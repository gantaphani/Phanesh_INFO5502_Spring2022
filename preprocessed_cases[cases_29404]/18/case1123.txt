this case arises from a contract dispute between defendant sporoptic pouilloux,sporoptic a french company,and plaintiff pro axess,pro axess,a utah corporation.the parties raise from a judgment and an associated order entered following a jury trial.sporoptic,which was held liable for breach of contract,contests the district court exercise of personal jurisdiction over it.pro axess,the prevailing party below,appeals the district court denial of its motion for prejudgment interest.we affirm the district court judgment because we conclude that the court exercise of personal jurisdiction over sporoptic was proper.we also affirm the district court denial of pro axess motion for prejudgment interest.
background 
sporoptic distributes sunglasses.in the,sporoptic decided to launch a line of sunglasses in the united states.to minimize the cost of manufacturing these sunglasses,sporoptic sought to manufacture the frames for the sunglasses in asia.
acting both directly and through its subsidiary,orlux distribution,orlux a california corporation with responsibility for distributing sporoptic sunglasses in the united contacted pro axess to make the arrangements necessary for such manufacturing.sporoptic lacked experience dealing with asian manufacturers,while pro axess regularly arranged for the manufacture of sunglasses frames in asia on behalf of distributors like sporoptic.in fact,pro axess had previously arranged to supply sunglasses frames to sporoptic.
as part of this project,in sporoptic contracted with pro axess to arrange for the manufacture and delivery of sunglasses frames.sporoptic later cancelled this order.the parties disagreed about whether the order was cancelled in a timely fashion or whether the cancellation was a breach of contract.
in january,pro axess filed suit against sporoptic and orlux in utah state court,alleging alternative claims based on breach of contract,promissory estoppel,and misuse of an open credit account.in march,sporoptic and orlux removed the case to federal court.
in its answer,sporoptic disputed the district court ability to exercise personal jurisdiction over it.the court noted this dispute in its pretrial order but did not rule on the issue.following a trial in march,a jury found that sporoptic had breached its contract with pro axess and awarded damages of to pro axess.the jury found that orlux did not have a contract with pro axess and thus had no liability in this case.
after trial,the parties litigated the issue of whether the district court could exercise personal jurisdiction over sporoptic.the court held that it could,and thereafter entered favor of pro axess against both sporoptic and orlux.
the parties filed motions to amend the judgment.in june,the district court denied pro axess motion for prejudgment interest,granted pro axess motion for postjudgment interest,and granted sporoptic and orlux motion to amend the judgment to reflect that it lay only against sporoptic.the court entered its judgment on july.
on july,the district court entered axess filed a notice of appeal.sporoptic on august.
discussion 
we exercise jurisdiction over these appeals pursuant to 
personal jurisdiction 
we review de novo the district court decision to exercise personal jurisdiction over sporoptic.see fed.deposit ins.oaklawn apartments,cir.pro axess has the burden of proving that the court exercise of jurisdiction was proper,though it must do so only by a preponderance of the evidence.see karnes boeing,cir soma med.int l standard chartered bank,cir examining the issue of personal jurisdiction over defendants in federal court in utah.
to obtain personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant in a diversity action,a plaintiff must show that jurisdiction is legitimate under the laws of the forum state and that the exercise of jurisdiction does not offend the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.far west capital,towne,cir.because we agree with the parties that general personal jurisdiction is not applicable in this case,we turn directly to the issue of specific personal jurisdiction.t he evaluation of specific jurisdiction in utah mandates a inquiry the defendant acts or contacts must implicate utah under the utah statute a nexus must exist between the plaintiff claims and the defendant acts or contacts and application of the utah statute must satisfy the requirements of federal due process.soma med.int l,at alteration in original quotations omitted see also far west capital,at.we address the requirements of federal due process before turning to the other two parts of the inquiry,and we hold that all the requirements are satisfied in this case.
federal due process 
the due process clause protects an individual liberty interest in not being subject to the binding judgments of a forum with which he has established no meaningful contacts,ties,or relations.burger king rudzewicz,d quotations omitted.thus,a court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant only so long as there exist minimum contacts between the defendant and the forum state.volkswagen woodson,d quotations omitted.the minimum contacts necessary for specific personal jurisdiction are established if the defendant has purposefully directed his activities at residents of the forum and the litigation results from alleged injuries that arise out of or relate to those activities.soma med.int l,at quotations omitted.
thus,an analysis of whether a court exercise of specific personal jurisdiction comports with the due process clause is a inquiry.see benton cameco,cir,cert.denied,d.first we consider whether the defendant conduct and connection with the forum state are such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.volkswagen,at,d.second,if the defendant actions create sufficient minimum contacts,we must then consider whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction over the defendant offends traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.omi holdings,royal ins.of canada,cir quotations omitted.
minimum contacts 
in determining whether a defendant has established sufficient minimum contacts with the forum state,we examine whether the defendant purposefully avail ed itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state.hanson denckla,d.a defendant contacts are sufficient if the defendant purposefully directed its activities at residents of the forum,and the plaintiff claim arises out of or results from actions by the defendant himself that create a substantial connection with the forum state.omi,at quotations,citations,and emphasis omitted.
purposeful availment 
the fact that sporoptic made a contract with pro axess,which is located in utah,is not enough on its own to allow a utah court to exercise jurisdiction over sporoptic.see burger king,at.if the question is whether an individual contract with an party alone can automatically establish sufficient minimum contacts in the other party home forum the answer clearly is that it can not.emphasis in original.however,with respect to interstate contractual obligations,parties who reach out beyond one state and create continuing relationships and obligations with citizens of another state are subject to regulation and sanctions in the other state for the consequences of their activities.id.at.quotations omitted.
in this case,sporoptic solicited pro axess assistance in procuring sunglasses frames.while not conclusive,this solicitation is itself some evidence suggesting purposeful availment.far west capital,at.sporoptic specifically sought out pro axess because pro axess had business relationships with many manufacturers in asia while the manufacturing and shipping of the product were not to take place in utah,services necessary for the contract were to be performed in utah.see benton,at.such services included choosing a manufacturer for the sunglasses frames,arranging for rough handmade models to be made into machined prototypes,arranging the details for the manufacture of the frames at a plant in china,arranging for the inspection of the frames in hong kong,invoicing and coordinating the manufacturing process,and arranging for the shipping of the frames from hong kong to france.although the agreement between the parties was a single contract,fulfilling the contract required a continuing relationship based on the provision of services.by procuring such services from pro axess,which operates its business in utah,sporoptic purposefully avail ed itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state.hanson,at.
in addition,sporoptic and orlux exchanged various direct communications with pro axess.although phone calls and letters are not necessarily sufficient in themselves to establish minimum contacts,far west capital,at,such materials provide additional evidence that sporoptic pursued a continuing business relationship with a utah corporation.sporoptic rightly points out that its direct communications with pro axess in utah were minimal.however,it is not just sporoptic direct communications with pro axess that are relevant,but also orlux communications with pro axess.companies conducting business through their subsidiaries can qualify as transacting business in a state,provided the parent exercises sufficient control over the subsidiary.see curtis publ g cassel,cir a wholly owned subsidiary may be an agent and when its activities as an agent are of such a character as to amount to doing business of the parent,the parent is subjected to the in personam jurisdiction of the state in which the activities occurred.phone directories contel,noting that a parent company exertion of significant influence on a subsidiary suffices for a court to exercise personal jurisdiction over parent 
sporoptic exercised considerable control over orlux,which acted as its agent.for example,sporoptic president chose the president of orlux.specifically relevant to the instant case,sporoptic president approved the concept of selling a line of sunglasses in the united states,then used orlux to implement the project.orlux faxed pro axess a preliminary purchase order for sunglasses frames,and sporoptic followed up with a formal purchase order confirming the details.sporoptic relied on orlux to cancel the order.given this relationship,we examine not only sporoptic direct communications with pro axess,but also orlux communications with pro axess.
sporoptic and orlux exchanged numerous faxes,letters,and phone calls with pro axess in utah about the order itself and the potential for modifications to the order.while the quantum of contacts between the parties is not determinative of personal jurisdiction,far west capital,at,the purposeful availment reflected in the content of these communications supports a utah court exercise of jurisdiction over sporoptic 
arising out of 
it is clear that there is a nexus between sporoptic contacts with utah and pro axess injuries,such that pro axess injuries arise out of or relate to sporoptic activities.burger king,at.quotations omitted see also omi,at.pro axess breach of contract claims arose from sporoptic solicitation of pro axess,development of a business agreement with pro axess,and subsequent communications with pro axess.those same interactions also constitute sporoptic contacts with utah.thus,pro axess claims arise out of sporoptic contacts with utah.
sporoptic argues that pro axess presence in utah is a coincidence that is inadequate to allow a utah court to exercise specific personal jurisdiction over sporoptic.however,this is not a case where t he quality and nature of sporoptic contact with utah was so random,fortuitous,or attenuated that it can not fairly be said that sporoptic should reasonably anticipate being haled into court in utah.burger king,at.quotations and footnote omitted.after all,this is not a case in which the defendant only contacts with the forum resulted from the unilateral activity of another party or a third person.helicopteros nacionales de colombia,hall,d.thus,sporoptic reliance on soma med.int l and lakeside bridge steel mountain state constr,cir,is misplaced.see soma med.int l,at involving a plaintiff going outside its home state to initiate contact with the defendant lakeside bridge steel,at,same.rather,sporoptic voluntarily sought out and conducted business with pro axess,with whom sporoptic had contracted before and whom sporoptic therefore knew to be located in utah 
although this is a somewhat close case,we believe that sporoptic purposefully directed its activities at residents of the forum,and the litigation result ed from alleged injuries that ar o se out of or relate to those activities.burger king,at.quotations and citation omitted.as a result,sporoptic conduct and connection with the forum state were such that it should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.volkswagen,at,d.thus,we hold that sporoptic had sufficient minimum contacts with utah to support a utah court exercise of personal jurisdiction over sporoptic.
traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice 
in analyzing whether a court exercise of personal jurisdiction offends traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice,asahi metal indus.superior court,d,we determine whether a district court exercise of personal jurisdiction over a defendant with minimum contacts is reasonable in light of the circumstances surrounding the case.omi,at quotations omitted.we do so by considering 
the burden on the defendant,the forum state interest in resolving the dispute,the plaintiff interest in receiving convenient and effective relief,the interstate judicial system interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies,and the shared interest of the several states in furthering fundamental social policies.
id.at.the analyses of minimum contacts and reasonableness are complementary,such that 
the reasonableness prong of the due process inquiry evokes a sliding scale the weaker the plaintiff showing on minimum contacts,the less a defendant need show in terms of unreasonableness to defeat jurisdiction.the reverse is equally true an especially strong showing of reasonableness may serve to fortify a borderline showing of minimum contacts.
id.at alterations in original quotations omitted.
in this case,we have determined that sporoptic purposefully directed its activities at utah.burger king,at.in such a case,where a defendant seeks to defeat jurisdiction,it must present a compelling case that the presence of some other considerations would render jurisdiction unreasonable.id.sporoptic can not meet this exacting standard.
burden on defendant of litigating in the forum 
t he burden on the defendant of litigating the case in a foreign forum is of primary concern in determining the reasonableness of personal jurisdiction when the defendant is from another country,this concern is heightened and great care and reserve should be exercised before personal jurisdiction is exercised over the defendant.omi,at quotations omitted.however,modern transportation and communication have made it much less burdensome for a party sued to defend himself in a state where he engages in economic activity.burger king,at.quoting mcgee int l life ins,d.
in this case,sporoptic headquarters in france is a substantial distance from utah,but sporoptic president has demonstrated his ability to journey to the united states for the company business dealings by meeting with pro axess in new york.moreover,sporoptic owns a subsidiary in california.thus,sporoptic employees and its agents travel to and operate in the united states to conduct economic activity,minimizing concerns about the burden that litigating in utah might place on them.moreover,any fears that sporoptic might not be able to obtain a fair trial because of language issues are misplaced,for the record reveals that sporoptic employees and agents regularly and adequately conduct business in english.accordingly,forcing sporoptic to litigate this dispute in utah is not gravely difficult and inconvenient.burger king,at.
forum state interest in adjudicating the dispute 
states have an important interest in providing a forum in which their residents can seek redress for injuries caused by actors.omi,at.the state interest is also implicated where resolution of the dispute requires a general application of the forum state laws.id.in this case,this factor favors utah exercise of jurisdiction over sporoptic.pro axess is a utah corporation with its principal place of business in utah,and the state has an interest in providing it with a forum for its suit against sporoptic 
plaintiff interest in convenient and effective relief 
this factor 
hinges on whether the plaintiff may receive convenient and effective relief in another forum.this factor may weigh heavily in cases where a plaintiff chances of recovery will be greatly diminished by forcing him to litigate in another forum because of that forum laws or because the burden may be so overwhelming as to practically foreclose pursuit of the lawsuit.
id.at.because common law governs this suit,litigating the case in france,a civil law country,would be difficult.moreover,pro axess management would face the hardship of traveling to france and conducting litigation in a language with which it is not readily apparent that they are familiar.we find that pro axess would not be able to receive convenient and effective relief by bringing suit in france,thus this factor weighs in favor of utah exercise of jurisdiction.
interstate judicial system interest in obtaining efficient resolution 
this factor asks whether the forum state is the most efficient place to litigate the dispute.id.key sic to this inquiry are the location of witnesses,where the wrong underlying the lawsuit occurred,what forum substantive law governs the case,and whether jurisdiction is necessary to prevent piecemeal litigation.id.citations omitted.based on the nature of pro axess claims against sporoptic,and the fact that sporoptic operated through orlux,many of the witnesses in the dispute are based in the united states.likewise,common law,not civil law,governed the dispute.therefore,we find that litigating the dispute in utah would be more efficient than doing so in france.
states interest in furthering fundamental substantive social policies 
the fifth factor of the reasonableness inquiry focuses on whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction by the forum affects the substantive social policy interests of other states or foreign nations.id.g reat care and reserve should be exercised when extending our notions of personal jurisdiction into the international field.id.at.therefore,we must look closely at the extent to which an exercise of personal jurisdiction by utah over sporoptic interferes with france sovereignty.relevant facts include whether one of the parties is a citizen of the foreign nation,whether the foreign nation law governs the dispute,and whether the foreign nation citizen chose to conduct business with a forum resident.id.at citations omitted.sporoptic is a french company.however,this dispute is not governed by french law,and sporoptic chose to conduct business with pro axess,a resident of utah.therefore,we find that an exercise of personal jurisdiction would not affect france policy interests.
in sum,these five factors do not weigh in sporoptic favor.sporoptic certainly can not establish a compelling case that the exercise of jurisdiction by a utah court would be unreasonable.burger king,at.thus,we hold that utah exercise of personal jurisdiction over sporoptic would not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice therefore,the district court exercise of personal jurisdiction over sporoptic satisfies both prongs of the federal due process analysis.
as noted in soma med.int l,utah law on specific personal jurisdiction mandates that a nexus exist between pro axess claims and sporoptic contacts with utah.at.this is analogous to part of the minimum contacts due process analysis above.see omi,at.because we found that sporoptic contacts with utah fulfilled the requirements of the minimum contacts due process analysis,we also conclude that the required nexus exists under state law.
utah statute 
the utah supreme court has stated that any set of circumstances that satisfies due process will also satisfy the statute.sii megadiamond,am.superabrasives,utah.this is because the utah legislature has declared that the statute must be interpreted broadly so as to assert jurisdiction over nonresident defendants to the fullest extent permitted by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution.utah code ann.thus,because the court exercise of jurisdiction over sporoptic in this case satisfies due process,that exercise also satisfies the utah statute.
accordingly,we conclude that both the federal and state inquiries for whether assertion of specific personal jurisdiction is proper are satisfied on the facts of this case,and therefore that the district court did not err in exercising jurisdiction over sporoptic 
ii.prejudgment interest 
we examine the district court decision not to award prejudgment interest to pro axess for an abuse of discretion,reviewing de novo the legal analysis on which that decision is based.see atlantic richfield farm credit bank of wichita,cir.we apply utah law in conducting this analysis.see webco,thermatool,cir prejudgment interest in a diversity action is a substantive matter governed by state law.we hold that the district court did not err in denying pro axess motion for prejudgment interest because pro axess damages were not calculable with the mathematical certainty necessary to support such an award and were not established as of a particular date.
calculability of damages 
under utah law,a prejudgment interest award is proper when the damage is complete and the loss can be measured by facts and figures.lefavi bertoch,utah quotations omitted.a court may only award prejudgment interest if damages are calculable within a mathematical certainty.id.
in this case,pro axess itself was not able to calculate its damages consistently during the period before trial,making clear that such damages were not calculable within a mathematical certainty.in its january complaint,pro axess claimed damages of plus prejudgment interest in its rule a disclosures two years later,pro axess stated that its damages had not been determined.in a july response to an interrogatory,pro axess claimed damages of plus prejudgment interest in an october affidavit and in the may pretrial order,pro axess claimed damages of 
the evolution of the amount of pro axess damages claim during trial also underscores the fact that those damages were not calculable within a mathematical certainty.pro axess decreased its claim for unrealized gross profits from to because it had overstated the lost revenue on which those profits were based by.pro axess also decreased its claim for the cost of parts already purchased from to because it had mistakenly included the cost of parts from another order.thus,at trial pro axess total claim for damages decreased by,plus the associated difference in interest.
further,pro axess damages for unrealized gross profits simply were not calculable within a mathematical certainty based on the evidence that pro axess submitted to the district court.pro axess submitted virtually no evidence in support of its claim of a gross profit margin.especially given utah courts reluctance to award prejudgment interest for unrealized profits,see canyon country store bracey,utah while the basis of the formula used to determine canyon country lost profits may have been sufficient for the jury to render a verdict in favor of canyon country,it is too speculative to allow for the addition of prejudgment interest,pro axess evidence of its gross profit margin is clearly inadequate to support the award of prejudgment interest.
similarly,pro axess failed to provide any written support for its claimed travel costs and other expenses.one of pro axess employees noted that in calculating these expenses we did get down to specifics but instead looked at the trips that we had taken,some of the other costs,and came up with a round figure.such an effort clearly does not establish damages calculable within a mathematical certainty.
pro axess argues that the variance over time in the amount of damages that it sought came as a result of a mistake in calculation,and that such a mistake should not defeat its claim for pr
