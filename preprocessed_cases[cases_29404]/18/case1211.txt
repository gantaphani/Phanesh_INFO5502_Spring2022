a statutory system authorizing organizations to act as agencies in disciplining members for federal securities law violations has existed for almost years.in every statutory iteration of this authority,congress has specified that adjudicatory actions of organizations like nasd are subject to plenary review by the sec.compare d e current provisions governing sec review of nasd disciplinary actions,with g h original provisions governing sec review of nasd disciplinary actions.congress has provided for judicial review of sec actions under a of the act,which enables a person aggrieved by a final order of the commission to obtain judicial review.a.
in this case,the commission reversed a determination by nac disciplining a nasd member and its owner for,among other things,engaging in a manipulative scheme in violation of b of the exchange act,b.nasd now petitions for review under a of the act.the commission argues that the petition for review should be dismissed,because congress did not intend for a to cover nasd when it is acting in its adjudicatory capacity.in other words,according to the commission,nasd is not a person aggrieved when the commission reverses a nasd disciplinary decision.we agree.
during the nearly years that organizations have been recognized under the exchange act,congress has never granted nasd a statutory right to seek judicial review of a sec decision reversing disciplinary action taken by nasd as a adjudicator under the statute.and no court has ever suggested that such review is possible.indeed,we can find no case in which nasd,in its capacity as a adjudicator in disciplinary actions,has ever petitioned for judicial review to challenge a sec judgment overturning the initial decision rendered by nasd in its adjudicative capacity.we find no reason to allow it to do so now.we hold that the adjudicatory arm of nasd is not a person aggrieved within the meaning of a of the exchange act when the commission reverses a decision it has made.we therefore dismiss nasd petition for review for want of jurisdiction.
background 
nasd as a adjudicator under the exchange act 
two provisions of the exchange act define nasd authority to adjudicate actions against members who are accused of unethical or illegal securities practices and the commission oversight of that authority.these are and.section,lays out the specific duties of a registered national securities association.it sets out disciplinary functions which nasd,as a registered national securities association,must perform.the organization must first establish 
rules designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices,to promote just and equitable principles of trade,to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating securities,to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system,and,in general,to protect investors and the public interest.
b.where nasd members have allegedly violated either association rules or federal securities law,nasd has the authority to consider disciplinary action in the first instance.see b.if nasd proceeds against a member,it must provide a minimum level of process,including notice of the specific charges and an opportunity to be heard,as well as a statement of subsequent findings.see h.fair disciplinary procedures are a prerequisite for registration of a national securities association.b.
given the statutory requirements of,nasd has established an elaborate adjudicative arm to address disciplinary actions.a code of procedure,see nasd manual,rule et,sets out the procedures for disciplinary actions brought by nasd department of enforcement.where a complaint has been filed against members for violations of federal securities laws,the adjudication may take place before a nasd hearing panel.see rules of nasd code of procedure,nasd manual,lexis.as noted above,hearing panel decisions may be appealed to nac,or they may be reviewed by nac on its own initiative.see rules of nasd code of procedure,nasd manual,lexis.rule,reflecting the exchange act mandate,provides that a respondent aggrieved by final disciplinary action pursuant to the rule series or the rule series may apply for review by the commission pursuant to section d of the act.nasd manual lexis.see also merrill lynch,at describing nasd adjudicative procedures.
section,sets out the commission supervisory duties over all organizations.nasd is a organization by virtue of the fact that it is a registered securities association under.see a definition of organization.with respect to adjudications,the commission oversight begins with the obligation of organizations to notify the commission of any final disciplinary sanction imposed on a member or associated person.d.the statute also provides the commission with plenary review powers.e.once notified,the commission may,on its own motion or on the application of any person aggrieved by the association action,review nasd disciplinary action.d see also commission rules of practice.section e authorizes the commission to make an independent determination as to whether the violations found by the association occurred,and to change nasd sanctions in whatever ways it deems appropriate.see e.the commission may base its determination on the record compiled by the association,but it is not limited to that record and may adduce additional evidence.commission rule of practice.sec oversight of nasd disciplinary functions is not limited to review of individual disciplinary actions.under g,the commission is empowered to relieve nasd of any of its enforcement responsibilities under the exchange act.g.
the statutory scheme governing nasd actions parallels the commission internal adjudicative structures.the commission is permitted to delegate its disciplinary functions to an administrative law judge alj.a.as with nasd,when an alj exercises the commission disciplinary powers,the commission shall retain a discretionary right to review the action of the administrative law judge upon its own initiative or upon petition of a party to or intervenor in such action.b see also commission rules of practice.in both disciplinary systems,once the commission takes final action,congress has provided for judicial review of the commission action under a of the act,which enables a person aggrieved by a final order of the commission to obtain judicial review.a.
the congressional scheme,in short,establishes a system in which the commission not only closely supervises and approves the processes by which nasd brings disciplinary action,but in which the commission fully revisits the issue of liability,and can completely reject or modify nasd decision as it deems appropriate.nasd disciplinary process essentially supplants a disciplinary action that might otherwise start with a hearing before an alj.and nasd authority to discipline its members for violations of federal securities law is entirely derivative.the authority it exercises ultimately belongs to the sec,and the legal views of the organization must yield to the commission view of the law.this is made clear in the legislative history of the amendments 
c are should be exercised,lest the use of phrases such as partnership and cooperative regulation lead to the impression that the industry and the government fulfill the same function in the regulatory framework or that they enjoy the same order of authority or deserve the same degree of deference the organizations exercise authority subject to sec oversight.they have no authority to regulate independently of the sec control.

organizations,such as nasd,have enjoyed congressionally delegated powers to discipline their members for nearly years.in,congress passed the maloney act,stat.maloney act,which added to the exchange act,and is,thus,the original source of nasd power to discipline its members.the new section permitted a securities association,such as nasd,to register with the sec.once registered,the association was authorized to discipline its members for violations of the organization rules.b.the maloney act expresse d congress thoughtful view that is the best defense against unethical or illegal securities practices.it allows the industry to set its own standards of proper conduct and permits their members to discipline themselves applying their own expertise and experience.first jersey,bergen,cir.congress gave organizations disciplinary power over their members,by allowing them to levy economic sanctions and by providing an incentive for associations to accept responsibilities.

id.emphasis added see also id.at,as reprinted in at.
the amendments are also significant,for our purposes,because,for the first time,congress explicitly authorized nasd to adjudicate in the first instance cases in which members had allegedly violated the exchange act or sec rules and regulations interpreting it.compare b with b.congress revisions to of the act illustrate,however,that congress only envisioned nasd as the adjudicator,whose disciplinary actions would be subject to plenary review by the commission.the newly enacted provisions of,as discussed above,established additional formal procedures enabling and enhancing the sec review of disciplinary actions undertaken by organizations.see securities acts amendments of,pub,stat,originally codified at e h.nasd currently disciplines its members within the framework put in place in,and it is within this framework that we must decide whether nasd is a person aggrieved within the meaning of a of the exchange act when the commission reverses a disciplinary action it has taken as a adjudicator pursuant to the act.

ii.analysis 
judicial review of sec actions is governed by of the exchange act,which includes two independent provisions.one relates to agency rulemakings and the other relates to agency adjudications.section b of the act,which covers agency rulemakings,provides 
a person adversely affected by a rule of the commission may obtain review of this rule in the united states court of appeals 
b.section a,which governs agency adjudications and controls this case,provides 
a person aggrieved by a final order of the commission may obtain review of the order in the united states court of appeals
