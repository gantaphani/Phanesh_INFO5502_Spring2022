plaintiff bottling company of pittsburg,kansas pittsburg pepsi appeals the district court order granting summary judgment in favor of defendants pepsico,pepsico and its wholly owned subsidiary,bottling group,llc bottling group.while pittsburg pepsi asserts claims sounding both in tort and in contract,its overriding contention is that defendants have interfered with its contractual right to sell a full line of pepsi products in its exclusive territory.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand.
as this is a summary judgment case,we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,which in this case is pittsburg pepsi.pepsico is a leading seller of soft drink concentrate and it controls the trademarks associated with its products.under an exclusive bottling appointment eba,pepsico enters into an individual agreement with a bottler for the bottling and distribution of its soft drink products within a designated geographic territory.under a syrup appointment,pepsico enters into an individual agreement with a bottler to manufacture,sell,and distribute fountain syrup within designated geographic territories.
pittsburg pepsi is an independent bottler of pepsico products in addition to pepsico products,pittsburg pepsi distributes products manufactured by other concentrate companies that do not compete with its pepsico products.pittsburg pepsi sells,on average,cases of beverage products each year.pepsico issued an eba to pittsburg pepsi on september,for for the designated territory encompassing the kansas counties of bourbon,crawford,cherokee,and part of labette,and part of the missouri counties of jasper and barton.the eba provided in relevant part

pepsico move toward alignment 
pepsico has historically viewed the eba,and specifically its grants of exclusive territories to its independent bottlers,as the core of its overall business structure.in his august,testimony before the federal trade commission,president walter mack discussed how pepsico used the promise of exclusivity to persuade independent businessmen to become pepsico bottlers 
w e had to give them confidence in the early days that we were going to win our trademark suits and that they were taking on a beverage which they would have the exclusive right to from then on for the rest of their lives we told the bottlers that the parent company would protect their franchise,the terms and conditions of the franchise,and do everything we could to protect both the trademark and the name and their territory for them on an exclusive basis.
app.iii at.mack testified that pepsico told the bottlers they would have an exclusive franchise for the rest of their lives or in perpetuity.on march,pepsico then vice president for corporate affairs,cartha deloach,testified before the house subcommittee on monopolies and commercial law on the soft drink interbrand competition act of act,et.deloach claimed pepsico needed the act passage to protect its right to issue bottlers ebas and syrup appointments covering exclusive territories.deloach testified 
if exclusive territories are eliminated,dozens and dozens of bottlers will be driven out of business by their larger neighbors.this will be accomplished quickly through the ability of larger bottlers by virtue of their location in major areas and their bottling capacity to take the cream of the business leaving smaller bottlers with less profitable accounts to service long term,not only will there be fewer outlets handling soft drinks,but after the bottler ranks are decimated,the survivors,i am certain,will be able to raise soft drink prices higher than ever 
we totally support our bottlers in their efforts to preserve the exclusive territories we granted them because we are deeply grateful for their past and continuing commitment to their parent company and because we need such fiercely competitive partners in our future.
app.iii at.
pepsico subsequently acted in to protect the exclusive territories of its independent bottlers by instituting a vigorous transshipment enforcement program tep.transshipment occurs when a product from one bottler is offered for sale in a territory for which another bottler has an eba.under the tep,which remains in place today,if any bottler discovers pepsi products manufactured by another bottler in its territory,the bottler can file a complaint with pepsico transshipment department.if pepsico confirms that products came from another bottler,it can impose a charge for each case of transshipped beverage,to be paid to the bottler whose territory is violated with the amount to be determined by pepsico.the tep restrictions apply to all bottlers.
during the and,two significant changes occurred which directly affected pepsico ability to successfully compete nationwide,and ultimately its relationship with its bottlers.first,significant consolidation occurred on the retail side of the soft drink industry as a result of the growth of large,nationwide retail chains like and sam club.pepsico biggest customers had stores in multiple bottling territories and began demanding that pepsico service their needs at a national rather than a local level.second,in the,pepsico chief rival,the company coke established a single anchor bottler,enterprises,and began acquiring its individual bottlers.this consolidation enabled coke to benefit from the economy of scale and to negotiate more effectively with large retail chains.
pepsico initially tried to replicate coke success without eliminating its independent bottler network.as part of a strategy termed alignment,pepsico developed a pair of contracts in the early the customer development agreement cda and the marketplace investment agreement mia.operating together,these contracts enabled pepsico to use its independent bottlers to obtain nationwide market power.pepsico still uses both contracts today.the cda is an agreement between pepsico and large retail chains.under the cda,pepsico agrees to provide financial incentives to the chain in exchange for a promise that the chain will pursue various marketing activities to increase sales of pepsi products.in exchange,the chain receives a rebate for each case of pepsi products purchased from its local bottler.pepsico and its bottlers typically share the cost of these rebates pursuant to the mia.under the mia,pepsico agrees to pay its independent bottlers to help offset marketing costs.in return,the independent bottlers agree to pay pepsico for their portion of the rebate costs as well as costs affiliated with national advertising campaigns.a bottler ability to receive marketing funds from pepsico is thus conditioned on the bottler willingness to participate in the system.
although most bottlers sign the mia and agree to pay their share of the costs under the cdas,pittsburg pepsi has refused to sign the mia by refusing to sign the mia,pittsburg pepsi has avoided any contractual obligation to share the cost of the cda rebates with pepsico.in return,pepsico has not provided pittsburg pepsi with the marketing funds that other independent bottlers receive when they sign the mia.nonetheless,to stay competitive with coke,pepsico has fully paid the cost for cdas and national advertising campaigns in pittsburg pepsi territory.
in the late,pepsico began contemplating more aggressive steps to its bottler network.in november,pepsi national executive team net determined that,as part of its strategic plan,it should focus on system alignment in order to capture a competitive advantage from direct bottling system control while achieving cost parity with coke.app.iv at.the net believed the key barrier to achieving perfect alignment was the fact that of the bottling system has one unified decision point,in the form of one bottler controlled by pepsico and of the bottling system has independent decision points in the form of individual bottlers.id.at.thus,at a march meeting,pepsico considered aggressively buying back franchises and other tactical actions in order to a ccelerate alignment through the creation of anchor bottlers within the next months.app.iv at.thereafter,pepsico began focusing on a specific strategy with respect to those independent bottlers who were not willing to participate in pepsico business model.it is pittsburg pepsi contention that the underlying goal of this business strategy was to eliminate those independent bottlers who did not participate in pepsico business model.id.at.during this period,each bottler strategic importance and degree of alignment were assessed.bottlers viewed as being of low strategic importance and generally unaligned were to be invested in only to prevent dysfunction and were to receive m inimum resourcing and n o system advantages.id.at.
at a march pepsico board of directors meeting,indra nooyi,pepsico then senior vice president of corporate strategy and development,presented a competitive analysis of the company,focusing on coke acquisition of bottlers.nooyi noted that in cases where an independent bottler failed to comply with coke demands,the bottler was often met with a punitive response,including termination of its.v at.nooyi further noted that in many markets where pepsico had as many as five separate bottlers,coke was servicing the same area with its single anchor bottler.
in early,pepsico launched its bottler consolidation plan by implementing a few national anchor bottlers which reported directly to pepsico.currently,pepsico has three anchor bottlers which account for percent of pepsi product volume in the united states.the largest of those anchor bottlers is defendant bottling group.bottling group existed as part of pepsico during the and was comprised of bottling operations pepsico had acquired from independent bottlers who wanted to sell their franchises.in march,pepsico entered into a master bottling agreement mba with bottling group,granting bottling group the exclusive right to manufacture,sell,and distribute pepsi products in all or a portion of states,including areas to the west,south,and east of pittsburg pepsi territory.
after implementing the anchor bottler network,pepsico turned its attention to acquiring or aligning its independent bottlers.according to richard lawrence,who serves as pepsico vice president of franchise development and oversees its transshipment department,a fter the anchor bottlers were created in,it was expected that the anchor bottlers rather than pepsico would pursue future bottler acquisitions.app.xii at.from until,bottling group employed lawrence to negotiate bottler acquisitions on its behalf and to help develop a bottler acquisition plan.
concurrent with bottling group plan to acquire independent bottlers,pepsico developed a plan to weaken some of its independent bottlers.on november,pepsico senior executive team met at pepsico headquarters to ratify o ur approach with unaligned bottlers,an internal strategy that outlined six criteria pepsico used to determine whether a bottler was deemed in with pepsico objectives and should be classified as unaligned.app.iii at.fourteen bottlers,including pittsburg pepsi,were classified as unaligned.pepsico proposed a particular solution for each unaligned bottler,which pittsburg pepsi contends had as its goal to force each bottler into the position of being a potential acquisition candidate.id.at.the solution set forth for pittsburg pepsi was withhold a m to offset customer cda commitments and not offered mist or dole appointments.id.at.pepsico decided to stop offering ebas for new pepsi products to most unaligned bottlers.as a result,pittsburg pepsi was not offered ebas for sierra mist,diet sierra mist,fruitworks,dole,mountain dew code red,pepsi twist,or diet pepsi twist.
transshipment by vendors 
bottling group is the largest transshipper in the pepsico system,paying in transshipment fines and expenses in,and in.pittsburg pepsi through counsel has repeatedly complained to pepsico about bottling group transshipment,sending bottling group letters on february,may,october,and on may.as a part of the present litigation,pittsburg pepsi transshipment claim against bottling group pertains to three vendors.
first,pittsburg pepsi relies on bottling group contacts with grace energy corporation grace to support its transshipment claims.grace operates convenience stores,three of which are in pittsburg pepsi territory.according to mike mcdaniel,the director of grace convenience store division,grace purchased fountain syrups from both pittsburg pepsi and bottling group for years.at some point,mcdaniel told terry sergeant,who worked for bottling group,that it was important that grace deal with one company for all of its needs.sergeant assured mcdaniel that bottling group could serve that purpose.according to mcdaniel,sergeant gave him the impression that sergeant had the authority to speak on behalf of pittsburg pepsi.thereafter,grace began selling fountain syrups provided by bottling group in pittsburg pepsi territory.similarly,wayne gruenwald,grace director of corporate merchandising,stated that sergeant,and byron brooks,bottling group missouri plant manager,told him that bottling group hoped to own pittsburg pepsi one day.according to gruenwald,during syrup fountain negotiations,bottling group represented that it could cover all of grace needs,including those parts of grace business serviced by pittsburg pepsi.gruenwald further stated that john mehalic,bottling group location unit manager in missouri,knew that grace was purchasing pepsi products from a sam club in bottling group territory and transporting it into pittsburg pepsi territory,but took no action to stop grace.
the second major vendor that has transshipped pepsi products into pittsburg pepsi territory is southeast kansas vending sek.sek is a vending company in girard,kansas,which stocks soft drink vending machines in pittsburg pepsi territory with pepsi,coke,and cadbury product.
from july,through the spring of,sek got percent of its pepsi product from sam club in joplin,missouri,which buys from bottling group.from july through december,sek purchased cases of pepsi product from sam club and cases of pepsi product from food less also joplin,for resale in pittsburg pepsi territory.
app.xix at.historically,pepsico has discussed with sam club the issue of transshipment.as early as,it appears the major distributors were actively engaged in policing and limiting transshipment by vendors seeking to purchase their products from sam club.
according to lawrence,if somebody is buying cases per month from sam club,that not going into the garage,and that if a bottler knows that sam club is selling that amount of product and it is ending up in another territory,the bottler would typically try to work something out to be sure that the product was not getting out of its territory.also,if a bottler has a third party vendor with outlets both inside and outside the bottler territory,the bottler should make sure that the vendor did not sell the bottler products into another bottler territory.
pittsburg pepsi first complained about sek transshipment of bottling group products in a november,letter to bottling group.on december,bottling group replied that we have no knowledge or information as to whom sek may be doing business with to obtain products.app.xv at.pittsburg pepsi hired a private investigator who determined that sek was purchasing products from the sam club in joplin,but apparently did not provide this information to bottling group.on january,pittsburg pepsi again complained to bottling group that sek was transshipping pepsi products into its territory.in response,bottling group suggested that if pittsburg pepsi told bottling group the source of sek product,it might be able to investigate the matter.app.xix at.some time thereafter,because of its transshipment policy or litigation involving bottling group and pittsburg pepsi,sam club notified sek that it could not purchase pepsi product for resale in pittsburg pepsi territory.id.sek has stopped purchasing pepsi products from sam club for resale.
the third major vendor that has transshipped pepsi products into pittsburg pepsi territory is smith foods vending smith.smith is a kansas corporation,headquartered in joplin,missouri,that offers vending and cafeteria services in missouri,oklahoma,and kansas.approximately percent of its accounts are located in pittsburg pepsi territory the rest are in bottling group territory.for several years,smith purchased pepsi products from both bottling group and pittsburg pepsi.in october,smith stopped purchasing pepsi products from pittsburg pepsi because smith believed pittsburg pepsi prices were too high,and because smith believed that pittsburg pepsi sold the same pepsi products to smith competitors at a reduced price.without informing bottling group,in october,smith began stocking its vending machines in pittsburg pepsi territory with pepsi products purchased from bottling group.although smith understood it was transshipping,in its view,it was just trying to obtain pepsi products at a fair price.
in the fall of,smith vice president patricia eggerman first spoke about transshipment with laurie lloyd,a bottling group sales representative.sometime thereafter,lloyd told eggerman that if smith was getting pepsi products from bottling group and reselling them in pittsburg pepsi territory,it should stop.app.xix at.since that conversation,bottling group has monitored smith purchases and they have declined.farabi,president of pittsburg pepsi,says he has continued to complain to bottling group about smith transshipment.
procedural history 
pittsburg pepsi filed this action against pepsico and bottling group in the united states district court for the district of kansas in its initial complaint,pittsburg pepsi alleged violations of its eba for regular.bottling group moved to dismiss pittsburg pepsi claims.the district court denied the motion.bottling of pittsburg,pepsico,d.
pittsburg pepsi then filed a second amended complaint,alleging pepsico breached the ebas and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing because pepsico refused to extend new product appointments to pittsburg pepsi,and denied pittsburg pepsi funding and territorial protection from transshipment pepsico assumed and breached various fiduciary duties to protect pittsburg pepsi territory pittsburg pepsi was a beneficiary of pepsico mia with bottling group and bottling group transshipment of pepsico products into pittsburg pepsi territory violated pittsburg pepsi beneficiary rights bottling group tortiously interfered with pittsburg pepsi contractual agreement with pepsico and both defendants tortiously interfered with pittsburg pepsi relationships with its customers pepsico and bottling group engaged in a civil conspiracy and aided and abetted in a tort by attempting to drive pittsburg pepsi and other independent bottlers out of business and pepsico and bottling group violated the kansas restraint of trade act.all three parties filed motions for summary judgment on all claims.

breach of contract by pepsico 
pittsburg pepsi contends pepsico breached an express and contract by failing to offer pittsburg pepsi new product appointments breached an express and contract by failing to enforce the tep against bottling group and breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.the district court concluded that pepsico was entitled to summary judgment because the ebas did not obligate pepsico to offer pittsburg pepsi new products or to enforce the tep.further,finding no breach of the ebas express terms,the court granted pepsico summary judgment on pittsburg pepsi corresponding claim that pepsico breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing 
failure to offer ebas for new products 
pittsburg pepsi contends that as a result of pepsico past practice of offering pittsburg pepsi ebas for new products,pittsburg pepsi has a contractual right to be offered ebas for new pepsi products pittsburg pepsi argues that the parties course of dealing modified the original eba to include a provision entitling pittsburg pepsi to be offered appointments for new pepsi products.relevant to this claim,new york law places two limitations on the use of course of performance to establish contract modification.stating course of performance shall be relevant to show modification,s ubject to the ucc provisions on modification.first,if the original contract is a signed agreement which excludes modification or rescission except by a signed writing,new york law prohibits modifying or rescinding that contract without a signed writing that conforms to the statute of frauds.second,new york law prohibits course of performance evidence unless the contract for sale involves repeated occasions for performance by either party with knowledge of the nature of the performance and opportunity for objection to it by the other.
applying new york law to the parties contract and subsequent actions,we are unable to modify the original eba based on the parties course of performance to now require that pepsico offer pittsburg pepsi appointments for new pepsi products.the original eba requires that any modification of the agreement must be in writing and agreed to by the parties.it states that this appointment expresses fully the understanding,and that all prior understandings are hereby cancelled,and no future changes in the terms of this appointment shall be valid,except when and if reduced to writing and signed by both the bottler and the company,by legally authorized officials.app.i at.here,pittsburg pepsi provides no evidence of a signed writing that modified the terms of the original eba.nor has pittsburg pepsi presented any authority to establish that the contract modification,resulting in a contract for more than and lasting into apparent perpetuity,would not be barred by the statute of frauds.instead,pittsburg pepsi cites several cases holding that the parties course of performance waived the terms of their original contract.in those cases,however,the courts relied on to conclude that the parties contract was modified where there was one contract which the delivering party repeatedly altered without objection by the receiving party.see hyosung,sumagh textile,cir holding because purchaser accepted three shipments of nonconforming goods without objection,it acquiesced in accepting future shipments of same nonconforming goods and could not refuse to pay for future nonconforming goods bottling of asbury park pepsico,holding if the parties contractually agreed on a price,but one party began changing the price and the other repeatedly paid that price,neither party could seek to enforce the price because they had acquiesced to a change in the course of performance.pittsburg pepsi contract modification claim differs from these cases because here,the parties repeated actions did not modify an existing contract entitling pittsburg pepsi to any new products rather,the parties entered into successive contracts,each entitling pittsburg pepsi to additional products.these successive contracts are legally distinct agreements,not modifications of the original eba.we conclude the district court correctly granted pepsico summary judgment on pittsburg pepsi contract modification by course of dealing claim.
relying on the same course of performance evidence,pittsburg pepsi argues that pepsico repeated decision to offer pittsburg pepsi bottling rights to new products created an contract entitling pittsburg pepsi to be offered new products.the district court ruled in pepsico favor on this claim,concluding pittsburg pepsi alleged implied agreement fails for lack of consideration.we agree with the district court conclusion,but we reach that conclusion by applying a different analysis.see perry woodward,cir noting appellate court may affirm for any reason supported by the record.
under new york law,theories of express contract and a contract implied in fact are mutually exclusive a contract can not be implied in fact where an express contract covers the subject matter involved.the logic underlying this rule has been explained as follows 
contracts arise in the absence of an express agreement and are based on the conduct of the parties,from which a fact finder may fairly infer the existence and terms of a contract.but the prerequisite for such a contract is that there be no express agreement dealing with the same subject matter.where,as here,there is an express agreement covering the subject matter of the alleged agreement,the agreement is precluded as a matter of law.the logic at work here is obvious if the parties have an express contract that deals with a subject,it makes little sense to conclude that they in fact agreed to additional terms but simply decided to leave them out of the express contract.indeed,the merger clause in the agreement in this case bears out that logic.
radio today,westwood one,internal citations omitted.additionally,although new york law permits a prior course of dealing to interpret existing contracts,a prior course of dealings may not be used to establish contract formation.fasolino foods,banca nazionale del lavoro.
in the present case,it is clear that pittsburg pepsi proposed contract,guaranteeing it a right to successive ebas on new products,would cover the same that the parties have already reduced to writing on at least fourteen separate occasions.further,to the extent pittsburg pepsi believes the subject matter of the implied contract would somehow be different from the existing contracts,new york law does not permit the creation of an implied contract from a prior course of dealing.we conclude pittsburg pepsi contract claim must fail as a matter of law.
failure to enforce the tep 
we next consider pittsburg pepsi assertion that pepsico breached the eba by failing to enforce the tep.the district court concluded the eba exclusive dealing clause did not obligate pepsico to enforce the tep.as such,since the eba did not explicitly mention the tep elsewhere,the court analyzed whether the parties course of dealing had modified the existing ebas or implied a new term into the ebas,requiring pepsico to enforce the tep.the court concluded the ebas do not obligate pepsico to protect plaintiff territory from transshipment.app.xix at.on appeal,pittsburg pepsi argues the district court narrow interpretation of the eba misses the agreeing to make pittsburg pepsi the exclusive dealer of pepsi products,pittsburg pepsi contends pepsico is contractually obligated to prevent transshipment.
under the ucc,the meaning of the agreement of the parties is to be determined by the language used by them and by their action,read and interpreted in the light of commercial practices and other surrounding circumstances,cmt.terms of a written agreement may be explained or supplemented by course of dealing or usage of trade or by course of performance.a.in analyzing the obligations and rights the exclusive dealings clause imposed,we may consider conduct because such conduct is the most persuasive evidence of the parties intentions.see,cmt.
the key question here is whether the scope of pepsico obligations under the eba included an obligation to enforce the tep.the eba states that pepsico contracted for pittsburg pepsi to be the exclusive bottler,to bottle and distribute the pepsi products.app.ii at.beginning with the initial eba and in each eba thereafter,pepsico has reiterated pittsburg pepsi exclusivity rights and has publicly stated that the promise of exclusivity was the most compelling reason for an independent bottler to sign with pepsico.pepsico has stated in a complaint filed against an independent bottler that 
to protect the bottler continuing investment and to encourage the bottler to fully develop its business,pepsico appoints each bottler to an exclusive territory to the exclusion of all other bottlers and,except for certain national syrup accounts,protects the bottler from competition from pepsico itself.each pepsico bottler enjoys these same benefits and protection under the terms of its exclusive bottling appointment.
app.xiv at emphasis added.in consideration of the right to be the exclusive dealer and the benefits attending that right,pittsburg pepsi and other independent bottlers agreed to do several things,including aggressively marketing pepsico products and not distributing competing beverages.one of the specific steps pepsico took to protect the exclusive rights granted to pittsburg pepsi under its original eba was to create the transshipment enforcement program tep and its transshipment department to enforce the program.the main responsibility of the transshipment department is to investigate and fine transshipping.id.at.
moreover,although pittsburg pepsi has stated a separate claim for breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing,under new york law breach of that duty is merely a breach of the underlying contract.harris provident life acc.ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted,and this duty strongly reinforces pittsburg pepsi transshipment claim.the covenant of good faith and fair dealing forbids a party to do anything which will have the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other party to receive the fruits of the contract.west owners jennifer realty,internal quotation marks omitted.transshipments could undermine the value of pittsburg pepsi exclusive franchise.if,for example,pittsburg pepsi present and potential customers decided to buy all their product from a sam club outside pittsburg pepsi territory,pittsburg pepsi franchise would become worthless.accordingly,pepsico must refrain from conduct that creates an unreasonable risk that it will generate transshipments into pittsburg pepsi territory unless it also polices the matter to deter transshipments.
we both on the original eba text,parties subsequent actions,and the implied covenant of good faith and fair pepsico had a duty to take reasonable steps to prevent competing bottlers from encroaching on pittsburg pepsi exclusive territory.
the more difficult question is whether there is sufficient evidence to create a question of material fact that pepsico did not protect pittsburg pepsi territory.pepsico alleged failure to enforce the tep becomes relevant at this juncture.that is,although the ebas do not mention the tep,evidence that pepsico failed to enforce the tep,while simultaneously taking no other action to prevent transshipment,would tend to prove that pepsico failed to perform its contractual obligations.see so.implement deere,cir concluding summary judgment improperly granted to supplier where contract did not grant distributor exclusive territory,because distributor general rights under contract coupled with parties long course of performance could support jury finding that distributor had exclusive rights which supplier was required to enforce 
here,pittsburg pepsi has presented several facts which pertain to pepsico alleged failure to protect pittsburg pepsi right to territorial exclusivity.first,and most damaging to pepsico,is the evidence relating to lawrence.until,lawrence appeared on both pepsico and bottling group payrolls,simultaneously serving as pepsico vice president of franchise development and transshipment enforcement director,and bottling group point person for bottler acquisition.thus,while lawrence was working on pepsico behalf to help independent bottlers grow and develop,he was leading bottling group efforts to acquire dysfunctional bottlers.there is no dispute that pepsico had classified pittsburg pepsi as a dysfunctional bottler and that pepsico had decided it would invest in pittsburg pepsi only to prevent dysfunction.app.iv at.one could thus infer from these facts that pepsico had little interest in protecting pittsburg pepsi territory,which pepsico admittedly was working to acquire.
second,pepsico made several decisions which had the effect of encouraging pittsburg pepsi customers to purchase pepsi product from sources outside pittsburg pepsi territory.while pepsico targeted unaligned bottlers,it simultaneously used the cdas and mias to increase sales to major national chains such as sam club.pepsico then worked with its anchor bottlers including bottling group to develop business with these national chains.thus,as pepsico nationalized its marketing strategy and moved toward alignment,pittsburg pepsi customers began going to bottling group territory to obtain and transship discounted pepsi products from national customers.from these facts,one could infer that pepsico created incentives for pittsburg pepsi customers to purchase product from large chains,but then took inadequate steps to police the anticipated transshipment that followed.finally,pittsburg pepsi repeatedly complained to pepsico about transshipment.it is unclear the extent to which pepsico responded to these complaints or whether it made any effort to train bottling group employees to prevent transshipment.
viewing this evidence in a light most favorable to pittsburg pepsi,we believe a jury could conclude that pepsico knew transshipment was occurring and,despite promising to make pittsburg pepsi the exclusive pepsico dealer,chose to permit the transshipment with the hope of weakening the franchise of a dysfunctional bottler.we therefore conclude the ebas required pepsico to protect pittsburg pepsi territory,but that a question of material fact remains as to whether pepsico breached the ebas exclusivity clause by not protecting pittsburg pepsi rights as an exclusive dealer.
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing 
pittsburg pepsi final breach of contract claim is that pepsico breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied in the ebas.pittsburg pepsi contends pepsico breached this covenant by refusing to offer pittsburg pepsi ebas for new products failing to adequately enforce pittsburg pepsi right to be the exclusive dealer of pepsi products in its defined territory and engaging in discriminatory wholesale pricing and withholding discounts.

the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing is not without limitation.it does not provide a court carte blanche to rewrite the parties agreement,and the mere exercise of one contractual rights,without more,can not constitute a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.hartford fire ins.federated dep t stores,internal quotation omitted.rather,it simply ensures that parties to a contract perform the substantive,terms of their agreement and that parties are not unfairly denied express,explicitly bargained for benefits.don king.at internal quotation omitted.
additionally,courts are not at liberty to impose obligations under the guise of the implied covenant which are inconsistent with the terms of the contract from which the covenant is to be implied.in re minipeco,usa.thus,a party which acts in accordance with rights expressly provided in a contract can not be held liable for breaching an implied covenant of good faith.id.at.the plaintiff can maintain its claim for breach of the implied covenant of fair dealing only if it is based on allegations different than those underlying the accompanying breach of contract claim.concesionaria dhm,int l fin,d,internal quotation omitted.new york courts therefore routinely dismiss claims for breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing as redundant since a breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is intrinsically tied to the damages allegedly resulting from a breach of the contract.ohm remediation servs.hughes envtl,internal quotation omitted.
we conclude that pepsico did not breach the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by failing to offer pittsburg pepsi ebas for new pepsi products.as we have noted,nothing in the existing ebas entitled pittsburg pepsi to be offered subsequent ebas.nor did the parties enter into a general franchise agreement entitling pittsburg pepsi to all pepsico products.rather,the parties agreed,through a series of individual ebas,that pittsburg pepsi would be the sole bottler and distributor of the pepsi product.to read the ebas as impliedly requiring pepsico to offer pittsburg pepsi ebas for all new pepsi products in perpetuity would impose additional obligations on pepsico beyond what a reasonable person would expect.to expand the existing ebas to imply this additional covenant would be contrary to new york law.see primavera familienstifung askin,d,stating the duty of good faith can not be used to create independent obligations beyond those agreed upon and stated in the express language of the contract.
as regards pittsburg pepsi claim that pepsico violated the implied covenant by denying it territorial protection and failing to enforce the tep,this claim was addressed earlier and is encompassed within pittsburg pepsi breach of the eba exclusive dealing clause.in support of this allegation,pittsburg pepsi principally relies on two facts pepsico decision to encourage bottling group to become partners with major vendors regardless of the transshipment consequences and pepsico decision to ignore pittsburg pepsi transshipment complaints.these are the same facts that support pittsburg pepsi assertion that pepsico breached the ebas by failing to protect pittsburg pepsi right to territorial exclusivity.
finally,we must rule in pepsico favor on pittsburg pepsi claim that pepsico breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by failing to give pittsburg pepsi advertising funds and other financial support.pittsburg pepsi argues that pepsico has used the cdas to reduce the price its largest customers pay by providing those customers with rebates while simultaneously using the mias to penalize those independent bottlers that refuse to contribute to the rebates by refusing to provide those bottlers with marketing funds.through this scheme,pittsburg pepsi contends pepsico uses funding as a tactic to extract cda compliance when it knows this violates bottlers fundamental pricing and discounting relationships within their own territories.aplt.br.at.according to pittsburg pepsi,these actions violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing to provide plaintiff with an opportunity to receive ordinary bottler funding from concentrate revenues.id.although pittsburg pepsi speculates t here are many discretionary funds regularly paid by pepsico to its bottlers,and those funds are least on their different programs,the only such funds referenced in the record are the advertising funds available under the mia.id.
to determine whether pepsico failure to give pittsburg pepsi advertising funds violated an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,our analysis again begins with the source of this proposed text of the eba.the original eba states that pittsburg pepsi 
must fully cooperate in and vigorously push the company cooperative advertising and sales promotion programs and campaigns for the territory.in addition the bottler will actively advertise,in all reasonable media including adequate advertising,and vigorously engage in sales promotions of,bottled throughout the territory at his own cost and expense.
app.ii at emphasis added.as we read this provision,pittsburg pepsi was required to promote pepsico sales promotion programs,and pay for its own advertising costs.because pittsburg pepsi assumed these contractual obligations,we can not expand the implied covenant to hold pepsico liable for failing to provide pittsburg pepsi advertising funds.
tortious interference by bottling group and pepsico 
we next consider pittsburg pepsi claim that bottling group and pepsico tortiously interfer ed with pittsburg pepsi advantageous business relationship with its customers and prospective customers located in the pittsburg territory.app.ii at to prevail on a claim for tortious interference with current or prospective business advantage under kansas law,pittsburg pepsi must show 
the existence of a business relationship or expectancy with the probability of future economic benefit to the plaintiff knowledge of the relationship or expectancy by the defendant that,except for the conduct of the defendant,plaintiff was reasonably certain to have continued the relationship or realized the expectancy intentional misconduct by defendant and damages suffered by plaintiff as a direct or proximate result of defendant misconduct.

the district court concluded that pittsburg pepsi tortious interference claim failed on the third prong of the analysis because defendants actions were not the but for cause for pittsburg pepsi customers purchasing product from others.app.xix at.with regard to the fourth prong,the court determined the record contains no evidence of malicious intent.id.at.like the district court,we conclude pittsburg pepsi has established the first and second is clear that pittsburg pepsi had established relationships with its customers and that both defendants knew about the relationships.additionally,we conclude that,because there is evidence that vendors purchased products from bottling group instead of pittsburg pepsi and that pittsburg pepsi incurred losses,if pittsburg pepsi has presented evidence giving rise to a question of material fact as to the third and fourth elements,summary judgment was improperly granted.we therefore focus our inquiry on the third and fourth tortious interference elements and separately review the evidence as it pertains to bottling group and pepsico.
bottling group.pittsburg pepsi toughest hurdle on its tortious interference claim is to show that,except for each defendant conduct,pittsburg pepsi was reasonably certain to have continued a business relationship or realized the expectancy of a business relationship with a customer.although this is a difficult element to prove,when viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to pittsburg pepsi,we conclude pittsburg pepsi has presented sufficient evidence to withstand summary judgment on the tortious interference claim against bottling group as regards its claim involving sek.
the evidence pertaining to bottling group involvement with sek suggests that bottling group actions encouraged sek to transship into pittsburg pepsi territory rather than purchase pepsi products from pittsburg pepsi.here,the evidence reflects that over a period spanning from to,sek used its registered account at sam club in joplin,missouri,to purchase approximately percent of its pepsi products for resale in pittsburg pepsi territory.app.xix at.according to lawrence,these continued purchases of large quantities of products should have triggered an investigation into sek possible resale of the product.id.during this period,pittsburg pepsi repeatedly complained to bottling group about sek transshipment,but bottling group stated it had no knowledge of the transshipment.app xv at.however,as early as,the major distributors were actively engaged in limiting transshipment through large stores like sam club.although bottling group may be able to establish it had no knowledge of the extent to which sek was purchasing products from sam club,we can not reach that conclusion on the record before us.we conclude pittsburg pepsi has proven that a question of material fact remains as to whether pittsburg pepsi would have obtained sek business but for bottling group actions.similarly,as to the fourth element of a tortious interference claim,we conclude a jury could interpret the foregoing evidence as evidence of bottling group intent to take pittsburg pepsi customers.we therefore reverse the district court grant of summary judgment to bottling group on pittsburg pepsi tortious interference claim against bottling group as regards sek.
pepsico.pittsburg pepsi tortious interference claim against pepsico presents a closer question.pittsburg pepsi claims that pepsico business plan,administrative structure,and failure to enforce the tep collectively equate to tortious interference.to determine whether pittsburg pepsi has proven that a question of material fact remains on this claim,we again examine whether there is evidence that,but for pepsico conduct,pittsburg pepsi was reasonably certain to continue its customer relationships or realize an expectancy of future business,and of intentional misconduct by pepsico.
pittsburg pepsi relies on three sets of facts to establish that pepsico conduct caused it to lose current and prospective business.first,pittsburg pepsi again focuses extensively on the fact that lawrence was jointly involved in bottler development for pepsico and bottler acquisition for bottling group.second and relatedly,pittsburg pepsi relies on pepsico decision to expand the sale of its products at discounted rates to major retailers while simultaneously failing to enforce its transshipment policies.pittsburg pepsi alleges these actions were part of pepsico larger plan to drive the independent bottlers out of business.third,pittsburg pepsi seeks to hold pepsico responsible for any tortious actions taken by bottling group based on its theory that bottling group was acting on pepsico behalf in effectuating pepsico plan to reduce the number of bottlers.
we note that pittsburg pepsi has provided no evidence that pepsico directly interfered with pittsburg pepsi business.instead,pittsburg pepsi asks us to infer that,because pepsico created a climate which made it possible for pittsburg pepsi customers to purchase products from another bottler,pepsico should be held liable for intentionally causing pittsburg pepsi customers to purchase from others.further,pittsburg pepsi asks us to conclude,consistent with the third element of a tortious interference claim,that this climate was the but for cause of its loss of business.however,absent evidence that pepsico conduct caused pittsburg pepsi customers to purchase products from another bottler at a cheaper price,pulsecard.at,pittsburg pepsi can not survive pepsico summary judgment motion on pittsburg pepsi tortious interference claim.we therefore conclude the district court properly granted pepsico summary judgment on pittsburg pepsi tortious interference claim.
beneficiary claim 
pittsburg pepsi claims that bottling group transshipment breached the clause in the mba and the ebas between pepsico and beverage products corporation bottling group predecessor in which bottling group promised pepsico it would not sell pepsi products outside bottling group territory.pittsburg pepsi is not a party to the mba or the ebas between pepsico and beverage products corporation,but contends it can nevertheless enforce the agreements as a beneficiary.the district court determined that pittsburg pepsi was not a beneficiary to any of bottling group agreements with pepsico and granted bottling group motion for summary judgment on pittsburg pepsi beneficiary claim.
under new york law,only an intended beneficiary of a contract may assert a claim as a beneficiary.mortise united states,cir.a third party is an intended beneficiary where no one other than the third party can recover if the promisor breaches the contract,or the language of the contract otherwise clearly evidences an intent to permit enforcement by the third party.piccoli calvin klein jeanswear,d.although a party need not necessarily be specifically mentioned in a contract to be considered a beneficiary,the parties intention to benefit the third party nonetheless must be revealed on the face of the agreement.id.at internal quotation omitted.a plaintiff must plead facts to establish that it is an intended beneficiary of a contract and not merely an incidental beneficiary.flack friends of queen catherine,d.
pittsburg pepsi beneficiary claim fails under the first test.both the mba and the eba plainly permit someone other than pittsburg pepsi to recover if bottling group breaches the contract.the mba states in paragraph b that i n addition to all other remedies pepsico may have against any transshipping bottler for violating the transshipment provisions,pepsico can recover from bottling group specified transshipment charges.ii at.similarly,the eba provides that pepsico,in addition to all other rights and remedies,including its right to damages sustained,may terminate the appointment if certain designated events occur.id.at.
pittsburg pepsi beneficiary claim fares no better under the second test.the mba text contains no proof that the parties intended that pittsburg pepsi or any third party retain the right to enforce the agreement.moreover,the parties practice fails to evince such an intent.rather,when a bottler suspects transshipment,the record reveals the normal practice is for the bottler to report the alleged transshipment to pepsico who,in turn,enforces the mba provisions.pittsburg pepsi repeatedly followed this practice.as a result,of course,pittsburg pepsi incidentally benefitted from the mba because pittsburg pepsi territory was protected,but that incidental benefit alone does not confer a right to enforce the mba.likewise,pittsburg pepsi beneficiary claim premised on the eba also fails.again,the eba contains no language suggesting the parties intended to confer upon a bottler a right to recover for a breach of another bottler contract with pepsico.we therefore conclude that under new york law,pittsburg pepsi is not an intended beneficiary of either the mba or the eba and that the district court properly granted bottling group summary judgment on pittsburg pepsi beneficiary claim.
breach of fiduciary duty by pepsico 
pittsburg pepsi also claims pepsico breached certain fiduciary duties by failing to fairly and fully enforce its transshipment program failing to consider the best interest of bottlers in cda negotiations undercutting pittsburg pepsi right to determine prices and other terms of territory product sales and retaliating against pittsburg pepsi by withholding new products and funding because of pittsburg pepsi refusal to participate in the cdas.the district court concluded that pittsburg pepsi failed to show that pepsico owed it any fiduciary duties and granted pepsico motion for summary judgment.
