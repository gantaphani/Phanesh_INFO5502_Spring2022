we must decide whether arizona general corporate law appraisal procedures or the default appraisal procedures set out in the national bank consolidation and merger act act,govern the appraisal of dissenting shareholders shares when an arizona state bank merges into a national banking association.the question is one of first impression in this circuit.we hold that,when a state has enacted no statute providing for the appraisal of dissenters shares in the specific context of banking,the default appraisal procedures of the federal act apply.therefore,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
a majority of the shareholders of plaintiff community bank of arizona,an arizona banking corporation,voted to merge into the new community bank of arizona,a national bank.the notice announcing the special meeting to vote on the proposed merger also set the value of each share of plaintiff common stock at.the notice stated that,in order to perfect their dissenters rights,dissenting shareholders must carefully follow the procedures prescribed by section of the act.
instead,trust and several other dissenting shareholders of community bank of payment of the fair value of their shares pursuant to arizona revised statutes to,asserting that state law rather than federal law supplied the relevant appraisal procedure in their written demand for payment,defendants pegged the fair value of their shares at each.
plaintiff then commenced this action in district court,seeking a declaration that 
the merger of new community bank and community bank,and all issues related to that merger,are governed by the act,and that any dissenting shareholders who seek additional consideration for their shares must pursue the appraisal proceeding under the auspices of the comptroller of the currency set forth in.
defendants duly filed an answer and counterclaim.the answer asked the district court to declare that the dissenters rights should be determined in accordance with the procedure set forth in.to.the counterclaim requested payment in favor of each defendant in the amount of per share owned.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiff,holding that the procedures set forth in the federal act,rather than the procedures set forth in arizona statutes,governed the valuation of defendants shares.this timely appeal followed.

discussion 
section d of the act 
at the heart of this dispute lies the proper interpretation of d,the subsection of the act addressing the appraisal of dissenting shareholders shares in the context of the merger of a state bank into a national banking association.as its title reveals,regulates the m erger of national banks or state banks into national banks.
section a addresses the merging bank requirement to notify its shareholders of a plan of merger and to have that plan 
ratified and confirmed by the affirmative vote of the shareholders of each such association or state bank owning at least of its capital stock outstanding,or by a greater proportion of such capital stock in the case of a state bank if the laws of the state where it is organized so require 
section b secures the right of a shareholder of the merging state or national bank who dissents to the vote in favor of a dissenting receive the value of the shares owned in exchange for the surrender of the merging bank stock certificates,once the merger is approved.section b also explains the procedure that the dissenting shareholder must follow to perfect that right.
section c sets out the process by which the dissenting shareholder shares are appraised.under c,the merging bank board of directors selects one appraiser,the dissenting shareholders select another,and the two appraisers so chosen select a third.the appraised value agreed upon by any two of the three appraisers shall govern.however,any dissenting shareholder who is dissatisfied with the appraised value arrived at by this method has the right to appeal to the comptroller of currency,who shall cause a reappraisal to be made which shall be final and binding.c.
section d,the subsection at issue here,is something of a provision with respect to the shares of dissenting shareholders.section d discusses,among other things,particular aspects of the comptroller own appraisal of shares.for example,it provides for an initial appraisal by the comptroller when two appraisers fail to agree on a third appraiser,or when the appraisers fail to determine the value of dissenters shares.section d requires the merging bank to pay the expenses of the comptroller in making an appraisal or reappraisal.it also sets out the procedure for auctioning the surrendered shares of dissenting shareholders and paying to the dissenting shareholders any amount by which the auction price for those shares exceeds their appraised value.finally,d contains the following provision concerning appraisal procedures for merging state banks 
the appraisal of such shares of stock in any state bank shall be determined in the manner prescribed by the law of the state in such cases,rather than as provided in this section,if such provision is made in the state law and no such merger shall be in contravention of the law of the state under which such bank is incorporated.
the parties dispute concerns the scope of d deference to state law.the statute requires the appraisal to be in the manner prescribed by the law of the state in such cases if such provision is made in the state law.id.emphasis added.however,the federal statute itself does not define the term such cases or the term such provision.plaintiff argues that by including the conditional phrase if such provision is made in the state law,congress intended to defer to state law only when a state has enacted a statute that regulates the appraisal remedy specifically in the context of bank mergers.for their part,defendants contend that,because nothing in the statute limits congress intended deference to state law to a state banking law,a proper interpretation of the federal act requires the use of a state general corporate law appraisal procedures whenever a shareholder of a state bank dissents from a plan of merger under.
defendant interpretation,however,would effectively render meaningless the default appraisal procedures,outlined in c,when a state bank merges with a national bank.nearly every state corporate law sets forth an appraisal procedure to determine the value of dissenters shares and,according to defendants,this procedure would invariably control when a state bank merges into a national bank.yet,the default appraisal procedure in c applies to this situation.w e should avoid an interpretation of a statute that renders any part of it superfluous and does not give effect to all the words used by congress.cheema ins,cir quoting nevada watkins,cir.
nevertheless,defendants are correct that nothing in the federal act clarifies the scope of d deference to state law.both parties readings of the law are reasonable.with respect to the issue before us,therefore,the statute is ambiguous.see office of the comptroller of currency interp,wl may,the federal law governing state bank mergers into national banks is ambiguous on which law governs the procedures for the perfection of dissenters rights.
when the text of a statute is ambiguous,we must consider t he purpose,the subject matter,the context and the legislative history of this statute.united states miguel,cir quoting pfizer,gov t of india,d alterations in original.we also grant a degree of deference to the interpretation of an administrative agency charged with implementing the statute or provision in question when the agency interpretation is a permissible construction of the statute.ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
section purpose and legislative history 
congress originally enacted the act sections governing bank mergers and consolidations in,with the goal of simplifying the merger of national banking associations 
it is the purpose of this bill to remove the necessity of liquidation and permit the consolidation to take place upon the affirmative vote of the stockholders of each association,such consolidation being permitted under the charter of either of the existing banks.proper provision is made by the proposed law to protect any dissenting stockholder in either corporation,who does not desire to be connected with the consolidated bank.
to accompany.an amendment to the statute in made the act more like extant state statutes with respect to appraisal rights.see nodak clarke,cir discussing legislative history.before the amendment to b,the dissenting shareholders of both the acquired bank and the acquiring bank were entitled to cash out and to have their shares appraised,making it much more difficult to consolidate banks under federal law than under state law under state law,only the dissenting shareholders of an acquired bank could seek an appraisal.id.
in,congress added the text of d that is at issue here as part of a series of technical amendments to the national banking laws,at,to accompany.the legislative history accompanying that provision is sparse.as plaintiff points out,congress added the new sections to the act 
in order to make uniform the provisions relating to these consolidations and mergers and to eliminate certain ambiguities.it would eliminate differences in the legal requirements for publication,the requirements of notice of shareholders meetings,the waiving of such notice,the procedure to be followed in determining dissenters rights,and the payment for the expense of appraisal or reappraisal made by the comptroller of the currency.
id.at emphasis added.
in view of the legislative history emphasis on uniformity,plaintiff argues that d must be construed to defer to appraisal procedures in only the narrowest of circumstances.it is hard to reconcile that argument with the fact that the plain text of the statute accommodates varying appraisal procedures in at least some situations.if congress chief concern was the uniformity of appraisal procedures,it would not have chosen to direct state banks and their dissenting shareholders to use potentially state laws for the appraisal of dissenters shares.in other words,congress general intent is not especially helpful in resolving the particular issue we face here.we are also mindful of the strong presumption that the plain language of the statute expresses congressional intent,which is rebutted only in rare and exceptional circumstances,when a contrary legislative intent is clearly expressed.royal foods rjr holdings,cir quoting ardestani ins,d.in the circumstances,the legislative history is of limited assistance.
the comptroller interpretation of d 
although no state or federal case has squarely addressed the issue of how to understand d,a series of interpretive letters from the office of the comptroller of currency occ has outlined an approach that is somewhat illuminating.as the agency charged with administering the act,the occ interpretations of that statute are entitled to deference.see nationsbank of,variable annuity life ins,d noting that the occ is charged with the enforcement of banking laws to an extent that warrants the invocation of the rule of deference with respect to his deliberative conclusions as to the meaning of these laws.we have held that the occ interpretations of the act contained in amicus briefs and interpretive letters are entitled to great weight if those interpretations are reasonable.bank of am.city county of,cir,cert.denied,d.interpretations contained in opinion letters,although not entitled to deference,are entitled to respect to the extent that those interpretations have the power to persuade.christensen harris county,d quoting skidmore swift.see also bank of,at we find the occ opinion letters to be both persuasive and consistent with the national bank act and occ regulations and thus at least entitled to respect.quoting christensen,at.
as a general matter,the occ has allowed provisions of a state corporate code to supplement federal banking regulations so long as those provisions do not conflict with federal law.indeed,federal law includes state law among its other sources of guidance when regulating corporate governance procedures 
to the extent not inconsistent with applicable federal banking statutes or regulations,or bank safety and soundness,a national bank may elect to follow the corporate governance procedures of the law of the state in which the main office of the bank is located,the law of the state in which the holding company of the bank is incorporated,the delaware general corporation law,or the model business corporation act.

with respect to bank mergers,however,federal law does expressly address both the authority of state banks to merge into national banks and,in connection with such mergers,the right of dissenting shareholders to be cashed out and to seek an appraisal.as indicated by a pair of occ interpretive letters,federal law does not defer to a state general corporate code for the relevant appraisal procedures in this context.in a interpretive letter,the occ held that,because massachusetts state law expressly provides that mergers of state banks into national banks shall be in accordance with federal law and does not set forth an appraisal procedure applicable to such mergers,the dissenters rights were governed solely by.occ interp,wl.
the dissenter who requested the opinion letter from the occ had argued that the general corporate law of massachusetts should supply both the notice and the appraisal procedures.this,according to the anonymous dissenter,is what congress meant by the manner prescribed by the law of the state in such cases if such provision is made in the state law.d.the comptroller disagreed,noting that t here is no provision made in massachusetts law for dissenters rights for shareholders of state trust companies which merge into national banks.occ interp.ltr.in fact,the only massachusetts statute that arguably spoke to share appraisals in the context of a merger under permitted a state bank to consolidate or merge into or convert into a national banking association in accordance with the laws of the united states and without the approval of any authority of the commonwealth.laws ch,b.
in a separate letter ruling in,however,the occ agreed with two banks that indiana statutes did govern the appraisal procedure for dissenting shareholders.occ interp,wl may.unlike massachusetts,indiana had a statute addressing appraisal procedures in the specific context of bank mergers.indiana code provides for judicial appraisal of dissenting shares of banks and does not confine its scope to mergers or consolidations into resulting state banks.relying on d deference to the manner prescribed by the law of the state in such cases,the occ interposed no objection to the banks plan to use the appraisal procedures because indiana law contains a comprehensive dissenters rights statute,including appraisal rights,and a valid legal argument can be advanced to support the banks position that state law should apply.interp.ltr.may.
the occ stopped short of fully endorsing the approach of the two indiana state banks nonetheless,reading the and interpretive letters side by side,the difference between them is that the occ approved a merging bank resort to appraisal procedures where,but only where,a state statute expressly addressed the appraisal of shares in the specific context of a bank merger.in other words,the occ appears to have construed in the manner prescribed by the law of the state in such cases,d emphasis added,to mean in cases involving bank mergers.
that construction is both reasonable and consistent with the approach that several st
