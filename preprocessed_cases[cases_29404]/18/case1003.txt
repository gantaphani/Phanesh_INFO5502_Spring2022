george diaz,sometime shareholder of digimarc corporation,filed this action derivatively on the corporation behalf.diaz alleges that the individual defendants,who are current and former officers and directors of digimarc,breached their fiduciary duties to the corporation and its shareholders by issuing misleading financial statements and misrepresenting the business and prospects of digimarc in violation of california corporations law and section of the act.the district court dismissed his claim on the grounds that there is no private cause of action for a violation of section and then realigned digimarc as a plaintiff,thereby destroying diversity jurisdiction over diaz state law claims.for the reasons explained below,we agree with the district court that there is no private right of action under section,and that the district of oregon accordingly lacked federal question jurisdiction over the suit.we disagree,however,with the district court realignment of digimarc as plaintiff for the purpose of determining diversity jurisdiction and therefore remand to that court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
on september,digimarc,a delaware corporation headquartered in oregon and a leading supplier of secure personal identification systems including personal identification documents and driver licenses based on digital watermarking technology,publicly announced that,due to accounting errors,the corporation had likely overestimated earnings for the previous six quarters.the announcement cited the improper capitalization of internal software development costs as the most likely cause of these accounting errors.in short,the corporation had failed to record the costs of internal software development as expenses on its balance sheet,thereby artificially inflating its net earnings over the relevant period.
although the full extent of the accounting errors approximately million in overstated earnings was not revealed until april,when digimarc formally issued a restatement of earnings,class action lawsuits were filed within one month of the september,announcement.on september,a class action complaint alleging violations of sections b and a of the securities exchange act was filed and eventually consolidated with two others in the district of oregon.see zucco partners,llc digimarc,d.the appellant in this action,meanwhile,filed a shareholder derivative suit in early october against digimarc and certain of its officers and directors in california superior court for san luis obispo county.this action,which was consolidated with a similar suit filed by patrick sheehan in the same court,pled state law claims for violations of california corporations code,breach of fiduciary duty,abuse of control,gross mismanagement,waste of corporate assets,and unjust enrichment.
other shareholders sought a more direct means of remediation.shortly after the california superior court actions were filed,christopher beasley sent a letter to the chair of digimarc board of directors demanding that the board take action to rectify the alleged breaches of fiduciary duties described in the california superior court complaint.the letter specifically demanded the board commence a civil action against each of the directors and officers to recover for the benefit of the company damages for misconduct and disgorgement of bonuses,stock options,and other incentive compensation.
in response to the derivative actions and the demand letter,digimarc created a special litigation committee slc by board resolution on january,for the purpose of investigating the breaches of fiduciary duty alleged in the california superior court action and the beasley letter.the board endowed the slc with the broad adjudicative power to undertake and supervise any action necessary and appropriate to implement any factual findings it made,and to determine whether or not the company shall undertake or defend against any litigation against one or more of the present or former directors or officers of the company.
initially,alty van luijt and jim roth,both directors of digimarc named as defendants in the california superior court action,were appointed as sole members of the slc.on june,however,van luijt and roth were replaced by lloyd waterhouse,bernard whitney,and william board members of digimarc who were not named as defendants in the california superior court action and who were not affiliated with the company during the time period at issue.the slc also retained the law firm farleigh witt to assist in the investigation of claims against individual officers and directors.one of the slc initial actions was to send a letter dated february,to beasley inviting him to participate in the investigation.the slc did not send similar letters to diaz or sheehan at that time.
digimarc approach to the california action was decidedly less generous.the corporation moved in california superior court to dismiss the consolidated derivative action on grounds of forum non conveniens.this motion was granted on july,and the case was dismissed.the court conditioned its order to dismiss on an agreement by digimarc and the individual defendants to submit to the jurisdiction of an oregon state court in which beasley,unsatisfied with the slc letter,had also filed a derivative action,and an agreement that the statute of limitations pertaining to any claims based on the same facts alleged in the california superior court actions would be tolled from the date of filing the california superior court actions.
instead of filing in oregon state court,however,diaz and sheehan each added a claim and brought separate derivative actions in the district court for the district of oregon on august.specifically,these actions asserted claims for disgorgement under section of the act,and state law claims for breach of fiduciary duty,abuse of control,gross mismanagement,waste of corporate assets,unjust enrichment,and violations of the california corporations code.the actions further alleged that the individual defendants,the directors and officers of digimarc were liable to digimarc for an unspecified sum of damages and declaratory and equitable relief.the district court consolidated the actions on september.
on september,shortly after the district court actions were filed,the slc sent a letter to counsel for diaz and sheehan,inviting them to have input in our investigation and to participate in the next committee meeting on october.three days later,the slc sent another letter to beasley counsel,advising him of the committee meeting and the ongoing investigation.
a little over a month later,on october,the individual defendants in this case filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint for lack of jurisdiction,pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b and b.the individual defendants argued that because section of the act did not create a private right of action,the district court could not assert federal question jurisdiction over that claim,and that because digimarc corporation should be aligned as a plaintiff in the action,the parties were not diverse and the district court lacked jurisdiction over the plaintiffs remaining state law claims.
meanwhile,after the motion to dismiss was filed but before the district court ruled,the slc finished its investigation and reported its findings and recommendations on february.the slc concluded that w ith respect to the facts,there was insufficient evidence to establish that any of the defendants violated applicable standards of conduct,intentionally or otherwise,and that the evidence overwhelmingly indicated that there was simply no malfeasance or nonfeasance such that would entitle the company or someone suing on its behalf to prevail on any of the claims alleged in the derivative litigation.accordingly,the slc recommended that the defendants substantial defenses,and the risks,costs,and burden of litigation establish that pursuit of the derivative litigation is not in the best interest of the company and its shareholders.
the district court subsequently granted the individual defendants motion to dismiss on august.the district court concluded that there was no private right of action under section,and thus that plaintiffs lack ed standing to assert the only federal law claim alleged in the complaint.additionally,the district court held that digimarc should be aligned as a plaintiff in the action because the company was not actively antagonistic to the derivative plaintiffs.once digimarc was realigned as a plaintiff,the district court dismissed the remaining claims for lack of diversity jurisdiction.diaz filed a timely appeal to this court.
diaz appeals both grounds.first,he argues that the district court had federal question subject matter jurisdiction because section of the act permits a cause of action.second,he argues that even if the district court lacked federal question jurisdiction,the district court should not have realigned digimarc as a plaintiff and,consequently,the district court had diversity jurisdiction over the state law claims.we consider each claim in turn.
diaz first contends that the district court erred in determining that section of the act does not contain a right of action allowing private parties to sue for noncompliance.we review a district court decision involving interpretation of a federal statute de novo.olympic pipe line city of seattle,cir.
section of title grants federal district courts original jurisdiction over all civil actions arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.additionally,a furnishes district courts with supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy.the only basis diaz asserts for federal question jurisdiction is section of the act.if private plaintiffs have a right of action to sue under section,the district of oregon had subject matter jurisdiction over both the claim and the state law claims asserted in this case.see merrell dow pharms.thompson,d am.well works layne bowler.opinion of holmes,a suit arises under the law that creates the cause of action.if,however,section does not contain a private right of action,the district court properly dismissed the claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,see merrell dow,at.
section of the act of provides for the forfeiture of certain bonuses and profits when corporate officers fail to comply with securities law reporting requirements.the statute provides in relevant part 
a additional compensation prior to noncompliance with commission financial reporting requirements 
if an issuer is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the issuer,as a result of misconduct,with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws,the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the issuer shall reimburse the issuer for 
any bonus or other or equity based compensation received by that person from the issuer during that period following the first public issuance or filing with the commission whichever first occurs of the financial document embodying such financial reporting requirement and 
any profits realized from the sale of securities of the issuer during the period.
a.the statute also allows the securities and exchange commission to exempt any person from the effect of the forfeiture penalty.b.
t he fact that a federal statute has been violated and some person harmed does not automatically give rise to a private cause of action in favor of that person.touche ross redington,d quotation omitted.instead,the statute must either explicitly create a right of action or implicitly contain one.id.at.whether this language contains a private right of action is a question of first impression in this court.
section does not explicitly create a private right of action because nothing in the text of the section makes any mention of a cause of action.other sections of the act demonstrate how congress expressly creates private rights of action.section,for example,provides that a n action to recover profits in accordance with this subsection may be instituted at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction by the issuer,or by the owner of any security of the issuer a b emphasis added.by contrast,section does not mention the availability of any action to enforce its mandates,nor does it explicitly describe a forum in which suit may be brought or a plaintiff for whom such a forum is available.accordingly,any private right of action within section must be implied from the statute language,structure,context and legislative history.opera plaza residential parcel homeowners ass hoang,cir.
we next turn to whether section creates an implied private right of action.so far as we can determine,no circuit has yet answered this question,except in dicta.pirelli armstrong tire.retiree med.benefits trust raines,holding that defendant directors decision not to bring suit under section for disgorgement by ceo and cfo was within the business judgment rule,since does not create a private right of action.however,a number of district courts have squarely addressed the issue and have concluded that there is no such right.see pedroli ex rel.microtune,bartek,d,in re diebold derivative,wl,at,in re ibasis.derivative,d,in re infosonics.derivative,btm wmc,wl,at,in re goodyear tire rubber.derivative,wl,at,kogan robinson,d,in re whitehall jewellers.derivative,c,wl,at,in re bisys group.derivative action,d,neer pelino,d,mehlenbacher jitaru,wl,at.june.
where a federal statute does not explicitly create a private right of action,a plaintiff can maintain a suit only if congress intended to provide the plaintiff with a n implied private right of action.first pac.bancorp,helfer,cir.if not express,a right of action must be implied because private rights of action to enforce federal law must be created by congress.alexander sandoval,d citing touche ross,at.in the absence of clear evidence of congressional intent,we may not usurp the legislative power by unilaterally creating a cause of action.touche ross,at.the ultimate question is one of congressional intent,not one of whether this court thinks that it can improve upon the statutory scheme that congress enacted into law.accordingly,t he judicial task is to interpret the statute congress has passed to determine whether it displays an intent to create not just a private right but also a private remedy.alexander,at.citing transamerica mortgage advisors,lewis,d.
the supreme court has created a test for determining the existence of an implied private right of action in a statute not expressly providing one.cort ash,d.a court determining whether a private right of action is implied in a statute must consider whether the plaintiff is one of the class for whose especial benefit the statute was is,whether the statute create s a federal right in favor of the plaintiff whether there is any indication of legislative intent,explicit or implicit,either to create such a remedy or to deny one whether the cause of action is consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme and whether the cause of action is one traditionally relegated to state law,in an area basically the concern of the states,so that it would be inappropriate to infer a cause of action based solely on federal law.id.internal quotations and citations omitted.
in analyzing the cort factors we will focus on the second factor whether congress intended to provide the plaintiff with a private right of action as the key inquiry in this calculus.opera plaza,at.see also orkin taylor,cir indeed,the three cort questions that are not explicitly focused on legislative intent are actually indicia of legislative intent,such that the cort test itself is focused entirely on intent.here,congressional intent weighs decisively against finding a private right of action.we begin our search for congress intent with the text and structure of the statute.alexander,at.see also lamie united states trustee,d the starting point in discerning congressional intent is the existing statutory text.in conducting this examination,we must consider the entire statutory scheme provided by congress in determining if a private cause of action exists,noting that analogous provisions expressly providing for private causes of action can imply congressional intent not to create an implied cause of action.opera plaza,at citing touche ross,at.
the language of section is at best ambiguous about an intent to create a private right of action.diaz argues that section language is analogous to that of section a of title ix of the education amendments of,which the supreme court found to contain an implied private right of action.see cannon university of chicago,d.it is clear,however,that the language so critical to the court analysis in cannon is completely absent alexander,at.from section.unlike section a,which expansively provides that no person shall be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance,see a,section does not create a right to disgorgement in shareholders.instead,it speaks in terms of the remedy,detailing when and under what circumstances a ceo and cfo must reimburse an issuer.see a t he chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the issuer shall reimburse the issuer.
the fact that both title ix and section use the hortatory shall is irrelevant.it is the no person language in title ix,conspicuously absent from section,which gives title ix its remunerative force.section focuses on the person regulated rather than the individual who will ultimately benefit from the statute protection,and thus does not provide a private right of action.alexander,at.
although the language and structure of section do not indicate congressional intent to create a private right of action,we must also examine the entire statutory scheme provided by congress to satisfy our inquiry into legislative intent.opera plaza,at.where analogous provisions expressly provide for a private right of action,we must infer that congress did not intend to create a private right of action in the statutory section at issue,see,because when congress wished to provide a private damages remedy,it knew how to do so and did so expressly.touche ross,at.
here,appellant and appellees debate which is the most analogous provision within the act with which to compare section.diaz points to section,which prohibits officers and directors from tak ing any action to fraudulently influence,coerce,manipulate,or mislead any independent public or certified accountant for the purpose of creating misleading financial statements.a.diaz notes that section,unlike section,contains a specific restriction on private gives the commission exclusive authority to enforce this section.id.b.diaz also cites section,which amended statute of limitations period for certain actions and provides that nothing in this section shall create a new,private right of action,title vii,c,stat.appellees,meanwhile,highlight section,which prohibits insider trading during pension fund blackout periods and requires a disgorgement of profits from officers and directors who engage in such trading.section,unlike section,explicitly creates an action to recover profits that may be instituted at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction by the issuer,or by the owner of any security of the issuer under certain circumstances.id.a b.
diaz can not satisfy his burden to show that section creates a private right of action by pointing to other sections in that expressly disclaim private enforcement.it would turn cort on its head to hold that by making clear it did not intend to create a private right of action in sections and,congress affirmatively intended to create rights of action in sections where it omitted such an express denial.furthermore,section does not create a new remedial,it merely extends a statute of limitations for certain actions and adds prophylactic rather than new language.
sections and,meanwhile,both require directors and officers to reimburse the issuer by disgorging the profits of their noncompliance.compare a t he chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the issuer shall reimburse the issuer,with a a any profit realized by a director or executive officer shall inure to and be recoverable by the issuer.it is true that both sections disgorgement remedies are equitable in the sense that they require wrongdoers to reimburse the issuer for gains and that we have previously acknowledged that where the statutory remedy is an equitable one,we are more inclined to perceive in congress silence a presumption that an individual may pursue a claim.helfer,at.but setting section against section prevents us from reading an implied private right of action into section.again,in addition to creating the disgorgement remedy,section also expressly creates a private right of action to enforce this remedy.a b.accordingly,we can not find in congress silence in section an intent to create a private right of action where it was not silent in creating such a right to similar equitable remedies in other sections of the same act opera plaza,at citing touche ross,at.
because the text and the structure of the act do not demonstrate an intent to create a private right of action under section,we need not delve into the first federal right in plaintiff favor,third general statutory purpose,and fourth nature of the action cort factors.as we have previously recognized,t hat the first two cort factors weigh against finding a private right of action is dispositive of our inquiry.opera plaza,at citing california sierra club,d oliver sealaska,cir.even if we assume that diaz would prevail under the first cort factor,this is not enough to offset the clear text and structure of section.we also observe that nothing that diaz has argued with respect to the third or fourth cort factors calls into question our conclusion.see neer,d at analyzing the legislative history of section and determining that nothing in the legislative history demonstrates congressional intent to create a private right of action.
accordingly,we conclude that section does not create a private right of action.because diaz section claim was the only basis for federal question jurisdiction,the district court correctly determined that it lacked federal question jurisdiction over diaz suit.thus the only possible basis for the district court jurisdiction over the plaintiff remaining state law claims is diversity 
diaz argues that subject matter jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims may be maintained on diversity grounds because the district court decision to realign digimarc corporation as a plaintiff thereby destroying diversity jurisdiction was error.we review the district court legal conclusions de novo,kroske bank,cir,and its factual determinations necessary to establish diversity jurisdiction for clear error.kroske,at.prudential real estate affiliates,ppr realty,cir the issue of alignment for purposes of diversity jurisdiction requires a court to look beyond the pleadings to the actual interest of the parties.because we find there was antagonism between the derivative plaintiffs and digimarc directors and officers at the time the suit was filed,we conclude that the district court erred in its decision to realign the corporation as a plaintiff.
section of title confers jurisdiction on federal courts where there is diversity of citizenship between plaintiffs and defendants.diversity jurisdiction requires complete diversity between the defendant must be a citizen of a different state from each plaintiff.strawbridge curtiss,cranch.this requirement would be satisfied if the parties were aligned as asserted in the complaint while diaz and sheehan are citizens of new york,the individual defendants are citizens of california,oregon,the netherlands,and the united kingdom and digimarc is incorporated in delaware and has its principal place of business in oregon.see a,a,c.
