in the aftermath of a colossal ponzi scheme conducted by bernard madoff over a period of years,irving picard has been appointed,pursuant to the securities investor protection act,et sipa,as trustee for the liquidation of bernard madoff investment securities llc,id.b.pursuant to sipa,picard has the general powers of a bankruptcy trustee,as well as additional duties,specified by the act,related to recovering and distributing customer property.id.essentially,picard has been charged with sorting out decades of fraud.the question presented by this appeal is whether the method picard selected for carrying out his responsibilities under sipa is legally sound under the language of the statute.we hold that it is.accordingly,we affirm the order of the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york lifland.
background 
the facts surrounding bernard madoff multibillion dollar ponzi scheme are widely known and were recounted in detail by the bankruptcy court.in re bernard madoff inv.sec.llc,see also,in re beacon assocs,d,anwar fairfield greenwich,d,in re tremont sec.law,state law ins,d.for our purposes,a few facts suffice.when customers invested with bernard madoff investment securities llc blmis,they relinquished all investment authority to madoff.madoff collected funds from investors,claiming to invest those funds pursuant to what he styled as a conversion strategy for producing consistently high rates of return on investments vol.ii at.the splitstrike conversion strategy supposedly involved buying a basket of stocks listed on the standard poor index and hedging through the use of options.however,madoff never invested those customer funds.instead,madoff generated fictitious paper account statements and trading records in order to conceal the fact that he engaged in no trading activity whatsoever.even though a customer monthly account statement listed securities transactions purportedly executed during the reporting period and purported individual holdings in various standard poor index stocks as of the end of the reporting period,the statement did not reflect any actual trading or holdings of securities by madoff on behalf of the customer.in fact,the trustee investigation revealed many occurrences where purported trades were outside the exchange price range for the trade date.in re bernard madoff,at.other now revealed irregularities make it clear that madoff never executed his investment and hedging strategies,and could not possibly have done so.id.to point out just two examples,an unrealistic number of option trades would have been necessary to implement the s trategy and one of the money market funds in which customer resources were allegedly invested through blmis has acknowledged that it did not even offer investment opportunities in any such money market fund from forward.id.
as is true of all ponzi schemes,see cunningham brown,describing the remarkable criminal financial career of charles ponzi,madoff used the investments of new and existing customers to fund withdrawals of principal and supposed profit made by other customers.madoff did not actually execute trades with investor funds,so these funds were never exposed to the uncertainties or fluctuations of the securities market.fictional customer statements were generated based on stock trades using trading data to pick advantageous historical prices.vol.i at,vol.ii at.the customer statements documented an astonishing pattern of continuously profitable trades,approximating the profits madoff had promised his customers,but reflected trades that had never occurred.although madoff scheme was engineered so that customers always appeared to earn positive annual returns,the rates of return madoff assigned to different customers accounts varied significantly and arbitrarily.in re bernard madoff,at.thus,the customer statements reflected unvarying investor success but the only accurate entries reflected the customers cash deposits and withdrawals.vol.i at.
madoff scheme collapsed when the flow of new investments could no longer support the payments required on earlier invested funds.see eberhard marcu,cir describing typical ponzi scheme where earlier investors are paid from the investments of more recent investors until the scheme ceases to attract new investors and the pyramid collapses.the final customer statements issued by blmis falsely recorded nearly billion of net investments and related fictitious gains.vol.i at.it is not contended on this appeal that any victim knew or should have known that the investments and customer statements were fictitious.it is unquestioned that the great majority of investors relied on their customer statements for purposes of financial planning and tax reporting,to their terrible detriment.
when madoff fraud came to light,the securities and exchange commission filed a civil complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,alleging that madoff and blmis were operating a ponzi scheme the securities investor protection corporation sipc,a nonprofit corporation consisting of registered and members of national securities exchanges that supports a fund used to advance money to a sipa trustee,then stepped in sec.exch.comm packer,wilbur,cir.sipc filed an application in the civil action seeking a decree that the customers of blmis are in need of the protections afforded by sipa.a a.the district court granted sipc application the protective order appointed picard as trustee for the liquidation of the business of blmis and the sipa liquidation proceeding was removed to the bankruptcy court.id.b see also sec.investor prot.bdo seidman,llp,cir.
sipa establishes procedures for liquidating failed and provides their customers with special protections.in a sipa liquidation,a fund of customer property,separate from the general estate of the failed,is established for priority distribution exclusively among customers.the customer property fund consists of cash and securities received or held by the on behalf of customers,except securities registered in the name of individual customers.each customer shares ratably in this fund of assets to the extent of the customer net equity.id.c b.under sipa 
the term net equity means the dollar amount of the account or accounts of a customer,to be determined by 
a calculating the sum which would have been owed by the debtor to such customer if the debtor had liquidated,by sale or purchase on the filing date,all securities positions of such customer minus 
b any indebtedness of such customer to the debtor on the filing date 
in many liquidations,however,the assets in the customer property fund are insufficient to satisfy every customer net equity claim.in such a case,sipc advances money to the sipa trustee to satisfy promptly each customer valid net equity claim.for securities accounts,the maximum advance is per customer.id.a.for customers with claims for cash,the maximum advance is substantially less.id.a,d.under sipa,all claims must be filed with the trustee,id.a,who is charged with determining customer claims in writing.a customer objection must be filed with the bankruptcy court.
in satisfying customer claims in this case,picard,as the sipa trustee,determined that the claimants are customers with claims for securities within the meaning of sipa.the trustee further concluded that each customer net equity should be calculated by the net investment method,crediting the amount of cash deposited by the customer into his or her blmis account,less any amounts withdrawn from it.at.the use of the net investment method limits the class of customers who have allowable claims against the customer property fund to those customers who deposited more cash into their investment accounts than they withdrew,because only those customers have positive net equity under that method.some customers objected to the trustee method of calculating net equity and argued that they were entitled to recover the market value of the securities reflected on their last blmis customer statements the last statement method.after the filing of a number of objections,the trustee moved the bankruptcy court for an order affirming his use of the net investment method of calculating net equity.both sipc and the sec submitted briefs supporting the trustee motion 
after a hearing,the bankruptcy court upheld the trustee use of the net investment method on the ground that the last customer statements could not be relied upon to determine n et e quity because customers account statements were entirely fictitious and did not reflect actual securities positions that could be liquidated in re bernard madoff,at.the bankruptcy court reasoned that the definition of net equity under sipa must be read in tandem with sipa section b,which requires the trustee to discharge n et e quity claims only insofar as such obligations are ascertainable from the books and records of the debtor or are otherwise established to the satisfaction of the trustee.id.quoting b.the bankruptcy court emphasized that the blmis books and records expose a ponzi scheme where no securities were ever ordered,paid for or acquired,and concluded the trustee could not discharge claims upon the false premise that customers securities positions are what the account statements purport them to be.id.the net investment method,unlike the last statement method,allowed picard to in the bankruptcy court phrase unwind,rather than legitimiz e,the fraudulent scheme.id.at.the bankruptcy court reserved decision on the issue of whether the net investment method should be adjusted to account for inflation or interest.id.at.the bankruptcy court certified an immediate appeal to this court,over which this court accepted jurisdiction,pursuant to d a.
discussion 
we review the legal conclusions of the bankruptcy court,including its interpretation of sipa,de novo.turner davis,gillenwater lynch in re inv.bankers,cir.in conducting our independent review,we consider that the views of the securities exchange commission sec and sipc are entitled to respect,but only to the extent that they have the power to persuade.chao russell le frois builder,cir internal quotation marks and alterations omitted see also in re new times sec,cir new times i observing that the drafters of sipa clearly envisioned roles for both the sec and sipc in administering the statute.
the positions of the parties on appeal are as follows.picard asserts that the objecting blmis claimants are customers with claims for securities under sipa and that the plain language of sipa dictates that their net equity be calculated based on the net investment method.the sec,as amicus curiae,supports the trustee view that,here,the net investment method is required by the language of sipa.the sipc deemed to be a party in interest as to all matters arising in a sipa proceeding urges this court to affirm the order of the bankruptcy court,which holds that on the present facts the net investment method and not the last statement method correctly measures net equity.the objecting blmis claimants contend that the last statement method is mandated by the language of sipa that they had a legitimate expectation that their customer statements were accurate that sipa is designed to protect this legitimate expectation and that the net investment method undermines the purpose of the statute.
first,accepting that the objecting blmis claimants are customers under sipa,they are customers with claims for securities.second,while the objecting blmis claimants and the trustee argue the plain language of sipa supports their irreconcilable positions,we conclude that the statutory language does not prescribe a single means of calculating net equity that applies in the myriad circumstances that may arise in a sipa liquidation see sec.exch.comm aberdeen sec,cir the intent of congress to protect customers of financially distressed security dealers is clear,but the specifics of precise resolution of individual situations are clouded by the provisions of a statute which range far from the clarity of blue sky one might expect in this area of the law.mckenny mcgraw in re bell beckwith,rejecting plain meaning arguments as to meaning of allocation under sipa as not persuasive.differing fact patterns will inevitably call for differing approaches to ascertaining the fairest method for approximating net equity,as defined by sipa.see b.
picard selection of the net investment method was more consistent with the statutory definition of net equity than any other method advocated by the parties or perceived by this court.there was therefore no error sipa serves dual purposes to protect investors,and to protect the securities market as a whole.see sec.inv.prot.barbour.treatment of the blmis claimants as customers with claims for securities and calculating net equity based on the net investment method effectuates these purposes.as the bankruptcy court observed,a ny dollar paid to reimburse a fictitious profit is a dollar no longer available to pay claims for money actually invested.if the last statement method were adopted,those claimants who have withdrawn funds from their blmis accounts that exceed their initial investments would receive more favorable treatment by profiting from the principal investments of those claimants who have withdrawn less money than they deposited,yielding an inequitable result.in re bernard madoff,at.the statutory definition of net equity does not require the trustee to aggravate the injuries caused by madoff fraud.use of the last statement method in this case would have the absurd effect of treating fictitious and arbitrarily assigned paper profits as real and would give legal effect to madoff machinations.
the threshold issues are whether the blmis claimants are customers within the meaning of sipa and,if so,whether they are customers with claims for securities or customers with claims for cash.if the objecting blmis claimants are not customers,a,they are not entitled to the protection of sipa at all,see sec.inv.prot.pepperdine in re brentwood,cir.under sipa,t he term customer includes any person who has deposited cash with the debtor for the purpose of purchasing securities.b i see also tew res.mgmt.in re esm gov t,cir observing that it is the act of entrusting the cash to the debtor for the purpose of effecting securities transactions that triggers the customer status provisions emphasis omitted.it also includes 
a person who has a claim on account of securities received,acquired,or held by the debtor in the ordinary course of business as a broker or dealer from or for the securities accounts of such person for safekeeping,with a view to sale,to cover consummated sales,pursuant to purchases,as collateral,security,or for purposes of effecting transfer.
a.we conclude that the blmis claimants are customers with claims for securities within the meaning of sipa.
while sipa does not and can not protect an investor against all losses,it does protect claimants who attempt to invest through their brokerage firm but are defrauded by dishonest brokers.ahammed sec.inv.prot.in re primeline sec,cir.sipa provides this protection by ensuring that claimants who deposited cash with a broker for the purpose of purchasing securities,b i,are treated as customers with claims for securities.this is so because the critical aspect of the customer definition is the entrustment of cash or securities to the for the purposes of trading securities.appleton first bank of ohio,cir emphasis added.
the legislative history supports the view that the blmis claimants are customers with claims for securities.throughout the house report on sipa,investors is used synonymously with customers,and it is clear that an individual who had documentation of his status as a trading customer was to be protected.sec.exch.comm baroff,cir.indeed,treating the blmis claimants as customers with claims for securities protects their legitimate expectations as investors in the securities market,at,reprinted in.similarly,sipa implementing regulations bolster the shared view of the trustee,sipc,and the sec that a claimant who has written confirmation that securities have been purchased or sold on his or her behalf should be treated as a customer with a claim for securities.b,a.the regulation does not,however,mandate that this written confirmation form the basis for calculating a customer net equity.
the blmis claimants object that the only way their legitimate expectations can be protected is by calculating net equity by reference to their last customer statements.we conclude,however,that while the blmis customer statements confirm that the blmis claimants are properly treated as customers with claims for securities,the last customer statements are not useful for ascertaining net equity.we begin where all such inquiries must begin with the language of the statute itself.united states ron pair.two provisions interact.sipa provides that a customer net equity is determined by 
a calculating the sum which would have been owed by the debtor to such customer if the debtor had liquidated,by sale or purchase on the filing date of the protective order 
i all securities positions of such customer minus 
b any indebtedness of such customer to the debtor on the filing date 
emphasis added.at the same time,sipa provides that the trustee should make payments to customers based on net equity insofar as the amount owed to the customer is ascertainable from the books and records of the debtor or is otherwise established to the satisfaction of the trustee.id.b emphasis added.
the objecting blmis claimants contend that their securities positions should be determined by reference to the liquidat ion value,id.a,of the securities listed on their last customer statements.the trustee argues that the customer statements do not reflect securities positions that could be liquidated because the account statements were wholly the invention of madoff and do not reflect actual securities positions that any of net equity therefore also requires a review of the books and records of blmis and that the books and records of the debtor reveal that the last statements are a fiction.br.of appellee picard at.
we agree with picard that a sipa trustee obligation to reimburse customers based on net equity must be considered together with sipa requirement that the trustee discharge obligations of the debtor to a customer relating to,or net equity claims based upon securities insofar as such obligations are ascertainable from the books and records of the debtor or are otherwise established to the satisfaction of the trustee.b see also sec.investor prot.lehman,under sipa,the trustee is required to determine a customer claim based on the net equity of the customer as shown on the books and records of the debtor.footnote omitted.this accords with our usual practice of examining the overall structure and operation of a statute.puello bureau of citizenship immigration,cir.the meaning of a particular section in a statute can be understood in context with and by reference to the whole statutory scheme,by appreciating how sections relate to one another.auburn hous.auth.martinez,cir.in other words,the preferred meaning of a statutory provision is one that is consonant with the rest of the statute.id.
when the terms of the statute are read together,the statute directs that a sipa trustee should determine a customer entitlement to recover net equity based both on the statutory definition of that term and by reference to the books and records of the debtor.while the language of the statute clearly requires a sipa trustee to distribute customer property based on net equity,the statute does not define net equity by reference to a customer last account statement.nor does it say specifically how net equity should be calculated if a dishonest broker failed to place a customer funds into the security market,notwithstanding that the customer deposited cash with the debtor for the purpose of purchasing securities,id.b i.
here,the profits recorded over time on the customer statements were constructs that were based on stock movements that had already taken place,were rigged to reflect a steady and upward trajectory in good times and bad,and were arbitrarily and unequally distributed among customers.these facts provide powerful reasons for the trustee rejection of the last statement method for calculating net equity.in addition,if the trustee had permitted the objecting claimants to recover based on their final account statements,this would have affect ed the limited amount available for distribution from the customer property fund.in re bernard madoff,at.the inequitable consequence of such a scheme would be that those who had already withdrawn cash deriving from imaginary profits in excess of their initial investment would derive additional benefit at the expense of those customers who had not withdrawn funds before the fraud was exposed.because of these facts,the net investment method better measures net equity,as statutorily defined,than does the last statement method as the bankruptcy court reasoned,t he net investment method is appropriate because it relies solely on unmanipulated withdrawals and deposits and refuses to permit madoff to arbitrarily decide who wins and who loses.in re bernard madoff,at.
in holding that it was proper for picard to reject the last statement method,we expressly do not hold that such a method of calculating net equity is inherently impermissible.to the contrary,a customer last account statement will likely be the most appropriate means of calculating net equity in more conventional cases.we would expect that resort to the net investment method would be rare because this method wipes out all events of a customer investment history except for cash deposits and withdrawals.the extraordinary facts of this case make the net investment method appropriate,whereas in many instances,it would not be.the last statement method,for example,may be appropriate when securities were actually purchased by the debtor,but then converted by the debtor.indeed,the last statement method may be especially appropriate where unlike with the blmis accounts at issue in this appeal customers authorize or direct purchases of specific stocks.see generally miller dequine in re stratton oakmont,cv rcc,cv rcc,wl.
ascertaining the proper measure of net equity in a given case is for the ultimate purpose of issuing payments to customers so,the ability to deduce payment amounts to the satisfaction of the trustee will bear upon the method selected for calculating net equity.in this case,the net investment method allows the trustee to make payments based on withdrawals and deposits,which can be confirmed by the debtor books and records,and results in a distribution of customer property that is proper under sipa.
under the circumstances of this case,the limitation on the objecting customers recovery imposed by the net investment method is consistent with the purpose and design of sipa.the principal purpose of sipa is to protect investors against financial losses arising from the insolvency of their brokers.in re new times sec,cir new times ii internal quotation marks omitted.sipa is also intended to protect capital markets by instilling confidence in securities traders.sec.investor prot.morgan,kennedy,cir.sipa main purpose i s not to prevent fraud or conversion,but to reverse los s es resulting from brokers insolvency.in re stratton oakmont,wl,at see also appleton,at in re brentwood,at.
the blmis claimants characterize the overall statutory scheme as an insurance guarantee of the securities positions set out in their account statements.they maintain that sipa should operate to make them whole from the losses they incurred as a result of madoff dishonesty.we disagree.while this court has referred to sipc as providing a form of public insurance,packer,wilbur,at,it is clear that the obligations imposed on an insurance provider under state law do not apply to this nonprofit membership corporation.barbour,at see also,rosenbluth trading,united states,cir observing that although social security is often referred to as insurance,m anifestly,social security is not traditional insurance,and consequently principles applicable to insurance policies need not be imported uncritically into lawsuits involving social security.moreover,a registered may obtain insurance under new york law and,in the event of a sipa liquidation,new york law governs the relative ability of implic
