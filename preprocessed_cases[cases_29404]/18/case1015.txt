amended opinion 
class plaintiffs appeal the district court judgment,following a bench trial,in favor of thane international,and its officers and directors collectively,thane international on plaintiffs action brought under section a of the securities act of the act,a and under section of the act,alleging control person liability against individual defendants.we must decide whether thane international misrepresented to investors that it would list its shares on the nasdaq national market system nasdaq,and if so,whether those misrepresentations were material.the district court answered no to both questions.we have jurisdiction under.we hold that the district court clearly erred when it found that thane international did not misrepresent that it would list the merged company shares on the nasdaq.we also hold that these misrepresentations were material.we therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
this appeal arises out of a merger transaction between reliant interactive media corporation reliant,a publicly traded corporation,and thane international,a privately held corporation.reliant and thane international executed an agreement and plan of merger on november,which was amended on december.under the terms of the agreement,reliant shareholders would receive shares of thane international common stock for each share of reliant common stock surrendered upon completion of the merger.a wholly owned subsidiary of thane international would merge with and into reliant.the separate corporate existence of the subsidiary would cease,and reliant would continue as the surviving corporation.reliant would then become a wholly owned subsidiary of thane international.premerger,reliant stock traded on the bulletin board otcbb,while thane international stock was not publicly traded.
on january,thane international filed a combined proxy statement and prospectus the initial prospectus,as part of a registration statement on form,with the securities and exchange commission sec.the stockholder letter accompanying the initial prospectus stated that,as a condition to the merger,thane international shares would be listed for trade on the nasdaq,or another national exchange 
it is a condition to the merger that the shares of thane common stock to be received by stockholders of reliant in connection with the merger be quoted or listed on the nasdaq national market or a national securities exchange.
the registration statement was amended on february,march,april,and finally,on april,at which point the sec declared it effective the final prospectus.in the meantime,by letter dated april,nasdaq notified thane international that its shares were approved for listing on the nasdaq.
the final prospectus omitted the express listing condition found in the initial prospectus.although there are several references to listing the merged company stock on the nasdaq sprinkled throughout the final prospectus,those references contained literal representations that the merged company shares had been approved for trading on the nasdaq,and not that the shares were actually listed on the nasdaq.for example,the cover page of the final prospectus states 
the shares of thane common stock to be received by stockholders of reliant in connection with the merger have been approved for quotation and trading on the nasdaq national market upon completion of the merger,subject to thane compliance with the minimum bid price requirements of per share.
under the heading reliant reasons for the merger,the prospectus represents 
the combined company is expected to meet the initial listing requirements of the nasdaq national market,which would provide the reliant stockholders with greater liquidity than they have with reliant common stock trading on the market.
under the heading per share market price information,the prospectus informed investors 
the thane common stock to be issued in connection with the merger has been approved for quotation and trading on the nasdaq national market upon the completion of the merger,subject to thane compliance with the minimum bid price requirements of per share.
in the final prospectus section on questions and answers about the merger,the hypothetical investor asks,will reliant continue as a public company if the merger agreement is approved the hypothetical investment advisor replies 
no.reliant will become a subsidiary of thane upon the completion of the merger,and reliant stockholders will become holders of thane common stock.thane has received approval for quotation and trading of its common stock on the nasdaq national market upon completion of the merger,subject to thane compliance with the minimum bid price requirements of per share.
the final prospectus also included a copy of the merger agreement.section b of the merger agreement discussed thane international covenant to secure the nasdaq listing 
thane shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its outstanding thane common stock immediately after the merger to be approved for quotation on the nasdaq national market system or,in thane reasonable discretion another national securities exchange,subject to official notice of issuance,as promptly as practicable after the date hereof,and in any event prior to the effective time.
thane international was required to compl y in all material respects with all covenants as a condition precedent to reliant obligation to consummate the merger.in the april,letter,nasdaq notified thane international that it had approved thane international listing application.however,in april,members of thane international board of directors met with their investment bankers,who advised the board that shareholder value would be maximized if thane international did not list its common stock on the nasdaq immediately after the merger,but instead waited to list once a secondary offering of shares was completed.according to william hay,thane international chairman and chief executive officer,the secondary offering was to be completed as early as,approximately six weeks after the merger was consummated.during those six weeks,the bankers recommended that thane international trade its shares on the otcbb.
on may,reliant shareholders approved the merger,which was consummated on may.thane international stock commenced trading that day over the otcbb.
thane international shareholders experienced a wild ride.between may and june,the reported share price ranged between and the stock closed at on june.thane international reported its fiscal year earnings on june,and the stock closed that day at.on june,thane international closing price sunk below per share,and never again closed above.
on august,thane international announced its quarterly earnings in its filing with the sec.the results were disastrous,with earnings falling percent over the same quarter the previous year.apparently,there was a general slump in the industry about this time.this was compounded by the company failure to find and market the hit product it had hoped to find.thane international flagship product,an exercise machine called the,was not flying off the shelves as it once had.the stated 
in may and june of,we met with our investment bankers to discuss an underwritten public offering of our common stock.our investment bankers advised us that we could potentially obtain more favorable pricing for the public offering if we implemented our move to the nasdaq national market in conjunction with the underwritten secondary public offering.over the course of june and july we have been preparing for the public offering,but we have recently concluded that present market conditions are no longer favorable for an underwritten public offering of common stock.as such,we are currently evaluating the listing of our common stock on a national market.
thane international shares tumbled on the news,closing at on august.
in february,thane international completed a transaction in which all thane international shareholders were bought out at per share.the shares had never been listed on the nasdaq.
plaintiffs filed an action in the district court,alleging violations of section a of the act,a,for misrepresentation in connection with a securities offering and of section of the act,for control person liability against individual defendants william hay denise,william hay wife and thane international chief creative officer kevin mckeon,thane international chief financial officer and mark taylor,thane international chief operating officer and president.plaintiffs allege that the final prospectus contained material misstatements of fact because it implied that thane international shares would be listed on the nasdaq.the district court certified the plaintiff class and confirmed joseph milkowski as the named class representative.
the district court conducted a bench trial.in a memorandum of decision,the district court held that the defendants had not violated section a of the act for two reasons.miller thane int l,d.first,the district court found that the statements in the final prospectus regarding nasdaq listing were not false or misleading.id.at.the court reasoned that the representations in the final prospectus were literally true,in that they did not promise that thane international shares would actually be listed on the nasdaq.id.at.rather,they merely represented that the shares would be or already had been approved or qualified for nasdaq listing.id.at.the district court contrasted this representation with that determined to be false in blasdel mullenix,where the defendant had represented that the corporation shares would be listed on the new york stock exchange.miller,d at.
the district court also gave weight to the drafting history of the prospectus,finding it reinforce d his conclusion that the representations are literally true.id.the district court noted that the initial prospectus contained an explicit condition that the merger would be completed only if thane international listed its shares on the nasdaq,but that the condition had been omitted from subsequent versions of the the final prospectus.id.the district court concluded that dropping this condition demonstrated that thane international did not actually promise to list its shares on the nasdaq because if a condition to list is eliminated,a reasonable investor would infer that there was no promise to list.id.
second,in the alternative,the district court held that even if the final prospectus contained false statements,those statements were not material.id.at.after hearing from both sides experts,the district court considered the movement in thane international share price in the aftermath of the merger as a probative indicator of materiality,even though it acknowledged that thane international shares did not trade on an efficient market.id.at.it held that because thane international stock did not depreciate immediately following its listing on the otcbb,even though the market had the ability to incorporate that information into thane international share price,the fact of nonlisting on the nasdaq was not material.id.at.
plaintiff class timely appealed.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction over final judgments of the district court under.we review the district court factual findings for clear error.a sec rubera,cir.as the supreme court stated in tsc industries,northway,
the issue of materiality may be characterized as a mixed question of law and fact,involving as it does the application of a legal standard to a particular set of facts.in considering whether summary judgment on the issue is appropriate,we must bear in mind that the underlying objective facts,which will often be free from dispute,are merely the starting point for the ultimate determination of materiality.the determination requires delicate assessments of the inferences a reasonable shareholder would draw from a given set of facts and the significance of those inferences to him,and these assessments are peculiarly ones for the trier of fact.only if the established omissions are so obviously important to an investor,that reasonable minds can not differ on the question of materiality is the ultimate issue of materiality appropriately resolved as a matter of law by summary judgment.

iii.the final prospectus contained misleading statements 
section a of the act imposes civil liability on 
a ny person who offers or sells a security by the use of any means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or of the mails,by means of a prospectus or oral communication,which includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading the purchaser not knowing of such untruth or omission,and who shall not sustain the burden of proof that he did not know,and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known,of such untruth or omission 
a.thus,to prevail under section a,a plaintiff must demonstrate an offer or sale of a security,by the use of a means or instrumentality of interstate commerce,by means of a prospectus or oral communication,that includes an untrue statement of material fact or omits to state a material fact that is necessary to make the statements not misleading.the district court noted,and the parties do not dispute,that only the fourth element is at issue here.
we must therefore first determine whether the final prospectus contains false or misleading statements or omissions.we have recognized that statements literally true on their face may nonetheless be misleading when considered in context,warning 
a n issuer public statements can not be analyzed in complete isolation.some statements,although literally accurate,can become,through their context and manner of presentation,devices which mislead investors.for that reason,the disclosure required by the securities laws is measured not by literal truth,but by the ability of the material to accurately inform rather than mislead prospective buyers.

section a is a virtually absolute liability provision that does not require an allegation that defendants possessed scienter.in re suprema specialties.sec,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also gustafson alloyd,d it is understandable that congress would provide securities buyers with a right to rescind,without proof of fraud.moreover,the purchaser need not prove reliance on the misrepresentations.see gustafson,at.
the disputed statements in the final prospectus fall broadly into two categories.certain representations assert that thane international expects to have its shares approved for quotation on the nasdaq once the merger is completed and the threshold is met.other representations indicate that thane international has already secured such approval.
these statements are literally true.thane international did make an effort to have its shares approved for nasdaq listing,and thane international did actually secure that approval on april,more than two weeks before it filed the final prospectus.the disputed statements in the final prospectus by their terms promise no more than that.
yet,as the district court recognized,literal truth is not the standard for determining whether statements in a prospectus are misleading.we held in convergent technologies that s ome statements,although literally accurate,can become,through their context and manner of presentation,devices which mislead investors.at quoting mcmahan,at.plaintiff class contends that the final prospectus implied that thane international would actually list its shares on the nasdaq.we agree with the plaintiff class.the fair and reasonable implication an ordinary investor would derive from all the listing representations is that,after approval,the shares would be listed on the nasdaq once the threshold was met.the final prospectus represented that thane international shares were expected to be approved for nasdaq listing,and,in the next breath,that reliant shareholders could look forward to being provide d with greater liquidity than they have with reliant common stock trading on the market emphasis added.greater liquidity,greater ability to quickly trade at values reasonable in light of underlying supply and demand,was thus touted as a contemporaneous benefit of the merger.that representation surely suggests a commitment to listing the shares on the the condition was met which was immediately upon merger for approval alone would do absolutely nothing to increase a stock liquidity.it is only once the stock actually trades on a national market that liquidity would increase.moreover,that portion of the final prospectus favorably compares thane international stock future listing with reliant current listing on the otcbb.the clear implication is that thane international shares would not trade on the otcbb,but would instead list on the nasdaq,which is expressly invoked in the first part of the very same sentence.
the district court relied heavily on the drafting history in finding that the final prospectus was not misleading.it observed that the initial prospectus made thane international listing on the nasdaq market a condition to the merger,but that this condition was dropped by the time the final prospectus was accepted by the sec and distributed to reliant shareholders.the underlying premise of the district court reasoning is that investors would read not only the effective final prospectus,but also previous drafts,would further connect the dots between various passages related to nasdaq listing,and could only conclude that thane international had not committed to the nasdaq listing.
we reject that premise for two reasons.first,this premise overlooks the fact that by the time the final prospectus was issued,thane international had already fulfilled the component of this condition over which it had any control thane international had applied for and received approval for nasdaq listing.all that remained as a predicate for listing was for thane international shares to reach a minimum bid price of.second,investors are not generally required to look beyond a given document to discover what is true and what is not.see in re apple computer sec,cir ordinarily,omissions by corporate insiders are not rendered immaterial by the fact that the omitted facts are otherwise available to the public.dale rosenfeld,cir availability elsewhere of truthful information can not excuse untruths or misleading omissions in the prospectus.readiness and willingness to disclose are not equivalent to disclosure.internal quotation marks omitted we will not presume or require that investors independently seek out prior versions of sec filings or otherwise familiarize themselves with the drafting history of a prospectus.sanders john nuveen,cir section does not establish a graduated scale of duty depending upon the sophistication and access to information of the customer.a plaintiff under is not required to prove due diligence.all that is required is ignorance of the untruth or omission.citations omitted.therefore,it was error to impute knowledge of the contents of the initial prospectus to reliant shareholders who received the final prospectus 
we also emphasize the context and manner of presentation of the references to nasdaq listing.convergent technologies,at quoting mcmahan,at.the nasdaq is discussed no fewer than six times throughout the pages of the final prospectus,including on the cover page,the contents of which are closely regulated by the sec.see regulation,b.indeed,b required thane international to disclose whether any national securities exchange or the nasdaq stock market lists the securities offered.the listing on the national exchange is even cited as one of reliant reasons for the merger.read in context,these repeated references suggest nothing short of actual listing on the nasdaq.
the clear error standard is a high bar,but the presumption of correctness that attaches to factual findings is stronger in some cases than in others.the same clearly erroneous standard applies to findings based on documentary evidence as to those based entirely on oral testimony,but the presumption has lesser force in the former situation than in the latter.bose consumers union of united states,d citation omitted.the district court misrepresentation findings were based almost entirely on the documentary that is more amenable to evaluation by a reviewing court.specifically,the relevant evidence consisted primarily of the sec filings themselves and the witnesses written declarations.after examining the documentary record,we have a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.easley cromartie,d citation and internal quotation marks omitted.therefore,we hold that the final prospectus contained false and misleading representations as to the nasdaq listing and that the district court clearly erred in finding otherwise.
iv.the misleading statements were material 
the district court held in the alternative that even if thane international misrepresented that it would list its shares on the nasdaq,any such misrepresentations were immaterial.to conclude that the misrepresentations were immaterial,the district court reasoned that thane international shares did not decline in value even after the market absorbed the fact that thane international shares were not trading on the nasdaq.although it acknowledged that thane international shares did not trade on an efficient market,the district court found by a preponderance of the evidence that those shares had the ability to incorporate the obvious fact of nonlisting into their price.
the district court erred when it considered the movement in share price of a stock that did not trade on an efficient market to determine materiality under the circumstances of this case.therefore,its conclusion that thane international misrepresentations were immaterial is clear error.
thane international is liable under section a only if the misrepresentations in the final prospectus were material to the decision of voters to approve the merger.a referring to a prospectus containing an untrue statement of a material fact or omit ting to state a material fact.the supreme court articulated the standard for materiality in securities actions in tsc industries an omitted fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important in deciding how to vote.at.assessing materiality is a inquiry that depends on the significance the reasonable investor would place on the withheld or misrepresented information.basic levinson,d.t o fulfill the materiality requirement there must be a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.id.at.quoting tsc,at.
the district court received testimony from both sides experts on the question of materiality.testifying for thane international,bradford cornell,professor of finance at the anderson graduate school of management at the university of california,los angeles,minimized the importance investors attach to the market in which a company trades,concluding value derives from the company itself and not where it trades.he also testified that liquidity is determined by a company inherent characteristics not the market on which it trades.he generally regarded listing on the nasdaq as a cosmetic benefit of secondary importance to investors who focus on a company fundamentals.
on behalf of the plaintiff class,candace preston,founding member of financial markets analysis,llc,emphasized the benefits that accompany nasdaq listing as compared to listing on the otcbb.she declared that nasdaq stocks generally enjoy greater liquidity,and thus reduced spreads leading to greater investor returns shares are
