background 
unless otherwise indicated,the factual allegations are not in dispute.guippone worked at steve barry,a chain of retail apparel stores owned and operated by steve barry industries,s b industries.s b industries filed for protection from its creditors pursuant to chapter of the bankruptcy code in july.one group of defendants in this action comprises investment firms bay harbour management lc and its related entities bay harbour master and bh s b together,bay harbour and york capital management and ysof s b investor llc together,york capital or york.bay harbour and york capital created a series of interrelated entities to purchase and manage steve barry after it filed for bankruptcy protection.one of the entities,holdco,served as the holding company and sole managing member of another entity,bh s b holdings llc holdings.holdings was funded with million from bay harbour and york capital,and an additional million in financing from ableco finance llc ableco.holdings employed guippone and the putative class members.
in august,with approval from the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york,holdings bought steve barry assets.holdings retained a number of steve barry employees,including plaintiff and the putative class members.holdings lacked a board of directors of its own.holdings senior management consisted of andy todd,president,and gary sugarman,chief operating officer.the holdco board hired the accounting firm cohn to act as holdings chief financial officer in september,and in october hal kahn was hired as holdings chief executive officer.scott sozio,a member of holdco board and a member of bay harbour,served as holdings assistant secretary.other holdco board members included luis medeiros,a member of york doug teitelbaum,a member of bay harbour and jamie dinan,a member of york.
the parties dispute exactly when and why holdings faced bankruptcy.regardless,the record is clear that in of,lender ableco exercised its rights under its loan agreement and swept roughly million from holdings account.on october,medeiros wrote to teitelbaum and sozio that w e strongly believe that in the best interests of york and other shareholders of steve and barry we put in place a liquidating plan immediately.holdings financial situation continued to deteriorate rapidly.in early november,ableco informed holdco board that ableco intended to call the remainder of its loan,then issued a notice of default.kahn and todd were replaced as holdings managers on november,by ras management advisors,llc.ras or ras management.sozio testified that the decision to hire ras was made by the holdco board to manage the.
on the same day holdings hired ras management,the holdco board discussed the possibility that holdings may have to retain bankruptcy counsel,lay off workers,and send affected workers warn notices.on november,the holdco board passed a resolution stating that 
the management of holdings informed the holdco board that unforeseeable business circumstances,including but not limited to the impact on the general economy,and specifically on retail spending,of the largest stock market crash since the great depression,receipt of a notice of covenant default on november,from holdings senior lenders under its existing loan facility,and recent unexpected deteriorations in the general condition of holdings business,have mandated immediate implementation of staff reduction by holdings 
the resolution continued 
resolved,that based on the facts presented by the management of holdings and the advisors to holdings and holdco,the board has determined in good faith that it is in the best interests of the company to authorize holdings to effectuate the reduction in force and to authorize holdings to provide notice in respect of the reduction in force to each affected employee,as soon as reasonably practicable,in consideration of any potentially applicable federal,state or local laws.
on november,at ras request,the holdco board authorized ras to have holdings file for protection from its creditors pursuant to chapter of the bankruptcy code.that same day,holdings filed for bankruptcy.holdings began sending warn notices and termination notices to employees on november,with more notices issued later that same month and in the months following.
the day after his termination,guippone filed a complaint seeking damages on behalf of himself and others similarly situated.perhaps as a result of that rush to the courthouse door,the district court described guippone first complaint as a model of deficient pleading.guippone bh s b holdings llc,d guippone i.guippone complaint was dismissed without prejudice as facially deficient.see id.at.
guippone filed an amended complaint on january.defendants brought two separate motions to dismiss,one on behalf of the bay harbour and york capital defendants and one on behalf of holdco.the district court granted the motion by the equity entities,finding that the amended complaint failed to plead adequate facts to support its claim that the equity investors were employers within the meaning of warn.see guippone bh s b holdings llc,civ,wl,at may,guippone ii.the district court denied holdco motion,finding plaintiffs pleaded sufficient facts to allege that holdco disregarded holdings corporate form and exercised de facto control over the company sufficient to make holdco liable under warn.id.at.claims brought by plaintiff against defendants holdings and bhy s b intermediate holdco were settled in october see guippone bh s b holdings,llc,civ,wl,at,guippone iii.
following discovery,plaintiff and holdco made for summary judgment.the district court determined that plaintiff failed to raise a triable question of fact that would allow a jury to find that holdco could be held liable pursuant to warn as a single employer with holdings.guippone iii,wl,at.this appeal followed.
discussion 
our standard of review for both motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment is de novo.miller wolpoff abramson,l,cir italics omitted.summary judgment is appropriate where there exists no genuine issue of material fact and,based on the undisputed facts,the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.o g,passenger,cir internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.
warn requires employers to give employees calendar days notice in advance of plant closings and mass layoffs.see.a.it applies under certain conditions where the employer has or more employees.see id.a.a plant closing occurs within the meaning of warn when a permanent or temporary shutdown of a single site of employment leads to the loss of employment for at least employees during a day period.see id.a.a mass layoff occurs when,not as the result of a plant closing,a reduction in force results in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any day period for at least percent of the employees excluding any employees,and at least employees excluding any employees or at least employees excluding any employees.see id.a.
as long as the requisite number of terminations is met,warn notice must be given.under warn,the requisite notice must contain 
a statement as to whether the planned action is expected to be permanent or temporary and,if the entire plant is to be closed,a statement to that effect 
the expected date when the plant closing or mass layoff will commence and the expected date when the individual employee will be separated
