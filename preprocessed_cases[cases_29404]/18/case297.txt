the government appeals from the october,judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york robert sweet,judge sentencing the patrick savin to months imprisonment followed by three years supervised release,restitution,and a mandatory assessment.the defendant,pursuant to a plea agreement,pleaded guilty to wire fraud in violation of and and perjury in violation of.
the government argues that the district court erred in failing to apply a sentencing guidelines enhancement for an offense that affected a financial institution and from which the defendant derived more than in gross receipts.united states sentencing guidelines or the guidelines b b.an application note to the guideline stated that any state or foreign investment company is a financial institution for purposes of the guideline,as is any similar entity,application note.the government contends that the district court should not have defined foreign investment company according to the law of luxembourg,the country in which the affected entity was registered and had its principal place of business,but according to united states federal law.savin counters that the enhancement can not be applied to him because the guideline is invalid as applied to investment companies generally,and that the district court conclusion that the entity at issue was not an investment company was correct applying either the law of luxembourg or united states federal law.the government replies that even if foreign investment company were correctly defined by the district court with reference to the law of luxembourg,savin behavior required the enhancement because the affected entity was similar to a state or foreign investment company,an issue that the district court did not address.savin responds that the similar entity clause,if otherwise applicable to his case,is unconstitutionally vague as applied to him.
we conclude that the sentencing commission was not without authority to treat any state or foreign investment company as a financial institution in the application note to section b b the application note is therefore valid as applied to investment companies generally.because we also conclude that the district court should have looked to united states federal law to determine the meaning of foreign investment company,we remand for the district court to resentence savin using the meaning of the term.because the similar entity clause is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to savin,if the district court concludes on remand that the affected entity is not a foreign investment company,the court should consider whether the affected entity is an entity similar to any of the kinds of institutions listed in application note,including a state or foreign investment company.
background 
the facts underlying this appeal are largely undisputed.they are set forth in some detail in the district court sentencing opinion,united states savin,rws,wl,dist.lexis.
at all relevant times,mezzonen,mezzonen was a private corporation organized and existing under the laws of the duchy of luxembourg,with its principal place of business in luxembourg,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.according to mezzonen documents introduced in a tangentially related bankruptcy proceeding in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york,the company was formed in to engage exclusively in securities investments,particularly in bonds.mezzonen raised approximately million in capital by selling shares in itself to european investors.
mezzonen hired savin to provide investment advisory and portfolio management services with respect to mezzonen investments in securities.through most of the,savin,acting in part through savin carlson investment corporation,which he owned,engaged in a complex series of misrepresentations and diversions of funds enabling him to bilk mezzonen out of several million dollars.
on november,the united states government filed a superseding grand jury indictment in the united states district court for the southern district of new york charging savin with conspiracy to commit wire fraud in violation of and,wire fraud in violation of and,and perjury in violation of in connection with his allegedly false testimony in the bankruptcy proceeding.on march,pursuant to a plea agreement,savin entered a guilty plea to one count of wire fraud for sending a facsimile transmission to an agent of mezzonen in furtherance of a scheme to receive fees in the nature of kickbacks from a company in which mezonnen,through savin,invested money and one count of perjury for his false testimony at the bankruptcy proceeding.
the plea agreement stipulated that the edition of the guidelines applied to the offenses and that governed the offense.according to the plea agreement,savin offense level was calculated as follows pursuant to section a,the base offense level was six.the level was increased by thirteen to nineteen pursuant to section b n because the aggregate amount of the loss involved was more than but less than.the level was increased by another two levels to pursuant to section b because the offense involved more than minimal planning.the level was then increased by another two levels to pursuant to section because the offense involved abuse of a position of private trust.savin and the government also agreed that because the offense level for the perjury offense was nine or more levels less serious than the offense level for the offense,the perjury offense level would be disregarded pursuant to c.and,for accepting responsibility,it was agreed that savin would be given the benefit of a reduction pursuant to.
the parties disagreed,however,as to the applicability of b b,under which an offense level is increased by four when the offense for which the defendant was convicted affected a financial institution if the defendant derived more than in gross receipts from the offense.they agreed to litigate this issue at sentencing,letter agreement between the united states attorney office for the southern district of new york and savin,at,and each reserved the right to appeal the district court decision on the matter.if the enhancement provided by section b b was ultimately determined not to apply,savin total offense level would then be twenty,with a sentencing range of to months.if the enhancement did apply,it would be,with a sentencing range of to months.
the district court decided that b b did not apply to savin offense.savin,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the court first rejected savin argument that the guideline was invalid as applied to savin,reasoning that the sentencing commission was fully empowered to adopt a definition of financial institution that included investment companies,wl,at,dist.lexis,at quoting united states ferrarini,cir.the court then agreed with savin that 
u nder luxembourg law,mezzonen is not an investment fund.instead,mezzonen was structured as a private corporation under the local corporate form of a societe anonyme and benefitted from a status.this structure enabled mezzonen to avoid corporate,income,capital gains and liquidation taxes under luxembourg law,as well as heavy regulation.as a matter of equity,mezzonen should not be considered a financial institution for the purpose of assessing a weightier criminal punishment but not be considered as its own the purposes of domestic regulation.because mezzonen is not an investment fund under luxembourg law,it will not be considered as such for the purposes of this sentence.the enhancement does not apply.
wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the district court did not consider whether mezzonen was an entity similar to one of the financial institutions listed in a pertinent guidelines application note,which would have qualified it as a financial institution for these purposes.see,application note.the court therefore decided that savin total offense level under the guidelines was twenty.savin,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.based on that determination and a criminal history category of i,the court sentenced savin at the bottom of the applicable range,to months imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release,restitution,and a mandatory special assessment of.

iii.the validity of application note 
background commentary to guidelines section stated that s ubsection b b implements the instruction to the sentencing commission in section of public law,cmt.background.the referenced section instructed the sentencing commission to increase the punishment for defendants who derive more than in gross receipts from certain offenses affecting a financial institution as defined in section of title,united states code.lists nine types of financial institutions,none of which is investment company.
thereafter,in,the sentencing commission revamped the guidelines with regard to,moving an amended version of b b to b a.the commission then stated that the definition of financial institution virtually identical to the definition was an implementation,in a broader form,of the instruction to the commission in section of public law,cmt.background emphasis added.
savin argues that the application note was intended only to carry out the dictates of.to the extent that it specified entities not contained in section,he asserts,the note was ultra vires.the district court concluded that section b b was valid as applied to savin sentencing.we agree with the district court.
in our recent decision in united states lauersen,cir,we held that the guideline is valid as applied to entities referred to in the application note even though they are not enumerated in,id.at.we found the language of the application note entirely clear as to the scope of the guideline,and stated that the amendment rejected a contrary interpretation.id.we are bound by lauersen to conclude that the guideline is valid as applied to investment companies generally and thus to savin on the facts of this case.
because the application note,which states that financial institution as used in b b is defined to include any state or foreign investment company and any similar entity,is valid as to savin,and because the guideline provided for a enhancement i f the offense affected a financial institution and the defendant derived more than in gross receipts from the offense,we must address the application of the terms foreign investment company and any similar entity to savin sentencing.
iv.the meaning of foreign investment company 
a.the use of the law of luxembourg or united states federal law 
the government argues that the district court erred by basing its determination on whether mezzonen was an investment company under the law of luxembourg,the country where mezzonen was registered and had its principal place of business.the government asserts that foreign investment company should be defined according to united states federal law instead.under such a definition,the government contends,mezzonen is a foreign investment company and savin should thus receive the enhancement in b b.savin responds that the question is,as the district court thought,whether mezzonen was an investment company under the law of luxembourg.savin also argues that even under united states federal law,mezzonen was not a foreign investment company.
in deciding whether to look to the law of luxembourg or united states law in interpreting the guideline and application note,we start with one of the fundamental purposes of the guidelines.the sentencing commission has explained that a policy underlying the guidelines is the promotion of reasonable uniformity in sentencing by narrowing the wide disparity in sentences imposed for similar criminal offenses committed by similar offenders.ch,pt.a,see also united states young,cir agreeing with the district court that t he whole purpose of the guidelines is that similarly situated defendants should get the same sentence internal quotation marks omitted.the objective of uniformity is not served if a defendant such as savin is sentenced at a particular level because his victim was registered in luxembourg and had its principal place of business there,while someone whose behavior is identical to such a defendant is sentenced at a significantly higher level because his otherwise identical victim is registered or has its principal place of business elsewhere.in such a case,applying the law of the place of the victim may lead to dissimilar sentences for similar behavior.
we find instructive the general principle that 
in the absence of a plain indication to the contrary,congress when it enacts a statute is not making the application of the federal act dependent on state law.that assumption is based on the fact that the application of federal legislation is nationwide and at times on the fact that the federal program would be impaired if state law were to control.
jerome united states.citations omitted accord.band of choctaw indians holyfield,d dickerson new banner,d popkin state health mental hygiene facilities improvement,cir,cert.denied,d we and our sister circuits have applied the jerome presumption to the construction of terms in the guidelines.see united states campbell,cir we conclude that,there being no pertinent provision in either the immigration statute or the guidelines to suggest the applicability of state law,the question of whether a vacated conviction remains a conviction for purposes of b and guidelines is a question of federal law.see also united states brown,cir,cert.denied,d united states duty,cir per curiam united states jones,cir,cert.denied,d united states,cir,cert.denied,d united states reed,cir united states cuevas,cir united states stewart,cir.
the jerome presumption reflects a preference for the uniform application of federal law irrespective of where within the united states an issue regarding the law arises.this concern with interstate uniformity is absent here.we see no reason,however,why this approach should not apply in the interests of uniformity to limit the incorporation of foreign law into federal law.see united states bcci holdings luxembourg.concluding that when a penal statute manifests a policy of uniform enforcement,it would frustrate legislative intent to make the federal statute application dependent on foreign law,cert.denied sub nom.liquidation comm for bcci overseas,macau united states,d labor relations bd.hearst publ ns.opining that referring to other domestic sovereigns legal definitions would introduce variations into a statute operation as wide as the differences the states and other local jurisdictions make in applying a definition for wholly different purposes.and we think that the rule applies to interpretations of the sentencing guidelines absent a plain indication to the contrary,the guidelines should be applied uniformly to those convicted of federal crimes irrespective of how the victim happens to be characterized by its home jurisdiction.
moreover,in light of the implications for uniformity if foreign law were applied to determine the affected entity status,the sentencing commission likely would have expressed more plainly the incorporation of foreign law had it meant to do so.indeed,the sentencing commission has done similarly in other contexts.see,application note criminal activity means any conduct constituting a criminal offense under federal,state,local,or foreign law.
we therefore agree with the government that foreign,as it modifies investment company,is used not to incorporate foreign law,but in a geographic sense any investment company,as defined by united states federal law,that is located outside of the united states is a foreign investment company and,therefore is,according to application note,a financial institution under section b b.in re letters rogatory issued by dir.of inspection of gov t of india,cir defining the statutory language of foreign tribunal to exclude the indian office partly because a tax assessor scarcely fits the notion that most american legislators would entertain of what constitutes a tribunal,implying that a foreign tribunal is a tribunal,as defined by federal law,which is located outside the united states.
we therefore turn to the task of determining the meaning of foreign investment company under united states federal law.
definition of foreign investment company 
in interpreting the guidelines,we are guided by the notion that they,having the force and effect of law,are to be construed as if they were a statute,giving the words used their common meaning,absent a clearly expressed manifestation of contrary intent.united states kirvan,cir see also united states skw metals alloys,cir noting that when a term is not defined in the guidelines,is not used elsewhere in the guidelines,and is not a term of art w e look to the ordinary meaning of the words.we thus apply traditional principles of statutory construction to guideline construction.we also apply these traditional principles to interpretive or explanatory guideline commentary,because it too is generally authoritative unless it violates the constitution or a federal statute,or is inconsistent with,or a plainly erroneous reading of,that guideline.stinson united states,d.
because,applying united states federal law,foreign has no more than a geographic connotation,we are left to determine under federal law the definition of investment company.savin argues that we should look to the definition of foreign investment company in the internal revenue code.the government argues that we should look either to the definition of investment company in the investment company act of or to the commonly accepted definition of the term.
the internal revenue code definition of foreign investment company,contained in a section addressing gains on stock in foreign investment companies,limits its definition to that section the investment company act definition similarly specifically limits its definition to the subchapter in which it appears each definition is thus too intentionally specific to its context to serve as a reliable guide to the meaning of the term as it is used in the guidelines for a completely different purpose to determine the appropriate sentence of a person convicted of an offense adversely affecting a specified type of victim 
traditional statutory interpretation rules under federal law counsel that we define investment company by its common meaning.united states ferrarini,cir using webster third new international dictionary,unabridged to determine the definition of bank under the same application note,cert.denied sub nom.kagan united states,d.webster third new international dictionary,unabridged defines investment company as a company that holds securities of other corporations for investment benefits only.the glossary in the series general securities registered representative study manual defines investment company as a company or trust engaged in the business of investing in and trading securities,id.at.based on these similar definitions,we conclude that investment company in application note includes a company substantially engaged in the business of investing in securities of other companies.
v.the equities 
the district court,as noted in the background section above,remarked 
mezzonen structure under the law of luxembourg enabled mezzonen to avoid corporate,income,capital gains and liquidation taxes under luxembourg law,as well as heavy regulation.as a matter of equity,mezzonen should not be considered a financial institution for the purpose of assessing a weightier criminal punishment but not be considered as its own the purposes of domestic regulation.because mezzonen is not an investment fund under luxembourg law,it will not be considered as such for the purposes of this sentence.
savin,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.we disagree.guideline offense levels are designed to reflect the seriousness of the offense for which a convicted criminal is being sentenced.see,nichols united states,d in arriving at an offense level for savin crime of wire fraud,the relevant question for the court is how serious the crime is according to the guidelines,not what is equitable for the victim.the answer to the question depends on the nature of savin offense,not what is fair to mezzonen his crime of wire fraud is the same regardless of the benefits mezzonen sought to reap from its status under the law of luxembourg.
of course,when a convicted person is sentenced,the identity of his or her victims may matter.the guidelines thus generally punish crimes against vulnerable or sensitive victims more severely.for example,the punishment for sexual abuse depends in part on the victim age,see b,as does the punishment for promoting a commercial sex act or prohibited sexual conduct.indeed,a portion of the,part devoted to adjustments,providing increases in offense levels for offenses involving,for instance,vulnerable victims,b.in the case before us,if the victim is indeed a financial institution,that fact may result in a substantially increased sentence.
we nonetheless fail to see how mezzonen status under the law of luxembourg changes the nature of savin crime against it,rendering it somehow less serious than it would have been were mezzonen a taxable entity.we do not think that the length of savin sentence should to any degree depend upon that factor.were it otherwise,the result would be at odds with the guidelines principle of uniformity discussed in part iv,above,calling for the application of similar sentences to similar criminal offenses committed by similar offenders.
vi.vagueness of any similar entity 
savin argues that if,upon remand,the district court concludes that mezzonen was not a foreign investment company,it still can not impose the enhancement on the basis that mezzonen was an entity that was similar to a state or foreign investment company,application note,because that provision is unconstitutionally vague as applied to savin in this case.if the district court decides that mezzonen was a foreign investment company or that it was not an entity similar to a state or foreign investment company,then whether the similar entity clause is too vague will be of no moment.but should the district court decide otherwise,to avoid an unnecessary further appeal we nonetheless address the vagueness issue here.
a statute is not vague as applied if it give s the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited.vill.of hoffman estates flipside,hoffman estates,d quoting grayned city of rockford,d.assuming that the sentencing guidelines are subject to an attack on unconstitutional vagueness grounds,something we have never decided,see united states johnson,cir reserving the question,cert.denied,d,savin vagueness challenge nevertheless fails.
savin argument is based on his view that the definition of financial institution in the application note is comprised of a confusing multitudinous mixture of many different types of and humans,the sole common denominator being that they are labeled financial institutions by the sentencing commission.appellee br.at.that may be so.and if the application note referred to entities that must be similar to all of the different types of entities listed,it would indeed be mys
