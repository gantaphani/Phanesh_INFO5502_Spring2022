defendants appeal the district court order granting plaintiff gary davis motion to remand davis putative class action to state court the only issue on appeal is whether best buy,a nationwide electronics retailer,has its principal place of business in the state of california.we reverse.
plaintiff gary davis,as a private attorney general on behalf of himself and a putative class of similarly situated california consumers,sued hsbc bank nevada,hsbc finance corporation,best buy company,and best buy stores,in california superior court and alleged claims for unfair competition under cal.bus,false advertising under,and common law fraud in the nature of concealment.davis complaint alleges the defendants defrauded california customers by offering credit cards without adequately disclosing the annual fee the customers would be charged for use of the card.
the defendants removed the action to federal district court and based on the class action fairness act of cafa.davis filed a motion to remand the action to state court and contended that the local controversy exception,d barred the exercise of federal jurisdiction.the district court granted the motion to remand,and the defendants timely appealed.
the only issue on appeal is whether best buy stores has its principal place of business in california.if not,best buy stores is not a citizen of california,the local controversy exception does not apply,and federal jurisdiction under cafa exists.we conclude best buy stores does not have its principal place of business in california.
a limited partnership or a corporation is a citizen of the state under whose laws it is organized or incorporated and the state of its principal place of business.c.in this circuit,we apply two tests to determine the state of a corporation or partnership principal place of business.first we apply the place of operations test.under that test,a corporation principal place of business is the state containing a substantial predominance of corporate operations.tosco communities for a better env t,cir per curiam quoting indus.tectonics,aero alloy,cir.if no state contains a substantial predominance of corporate operations,we apply the nerve center test,which locates the corporation principal place of business in the state where the majority of its executive and administrative functions are performed.id.
determining whether a substantial predominance of a corporation operations take place in a given state plainly requires a comparison of that corporation business activity in the state at issue to its business activity in other individual states.id.we employ a number of factors to determine if a given state contains a substantial predominance of corporate activity,including the location of employees,tangible property,production activities,sources of income,and where sales take place.id.substantial predominance does not require the majority of the corporation operations to occur in a single state,but the corporation activity in one state must be substantially larger than the corporation activity in any other state.id.
applying this standard,the district court concluded best buy stores had a substantial predominance of its activities in california.best buy stores has more stores in california than in any other state,more employees in california than in any other state,and more sales in california than in any other state.as the district court explained,california has more stores,more employees,and more sales than texas,the second highest state.
the substantial predominance test does not require that a majority of corporate operations occur in a single state.but the test requires a substantial predominance,not mere predominance.in tosco,for example,we held that a gasoline manufacturer and retailer was a citizen of california when of its employees,nearly of its refining capacity,half its lubricant blending facilities,of its retail locations,of its convenience stores,and of its inventories were located in california.at.in that case,the defendant also had management operations in california and,in previous litigation,had maintained that it was a citizen of california.id.at.tosco operations reflected not only that it had more operations in california than in any other state,but that it had substantially more operations.
accordingly,we have stated that when a corporation has operations spread across many states,the nerve center test is usually the correct approach.breitman may,cir may company has corporate operations in over thirty states.because no one state contains a substantial predominance of the corporation business activities,the place of operations test inappropriate.industrial tectonics,at iti operations are divided between only two states california and michigan.iti operations are not so spread out that one must look to the corporate headquarters to find a principal place of business.when a corporation activities are spread over many states,it is much less likely operations in any one state will substantially predominate over operations in other states.
we have not previously given precise definition to the meaning of the term substantially in the substantial predominance test.we do not here adopt any hard and fast rule or percentage by which the operations in one state must exceed those in other states.but in determining whether a corporation operations substantially predominate,we must take into consideration both the nature of the corporation business activities and the purposes of the corporate citizenship statute.the purpose of diversity jurisdiction,and the citizenship determinations associated with it,is to avoid the effects of prejudice against outsiders.industrial tectonics,at.thus,the term substantially must be defined with an eye to ensuring that a corporation is a citizen of the place in which it is least likely to suffer prejudice.see id.
it is clear that best buy stores california operations predominate over its operations in other states.but we can not say that these operations substantially predominate over best buy stores operations in other states.best buy stores is a nationwide retailer with stores in states,the district of columbia,and puerto rico.at most,the statistics demonstrate that best buy stores california retail activities roughly reflect california larger population.if a corporation may be deemed a citizen of california on this basis,nearly every national matter how far flung its be deemed a citizen of california for diversity purposes.such a result is untenable.with operations distributed widely across the country,best buy stores is no more familiar to californians than it is to texans or illinoisans,and hence no less likely to suffer prejudice in california than elsewhere 
we do not require that courts apply a per capita approach to determining a corporation principal place of business in every case.however,we hold that a nationwide retailer with operations spread across many states will be a citizen of california only when a substantial predominance of its activities are located in california it will not be a citizen of california merely because its operations in california cater to california larger population.
accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
reversed and remanded 
i concur in the result.my reasoning is somewhat different.
the majority opinion extends tosco communities for a better environment beyond its facts.in my view,tosco was overwritten,and i would confine it to its facts.in tosco,an oil company was suing an environmental advocacy group for defamation and related torts,and claimed to be a citizen of connecticut in order to get diversity jurisdiction we affirmed a district court decision,which held that the oil company had its principal place of business in california,and adopted as our own the district court decision,rather than writing a decision independently the most striking fact in the case,more than the difference in percentage of refineries,gas stations and employees between one state and another,is that tosco had itself successfully claimed in previous litigation that its principal place of business was california all that the district court and we had to decide in tosco was whether some corporate changes in the three years between the two lawsuits changed the oil company citizenship.the corporate changes did not amount to enough to change its citizenship.a district court decision often includes,quite properly,multiple reasons for affirmance,but an appellate decision has different purposes.we should have picked the best reason,that tosco was still a citizen of the state where three years earlier it successfully claimed to be one.since we did not,we must struggle with tosco and follow it if it applies,but i think we could confine tosco to its facts and distinguish it.
we held in industrial tectonics,aero alloy that the a corporation principal place of business is where a majority of a corporation business activity takes place in one state.tosco says the opposite,that the principal of business does not require the majority of a corporation total business activities to be located in one single state,but instead,requires only that the amount of the corporation business activity in one state be significantly larger than any other state in which the corporation conducts business.without the per capita qualification the majority articulates,that means that the principal place of business of most national corporations would be in the most populous state,california.even with it,this approach makes the wrong comparison,largest to state,instead of the right one,state to everywhere the business operates,to determine principal place of business by the place of operations test.
comparing one state to another unreasonably lends itself to designating a principal place of business with the place of operations test when the nerve center test ought to be used.there is no reason why the burden of proof should be on the party urging use of the nerve center test,or why the place of operations test ought to be the default for a national corporation,the opposite presumption makes more sense.the seventh circuit uses only the nerve center test there can only be one principal place of business,and for a corporation that operates in multiple states principal does not merely mean the state with more of some activities than any other individual state.comparison,as suggested in tosco and followed by the majority,only assures identification of the state that has substantially more than the state it is compared to.identification by this comparison of the state that substantially predominates for the entire corporation which,as principal suggests,is what we are trying to identify will have little to do with the correctness of the methodology,and more to do with fortuity.rather than limiting application of what is plainly the wrong test for national corporations the place of operations test,the majority opinion extends tosco.this extension generates excessive unpredictability and encourages expensive litigation to identify the principal place of business for corporations that operate in multiple states.one great appeal of the nerve center test is that it is generally faster,more certain,and cheaper to apply than the place of operations test.
plaintiff gary davis sued best buy and hsbc,the bank that issues the best buy credit card,in the superior court of the state of california.the complaint claims that best buy and hsbc defrauded their california customers by offering them credit cards without adequately disclosing the annual fee they would be charged.the case was brought as a class action,on behalf of all californians who obtained the credit card and were charged a fee.the defendants removed the case to the united states district court pursuant to b a provision of the class action fairness act of 
all that matters on appeal is whether best buy is a citizen of the state of california.there are actually two best buy defendants in this case,a corporation that is a holding company,and a limited partnership that owns and operates the national chain of best buy retail stores.the parties do not put at issue the holding company minnesota citizenship.they dispute only whether the limited partnership is a citizen of california the limited partnership operates retail stores in of the states,plus puerto rico and the district of columbia.the stores sell consumer electronics such as television sets and computers,video games,dvds,cameras,and home appliances.
generally,a company is a citizen of at most two states,the state of incorporation for corporations or state of organization for unincorporated associations and the state where it has its principal place of business.since best buy is organized under the laws of virginia and is therefore a citizen of virginia,the only issue is whether its principal place of business is california the argument for california citizenship is basically that best buy operates more stores,employs more people,and sells more goods in california than in any other state.all of this is true.the argument against is basically that california is only a small part of best buy national operations,sales,and workforce,and its national locus of decision making is in minnesota.this is also true.
there can be only one principal place of business for diversity purposes,which of course is what the word principal implies best buy has about of stores,of sales and of employees in california,compared with about of stores,and of both sales and employees in its active state texas.this works out to be roughly more stores,more sales,and more employees than texas.though its california business greatly exceeds its texas business,best buy does to of its business and has all of its central management outside of california.principal,the statutory term,means principal for the corporation entire business,not more than any other single state.
under our precedents,we use the place of operations test to determine a corporation principal place of business if and only if one state has a substantial predominance of the corporation business activities if no state has a substantial predominance we use the nerve center test to determine that corporation principal place of business.our sister circuits generally apply some combination of the nerve center the corporate activities or place of operations and the total activity tests despite varying verbal formulas,their approaches generally amount to about the same thing as industrial tectonics,tosco,and this separate opinion 
industrial tectonics and tosco 
in industrial tectonics,aero alloy the corporation business activities were located in just two states,california and michigan.we concluded that california was the corporation principal place of business for the purpose of diversity jurisdiction,after noting that california accounted for of sales,of operating income,of receivables,and the location of of its inventory the california plant also had nearly double the book value of the corporation only other plant in michigan,and employed more than of the corporation employees thus,by every measure,well over half of the corporation business activities were in california.we held that where a majority of a corporation business takes place in one state,that state is the corporation principal place of business,even if the corporate headquarters are located in a different state.we did not apply the nerve center test because california contained a substantial predominance of the corporation business activities our approach in industrial tectonics was consistent with our prior decisions,in which corporations with substantially all of their one and only business activity in a single state were found to have their principal place of business in that one state where all the operations were located 
in tosco communities for a better environment we held that the place of operations test determines a corporation principal place of business when a corporation conducts a substantial predominance of its business within a state.the emphasis in tosco on substantial predominance,rather than majority,as in industrial tectonics,arose because the corporation business activities in tosco were more complex than in industrial tectonics.according to the district court opinion we adopted,tosco refinery business had a majority of its refineries,half of its lubricant blending and packaging facilities,and almost half of its refining capacity in california,but only about a third of its retail locations and inventory.california had more than twice the number of retail locations of any other state thus,in tosco we applied the substantial predominance inquiry mentioned but not used in industrial tectonics to analyze a corporation operating in more than two states,with the majority of its most important business factor refineries,since tosco was an oil company and of the important and production facilities were in california.at least on the facts considered in tosco,we concluded that a majority of each and every corporate activity was not required to establish a substantial predominance.
neither industrial tectonics nor tosco addressed companies with no majority of any activity in one state.tosco was in the business of making and selling products,and industrial tectonics was in the business of making ball bearings.both performed these activities largely in california,where the bulk of their production facilities were located.best buy does not conduct any of its activities largely in california.though tosco says,perhaps in dicta,that a majority of the corporation total activities are not necessary tosco did in fact maintain a majority of its refineries in california,we have never said what substantial predominance requires when no state had a majority of any activity.
under tosco and industrial tectonics,application of the place of operations test requires substantial predominance of the corporation activities in one state substantial predominance itself requires two things,both that activities in one state predominate,and also that this predominance be substantial.
ii.predominance 
the term predominance invites arithmetic,but not merely arithmetic.judgment is necessary to decide which numbers matter.
in this case,the district court considered that best buy generates most of its net sales,roughly,in california and of its net sales in texas,the productive state.taking the difference,it calculated that california accounted for more business than texas.based on the difference between california the highest state and texas the state,it concluded that california had a substantial predominance of best buy sales.the court applied similar arithmetic,with similar results,to the number of best buy employees and stores in california.based on these percentages of percentages,it concluded that california was best buy principal place of business.
it is error to determine predominance merely by comparing one state to another.principal place of business means principal place of business for the entire company.that may be the whole country for a nationwide business,and all of the states with its operations for a business.in the context of determining a corporation principal place of business,predominance should be judged against the corporation entire operations,not merely by a comparison of the two highest states.for best buy,determining predominance requires comparing its california business to the other states,puerto rico,and the district of columbia.
a comparison between the two highest states can not tell us whether the highest state has a substantial predominance because it tells us only how one state compares to another,not whether any state so predominates that it is reasonable to call a company a citizen of that one state.if a retailer has operations in all the states proportional to population,and we determine predominance just by taking the difference between the two highest states,california would be the principal place of business for virtually every corporation because of its larger population.because a comparison between the two highest states tells us nothing about whether the highest state predominates for the entire corporation which is what matters,the comparison can not tell us enough about substantial predominance to yield the principal place of business.
determining predominance by comparing the operations in one state to the corporation national operations is consistent with what the court actually did in tosco,even though the words can be read to say we should do what the district court did in this case.in tosco,we said that substantially predominates requires a comparison of that corporation business activity in the state at issue to its business activity in other individual states.we applied this verbal formulation by calculating what percentage of tosco total,national operations occurred in california it was based on this percentage of tosco entire operations that the district court found california to predominate and that predominance to be substantial 
a hypothetical case illustrates why looking at the difference between states fails to determine the principal place of business.suppose a craft bourbon distillery,mostly discovered by tourists who arrange shipments home,ships case of bourbon to each of the states,except for alaska,where a pair of tourists each ordered a case.the distillery sells twice as much bourbon to alaska as to any other state,but alaska only accounts for about of its total sales.although alaska greatly predominates when compared to any other individual state cases to,it does not predominate in a relevant way,because is not close to a majority of total sales.to say that alaska is the principal place of business and citizenship of this distillery,when none of its employees have even taken a cruise there,and all of its manufacturing facilities and of its sales occur elsewhere,would be a little silly.yet under a analysis,we would look only at the difference between the two highest states by subtracting the sales in the state case from the sales in alaska cases,and then dividing by the sales in the state case.by this calculation more sales occur in alaska than any other state,so we would erroneously conclude that alaska substantially predominates and is therefore the distillery principal place of business and citizenship.
in order to calculate a useful percentage,one has to pick the numerator and denominator with a view towards what matters.using the state as a denominator has only a slight bearing on what matters,substantial predominance of the business entire operations.to determine whether operations in a state predominate,the proper numerator is business occurring in the state and the proper denominator is all the corporation business net sales,tangible property,personnel,production facilities,and other factors may be helpful for determining whether a state is the principal place of business.whatever the indicia are,the point of looking at them is to determine what state,if any,predominates relative to everywhere the corporation operates,not simply where the corporation has the most activities.
thus,if a retail company has sales of in california,in nevada,and in oregon,the relevant arithmetic is not,which only tells us that more sales occur in california than the state.it is,which is california percentage of,the company total sales nationally.although both calculations tell us that california predominates in sales,only the latter provides a basis for concluding that california is the principal place of business because it is the only one that compares california operations to the company total operations in all states.the former calculation only shows how much more activity occurs in the highest state than the state,which tells us nothing about whether any state has a predominance of its national operations.
if this retail company also had operations in washington,and its sales were in california,in nevada,in oregon,and in washington,the first way looking at the difference between states yields the wrong answer.it shows a predominance by california in total sales,while the correct calculation suggests california does not predominate as to sales,because it only accounts for of total sales.the figure,which corresponds to california predominance over nevada,is of little use in determining the principal place of business for this regional corporation.
to determine whether best buy california operations predominate,the relevant comparison is between the percentage of best buy total operations in california and the percentage occurring elsewhere,not merely to the state texas.for factors such as sales,employees,and stores,the numerator is the amount of sales,number of employees,and number of stores in california.the corresponding denominators are the total sales,total number of employees,and total number of stores for the entirety of best buy operations.
as the majority says diversity jurisdiction enables citizens of states a better chance of avoiding local prejudice.there is more to it,though,than avoiding the sort of prejudice southerners might have had a half century or a century ago toward yankees.jurors may have no prejudice at all against citizens and corporations of other states,but still have a financial incentive to import their money.this incentive is especially strong when the corporate pockets are deep and the loss will not affect local employment.that may have been one of the reasons why congress modified diversity jurisdiction in the class action fairness act diversity protects against deep pocket justice as one form of prejudice.
iii.substantiality 
finding a state that predominates nationally does not suffice to establish the corporation principal place of business.the predominance,under industrial tectonics and tosco,must also be substantial.substantial does not mean just more than any other state.like predominance,substantiality is judged by comparing the putative principal place of business to the rest of the corporation activities the totality of corporate activity,not just one or several components of that activity,must be substantial at the corporation principal place of business thus,in tosco we held that the corporation california operations were substantial because it had the majority of the corporation most important activity,its refineries,and of the important and related production facilities in california.in tosco no other state had comparable percentages of the other factors had of total refining capacity,and of all retail locations although california did not have a majority of every factor,california predominance in tosco was substantial because it had a majority of one of them,and the other factors percentages were close to a majority and significantly larger than the percentages in any other state 
there are four reasons why substantiality is essential for proper application of the substantial predominance test.first,if mere predominance sufficed,no matter how slight,then a corporation principal place of business might change from year to year,or month to month,based on the routine vicissitudes of commerce.second,requiring a finding of mere predominance,rather than substantial predominance,would make it likely that district and circuit courts in multiple circuits might locate a corporation principal place of business in different states,even though each corporation can have only one third,a simple predominance test would result in california being the principal place of business for nearly every national retailer by virtue of its larger population.fourth,a slight predominance standard would just encourage expensive and fundamentally wasteful discovery,motions practice,and appeals not even focused on whether or to what extent the defendant wronged the plaintiff,but instead on where a lawsuit about those matters ought to be conducted.litigation is more than burdensome enough without adding a trial to decide where to have the trial.
the substantiality inquiry will not necessarily pinpoint a state in which a corporation business activities substantially predominate so that it is the principal place of business.the substantiality requirement should actually help identify when,despite a predominance,the place of operations test is nevertheless inappropriate because the corporation activities are not overwhelmingly concentrated in one place.as we explained in tosco,predominance is not necessarily substantial if other states have comparable concentrations of the corporations business activity assuming a hypothetical business with of its total activities in california,in nevada and in oregon has a predominance in california,we might still conclude that this predominance was not substantial because nevada has a comparable percentage of the corporation total activities and less than half of its activities are in california 
to assess whether two states are comparable,i would not depend on per capita analysis as the majority does.dividing the amount of a business factor in a state by its population,or vice versa and thus finding amount of sales per person or number of people per store at most identifies cases where the activity in a state is disproportionate to population.but disproportionateness on a per capita basis can arise for reasons having nothing to do with a state being the corporation principal place of business.
consider a hunting and fishing outfitter with lodge in every state except wyoming,where it has.per capita,then,wyoming is the highest state with lodge per people.the state has lodge per people.on a per capita basis,the majority comparison leads to the conclusion that the outfitter physical operations in wyoming do predominate and that this predominance is substantial.but just as it was for the bourbon distillery,this conclusion makes little sense.it is just silly to call wyoming the principal place of business for a company when of its employees have never set foot in yellowstone,and of its physical facilities and central reservation office are located elsewhere.a per capita analysis only tells us when a state has more or less of a given factor than other states.it does not tell us anything about what really matters,which is whether any state predominates for the entire corporation.
many products appeal to specialized audiences,so that sales are disproportionately in a few states.for example,porsches doubtless sell better to rich people,so richer states have disproportionately more porsches,even with a per capita correction.is porsche principal place of business california,connecticut,or washington,just because more people in those places than in,say south dakota or west virginia,can afford porsches because car battery blankets,oil pan heaters,and circulating heaters sell disproportionately in fairbanks,is alaska the principal place of business for the outside companies that make them not by a sensible attribution of citizenship.
because the place of operations test is only appropriate for corporations that are truly concentrated in one place,courts should not struggle with mathematical gyrations to determine whether a predominance is substantial.where predominance is not substantial enough to be pellucid,the nerve center test applies only if the totality of corporate activity in a given place m ay be said to represent the center of gravity of corporate function is the substantiality requirement met 
the nerve center test determines a corporation principal place of business by looking to where its executive and administrative functions are performed.in short,courts generally assign greater importance to the corporate headquarters when no state is clearly the center of corporate activity,and assign greater importance to the location of corporate business when substantially all business operations take place in a single state.in industrial tectonics,we held that because a majority of the corporation business activity took place in one state,that state was its principal place of business,even though the corporate headquarters were located in a different state when no state has a substantial predominance of the corporation total activities,we apply the nerve center test to determine the principal place of business.
iv.best buy 
to determine if best buy has its principal place of business in california,we look at whether california contains a substantial predominance of best buy business activities.best buy business activities consist of its chain of best buy retail stores that sell movies,music,and electronics in states,puerto rico,and the district of columbia.there are
