the housing authority of the city of los angeles appeals from the judgment following a jury trial in favor of its former employee,ada cordero sacks.we affirm the judgment as modified.
facts and proceedings 
applying the usual rules of appellate review,we state the evidence in the light most favorable to the judgment.mammoth lakes land acquisition,llc town of mammoth lakes th.appellant is the housing authority of the city of los angeles the authority.respondent is ada cordero sacks,a licensed attorney hired in october to work in the authority office of internal control.the office of internal control investigates internal misconduct and fraud within the authority.
for reasons not pertinent to this appeal,in the director of the authority technical services department,victor taracena,fell under suspicion that he was awarding contracts to unqualified corporations that he had secretly set up with family members.the contracts were for retrofitting public housing to bring the housing into compliance with accessibility laws for the disabled.in may,rudolf montiel,who was the authority president and chief executive officer,authorized the office of internal control oic to investigate taracena.oic quickly discovered taracena had steered over in the authority contracts to corporations his family controlled.
during oic investigation of taracena,information surfaced that may have suggested the authority president montiel was involved in taracena fraud.one seemingly incriminating,but eventually debunked,link between montiel and taracena was the fact that montiel brother was related by marriage to a man named gustavo valdiva,which was the name of one of taracena accomplices.as part of oic investigation,cordero sacks in august conducted an search of montiel relative using the choicepoint commercial database.a key factual dispute in the case,which the jury resolved against appellant authority,is whether montiel authorized oic to investigate himself as part of the taracena investigation the jury implicitly found he did.eventually,oic established that the relative and taracena accomplice were different men.
about six weeks later,on october,the authority fired cordero sacks.at the time of her discharge,the authority did not tell cordero sacks why it was terminating her.her notice of discharge merely stated she was being separated from her position.in february,cordero sacks filed her complaint for wrongful termination the complaint asserted that the authority fired cordero sacks because she had participated in investigating taracena misuse of the authority funds.the complaint alleged a cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of public policy.it also alleged a cause of action for violation of the statutory prohibition against retaliatory discharge in california false claims act.the retaliatory discharge provision of the false claims act states no employer shall discharge an employee because of lawful acts done by the employee on behalf of the employee or others in disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency or in furthering a false claims action,including investigation for,initiation of,testimony for,or assistance in,an action filed or to be filed under the false claims act,subd.b.
during pretrial discovery,the authority stated it terminated cordero sacks for three reasons.first,she conducted the choicepoint search of montiel relative without montiel approval a claim which we have noted the jury implicitly rejected.second,she had been sanctioned in august by the superior court in an authority lawsuit she was overseeing when she missed a court deadline in the lawsuit,resulting in its dismissal.the court reinstated the lawsuit after cordero sacks paid the sanction and filed a motion under code of civil procedure section admitting her negligence.and third,she had not told the los angeles city attorney office,which is the authority general counsel,about the sanction.
the trial court granted in part and denied in part the authority motion for summary judgment and adjudication.the court granted summary adjudication of cordero sacks cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of public policy a tameny claim because that cause of action can not lie against a public entity.miklosy regents of university of california cal th.the court rejected,however,the authority assertion that cordero sacks duty to maintain the confidentiality of her communications with authority personnel made it impossible for her to prove the authority unlawfully discharged her.hence,cordero sacks single cause of action for retaliatory discharge under the false claims act was tried to a jury,which issued a special verdict in her favor.the thrust of the jury findings was that cordero sacks acted lawfully when she conducted the choicepoint searches in furtherance of a false claims action,and the authority would not have fired her but for those searches.the jury awarded cordero sacks in past economic damages,in future economic losses,and in past noneconomic loss this appeal followed.
discussion 
cordero sacks sued the authority for retaliatory discharge 
cordero sacks sued the authority under the false claims act.et the false claims act prohibits a person from defrauding the government of money,property,or services by submitting to the government a false or fraudulent claim for payment.section of the act allows for treble damages against a person who submits such a claim,subd.a.the authority contends we must reverse the judgment because,as a governmental entity,the authority is not a person under the act,which defines a person as any natural person,corporation,firm,association,organization,partnership,limited liability company,business,or trust,subd.b.the definition does not include governmental agencies,a point affirmed by our supreme court in wells learning foundation cal th.in a case involving a lawsuit against a school district that supposedly defrauded the state of california,wells stated governmental agencies may not be sued under california false claims statute.wells at accord state ex rel.dockstader hamby th,may not circumvent bar against suing governmental agency for filing a false claim by suing the agency employee because agency duty to indemnify employee makes suit against employee tantamount to a suit against the agency.the authority is thus correct it is not a person from which cordero sacks may recover money for the authority making a false claim cordero sacks judgment rests,however,on the authority liability as an employer under the false claims act prohibition against retaliatory discharge,a provision to which we now turn.
the false claims act bans retaliatory discharge in section,which speaks not of a person being liable for defrauding the government,but of an employer who retaliates against an employee who assists in the investigation or pursuit of a false claim.section has been characterized as the whistleblower protection provision of the false claims act and is construed broadly.kaye board of trustees of san diego county public law library th.the section states no employer shall discharge an employee because of lawful acts done by the employee on behalf of the employee or others in furthering a false claims action,including investigation for,or assistance in,an action filed or to be filed under the false claims act,subd.b.
the authority contends we should interpret the term employer in the retaliatory discharge provision as a subset of a person who can be liable for making a false claim,so that only employers who are persons can be liable for retaliatory discharge.the authority interpretation is unconvincing for several reasons.first,it violates the principle of statutory construction that different words used in the same statute mean different things.people albillar cal th,watsonville pilots ass city of watsonville th.the legislature presumably intended to target different malefactors when it used the word person in section allowing treble damages against a person who tries to defraud the government with a false claim,compared to its use of the word employer in section prohibiting retaliation against an employee.because the injury the government suffers from a false claim differs from the injury an employee suffers from retaliatory discharge,it stands to reason that the party subject to liability a person who defrauds the government versus an employer who retaliates against an employee need not overlap.
case law supports observing a distinction between person and employer.in fassberg construction housing authority of city of los angeles th,the court discussion of a city housing authority ability to collect damages coincidentally the very same authority before us in this appeal distinguished between a person under the damages provision and an employer under the retaliatory discharge provision because they involved different sections of the false claims act.fassberg at.and it is instructive that federal courts applying the federal false claims act,which is analogous to california false claims act,also distinguish between a person and an employer.fassberg at the california false claims act is patterned after the federal false claims act so authorities applying the federal act may be persuasive to the extent the language of the two acts is similar.in ex rel.satalich city of los angeles d satalich,the district court found that even though a city was not a person which could be liable under federal law for submitting a false claim,the city was an employer potentially liable for retaliatory discharge and in wilkins louis housing authority cir,the court of appeals adopted satalich reasoning and held that even though a public housing authority was not a person subject to false claims liability,it could be an employer liable for retaliation.wilkins at.
in support of affixing the meaning of person to the definition of employer,the authority notes that wells learning foundation overruled a related pair of cases which had held a governmental agency was a person under the false claims act.levine weis th and levine weis th overruled by wells learning foundation,supra,cal th at.in the levine cases,a governmental agency argued liability for retaliatory discharge attached only if the false claims act protected the employee conduct in reporting a false claim.levine,supra,th at levine,supra,th at.in overruling levine,the wells court held a governmental agency was not a person.wells stated w e conclude the legislature did not intend to subject financially constrained governmental agencies to the provisions of the false claims act.we conclude that such entities are not persons subject to suit under that statute.we disapprove the two decisions in levine weis to the extent they hold otherwise.wells at.wells did not discuss whether a governmental agency was an employer subject to liability for retaliatory discharge.it therefore offers the authority little help.
the authority also argues the retaliatory discharge provision did not apply because cordero sacks did not conduct her choicepoint searches to investigate or pursue a qui tam action.the authority contends the false claims act protected cordero sacks from retaliation only if cordero sacks were acting for herself or another as a potential or actual qui tam plaintiff when she conducted the choicepoint searches.instead,according to the authority,cordero sacks was by her own description properly discharging her normal job duties ferreting out fraud when she conducted the searches.thus,the authority concludes,the false claims act did not apply.the authority is mistaken because the acts retaliation provision applies not only to qui tam actions but to false claims in general.section makes it unlawful for an employer to retaliate against an employee who is engaged in furthering a false claims action,including investigation for,initiation of,testimony for,or assistance in,an action filed or to be filed under section.section permits the attorney general on behalf of the state of california,the local prosecuting authority on behalf of a state political subdivision,and private parties as qui tam plaintiffs,to sue defendants who submit false claims to the state or a political subdivision.our supreme courts decision in state ex rel.harris pricewaterhousecoopers,llp cal th,describes the statutory division of labor into which a qui tam action falls the false claims act specifies in detail who may bring and prosecute actions under that statute,depending on whether state or political subdivision funds are involved.if state funds are involved,the attorney general may bring the action.citation.if political subdivision funds are involved,the action may be brought by the political subdivision prosecuting authority citation,the county counsel,city attorney,or other local government official charged with investigating,filing,and conducting civil legal proceedings on behalf of,or in the name of,the particular political subdivision.there is,however,a third category of eligible plaintiffs under the false claims act.a person with independent knowledge of the facts,who gets to the courthouse first,may bring a qui tam action for and in the name of the state if state funds are involved,or a political subdivision where the political subdivision funds are involved,or both.harris,at,italics added.
under the foregoing division of labor,cordero sacks need not have been pursuing a qui tam action when she conducted the choicepoint searches.the italicized language demonstrates it was sufficient that she was investigating victor taracena for what might have been the authority false claim action accord kaye board of trustees of san diego county public law library,supra,th at generally,to constitute protected activity under the false claims act,the employee conduct must be in furtherance of a false claims action.the employee does not have to file a false claims action or show a false claim was actually made however it must be reasonably possible for the employee conduct to lead to a false claims action.
in the same vein of cordero sackss retaliation claim purportedly not being grounded in a viable qui tam action,the authority asserts cordero sacks conducted her choicepoint searches after the authority had referred taracenas case to the los angeles county district attorney for possible prosecution.according to the authority,once it referred the matter in june to the district attorney,no further justification existed for cordero sacks to continue her investigation.furthermore,according to the authority,the false claims act provides that a governmental agency employee such as cordero sacks may pursue a false claims action only if the employee exhausts the agency chain of command for reporting and investigating false claims and the agency fails to act on the reported information.the authority cites section,subdivision d,which states no court shall have jurisdiction over an action brought under subdivision c based upon information discovered by a present or former employee of the state or a political subdivision during the course of his or her employment unless that employee first,in good faith,exhausted existing internal procedures for reporting and seeking recovery of the falsely claimed sums through official channels and unless the state or political subdivision failed to act on the information provided within a reasonable period of time.italics added.the authoritys referral of taracena to the district attorney shows that the authority did not fail to act on its information that taracena had submitted false claims to the authority.but the authoritys reliance on the requirement that the authority have ignored information about taracena false claim is nevertheless unavailing because that requirement by its own terms applies only to subdivision c which govern the pursuit of a false claims action by a qui tam plaintiff no court shall have jurisdiction over an action brought under subdivision c see,subd.c a person may bring a civil action for a violation of this article for the person and either for the state of california in the name of the state,if any state funds are involved,or for a political subdivision in the name of the political subdivision,if political subdivision funds are exclusively involved.the person bringing the action shall be referred to as the qui tam plaintiff.as we have observed,cordero sacks was not a qui tam plaintiff,and the requirement that the agency have ignored information about the false claim does not refer to the section prohibiting retaliatory discharge under which cordero sacks sued,section.
nondisclosure of attorney client confidences 
the authority notes that an attorney such as cordero sacks ordinarily may not pursue a retaliatory discharge claim against her former employer if doing so divulges confidences.general dynamics superior court cal th,general dynamics solin omelveny myers th,see also.attorney duty of confidentiality supersedes whistleblower protection for attorney.the gravamen of cordero sacks claim is that the authority fired her for her choicepoint searches of gustavo valdiva,who was related by marriage to the authoritys president,rudolf montiel.the authority contends cordero sacks tried to prove retaliatory discharge by wrongfully disclosing at trial confidential information that she had acquired as an attorney in the authoritys oic.the authority does not,however,identify the confidences cordero sacks purportedly disclosed.moreover,the trial court had granted the authoritys pretrial motion in limine to exclude from evidence communications among cordero sacks,authority personnel,and the los angeles city attorneys office.the authority pays little heed to the court consistent enforcement of its order excluding communications during cordero sacks testimony,when the authority successfully objected about a dozen times to questions that sought to invade the privilege.as the trial court later noted,it sustained every single objection that was made.the court reminded counsel that i believe i sustained every single objection that the authority made.cordero sacks counsel every one.court.every single one there were a couple there where the witness blurted out something that had been restricted by motion in limine,but the minute they were halfway through it,there was an objection,i sustained it.so then i believe i instructed the jury to disregard it.
the authoritys contention is at bottom an argument about sufficiency of the evidence.take away the confidential information,the authority contends,and cordero sackss retaliatory discharge claim fails for lack of proof.the logic of the authoritys contention compels the authority,as the party challenging the courts judgment,to identify the errors the court made in receiving inadmissible evidence,and to parse the supposedly confidential information from the nonconfidential information in order to demonstrate how the nonconfidential information is insufficient to support the judgment.grassilli barr th.the authority does not attempt that demonstration.indeed,the authority indirectly concedes it has not done so in its reply brief,where it states although cordero sacks argues that she made out her government code section claim for retaliatory discharge without privileged information,the court will never know if that is true because of the undisciplined manner in which she approached trial and presented her case before the jury.in fact,the reason this court will never know is that the authority,as the appellant challenging the courts judgment,does not identify the nonconfidential evidence stripped of confidential information and show how the nonconfidential information was insufficient.the authoritys failure to satisfy its obligation results in its contentions failure.
the authority alternatively contends we must reverse the judgment because the trial court did not insist cordero sacks make a pretrial offer of proof showing she could prove retaliatory discharge using only nonconfidential information.in support,the authority reads general dynamics to require the trial court to determine in the first instance whether some statute or ethical rule specifically permitted cordero sacks to divulge confidences as she pursued her claim against the authority.according to the authority,a pretrial proceeding outside the jurys presence would have had the salutary effect of saving the authority from needing to object in front of the jury to protect confidences.the authority reasons that forcing it repeatedly to object in the jurys presence as if the authority were trying to hide something,in a case involving alleged concealment of wrongdoing and whistleblowing,risked tainting the authority in jurors eyes.
the authoritys reliance on general dynamics to compel the trial court to put cordero sacks to the test of a pretrial offer of proof falls short,however,because general dynamics reviewed a demurrer sustained without leave to amend.in its discussion,general dynamics noted that eventually during the course of the lawsuit an attorney claiming wrongful discharge must show she can prove her case without divulging confidences,or show that confidentiality has been waived.general dynamics,supra,cal th at.general dynamics did not,however,describe any particular proceeding the trial court must employ in putting the attorney to that showing,and the authority cites no published decisions describing any such proceeding.in the absence of such authority,the trial court resort to the procedures employed here to protect the authoritys privileged information granting the authoritys motion in limine and sustaining the authoritys trial objections was sufficient to ensure the jury decided the case based on nonconfidential information,and thus was not error.we see no reason to create a special offer of proof procedure only in retaliatory discharge cases that might involve confidential information.see general dynamics,supra,trial courts can and should apply an array of ad hoc measures from their equitable arsenal designed to permit the attorney plaintiff to attempt to make the necessary proof while protecting from disclosure client confidences subject to the privilege.the use of sealing and protective orders,limited admissibility of evidence,orders restricting the use of testimony in successive proceedings,and,where appropriate,in camera proceedings,are but some of a number of measures that might usefully be explored.
evidence of job performance 
during discovery,the authority identified three reasons why it terminated cordero sacks her purportedly unauthorized choicepoint searches her trial court sanction and,her failure to tell the city attorneys office about the sanction.when cordero sacks inquired during discovery about the authoritys discussions with the city attorneys office about her job performance in working with city attorneys,the authority exercised its right to withhold that information on the grounds of privilege.the authoritys opening brief plainly states the authoritys invocation of the privilege.the brief states because these inquiries by cordero sacks directly sought evidence of privileged communications between the assistant city attorneys and their client the housing authority,the housing authority asserted privilege to prevent disclosure of what the agencys employees had been told by the city attorney.based on the authoritys assertion of the privilege,the trial court granted cordero sacks evidentiary motion barring the authority from offering evidence that the authority had withheld from discovery on the basis of the privilege.
despite the court ruling,the authority tried during trial to offer evidence that the reason it fired cordero sacks was the city attorney unhappiness with cordero sackss job performance.the authority first tried to offer the evidence through one of the authoritys managers,who testified one reason the authority fired cordero sacks was she didnt get along with the city attorney office.the court sustained cordero sackss objection to that testimony as hearsay.the authority then tried to offer evidence of the city attorneys dissatisfaction through the testimony of cordero sackss main contact with the city attorneys office,assistant city attorney michael custodio.the court excluded his testimony on the matter,however,because the authority had prevented cordero sacks from learning what the city attorneys office had told the authoritys decision makers about her job performance.
the authority contends the trial courts exclusion of evidence from the city attorneys office about cordero sackss job performance was error because it prevented the authority from showing it fired cordero sacks for poor job performance.we review the trial courts exclusion of evidence for abuse of discretion.people brady cal th,starrh and starrh cotton growers aera energy llc th.here,as the authority concedes,the authority asserted the privilege during discovery,resulting in cordero sacks not being able to learn what the city attorneys office had told the authority about her job performance.the court ruled that the authoritys successful invocation of the privilege barred the authority from using at trial evidence it had successfully withheld from discovery.the city attorney was not the decision maker in discharging cordero sacks the authoritys managers were the decision makers.the city attorneys assessment of cordero sackss job performance was relevant only to the extent the city attorney communicated that assessment to the authority.because the authority did not allow discovery of those communications,the court did not abuse its discretion in excluding those communications at trial.
mitigation of damages instructions 
the jury found by its special verdict that the authority did not prove that the steps cordero sacks took to mitigate her damages after she lost her job were unreasonable.after her discharge,cordero sacks applied for at least one government attorney job but did not get the position.she thereafter started her own law practice.by the time of trial,her practice was at best only moderately successful.she testified,its not going very good.when i got fired i didnt have any clients,but i have some clients now,and ive been making some money i have money coming in,but i also have money going out a lot of its going out and expenses.
the authority contends the court misinstructed the jury about cordero sacks duty to mitigate her damages.our supreme court articulation of a discharged employee duty to mitigate her damages,which we rely on to guide our analysis of the authoritys contention,is as follows the general rule is that the measure of recovery by a wrongfully discharged employee is the amount of salary agreed upon for the period of service,less the amount which the employer affirmatively proves the employee has earned or with reasonable effort might have earned from other employment.citations.however,before projected earnings from other employment opportunities not sought or accepted by the discharged employee can be applied in mitigation,the employer must show that the other employment was comparable,or substantially similar,to that of which the employee has been deprived the employee rejection of or failure to seek other available employment of a different or inferior kind may not be resorted to in order to mitigate damages.parker twentieth century fox film cal d.
the court instructed the jury with several form instructions.one instruction explained that cordero sacks had a duty to take work substantially similar to her position at the authority,but the authority had the burden of proving such work existed.see caci.two other instructions emphasized that the jury must reduce its award for cordero sackss past and future economic damages by the amount she could have earned if she had taken substantially similar available employment.see caci.the instruction explaining her duty to take substantially similar work stated the housing authority of the city of los angeles claims that if ada cordero sacks is entitled to any damages,they should be reduced by the amount that she could have earned from other employment.to succeed,the housing authority of the city of los angeles must prove all of the following that employment substantially similar to ada cordero sacks former job was available to her that ada cordero sacks failed to make reasonable efforts to seek this employment and the amount that ada cordero sacks could have earned from this employment.in deciding whether the employment was substantially similar,you should consider,among other factors,whether the nature of the work was different from ada cordero sacks employment with the housing authority of the city of los angeles the new position was substantially inferior to ada cordero sacks former position the salary,benefits,and hours of the job were similar to ada cordero sacks former job the new position required similar skills,background,and experience and the job responsibilities were similar.caci.
additionally,cordero sacks submitted the following instruction,which the court gave to the jury the employees rejection of or failure to seek other available employment of a different or inferior kind may not be resorted to in order to mitigate damages.substantially equivalent employment affords virtually identical promotional opportunities,compensation,job responsibilities,working conditions and status as the position from which cordero sacks has been terminated.the authority does not indicate that it objected to that instruction.
for its part,the authority offered the following instruction about cordero sackss duty to mitigate damages from her loss of employment and her decision to open her own practice in determining whether ada cordero sacks mitigated her damages by starting her own business,you must first determine whether cordero sacks was a reasonable alternative to finding other comparable employment.may not be reasonable where an employee could have obtained comparable employment but instead chose to become and as a result receive little or no income.additionally,an employee decision to become must remain reasonable for the entire time period.therefore,if the business is unprofitable,you may decide that cordero sacks should have resumed her search for other comparable employment in order to fulfill her obligation to mitigate her damages.if you find that cordero sacks decision to start her own business was unreasonable or that the decision to remain despite the business lack of profit was unreasonable,then you should find that cordero sacks failed to mitigate her damages and that the housing authority is relieved of any obligation to pay for cordero sacks lost earnings.if you find that cordero sacks decision to start her own business was reasonable and that her decision to remain despite the business lack of profit was reasonable,you should reduce the amount of the backpay award for lost earnings by the business profits,or,if none,by the reasonable value of cordero sacks services,including the future value of the business.
the trial court refused the authoritys proposed instruction.
the authority contends the courts error was.first,the court erred in instructing with cordero sackss instruction because it misstated the law.according to the authority,a replacement job need not be,as cordero sacks urged,virtually identical to trigger a discharged employees obligation to take the job under her duty to mitigate her damages.second,the courts rejection of the authoritys instruction permitted the jury to conclude cordero sackss acted reasonably in persisting with her own law practice even though it generated little income.
we review jury instructions as whole.cumbre,state comp.ins.fund th.we conclude that the courts instructions on cordero sackss duty to mitigate her damages,when taken as a whole,adequately informed the jury of cordero sackss obligation to mitigate her damages.first,the authority did not object to cordero sackss instruction,thus failing to preserve its point for appeal.second,the authoritys instruction,which the court refused,was infirm because it risked confusing the jury by telling jurors that they must first address the question of whether cordero sackss decision to open her own practice was reasonable in determining whether ada cordero sacks mitigated her damages by starting her own business,you must first determine whether cordero sacks was a reasonable alternative to finding other comparable employment.in fact,because mitigation is an affirmative defense,it was the authoritys burden to show that other employment opportunities were available to cordero sacks.candari los angeles unified school dist.th,as
