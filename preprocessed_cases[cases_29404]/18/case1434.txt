this case involves the california disabled veteran business enterprise dvbe program,within the department of general services department,designed to benefit qualified disabled veterans and their businesses by giving them preferences in state contracting.mil,et further unspecified section references are to this code.
daniel moody and niles freeman each had a contracting business,moody construction and niles freeman excavating nfx,respectively.moody is a qualified disabled veteran,but freeman is not.moody and freeman created a partnership,niles freeman enterprises nfe,certified as a dvbe by the department.freeman ran nfe,and derived most of its profits.
the department decertified nfe as a dvbe,after an administrative law judge alj upheld the department conclusion that nfe did not meet the definition of a dvbe.
the department later suspended plaintiffs nfe,moody,moody construction,freeman,and nfx from participating in any state contracts for three years.plaintiffs appealed and lost at an administrative hearing,except that the period of suspension was reduced to one year.all then filed this unsuccessful administrative mandamus petition to set aside the suspensions.
although the notice of appeal lists all plaintiffs,we previously granted the request of freeman and nfx to dismiss their appeal.we shall affirm the judgment as to nfe,daniel moody and moody construction collectively moody,except as context indicates.
standard of review 
the trial court concluded that the suspension order impacted fundamental rights and required application of the independent judgment standard of review.
we agree.depriving a contractor of the right to bid on a contract implicates a liberty interest.marvin lieblein,shewry th,d lieblein see also golden day schools,state of education th,d golden day stacy witbeck,city and county of san francisco th,d,fn.stacy.
on appeal,we review the trial court factual conclusions for substantial evidence and its legal conclusions de novo.see handyman connection of sacramento,sands th,d handyman.
background 
although we are reviewing the denial of a petition to overturn the suspension order,some of the issues raised on appeal relate to the decertification order.the facts found at the first administrative hearing provide a useful context,because the findings at the second hearing,although of more serious consequence,accord with the earlier findings.
statutory background 
the administering agency of the dvbe program is the department of general services,except in the case of contracts for professional bond services,subd.a.
generally,the department may certify an entity as a dvbe if it is owned at least percent by one or more disabled veterans and its daily business operations are managed by one or more disabled veterans,subd.b a.
this article includes language similar to that commencing with section of the public contract code and does not create an independent or additional goal or program.the referenced section encourages minority,women,and disabled veteran business enterprises in various ways,some challenged on theories not relevant herein.
the department has adopted regulations detailing aspects of the dvbe program,including eligibility.see,tit.
section,as amended in stats,ch,providing for civil,criminal and administrative penalties for violations of the dvbe program,is set out in the appendix.
decertification hearing 
on february,alj roman issued a written decision after an administrative hearing,and that decision and documents leading up to it generally establish the following.
daniel moody was a duly qualified disabled veteran and a licensed contractor with an existing business named moody construction.he made a partnership agreement with niles freeman to create nfe.this is a distinct entity from nfx,freeman separate business.
the partnership agreement states nfe was to be owned percent by moody and that nfe purpose was to create a dvbe entity.the partnership would provide firefighting services to the california department of forestry cdf.freeman applied for dvbe certification and the department certified nfe for a period.of generated by nfe contracts in,moody was paid and freeman was paid.
the department concluded that the partnership had failed to demonstrate moody managerial and operational control of the enterprise,and sought further information from the partnership.eventually,on october,the department sent nfe a letter,captioned dvbe intent to revoke,stating in part that it had determined nfe was not in compliance with specifically identified regulations defining a dvbe,based on facts summarized under each claimed area of noncompliance.
on october,nfe filed an administrative appeal.on tuesday,december,an attorney wrote to alj roman and stated that he had been retained that week to represent nfe at the hearing set for monday,december.the attorney sought a continuance based on calendar conflicts.alj roman denied the request,stating that the notice of hearing had been issued on november,and no good cause for the request was shown.
as duly scheduled,on december,a hearing was held at which evidence including the testimony of moody and freeman was taken.on appeal moody briefs emphasize isolated comments by alj roman at the hearing,portraying the proceeding as favorable.but alj roman written decision was unfavorable.we quote two significant passages 
what emerges from a review of the documentation and testimony provided herein by both the department and the partners is that nfe lacks any business equipment and the documentation necessary to establish moody as a qualifying disabled veteran for purposes of certification.despite protestations to the contrary,freemen,largely engaged in furthering the partnership,has a greater clarity on the business enterprise than moody.nfe has no distinct employees or work force except as provided by freeman subject to moody supervision,no materials except as largely provided by freeman and no discrete facilities except as provided by freeman.the manner in which nfe activities are candidly vetted by freemen determination of financial distribution to include compensation,notwithstanding the expressed terms of the partnership agreement or the partners protestations,when balanced with the partners actual conduct of nfe activities,functions to belie the partnership agreement import.simply put,moody renders no commercially useful function to nfe.
the partners,seeking to properly increase their business opportunities,fashioned a business entity that,on paper,commences with an investiture in moody of a interest.the business practice,at least with respect to financial capitalization has been,during the period of analysis.distribution of income has,however,favored freeman.further,it becomes abundantly clear that moody,in several respects,fails to meet the expressed regulatory provisions relating to both managerial and operational control of the business what the partners clearly created does not appear to be a partnership that would vest any degree of meaningful or qualifying control in moody but,instead,a joint venture for the limited purpose of gaining status by and through moody with its concomitant financial benefits.
alj roman upheld the department decertification of nfe,and no review of his decision was sought.
suspension hearing 
on march,the department sent freeman and moody written notice of its intent to suspend them,nfe,moody construction and nfx,from bidding on,or participating as either a contractor,subcontractor,or supplier in any state contract or project for years for violation of m vc section a,and.the gist of the claim was that nfe was a sham entity that subcontracted all of its cdf work to nfx,and the partners knowingly and with intent to defraud sought and obtained the dvbe certification,made knowingly false statements and obtained or attempted to obtain public moneys to which they were not entitled.
the notice alleged that freeman had been providing cdf equipment since as nfx,and continued to provide the same services through the shell of nfe once nfe was issued the dvbe certification.nearly percent of the income from cdf contracts with nfe went to nfx,and only about percent went to moody.moody construction,owned by moody,has dvbe certification,but does not own the type of equipment commonly needed by cdf,bulldozers and water trucks freeman owns bulldozers.therefore,the notice alleged,the only added benefit to moody as a partner of nfe was the receipt of percent of the profit on freeman equipment provided to cdf by nfe.
the notice,accompanied by voluminous exhibits,gave instructions on how to appeal the proposed suspension.a timely administrative appeal was filed.
after a prehearing conference on may,before alj hoover,occupying pages of transcript,he ordered briefing on issues including the department suspension authority.this prehearing order also states that any evidentiary hearing must comport with due process requirements as found in the general provisions in the administrative procedure act.in the interim,the alj has issued this order to permit the orderly preparation for hearing.this order provides for discovery to be completed by may,and sets out other hearing rules.at oral argument in the trial court,moody counsel incorrectly stated that this order merely addressed identifying exhibits and witnesses.
after both sides filed prehearing briefs,alj hoover conducted a second prehearing conference on june.conference moody counsel complained about the paucity of detail in the witness statements,particularly regarding witness bob sheehy,and alj hoover ordered the department to by the end of the day identify with specificity what sheehy is going to testify to and send that to miss doi moody counsel.department counsel yes.after determining that the department had no discovery complaints,alj hoover asked moody counsel okay.all right.so next,do you have any questions or anything that you want to raise doi no,your honor.
on july,plaintiffs filed this petition,which was stayed pending a final administrative decision.
alj frink conducted a hearing on august,and on november,found against plaintiffs,but reduced the penalty to a suspension,the maximum allowed by statute at the time of the offending conduct.
alj frink decision finds that freeman and moody created nfe with knowledge that freeman would run the business,although nominally moody would be the majority owner.freeman ran nfe and received most of its profits.the partners gave misleading responses when the department began investigating nfe dvbe eligibility,such as falsely stating that moody managed the business.
we will set out some of alj frink specific findings.
to comply with executive orders,cdf instituted a practice of giving a preference to dvbe vendors to supply emergency firefighting equipment,specifically bulldozers,water tenders,and fire engines.freeman or nfx owned bulldozers moody or his company owned no bulldozers,only excavators.they made a partnership agreement which allowed the partnership to buy equipment,but it did not buy any equipment.when nfe supplied equipment owned separately by either partner,that partner would get percent of the profit.
under the dvbe rules,and nominally under the partnership agreement,moody was to manage nfe.however,the partnership was named niles freeman equipment the address and contact numbers on the partnership agreement and dvbe application were the same as for nfx,although admittedly the physical location on the application was moody home address the federal employer identification number fein was the same as nfx the agreement states equipment operators will be provided by freeman,he would handle all payroll responsibilities and freeman,not moody,signed the application,with the notation,for dan moody.
because the employer id number,business address,and telephone numbers of freeman or nfx were used,the partners reasonably believed that all inquiries for work would be received by freeman.they falsely stated that moody was the primary individual responsible for handling financial transactions and agreements,when the parties knew that nfe had no separate bank accounts,that freeman was responsible for handling payroll responsibilities and hiring operators for equipment rentals,and that freeman would be entering into contracts for use of his equipment,which comprised the overwhelming majority of nfe anticipated business.
after a close review of specific cdf contracts and payments in and,alj frink concluded,there was no appreciable difference between freeman management and control of nfx and the conduct of business of nfe,as it pertained to cdf contracts.freeman exerted complete control over nfe contract services.moody did not exercise meaningful management and control of nfe business operations,except to receive a percentage of the proceeds from the projects.the one time cdf did contact nfe about an excavator,moody declined the job because his excavator was already in use.this is the only time nfe was contacted for the use of equipment owned by moody all other contacts were for bulldozers and transport vehicles owned by freeman,for which freeman made all utilization decisions.
in june,the partners responded in writing to a department inquiry.they stated moody managed the business,but all contracts nfe made were signed by freeman,and freeman handled all of nfe finances.they implied that freeman merely fielded telephone calls for nfe because it was hard to reach moody by cell phone,when in fact freeman made all decisions about bulldozers and support equipment,which were the only rentals actually engaged in by nfe.they made other false or misleading responses.
the partners also made false or misleading statements in a written response to a cdc inquiry.
in august,the department sent further questions to nfe,and the partners made further false or misleading replies,consistent with their earlier responses.
on august,nfe made a contract with cdc,using an employer id number moody obtained,but the contract was signed by freeman alone,and uses nfx address.on september,the partners opened a bank account in nfe name,but the address and phone number of the account were those of nfx.
alj frink discredited the partners claims of lack of bad intent.in particular,moody testimony that he managed freeman was not credible.
mandamus proceeding 
on november,plaintiffs filed an amended administrative mandamus petition,and the parties stipulated to stay the suspension order during this action.
on june,the trial court issued a judgment,incorporating a statement of decision,denying the petition.the trial court upheld alj frink factual findings.in particular,the trial court discredited moody claim that he managed the business,describing in detail the evidence that undermined moody claim.
all plaintiffs timely filed a joint notice of appeal.based on their written request,we dismissed the appeal as to nfx and freeman.
discussion 
i.the department authority to suspend dvbes 
the parties dispute whether the department had the authority to suspend dvbe entities when moody engaged in the conduct underlying the suspension,whether a amendment granted it such authority,and whether the amendment permits suspension where the offending conduct took place before.
we conclude the department always had authority to suspend fraudulent dvbes in any case,it certainly had such authority after,and such authority,if newly granted in,could be exercised based on prior unlawful conduct.
a.the department authority 
before any of the conduct at issue in this case took place,government code section stated as it still does 
the legislature declares that a centralization of business management functions and services of state government is necessary to take advantage of specialized techniques and skills,provide uniform management practices,and to insure a continuing high level of efficiency and economy.a department of general services is created to provide centralized services including,but not limited to,planning,acquisition,construction,and maintenance of state buildings and property purchasing printing architectural services administrative hearings and accounting services.the department shall develop and enforce policy and procedures and shall institute or cause the institution of those investigations and proceedings as it deems proper to assure effective operation of all functions performed by the department and to conserve the rights and interests of the state.
moody observes that earlier in this proceeding the department did not interpret its authority to allow it to bring suspension proceedings.even if the department misunderstood its authority,that does not equate to a formal administrative interpretation of a statute within an agency purview pacific gas electric department of water resources th,d,nor change the scope of the department actual legal authority bank of italy johnson cal.thus,any mistake by the department does not change the scope of its power,as conferred by the legislature,to institute or cause the institution of those investigations and proceedings as it deems proper to conserve the rights and interests of the state.
moody asserts that the version of section is a more specific statute that limited the department powers over the dvbe program,notwithstanding government code section.he relies on cases holding that where two statutes conflict,the more specific statute should govern.see,in re brent th,d.
we see no conflict.former section first listed unlawful acts subd.a,then stated that a violation of those provisions would result in a civil penalty subd.b,and then stated that any person who performs the unlawful acts shall,in addition to the civil penalties,be suspended from bidding on contracts for between days and one year subd.c.former stats,ch.
the next subdivision provided,the awarding department shall report all alleged violations of this section to the office of small and minority business.the office shall subsequently report all alleged violations to the attorney general who shall determine whether to bring a civil action against any person or firm for violation of this section.former,subd.d stats,ch.
moody asserts that only the attorney general could proceed against alleged violators.that is not what the statute says,it provides a way to report violations to the attorney general,to consider whether or not to bring a civil action.
what moody overlooks is that an administrative proceeding,such as a license suspension hearing,is not a civil action 
code civ,defines action as an ordinary proceeding in a court of justice by which one party prosecutes another for the declaration,enforcement,or protection of a right,the redress or prevention of a wrong,or the punishment of a public offense.italics added.section states every other remedy is a special proceeding.we said in city of oakland public employees retirement system th d oakland an administrative proceeding is neither a civil action nor a special proceeding of a civil nature.lomeli department of corrections th,d lomeli see cartwright board of chiropractic examiners cal d,bold board of medical examiners.
thus,the legislature has defined an action to refer to a court proceeding,the courts of this state have long interpreted that term to exclude administrative hearings,and we presume the legislature knew exactly what it meant when it used that and term in former section,subdivision d.see viking pools,maloney cal d,legislature presumed to act in light of existing statutes and judicial decisions.
former section,subdivision d did not prohibit the department from exercising its power to suspend violators by initiating an administrative suspension.thus,it did not conflict with government code section,quoted above,as moody asserts the statutes were in harmony.
b.the amendment to section 
as amended,effective,section,the full text of which can be found in the appendix,provides for civil,criminal and administrative penalties.stats,ch.
section,subdivision a defines several unlawful acts,such as to knowingly and with intent to defraud obtain,or retain dvbe certification,subd.a.
section,subdivision b makes those unlawful acts punishable as misdemeanors.contrary to moody view,that did not reflect a change in the law.as the attorney general states criminal liability for defrauding the dvbe program existed since before any of the conduct involved in this case.see pub.contract code,subd.b stats,ch.
section,subdivision c in part provides 
the department of general services shall suspend any person who violates subdivision a from bidding on,or participating in,any state contract or project for a period of not less than three years,and if certified as a dvbe,the department shall revoke the business certification for a period of not less than three years the suspension and revocation shall apply to the principals of the business and any subsequent business formed or financed by,or affiliated with,those principals.
moody argues this language merely gives the department the administrative duty to suspend a violator when the violation is determined by some other entity,such as a court of law,but that it does not give the department any power to determine whether a violation occurred.we disagree the department shall suspend any person who violates,subd.c.grammatically,the department takes the stated action,that is,the department,not someone else,shall suspend violators.
further,the department explicit power to grant dvbe certification confers the implicit power to suspend dvbe certification.see mchugh santa monica rent control bd.cal d,it is well established that administrative agencies with licensing power also have the authority to revoke or suspend licenses.
part of moody argument is based on legislative materials contained in his request for judicial notice,previously granted.those documents show that the legislature wanted to ensure greater scrutiny over the dvbe program,in response to reports by the sacramento bee and the state auditor that detailed fraud in the dvbe program.they do not speak to the issues in this case.
further,we look to legislative materials when and only when a party has identified a statutory ambiguity requiring interpretation.the fact we previously granted the motion for judicial notice does not mean we found that the statute was ambiguous.see kaufman broad communities,performance plastering,th,d.
if the language is clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction,nor is it necessary to resort to indicia of the intent of the legislature.alameida state personnel bd.th,d alameida see also handyman,supra,th at,d.a party demonstrates ambiguity by tendering an alternative candidate of meaning,that is,a grammatically plausible reading of the language at issue.see estate of dye th,d zabetian medical board th,d.
the language here does not call for interpretation because moody candidate of meaning does not reasonably account for the language in the statute.he reads the language the department shall suspend any violators to mean something like when someone else finds wrongdoing,the department shall suspend violators.that candidate of meaning does not reasonably account for the language chosen by the legislature,but adds a new concept.therefore,moody repeated assumption that various interpretive tools can or should be wielded in his favor fails,because his candidate of meaning is not reasonable and thus no ambiguity exists.
moody also implies that the amendment made purely technical changes.the legislature clarification of section c was accomplished by the first sentence of subdivision c any person who violates shall be suspended to eliminate the passive voice one of the improvements legislative counsel regularly makes is to change the passive voice to the active.that is the case here.the legislative counsel office does not focus on ferreting out avoidable passive constructions its prime function is to substantively assist in drafting legislation.see,schabarum california legislature th,d id.at,d.the use of the passive voice in the prior version of the statute did not obscure its meaning.belton comcast cable holdings,llc th,d a reasonable consumer would not likely be deceived by the mere use of the passive voice.in any event,as stated,the current statute is clear the department shall suspend dvbe cheats,subd.c.
we accept moody implied premise that a statutory ambiguity can be latent,that is,not apparent on the face of the language,and that such ambiguity may be shown by reading parallel or similar statutory language.see people galindo th,d city of sacramento public employees retirement system th,d.
first,moody makes the following claim 
in the version of the statute,subdivision c did not specify how the suspension would be implemented.the amendments now specify that the department is responsible for implementing the suspension and revocation of dvbe certifications.these would be summary administrative procedures based on the judicial determination that a violation of subdivision a had occurred.
the above interpretation of subdivision c is also consistent with the specific provisions governing suspension in the public contract code.specifically,public contract code sections part of the state contract act outline the circumstances under which any state agency may suspend a person from bidding upon a public works contract with the agency if that person has been convicted by a court of competent jurisdiction of any charge of fraud,bribery,collusion,or conspiracy in connection with bidding upon a prior public works contract.public contract code.before suspending a person pursuant to these provisions,the state agency must provide a hearing upon reasonable notice.
the fact that the public contract code expressly authorizes agencies to bring suspension proceedings under certain circumstances suggests that there is no general authority for agencies to bring such proceedings under government code section.the public contract code suspension proceedings rely on a conviction in a court of competent jurisdiction the agencies are not bringing an independent action.the provisions also articulate due process requirements.all of these factors are absent in the proceedings currently brought by the department against appellants.accordingly,the department lacks authority to bring the current proceedings.italics and emphasis in original.
the relevant state contract act statute applies to any charge of fraud,bribery,collusion,conspiracy,or any other act in violation of any state or federal antitrust law.pub.contract code,italics added.the attorney general asserts this means the sections apply only to antitrust cases.one decision,not cited by the parties,supports moody on this point u nder the state contract act pub.contract code,et,any state agency can suspend for up to three years a contractor from bidding on or being awarded a public works contract with that agency if that person has been convicted of fraud,bribery,collusion,in connection with any public works contract.pub.contract code.the act provides for notice and a hearing prior to any suspension,at.stacy,supra,th at,d.but even accepting that these sections apply to all criminal fraud convictions,not merely antitrust convictions,the fact that the legislature has established procedures following criminal convictions in the state contract act does not mean it precludes other remedies provided by other statutes.we see no conflict with section.
moody also points to statutes applicable to a contract preference program similar to the dvbe program 
there are telling discrepancies between the legislative histories of the statutes behind the small business and dvbe programs.in amending the statutes governing the small business program,for example,the legislature made clear its intention to provide the department with independent authority to initiate suspension proceedings to address violations of the small business program statutes.citation.unlike the amendments to the dvbe program statutes,the amendments to the small business program statutes contained explicit language granting the department independent authority to initiate suspension proceedings.
the relevant section states the department shall revoke the small business or microbusiness certification of any person that violates a list of fraudulent acts similar to section,subdivision a,and suspend their ability to bid on or supply to any state contracts,subd.c.moody perceives significance in the fact that no similar language appears in section.but we see nothing in the small business statute which raises any latent ambiguity in section it merely shows that other language could be used to accomplish the same result.the legislature is not required to use the same language to accomplish the same ends.
moody raises a new claim in the reply brief,that the suspension is punitive in nature and therefore the interpretive rule of lenity should apply.this claim is forfeited because by withholding it to the reply brief moody deprived the department of the ability to address it.see neighbours buzz oates enterprises d,fn.in any event,the statutory language is not ambiguous,calling for an interpretive choice,and the suspension is not punitive although debarment can have a severe economic impact on contractors,it is not intended as punishment.it is,instead,a necessary means to enable the contracting governmental agency to deal with irresponsible bidders and contractors,and to administer its duties with efficiency.southern cal.underground contractors,city of san diego th,d underground contractors.we need not address other new claims in the reply brief,both because they are forfeited and because they are subsumed within our analysis,as stated above.
retroactivity 
moody asserts that exercise of the authority granted by the amendment to section based on conduct occurring before that amendment effective date would be an impermissible retroactive application of the statute.although we have concluded the department always had the ability to suspend dvbe cheats,we will address this claim as if the amendment newly granted the department such authority.
the trial court rejected this claim as follows 
e ven if the court were to assume that the department did not have authority to bring an independent suspension action prior to the amendments,the court still would rule that the suspension action against petitioners was not an improper retroactive application of the amendments.this is not a situation where an act lawful at the time it was done was retroactively rendered unlawful.rather,both before and after the amendments,military and veterans code made it unlawful to defraud the dvbe program.in addition,both before and after the amendments,any person who violated subdivision a of that section was subject to the penalty of suspension.thus,at most,the amendments merely changed or broadened which agency or agencies were authorized to bring a suspension action.this is not an impermissible retroactive effect.
we agree with the trial court.the case relied on by the trial court,century ins.garamendi cal th,d,century,involved the validity of insurance rate reductions rollbacks as applied to rates charged during a period when the lawful amount of the rates was uncertain,due to the enactment of an initiative purporting to lower the rates.the california supreme court rejected a claim that requiring reductions in rates already charged would be impermissible 
e ven if the rate regulations as to rollbacks might be deemed retroactive,they can not be deemed impermissibly so.primary retroactivity to coin a when regulations alter the past legal consequences of past actions.citations.that is not present here.secondary retroactivity occurs when regulations affect the future legal consequences of past transactions citation.that is indeed present.b ut such secondary retroactivity is an entirely lawful consequence of much agency rulemaking and does not by itself render a rule invalid.citation.that it is an entirely lawful consequence means just that it does not itself offend any law,including the united states and california constitutions and their respective due process clauses.
we may observe in passing that the rate regulations as to rollbacks were not adopted until after the rollback year.that fact can not itself render them impermissibly retroactive.for about a year prior to the approval of proposition,insurers were on actual notice of the rate rollback requirement provision itself.century,supra,cal th at,d.
here,the only different consequence,if any,is that that agency bringing the suspension action is the department.the suspension action was not based on conduct later made unlawful.
moody claims that before the amendment the past legal consequences of fraudulent conduct were that,upon referral by the department,the attorney general might elect to pursue a civil action.if the attorney general elected not to bring such a civil action,the dispute was over.no further legal consequences would inure.we do not agree,because at best for moody perhaps no civil action would inure if the attorney general declined to file one,but as we have explained,an administrative proceeding is not a civil action.lomeli,supra,th at,d.the asserted immunity from a civil action would not make the fraudulent conduct lawful,and there would be nothing improper about allowing the department to pursue dvbe violators the attorney general chose not to pursue.this would not be like allowing claims based on conduct not actionable when done myers philip morris companies,cal th,d,repeal of product liability immunity for tobacco did not revive claims based on conduct while statute was operative,nor like implying an intent to revive claims moore state bd.of control th,d moore when the legislature intends to revive claims it does so expressly.
moore,relied on by moody,involved the claims procedures applicable to a crime victim restitution fund.under the old rule,the administering board could grant relief to late claimants,but only for up to three years.crime victims filed late claims because they were not told about the existence of the fund,and their applications for relief from the time limits were denied because they were over three years late.after they sued,the legislature eliminated the cap on relief from the time limits.moore,supra,th at,d.we held that the law applicable at the time the claims were filed applied there was no intent to make the new law retroactive,no intent to revive barred claims,and when the legislature establishes a right or benefit that was unknown at common law and,in the same statute,establishes a time within which a claim to the right or benefit must be exercised,the time period is substantive and jurisdictional.id.at,d.similar circumstances are not present in this case.
johnson alexis d,also cited by moody,involved the suspension of a driver license for recidivist drunk driving.an amendment changed how to calculate a washout period for prior convictions.under the old law,johnson prior conviction would be deemed washed out under the new law,effective after his second act of drunk driving but before that conduct resulted in a conviction,the prior would count,and trigger a suspension.id.at.the court concluded that the amendment did not clearly indicate an intent that it apply retroactively,and that applying the new law would impair johnson preexisting right to continue his licensed driving unless he suffered two convictions of drunk driving within five years.id.at.here,no new penalties have been imposed.
moody claims in a footnote in the reply brief 
appellants do not agree that their penalties were not enhanced as a result of the amendments.under the version of section,appellants were suspended of the maximum suspension period.applying the same penalty under the version of section,appellants would have only been suspended for four months.
to the extent we understand this claim,it is incorrect.the suspension shall be for a period of not less than three years,subd.c.the suspension could be for from days to one year,with a provision for an extended period,up to three years for additional violations.former,subd.c stats,ch.moody suspension was reduced by alj frink to one year,explicitly for the purpose of conforming the suspension to the law,in effect when the relevant conduct took place.there was no imposition of a suspension,there was no enhanced penalty,and there is no claim that the alj should have imposed something less than a suspension.
hughes aircraft ex rel.schumer,d hughes,also relied on by moody,is somewhat closer to this case,but materially distinguishable.
hughes addressed an amendment to the federal false claims act fca.before the amendment,a federal court was required to dismiss an action by a private plaintiff relator if it was based on evidence or information the government had when the action was brought.hughes,supra,at.at,d at,quoting an earlier version of.the action in hughes was based on such information.in,before the action was filed,the statute was amended to allow such actions to proceed in some cases.although the conduct underlying the action took place under the old rule,the action was filed after the new rule took effect.the defendant claimed the new rule could not be applied to allow actions based on conduct that took place under the old rule.
the court applied the general rule that a statute will not be construed to apply retroactively unless such intent is clearly stated,therefore if the amendment has a retroactive effect,then we presume it will not apply to the conduct alleged in this case,which occurred prior to its effective date.hughes,supra,at.at,d at.the amendment had a retroactive effect because it abolished an affirmative defense available to the defendant at the time the conduct took place,that is,the defense that the action was based on information known to the government.id.at.at,d at.this was significant for the following reason 
the extension of an fca cause of action to private parties in circumstances where the action was previously foreclosed is not insignificant.as a class of plaintiffs,qui tam relators are different in kind than the government.they are motivated primarily by prospects of monetary reward rather than the public good 
in permitting actions by an expanded universe of plaintiffs with different incentives,the amendment essentially creates a new cause of action,not just an increased likelihood that an existing cause of action will be pursued.hughes,supra,at.at,d at.
here,assuming the amendment newly granted authority to suspend to the department,the amendment might be said to have allowed an expanded universe of plaintiffs,as moody asserts.but we disagree that any new plaintiff had any different incentives,in the language of the supreme court.hughes,supra,at.at d at.a qui tam relator is often a mercenary,seeking only the bonus available for uncovering fraud.but,akin to the attorney general,the department is an arm of california government,charged with acting to further california public policies it does not seek private reward for its actions.at worst the amendment merely increased the likelihood that an existing cause of action will be pursued,which the hughes court did not view as a retrospective effect.ibid.
finally,the gist of retroactivity is whether a law gives a different and potentially unfair legal effect to actions taken in reliance on the preenactment law.california trout,state water resources control bd.d,italics added.moody could not reasonably have relied on nfe ability to escape consequences for fraud,based on the hope that the attorney general would conclude the case did not merit the attentions of his office.
ii.due process 
moody argues that the administrative suspension hearing violated his due process rights because the department neither adopted hearing regulations pursuant to the administrative procedures act,et apa nor followed the default adjudication procedures within the apa.
as far as moody briefs show,no due process objections were lodged at the hearing before alj frink.we conclude he has forfeited this structural claim because he did not raise it at the administrative hearing.we have repeatedly held that issues not presented at an administrative hearing can not be raised on review.citizens for open government city of lodi th,d ceqa case alameida,supra,th at,d discipline hearing see cal.administrative mandamus ed.laying the foundation at the administrative hearing.
further,to the extent moody briefs can be read to raise an claim,that is,that he was actually prejudiced in this case,such a claim requires the appellant to present a factual analysis of the individual case banning newdow th,d,but no such claim was tendered to the trial court,therefore any purported due process claim is doubly forfeited because prejudice would require consideration of the degree to which moody case was impaired,it is a factual issue forfeited by the failure to litigate it in the trial court.ward taggart cal d,oakland,supra,th at,d.
we observe that at prehearing conferences the parties could have raised any procedural or discovery issues,and,indeed,alj hoover issued a detailed order regulating some procedures,including discovery.at the beginning of the hearing itself alj frink stated that the parties had discussed procedural issues off the record,including the fact that she would issue a final decision,not a proposed decision for the department to adopt,and the fact that the department would have the burden of proof.either party could have made a record of any irregularities or continued objections,including due process objections,at that time.
moody claims at the prehearing conferences,appellants counsel repeatedly objected to the department failure to apprise appellants of the procedures that would govern the suspension proceedings.no record citation is given for this assertion,therefore we disregard it.city of lincoln barringer th,d.the next sentence of moody brief claims that alj hoover shared moody concerns,and that assertion is followed by citations and quotations from the prehearing conferences.in the cited portions of the record,alj hoover expressed concern about the need for clarity in the procedures,but moody counsel lodged no due process objections.as indicated earlier,alj hoover made a prehearing order requiring that any evidentiary hearing must comport with due process requirements under the apa,and if they did not,it was moody counsel duty to object.moody did not preserve the due process claims raised on appeal.
we observe that in certain cases a party claiming that an administrative hearing is unfair may present new evidence in a mandate proceeding,for example,to show bias on the part of the decision maker.nasha city of los angeles th,d but nasha raised issue at administrative hearing.such cases are inapposite because moody did not tender any evidence to the trial court in an effort to show that plaintiffs were hampered in any way at the administrative hearing.in the trial court moody simply claimed that the hearing violated his due process rights because no governing regulations for such a proceeding had been adopted,claims he failed to present to the aljs.he did not articulate any claim of prejudice.
nonetheless,we briefly address moody forfeited claims.
government code section partly states that,if no other governing procedure is provided an agency may conduct an adjudicative proceeding under the administrative adjudication provisions of the apa.moody argues 
under government code section,when an agency conducts an adjudicative proceeding,it must do so according to the procedures prescribed in the statutes and regulations governing that type of proceeding.if there are no statutes or regulations applicable to the proceeding in question,the agency may proceed according to the adjudicatory provisions of the apa.however,if the agency elects not to proceed according to the apa adjudicatory provisions,then the agency must promulgate regulations to govern the proceeding.failure to promulgate such regulations renders any action taken as a result of the proceeding invalid.italics and emphasis in original.
contrary to moody view,government code section says an agency may use the default apa procedures in certain cases but that statute does not mandate setting aside a decision when an agency neither uses the default procedures nor adopts procedures specific to the particular kind of case.
we agree with moody that underground regulations,that is,rules of general application not adopted in compliance with the apa rulemaking provisions,are generally invalid.see kings rehabilitation center,premo th,d.however,the record does not support his claim of an underground regulation.the department sent this matter to the office of administrative hearings for resolution,and that office sent the matter to an alj.there is no showing the department adopted a rule of general application,about dvbe suspension hearings.
on appeal,moody bases his claim for prejudice on two grounds.first,appellants were never provided a copy of the procedure employed by the department and,consequently,were left to speculate as to the nature of the procedures that would be followed.second,the exclusive discovery procedures set forth in the apa were never made available to appellants in this case.
as for discovery,we have described earlier one minor discovery objection at a prehearing conference,which was promptly resolved by alj hoover.we have not been cited to any other discovery issues raised by moody.
as for notice of the procedures,moody had enough notice.
moody cites a federal case where an agency conducted a suspension hearing absent regulations stating grounds for suspension.gonzalez freeman gonzalez.the agency debarred a company from contracting pending an investigation,and later suspended it for five years,without stating any reasons.the court observed in short,we construe,the pertinent statutory scheme as authorizing debarment but as not authorizing debarment without either regulations establishing standards and a procedure which are both fair and uniform or basically fair treatment of appellants.id.at,italics added.
the facts of this case are not like those in gonzalez,supra.here,the department issued a lengthy notice of intent to suspend,which detailed specific statutory grounds,and also summarized the evidence supporting suspension.two prehearing conferences were attended by moody counsel and procedures were discussed.a hearing before a neutral alj was held at which the parties were represented by counsel and procedures were discussed.at the hearing itself,moody had the opportunity to present evidence and challenge opposing evidence.alj frink issued a detailed written decision describing the facts and the law supporting suspension.in our view,moody received basically fair treatment as defined by the gonzalez decision he has not even come close to showing a due process violation.see underground contractors,supra,th at,d notice of ground of debarment,ability to confront evidence and assistance of counsel at hearing stacy,supra,th at,d notice of hearing,notice of charges,advance synopsis of evidence,opportunity to present witnesses and documentary evidence,and the right to presence of counsel as well as prehearing depositions,meant that the inability to cross examine witnesses did not violate due process.
moody cites to golden day,supra,th,d,but the problem in that case was that a hearing was not held before an impartial decision maker.id.at,d one panel member was in the position of judging the correctness of his own decision.here,unlike in golden day,the administrative appeal was entirely conducted by an independent hearing officer.lieblein,supra,th at,d.
thus,even if the department erred by failing either to adopt procedural rules for dvbe suspension hearings or to use the default procedures under the apa,moody has not shown that such irregularity,of itself,violated due process and he has not demonstrated prejudice in his particular case.
iii.collateral estoppel 
moody claims the department should have been collaterally estopped from bringing the suspension action because it failed to seek suspension in the prior administrative action which involved identical facts and circumstances.
the briefing suggests that moody means to invoke claim preclusion res judicata,on the theory that the suspension could have been litigated in the earlier case,rather than issue preclusion collateral estoppel,on the theory that the exact issues were litigated.see people damon th,d,fn.damon collateral estoppel would merely prevent him from relitigating whether he violated the automotive repair act,which was decided adversely to defendant in the administrative action.
moody quotes sutphin speik cal d,
if the matter was within the scope of the action,related to the and relevant to the issues,so that it could have been raised,the judgment is conclusive on it despite the fact that it was not in fact expressly pleaded or otherwise urged.the reason for this is manifest.a party can not by negligence o
