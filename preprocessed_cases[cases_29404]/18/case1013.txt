background 
thomas rubin and thomas sullivan were the chief executive officer and chief financial officer,respectively,of focus media,a santa monica,advertising agency.geoffrey mousseau is an attorney who represented focus in bankruptcy proceedings and other business matters.
focus was in the advertising placement business.the agency placed commercial advertisements on television and radio for clients including sears roebuck,century fox,and universal city studios.focus services included booking air time for its clients commercials,tracking whether the commercials reached their desired audience,and negotiating compensation with stations when advertisements failed to air or reach their promised audience.
after commercials aired,media stations sent an invoice to focus,and focus in turn invoiced its advertising clients.focus billed its clients for the actual cost of the air time and charged a fee for its additional services.focus clients were expected to pay within days of receipt of an invoice.focus in turn paid the media stations days after the commercial broadcast date.this procedure allowed clients to avoid writing hundreds of checks to the individual stations that aired the commercials,and focus had the benefit of the float on which it could earn interest.
the record reflects that none of the foregoing was documented by agreements between focus and its clients or focus and the media.media stations considered both focus and focus clients to be liable for the cost of air time purchased,but the clients relied upon focus to pay the stations.
focus business thrived for much of the.but in,focus lost three of its four major accounts when century fox,dreamworks,and universal studios stopped doing business with the agency.universal studios cited as reasons for terminating its account,focus failure to deliver promised savings and poor record of placing advertisements that reached the company target audience.in the summer of,focus last major client,sears,expressed concern that focus was not paying media stations in a timely manner and cut the fee it paid focus.sears fired focus on march.
by the end of,focus was laying off employees and was insolvent.focus was limited by its dwindling client base and ceo rubin practice of borrowing from focus.from to,focus disbursed million in shareholder loans to thom rubin associates,rubin.
in early,focus failed to pay media stations for advertising time it purchased on behalf of universal studios and sears during the fourth quarter of.both clients remitted funds to focus to pay the cost of their advertising in late,but focus transferred just a fraction of this money to the media outlets.of the approximately million that sears remitted to focus to cover its fourth quarter advertising costs,focus paid million to media outlets and retained more than million.focus failed to pay warner brothers affiliates more than million,nbc more than,and abc more than owed for sears advertisements.rubin and sullivan offered several excuses to the media stations for the unpaid invoices,including that focus was not obligated to pay because the stations had contacted sears and universal studios directly and that universal studios never remitted funds to focus to pay for its advertisements.
in january,rubin and sullivan began disbursing focus funds to private accounts under their control.in march,sears filed a civil suit against focus in california superior court alleging,inter alia,conversion and breach of contract.sears obtained a preliminary injunction enjoining focus from spending its funds.universal studios obtained a similar preliminary injunction against focus in may.
despite these court orders,from march to july,rubin and sullivan transferred more than million from focus accounts to thom rubin associates.focus forgave the million in shareholder loans that the agency had made to thom rubin associates.rubin used more than million of these funds to pay his personal taxes.the money also financed a credit balance on a corporate american express credit card in the names of rubin and sullivan.rubin continued to use the corporate card after he quit focus in july.in,rubin received more than million in cash from focus.focus lost almost million that year.
still unpaid,nbc,abc,and paxson communications,filed an involuntary bankruptcy petition against focus on october,triggering an automatic stay of the california proceedings under rubin had retained mousseau to represent him personally on september,but mousseau began to work on focus bankruptcy case mousseau had experience in business litigation,employment law,and transactional work,but had no bankruptcy experience.
on october,sears filed a motion to appoint an interim trustee to take possession of focus remaining assets and preserve them during the bankruptcy proceedings.the same day,focus retained the law firm stutman,treister glatt as bankruptcy counsel.the firm agreed to represent focus,but insisted that focus funds not be used to pay its retainer.the state court injunctions were still in place.
on october and,sullivan disbursed approximately million from focus accounts to himself,rubin,mousseau,rubin corporate american express card,and other third parties.sullivan transferred from focus to mousseau client trust account.mousseau later used these funds to pay stutman retainer.in so doing,mousseau told stutman partner theodore stolman that the funds came from rubin,who had earlier deposited them in mousseau client trust account.stutman was not informed of sullivan other disbursements.
at on october,the bankruptcy court granted sears motion and appointed an interim trustee.when the trustee sought an accounting of focus assets that had been sold or transferred within the past year,mousseau did not report the that sullivan transferred to his client trust account.rubin and sullivan did not report the transfers made from focus accounts to their private accounts on october and.
in december,stolman learned of sullivan october and disbursements and stutman terminated its representation of focus.in september,the bankruptcy court granted a partial summary judgment in favor of focus creditors.we affirmed this decision in.see in re focus media,at.
criminal proceedings 
on october,rubin and sullivan were indicted for conspiracy,mail fraud,wire fraud,and money laundering in connection with the alleged misappropriation of client funds owed to media outlets.rubin,sullivan,and mousseau were indicted for bankruptcy fraud stemming from the disbursement of focus funds during the involuntary bankruptcy proceedings.
the government charged rubin with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud in violation of mail fraud in violation of four counts of wire fraud in violation of wire fraud involving the deprivation of honest services,in violation of and conspiracy to commit bankruptcy fraud in violation of seventeen counts of bankruptcy fraud in violation of and two counts of money laundering in violation of.sullivan was charged under the same counts and one additional count of money laundering.the government charged mousseau with seventeen counts of bankruptcy fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit bankruptcy fraud.
prior to trial,the district court denied a motion from mousseau to sever the counts related to rubin and sullivan alleged defrauding of focus clients and the media outlets.on june,a jury convicted rubin on all counts except one count of wire fraud and one count of bankruptcy fraud.sullivan was convicted on all counts except one wire fraud count.mousseau was convicted on five counts of bankruptcy fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit bankruptcy fraud,and was acquitted on the remaining charges.
the defendants filed motions for acquittal and for a new trial.the district court denied the motions for a new trial and the motions for acquittal on all but one count,granting rubin and sullivan acquittal motion for deprivation of honest services.on december,the defendants were sentenced and ordered to pay restitution.
rubin and sullivan challenge their convictions for mail and wire fraud counts,conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud count,fraudulent bankruptcy transfers counts,and false declarations in bankruptcy count,arguing the evidence submitted at trial was insufficient to support the jury verdict.rubin,sullivan,and mousseau claim there was insufficient evidence to sustain their convictions for concealment of bankruptcy assets counts and,withholding of information from the interim trustee count,and conspiracy to commit bankruptcy fraud count.sullivan and mousseau raise sufficiency of the evidence challenges to their convictions for false declarations in bankruptcy counts and 
claims of insufficient evidence are reviewed de novo.united states shipsey,cir.there is sufficient evidence to support a conviction if,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson virginia,d emphasis in original.
a counts,and 
the elements of mail and wire fraud are proof of a scheme to defraud using the mails or wires to further the fraudulent scheme and specific intent to defraud.see.the supreme court has interpreted broadly and twice held that individuals who retain or misappropriate the money or property of others,regardless of how they acquired it,fall within the purview of mail or wire fraud.united states jones,cir.it is settled law that intent to defraud may be established by circumstantial evidence.united states rogers,cir.intent may be inferred from misrepresentations made by the defendants,see united states lothian,cir,and the scheme itself may be probative circumstantial evidence of an intent to defraud.united states plache,cir.
rubin and sullivan argue that the evidence established neither the existence of a scheme to defraud nor that they had specific intent to defraud their clients.they contend that client funds remitted to focus constituted focus income and that they were not obligated to use these funds to pay their clients media bills.noting that sears and universal studios commercials aired during the fourth quarter of,they argue that their clients received the benefit of what they paid for.they claim the government remaining evidence merely points to a civil dispute between focus and media outlets over payments.
rubin and sullivan argument ignores evidence that focus clients relied on focus to pay media stations for their advertisements.sears executive mark cohen and universal studios executive mark kristol testified that their companies hired focus in part to pay the individual media stations that broadcast their advertisements.cohen,kristol,and debra stover,sears comptroller for marketing,testified that their companies remitted funds to focus on the understanding that they would be used to pay the media bills referenced on focus invoices.the government produced focus invoices to sears and universal studios itemizing the media bills that client funds were used to pay.
assuming,arguendo,that focus was not obligated to pay its clients media bills,the company still was required to pay media outlets for advertising time it purchased,as rubin and sullivan acknowledge.focus was insolvent at the end of.instead of paying off focus media company creditors,rubin and sullivan disbursed client funds earmarked for the media outlets to their private accounts.the government offered evidence that rubin and sullivan repeatedly misrepresented why they could not pay their clients advertising bills when media stations tried to collect payment in early.their basic focus clients for aired advertisements,then disburse remitted funds to their private accounts instead of to the media within the supreme court broad interpretation of fraudulent activity under and.see jones,at.
rubin and sullivan contend that they lacked specific intent to defraud at the time they used the mails to invoice sears and universal studios for advertisements broadcast in the fourth quarter of.this argument is meritless.the government established beyond a reasonable doubt that beginning in december,rubin and sullivan failed to pay media outlets for sears and universal studios advertisements and misrepresented why they did not pay for their clients advertisements.from january to july,they appropriated funds from focus accounts receivable for their personal use.this provided sufficient circumstantial evidence from which the jury could find that rubin and sullivan specifically intended to defraud their clients and the media outlets when the invoices were mailed rubin and sullivan subsequent fraudulent appropriation of funds also satisfies the intent requirements of and for counts,and,which involved wire transfers of sears funds to focus in december and january.see jones,at although jones did not possess a fraudulent intent when he received the money,his fraudulent appropriation of the funds still satisfies the elements of.there is sufficient evidence to uphold rubin and sullivan convictions on the mail and wire fraud charges 
rubin and sullivan submit that the evidence was insufficient to convict them for conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud.
to prove a conspiracy under,the government must establish an agreement to engage in criminal activity,one or more overt acts taken to implement the agreement,and the requisite intent to commit the substantive crime.united states montgomery,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the agreement need not be explicit it is sufficient if the conspirators knew or had reason to know of the scope of the conspiracy and that their own benefits depended on the success of the venture.id.citing united states romero,cir.
the government introduced sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction on the conspiracy charge.the evidence indicates that rubin and sullivan both knew of the scope of the conspiracy.from january to march,both men misrepresented why focus could not pay media outlets for the sears and universal studios advertisements,at the same time they were transferring funds from focus accounts receivable to their personal accounts.sullivan authorized the illicit transfers of which rubin had knowledge.the evidence supports the jury verdict on the conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud count.
rubin,sullivan,and mousseau argue that evidence submitted at trial was insufficient to support the jury verdict on the concealment of bankruptcy assets counts.the counts involved two wire transfers from focus to mousseau account on october and,funds that were later used to pay stutman and other law firms.
concealment of bankruptcy assets requires the government to prove that the defendants knowingly and fraudulently concealed property of the bankruptcy estate from the trustee.concealment need not consist of secretly appropriating funds for one own use.it is sufficient if one withholds knowledge of assets about which the trustee should be told.united states weinstein,cir citation omitted.a violation of can exist where the concealment of funds from the bankruptcy estate occurred before the appointment of the trustee.see,max sugarman funeral home,investors,cir transfers made nine months before a bankruptcy proceeding were sufficient to show a violation of.
rubin,sullivan,and mousseau argue that they disclosed focus as the source of the funds and that they did not knowingly conceal funds from the interim trustee.a rational juror could have concluded otherwise.the government introduced evidence that stutman informed the appellants that it would not accept focus funds to pay its retainer.stolman,the stutman partner who handled focus communications with the interim trustee,testified that mousseau told him that rubin was the source of the retainer funds.on the cover page of a december,fax,mousseau asserted to stolman that the funds used to pay stutman retainer came from his client trust account and not directly from focus in january,sullivan and mousseau declared that the funds were transferred to mousseau client trust account pursuant to sullivan indemnification agreement with focus,despite evidence that mousseau did not represent sullivan in his personal capacity.these misrepresentations are evidence of appellants efforts to conceal focus assets from the trustee.see lothian,at.stolman further testified that portions of a december,fax from mousseau that allegedly disclosed focus as the source of the funds were illegible.in addition,neither mousseau nor sullivan disclosed the transfers to the interim trustee.
mousseau asserts that evidence of intent is lacking because funds that pass through a client trust account are readily traceable.this argument fails.we have held that an easily traceable transfer can still show intent to conceal under.see weinstein,at.in addition,mousseau contention that a debtor may use its funds to hire an attorney before the trustee is appointed does not negate the intent to conceal.so long as an intent to conceal assets from the trustee may be inferred from the evidence,the government has met its burden under.
mousseau contentions that he was not focus bankruptcy attorney and that he corresponded with the interim trustee to the best of his ability are not well taken.mousseau chose to represent focus in its bankruptcy proceedings despite having no experience in this highly specialized practice area.even an inexperienced attorney should have known to report the transfers to the interim trustee.mousseau knowingly involved himself in rubin and sullivan scheme and assisted in the concealment of focus assets.his lack of experience in bankruptcy law is not a shield from criminal liability.
rubin argues that he lacked the requisite intent to prove concealment because he had no knowledge of the october wire transfers.he notes that he resigned from focus three months before the transfers took place.the government introduced billing records from zelle hofmann voelbel mason gette,llp,another law firm retained by focus,indicating that rubin took part in decisions regarding focus response to the october involuntary bankruptcy petition.stolman also testified that rubin called him on december,in an effort to persuade stutman not to withdraw as focus bankruptcy counsel.even if rubin was not directly involved in the wire transfers,a rational juror could have found that the transfers were reasonably foreseeable to him as part of the conspiracy to commit bankruptcy fraud charged in count.see infra section.under pinkerton united states,a conspirator is criminally liable for the substantive offenses committed by a when they are reasonably foreseeable and committed in furtherance of the conspiracy.united states long,cir citing pinkerton,at.rubin participation in strategy sessions to respond to the involuntary bankruptcy petition support an inference that he could have foreseen the transfers.the evidence is sufficient to uphold the defendants convictions for concealment of bankruptcy assets.
rubin and sullivan argue there is insufficient evidence that they made fraudulent bankruptcy transfers on october and november,contending the transfers were made to pay routine business expenses and without the intent to defraud.we reject the argument.
to prove a violation of,the government must show that the defendants knowingly and fraudulently transferred or concealed property with intent to defeat the provisions of title.intent may be established through circumstantial evidence.see united states mccormick,cir.
the record shows that rubin and sullivan caused eleven checks to be drawn on focus accounts on october,disbursing funds to rubin,sullivan,rubin adult children,rubin corporate credit card,and rubin personal physician,among other recipients.the bankruptcy court appointed the interim trustee at that day.stolman testified that sullivan and mousseau were aware of sears ex parte application to appoint an interim trustee on october.zelle,hofmann billing records showed that rubin,sullivan,and mousseau held meetings on how to respond to the filing throughout the day.peter anderson,counsel for the interim trustee,testified that sullivan and mousseau did not provide the interim trustee with the location of focus bank accounts until the eleven checks had already cleared.as of december,rubin and sullivan had not revealed to the trustee all of focus banking records.their actions prevented the interim trustee from taking full possession of focus assets.see g.there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could find the fraudulent intent required to convict rubin and sullivan under.
sullivan and mousseau challenge their convictions for false declaration in a bankruptcy proceeding on the ground that the statements they made to the bankruptcy court were not false.rubin challenges his conviction for aiding and abetting a false declaration made by sullivan,arguing that he had no role in the statement.
to prove a violation of,the government must establish beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of the bankruptcy proceedings that a statement under penalty of perjury was made therein,or in relation thereto that the statement was made as to a material fact that the statement was false and that the statement was knowingly and fraudulently made.united states lindholm,cir.
in an october,declaration submitted in opposition to the appointment of an interim trustee,sullivan told the bankruptcy court that pending the resolution of the involuntary bankruptcy case,focus intended to make ordinary business expenditures and would preserve and protect the company assets.as noted supra in section,that day,sullivan authorized the disbursement of of focus funds in a severance package to himself,rubin,rubin adult children,and others.a rational juror could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that sullivan statement to the court was knowingly false.a rational juror could also have convicted rubin for aiding and abetting the statement.rubin participated in several meetings with sullivan and mousseau where they prepared declarations in response to sears motion to appoint an interim trustee.mccormick,at holding evidence of false statement was insufficient where an appellant signed a bankruptcy petition without reading it.
in a january,declaration,sullivan asserted that the disbursement from focus to mousseau client trust account was transferred pursuant to sullivan indemnification agreement with focus.the government established that the principal recipients of these funds,mousseau and stutman,never identified themselves as sullivan counsel.sullivan declaration is also at odds with testimony he delivered under oath on january,stating that he was unfamiliar with the indemnification agreement and had no legal expenses stemming from focus bankruptcy.in light of these discrepancies,a rational juror could infer that sullivan declaration was false.see,united states,cir it is the province of the trier of fact to resolve evidentiary conflicts,and draw reasonable inferences from proven facts.citation omitted.
there is sufficient evidence to affirm mousseau false statement conviction in connection with the indemnification agreement.mousseau claimed that the focus funds were disbursed to his client trust account pursuant to sullivan indemnification agreement at a bankruptcy hearing to determine whether mousseau violated,which requires bankruptcy attorneys to disclose the compensation they receive from.mousseau assertion contravened his earlier representation to stolman that the funds originated with rubin.anderson also testified that mousseau defied an april,order from the bankruptcy court to face over inconsistent statements he had made concerning his bankruptcy compensation.
the evidence also supports the jury finding beyond a reasonable doubt that mousseau made a false declaration when he testified that he never told stolman that he paid stutman retainer with his own funds.mousseau december,fax to stolman expressly stated that as you can see by comparing the timing
