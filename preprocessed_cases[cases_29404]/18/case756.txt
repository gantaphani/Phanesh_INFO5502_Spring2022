sarkes tarzian,incorporated sti brought this suit for breach of an oral contract for the sale of traded shares of sti stock against trust company of florida savings bank.a jury found that trust breached its contract entered into by james pressly,who was acting on trust behalf,and awarded sti million in damages.trust appeals the district court denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law,or in the alternative a new trial,and sti appeals a number of the district court rulings.for the reasons discussed,we find that sti presented no evidence at trial showing that pressly had actual authority to bind trust in a contract.we reverse the district court denial of trust motion for judgment as a matter of law and remand for entry of judgment for trust.we also find that the jury instructions that the district court gave to the jury were sufficient to apprise the jury correctly of the applicable law of agency under new york law.as such,the district court did not err by refusing to instruct the jury on apparent authority.because we find that there was no contract between sti and trust,we will not address sti arguments.
background 
sti is a indiana corporation.sti,which owns and operates four radio and two television stations,was founded by sarkes tarzian and his wife,mary tarzian.mary tarzian will stated that upon her death,her shares in sti were to be transferred by her estate the estate to the tarzian family trust the family trust.mary tarzian hired james pressly,a florida trust and estates lawyer,to revise her will and trust documents,instructing him to modify these documents so that within nine months after her death,the family trust trustees could disclaim,or legally detach themselves from,the shares of par value sti stock that tarzian owned.one way for the trustees to disclaim themselves of the stock was to sell it.after the trustees disclaimed this stock,the shares would pass to the mary tarzian charitable foundation.this action would enable the estate to avoid paying death taxes.trust,the personal representative of the estate,and patricia tarzian mary tarzian daughter were appointed trustees of the family trust.after mary tarzian died on june,trust retained pressly as counsel for the estate.through pressly,trust retained a broker to find a purchaser for the shares 
trust had some difficulty finding a buyer for the shares because tom tarzian,a beneficiary of the trust,was unwilling to sell his controlling interest in sti with the deadline fast approaching and no willing buyer for the shares identified,pressly,on behalf of trust,held a meeting with representatives of sti on january,in new york city.the purpose of the meeting was to negotiate a sale of the shares.present at the meeting were tom tarzian and two sti attorneys,herbert camp,and valerie carney pressly,as the estate legal counsel and periodically by telephone,lawyers who represented patricia tarzian,of the family trust and beneficiary of the estate and trust.however,no principal of trust attended this meeting.
there is little dispute about what the parties said at the meeting.pressly started the meeting by telling the sti representatives not to be concerned about the fact that no one from trust was present.reading from his prepared notes,pressly stated,trust is standing by,is fully briefed,and is prepared to sign a definitive purchase and sale contract today if we can negotiate one.sti attorney carney notes also reflect that pressly made this statement.pressly also stated during the meeting that,if there is a way to cut the gordian knot,we here at your invitation to decisively make a deal today.
trust chairman and ceo,townbridge callaway iii,and trust senior vice president,ann cavanaugh,testified that pressly had authority to negotiate a sale of the shares but did not have authority to enter into a contract on behalf of the estate.after almost a day of negotiation,pressly proposed a sale price of million in cash and million in the form of a promissory note.pressly stated,i am authorized to make this offer.
following some further negotiations,sti offered to purchase the shares for million cash and a million promissory note.the promissory note had a term at a interest rate.pressly conferred with patricia tarzian counsel and then stated,this is not what we had hoped for and i ca say we happy with it,but we take it.tom tarzian asked pressly if they had a deal.pressly replied,y es,we have a deal.after pressly made that statement,the parties shook hands.
pressly was then told that sti general counsel,valerie carney,was marking up a sale agreement.supposedly,carney was using as a template the contract for an earlier sale of patricia tarzian sti shares to sti.carney faxed the document to pressly that night.after leaving the meeting and on his way to the airport,pressly received a message from gray communications,offering to pay trust million in cash for the shares.on january,trust sold the shares to gray affiliate,bull run,for that price.that same day,pressly informed sti of the bull run transaction.on february,sti wrote to trust asserting that it had a binding contract and demanded return of the shares.
ten days later,sti sued bull run and the estate,naming trust as the estate personal representative sti claimed that the estate breached an oral contract to sell its shares to sti for million in cash and a million promissory note.sti had two theories about how the oral contract was made that the parties had agreed to all material terms and had agreed to negotiate a written document in good faith referred to under new york law as a type i agreement or that the parties had agreed to certain important terms and had agreed to negotiate the remaining terms in good faith referred to under new york law as a type ii agreement.sti sought specific performance of the oral contract or damages resulting from the breach.
with motions for summary judgment on both type i and type ii agreements denied,the case went to trial.the jury found that the estate had entered into a binding type i agreement,and awarded sti million in damages.this amount represented the difference between the sti contract price total of million and that of bull run million.per the district court jury instructions,the jury made no finding on the alleged type ii agreement.
trust renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law and,in the alternative,a new trial.the district judge denied both motions and sti filed a motion to amend the judgment,seeking specific performance and prejudgment interest from the date trust allegedly breached the contract.the district court denied the request for specific performance but granted sti prejudgment interest from august,date the district court found sti to have been damaged by the february,the date of the jury verdict trust appeals the judgment and related rulings.sti the district court refusal to permit sti to recover damages and the district court order denying specific performance.it also the district court refusal to award prejudgment damages from the date of the breach.
ii.analysis 
while the parties briefs present us with many issues,we must decide as a threshold matter whether the district court properly denied trust motion for judgment as a matter of law.trust central argument in support of its motion is that no binding contract of any type was created between trust and sti.trust asserts that pressly,the attorney representing the trust,did not have the authority necessary to bind trust in a stock purchase and sale agreement.as a result,trust contends the matter should not have gone to the jury,and the district court judgment should have been for the estate as a matter of law.consequently,trust argues that sti can claim no damages for trust sale of the sti shares to bull run.
we review de novo the district court denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.harvey office of banks and real estate,cir deimer cincinnati,cir.we examine all of the evidence in the record to determine whether a reasonable juror could have found in favor of the party,drawing all reasonable inferences in the party favor,and refraining from weighing the evidence or making credibility determinations.harvey,at citing reeves sanderson plumbing,d.we note that the question is not whether the jury believed the right people,but only whether it was presented with a legally sufficient amount of evidence from which it could reasonably derive its verdict.zelinski columbia,cir internal citations omitted.
oral contracts for the sale of stock are enforceable under new york law,a providing,in pertinent part,a contract or modification of a contract for the sale or purchase of a security is enforceable whether or not there is a writing signed or record authenticated by a party against whom enforcement is sought,even if the contract or modification is not capable of performance within one year of its making.we therefore direct our attention to the question of whether there was sufficient evidence presented at trial to demonstrate that pressly had the authority to bind trust in the oral contract with sti the party asserting that an attorney had authority to enter into a contract on behalf of the attorney client in this case,sti bears the burden of proving it.nash y and t,slavin polyak.without the authority for the agent to bind its principal in a contract with a third party,or without the principal subsequent ratification,the contract must be set aside under new york law.nash,at.
a party mere retention of an attorney,and its assignment to that attorney the responsibility to negotiate on behalf of the client does not create authority in the attorney to bind the principal in a contract.see also ford unity,an agent power to bind his principal is coextensive with the principal grant of authority.with this rule in mind,the question before this court is what kind of authority is sufficient under new york law is actual authority sufficient,or does a party need actual and apparent authority 
the highest court of the state of new york,the new york court of appeals,has explicitly recognized that without a grant of authority from the client,an attorney can not compromise or settle a claim.hallock state.see also nash,at it is settled new york law that an attorney must be specifically authorized to settle and compromise a claim.while this language suggests that only actual authority will do,as trust contends closer study reveals that apparent authority can also suffice.see hallock,at finding that principal had cloaked attorney in apparent authority and therefore was bound by a settlement agreement into which attorney had entered client in open court.see also clark squibb and,a settlement is considered binding,however,even where a client is not present at the time it is entered,and where the attorney does not have actual authority,if the court concludes that counsel actions indicate apparent authority to act on his or her client behalf.
a principal confers actual authority on his agent when he objectively manifests to the agent consent to the agency.ojeni lieber.as for apparent authority,it is created by words or conduct of the principal,communicated to a third party,that give rise to the appearance and belief that the agent possesses authority to enter into a transaction.hallock,at.new york explicitly rejects the idea that an agent can confer apparent authority on him or herself.see id.rather,the existence of apparent authority depends upon a factual showing that the third party relied upon the misrepresentation of the agent because of some misleading conduct on the part of the the agent.id.quoting ford,at and restatement second of agency.furthermore,we note that a third party may rely on an appearance of authority in such circumstances only to the extent that such reliance is reasonable.id.finally,the new york court of appeals has held that o ne who deals with an agent does so at his peril,and must make the necessary effort to discover the actual scope of authority.ford,at.with these principles in mind,we turn to the facts of this case to discern whether there was sufficient evidence presented to support a finding that pressly had actual or apparent authority to bind trust in a contract with sti.
actual authority 
because there was no writing between trust and pressly outlining the scope of pressly authority,only testimonial evidence was available to determine whether pressly had actual authority.in its appellate brief,sti highlights the testimony of trust chief executive officer callaway as the strongest affirmative evidence from which the jury could infer actual authority.when asked,was pressly authorized to go to new york to negotiate the deal,callaway responded,he was authorized to go to new york to negotiate a deal,yes.
pressly told sti at the beginning of the january,meeting,trust is standing by,is fully briefed,and is prepared to sign a definitive purchase and sale contract today if we can negotiate one.at the end of the meeting,pressly said,this is not what we had hoped for and i ca say we happy with it,but we take it.sti also notes that pressly stated at one point during the negotiations,i am authorized to make this offer.in addition,pressly admitted on that at the new york meeting,he did not state that he was not authorized to bind trust.
trust directs our attention to the following evidence in the record as supporting its contention that pressly did not have actual authority.first,it is undisputed that no one from sti had any communication with trust concerning that scope of pressly authority other than with pressly himself.second,trust senior vice president cavanaugh testified that pressly was authorized to negotiate a possible deal,but his authority was limited.specifically,pressly was not authorized to actually execute a contract.trust ceo callaway testified to the specific instructions he gave pressly he was 
to go out and try to find a buyer for the sarkes tarzian stock and he was given the authority to negotiate terms,price,and that sort of thing,with the people that he actually found,if any,and was specifically instructed,and there was no argument at all,that he would come back to us with those terms,and present them to us for review,analysis,and a final decision as to whether they were something that we should move forward with.
further,callaway testified that pressly had a fairly wide authority to go out and basically negotiate on terms,and anything else that needed to be considered,but with the definite caveat that whatever he had negotiated came back to us for final determination.it is also undisputed that pressly only communicated with trust on one occasion about the negotiations.pressly communicated with trust after the negotiation session concluded.in particular,pressly called trust ceo callaway,who was standing by all day long,and stated that there would not be an agreement signed that day.furthermore,pressly told callaway that he was released from standing by.
in addition,trust argues that the signature blocks on the unsigned written agreements sti prepared after the negotiation meeting were for trust signature,not that of pressly.this assertion is consistent with the other record evidence indicating that only trust signed agreements on behalf of the mary tarzian estate.
trust wanted pressly to testify concerning the scope of his authority to corroborate callaway testimony.however,the district court prohibited pressly from testifying on this issue and trust challenges this evidentiary decision on appeal.we review a district court decision to exclude evidence for abuse of discretion.mason.at carbondale,cir old republic ins.employers reinsurance,cir.
apparently concerned about gamesmanship,the district court did not permit pressly to testify as to whether he had actual authority to bind his principal in a contract with sti.the district court made this ruling because pressly refused to answer sti question on this point in his deposition.pressly claimed privilege.the day after pressly deposition,trust implicitly waived its privilege when cavanaugh responded fully to the same questions sti asked pressly the day before.the court regarded pressly desire to change his position taken at his deposition as not playing right.
even if the district court did abuse its discretion by excluding the test
