appellant james tinnell developed a liquid solution to treat lesions caused by the herpes virus.he applied for a patent on the treatment and acquired a defunct corporation,now named zila,as a vehicle for marketing and selling the product,now called zilactin.tinnell subsequently entered an agreement with zila that assigned all rights in his invention to the company in return for royalty payments and company stock.the royalty payments provided for in this contract are the subject of the present dispute.
the contract at issue is unambiguous as to the duration of the royalties,and the parties agree on their intent at the time it was formed.all the evidence is thus in accord with a single tinnell would relinquish all rights to zilactin,patent or otherwise,and,in return,receive in perpetuity a five percent royalty on zila sales of the invention.the difficulty in this case arises because zila asserts,and the district court agreed,that the doctrine announced in brulotte thys,d,displaces,because of federal patent policy,the parties intent and renders the royalty obligation unenforceable,either entirely or upon the expiration of the first patent that issued on tinnell invention.we confront,consequently,not simple questions of contract law but rather issues concerning the impact and bounds of brulotte,in the context of an otherwise unremarkable case.
tinnell first developed his liquid solution to treat lesions caused by oral and genital herpes in.he applied for a patent on the treatment the following year and soon thereafter acquired a defunct california corporation,which he renamed zila,as a vehicle for marketing and selling the product.the product has been improved since it was developed in and is now sold under the brand name zilactin.
on september,tinnell and zila entered into an agreement agreement that began by noting that tinnell has invented a treatment composition for herpes virus infection,which is the subject of a patent application,and tinnell is desirous of assigning all of his right,title and interest in the application and invention,improvements thereon and letters patent thereon for consideration including royalties and stock.the agreement 
assign ed all of tinnell right,title and interest in the patent application and invention,improvements thereon and letters patent thereon,when granted in the united states or foreign countries,to zila,including any present or future improvement whether the same being made by tinnell or zila,and whether presently existing or made in the future,and as may be granted in the united states or any foreign country or otherwise,including each patent granted on any application which is a division,substitution or continuation of any of the applications specifically identified herein,and each reissue or extension of any of the same.
in return,and without any temporal or other limitation,the contract provided tinnell with a five percent royalty on gross sales of zila of the invention,as well as company stock.tinnell obligated himself to cooperate with zila to the extent that zila may enjoy to the fullest extent the rights conveyed hereunder 
the officers who signed on behalf of zila testified that when they executed the agreement,it was not known whether any patents would issue on tinnell invention.according to their uncontested statements,the duration of zila obligation to pay tinnell royalties was not related in any way to the patents that might or might not be obtained by the company as a result of his patent application.instead,the signatories understood the agreement to provide tinnell with a royalty on gross sales of zilactin for as long as the company sold his product.
zila subsequently secured patents in the united states and canada the first of these patents,patent,was issued in august.zila also secured a continuation patent,for the patent and,in december,canadian patent.the primary improvement that transformed tinnell original solution into the zilactin was the addition of a thickener that made the product into a gel.the patent for the addition of this thickener was approved as patent in january.
there is a dispute as to who invented the patent.in,zila filed a patent application which described an improvement to the original chemical compound and named tinnell as the inventor.because zila patent counsel erred in the technical description of the chemical compounds involved,however,the company withdrew the application.when the company resubmitted the application,it inexplicably named edwin pomerantz,zila regulatory specialist,as the inventor.the patent office subsequently issued the patent in to zila,crediting pomerantz rather than tinnell with the invention 
zila royalties to tinnell grew exponentially from to.in,gross sales of zilactin amounted to only,which pegged royalties at.by,however,zilactin had gross sales of over million,and zila owed tinnell half a million dollars in royalties annually.
in july,zila patent counsel advised the company to terminate tinnell royalties,on the grounds that,under brulotte,tinnell right to royalties expired on august,when the patent expired.two months later,zila stopped making royalty payments on all sales of zilactin.although the canadian patent did not expire until december,zila justified its withholding of the canadian royalties on the ground that it had overpaid tinnell nearly a million dollars in american royalties over the previous two years.
shortly after it stopped paying royalties,zila filed a complaint in federal court requesting a declaratory judgment that tinnell right to royalties under the agreement ceased after august.the suit also sought reimbursement for the royalties paid to tinnell for the two years after the patent expired.tinnell filed a for declaratory relief,contending that his entitlement to royalties under the agreement did not terminate with the expiration of the patent but,instead,continued in perpetuity.he added counterclaims for breach of contract,fraud,and other state law claims.
after discovery,the parties made for summary judgment on the question of whether royalties were owed after august.applying brulotte,the district court held that the agreement was unlawful per se under federal patent law,because it project ed beyond the expiration date of the patent.accordingly,the district court granted summary judgment to the extent that zila requests declaratory relief from liability under the agreement.the court explained that,s ince the agreement is unenforceable after the expiration of the patents on august,zila can not be forced to pay royalties after that date.zila subsequently filed a further motion for summary judgment on its demand that tinnell repay royalty payments from to,arguing that the payments amounted to unjust enrichment.the district court denied summary judgment to zila on this claim and,instead,dismissed it.
tinnell did not sit idle after the district court first order.he filed his own demand for entry of judgment,arguing that zila owed him at least in royalties for canadian sales of zilactin from august,when he stopped receiving payments,until december,when the canadian patent expired.zila admitted to owing the money but claimed it was entitled to offset the amount against the american royalties it paid tinnell from september through august.the district court agreed with zila bottom line and went further tinnell had no rights to royalties in the united states or canada,the district court held,because,although the agreement purports to require the payment of royalties based upon the canadian patent,that agreement is unenforceable.the court noted that this result appeared inequitable but read brulotte to require it.
on december,the parties stipulated to dismissal of tinnell outstanding counterclaim for breach of contact.the district court then declared all previous orders and the judgment ripe for appeal,and this timely appeal followed.
we first consider brulotte.the case involved various patents held by the thys company,which sold farmers a hoppicking machine for a flat sum but required them to purchase a license for the patents on the machines in order to use the product.id.at.the license contract demanded that,in addition to the initial purchase price of the machines and onerous restrictions on their assignment or use,the farmers pay the larger of a annual royalty or a set royalty rate tied to the amount of hops they harvested each year.id.the last patent incorporated into the machines expired in.id.at.when the farmers subsequently refused to pay the royalty,the thys company sued to enforce the licensing contract.id.
the supreme court ruled for the farmers,holding that the royalty agreements were unenforceable to the extent that they extended beyond the expiration date of the patent s.id.at.the court explained its holding in part by noting that 
t he present licenses draw no line between the term of the patent and the period.the same provisions as respects both use and royalties are applicable to each.the contracts are,therefore,on their face a bald attempt to exact the same terms and conditions for the period after the patents have expired as they do for the monopoly period.
id.as a result,the court conclude d that a patentee use of a royalty agreement that projects beyond the expiration date of the patent is unlawful per se,and held the farmer royalty obligation under the license unenforceable.id.
simply put,brulotte indicates that under some circumstances patent owners can not exact royalties for use of patented devices beyond the duration of their patents.id.at.the doctrine appears straightforward enough,but its application runs counter to the usual task in a contract interpret the terms agreed to by the parties.that is,brulotte renders unenforceable some aspects of an otherwise valid contract.and it does so for a reason that many courts and commentators have found economically unconvincing,namely,that the free market visualized for the period would be subject to monopoly influences if a royalty agreement was allowed to project beyond the expiration date of the patent.id.at.no matter how unconvincing brulotte foundation may be,however,we are bound to apply its holding if it applies to the case before us.see,agostini felton,d court s of appeals should follow the supreme court case which directly controls,leaving to this court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.scheiber dolby,applying brulotte despite stinging criticism of its logical underpinnings because we have no authority to overrule a supreme court decision no matter how dubious its reasoning strikes us.at the same time,our task is not to expand brulotte holding beyond its terms.so,except as required by brulotte and its progeny,we shall endeavor to give effect to the intent of the parties and the bargain that they struck.
a central difference between this case and brulotte is that here,although the contracting parties contemplated the possible future issuance of a patent,the royalty provision did not depend on it,either on its face or as reported by the contracting parties.whether that difference is material is a difficult question that largely turns on the interpretation of a supreme court case that had this same feature,aronson quick point pencil,d,and that enforced the contract royalty provision.
aronson concerned an inventor who filed an application for a patent on a design for a keyholder.id.at.while the patent application was pending,she negotiated a contract with a manufacturer to make and sell the product.id.the agreement between the inventor,aronson,and the manufacturer,quick point,consisted of two documents.id.in the first,quick point agreed to pay a royalty in return for an exclusive license to sell the invention described in the patent application the duration of the royalty was not detailed.id.in the second,the parties agreed that if the patent application was not allowed within five years,quick point would pay a royalty so long as it sold the invention.id.after five years passed and aronson had failed to obtain a patent,quick point reduced its royalties to the lower rate,which it paid for years.id.at.as sales of the keyholder rose and competitors entered the market,quick point sought a declaratory judgment that the royalty agreement was unenforceable.id.at.although quick point persuaded the appeals court,the supreme court disagreed,holding that the brulotte doctrine and similar federal patent principles do not bear on a contract that does not rely on a patent,particularly where,as here,the contracting parties agreed expressly as to alternative obligations if no patent should issue.id.at.
in so holding,the court stated that enforcing the perpetual royalty of was consistent with the principles treated in brulotte.id.at.the distinction between the contract in brulotte and the one in aronson rested,according to the court,on the fact that the extended royalty term in aronson was not negotiated with the leverage of a patent but rested on the contingency that no patent would issue within five years.id.at.the court recognized that a pending patent application gives the applicant some additional bargaining power for purposes of negotiating a royalty agreement,but observed that the amount of leverage arising from a patent application depends on how likely the parties consider it to be that a valid patent will issue.id.because the parties in aronson negotiated a royalty,with a contingency for the acceptance or rejection of the patent application,the court concluded that i t is clear that whatever role the pending application played in the negotiation of the royalty,it played no part in the contract to pay the royalty indefinitely.id.
aronson thereby added an additional wrinkle to the brulotte analysis and has been read to create two rules if a patent ever issues on an invention,brulotte applies,and no contract can properly demand royalty payments after the patent expires and a contract that provides for royalties either when a patent expires or when it fails to issue can not be upheld unless it provides a discount from the alternative,rate.see meehan ppg industries,cir boggild kenner products,cir pitney bowes,mestre,cir.this understanding,however,may well overread both brulotte and aronson,by glossing over the unique and onerous contractual restrictions at issue in brulotte and relying on a sentence in aronson that is really only dicta.
brulotte indicates that it is because of contractual restrictions other than royalties that the thys company could not collect the royalties after the patents expired.specifically,the court in brulotte noted that,although the farmers bought the machines outright and title transferred,they were forced to obtain a license to actually use the machines the licenses could not be assigned,making the machines the farmers purchased worthless for subsequent sales the farmers were forbidden from moving their machines out of the county,whether or not they intended to use them elsewhere and the license charged both a sliding royalty rate and a minimum fee,depending on use.at.it is only in view of these other provisions of the license agreements that the court found the unchanging royalty rate to be peculiarly significant.id.at.emphasis added.the court emphasized that the presence of t hose restrictions,rather than the royalty alone,in the period was a telltale sign that the licensor was using the licenses to project its monopoly beyond the patent period.id.at.emphasis added.in other words,the thys company was not simply attempting to charge a royalty after the patent expired it was acting in all respects as if the patent remained in place.see id.the same provisions as respects both use and royalties are applicable during the term of the patent and the period we are,therefore,unable to conjecture what the bargaining position of the parties might have been emphases added.
moreover,brulotte involved the sale of a physical machine along with a use license,where the machine was separately paid for and owned outright by the farmers.id.at.as the court noted,id.at,the sale of intellectual property alone,as here,is a considerably more complex matter than the contract at issue in brulotte,and the concepts underlying brulotte do not necessarily transfer to that context readily.an invention can have value to a manufacturer as a trade secret,or as an opportunity to exploit brand identity or market share,quite aside from any patent that could issue on it.in brulotte,in contrast,the farmers had no interest in the invention other than its physical they the right to use the intellectual property included in it,which could not be exploited by the patent holder once the patent expired.
aronson,on the other hand,involved a sale of purely intellectual property to a manufacturer,and recognized the value of other intellectual property besides the patent.see at.quick point apparently placed a significant value on exploiting the basic novelty of the device,even if no patent issued.id.at.noting that,even without patent rights,the contract allowed quick point to preempt the market id.at.quick point agree d to pay for the opportunity to be first in the market.this recognition was both necessary and sufficient to the holding in aronson that brulotte does not bear on a contract that does not rely on a patent,as it was essential to the demonstration that the lower royalty was explicitly independent of federal law.id.at.although the court stated in passing that,if aronson had received a patent on her keyholder,she would have received a royalty only on keyholders sold during the life of the patent,this example was counterfactual dicta,neither supported by any analysis nor necessary for the decision.
in short,were we writing on a clean slate,we might be inclined to read the dicta in aronson as nonbinding in light of what appears on its face to be a very limited holding in brulotte.by doing so,we would largely avoid attributing to the supreme court in brulotte and aronson the lack of economic logic laid at its feet by scheiber and a bevy of commentators.
nonetheless,every other circuit to consider brulotte has ignored the relevance of the restrictions on use and,in the process,read aronson as turning not on the absence of such restrictions or on the fact that the agreement was enacted before any patent issued but on the facts that a patent did not issue in that case and the underlying agreement provided for a lower royalty if no patent issued than if one did.see meehan at boggild,at pitney bowes,at.this consensus view may overread both brulotte and aronson for the reasons we have surveyed,and gives rise to the trenchant criticisms of the commentators and of the seventh circuit in scheiber.but the supreme court opinions are sufficiently opaque that we say with any certainty that the consensus view is wrong.as patent matters give rise to particularly strong national uniformity concerns,see,at,cong,citing the special need for national uniformity in the interpretation of patent law as support for the creation of the federal circuit,we hesitate more than is ordinarily the case to open up an conflict,see hale arizona,cir en banc for prudential reasons,we avoid unnecessary conflicts with other circuits.we therefore adopt the majority approach and consider not whether but the extent to which brulotte preempts state law with regard to a contract for payment of royalties on the sale of an invention that may be patented,if a patent indeed issues on the invention.
applying brulotte,the district court in this case found that the agreement was unlawful per se under federal patent law.it therefore granted summary judgment to the extent zila requests declaratory relief from liability under the agreement.in the subsequent order,however,the district court expanded its previous rulings.it interpreted brulotte as rendering the entire patent assignment agreement null and void,not just its provision of royalties after.faced with the question whether zila must pay tinnell royalties it admitted were due under a valid canadian patent,the district court determined that it need not,because,although the agreement purports to require the payment of royalties based upon the canadian patent,that agreement is unenforceable.
contrary to the district court conclusions,brulotte does not render an entire contract void and unenforceable merely because it includes an invalid licensing agreement.rather,brulotte renders unenforceable only that portion of a license agreement that demands royalty payments beyond the expiration of the patent for which the royalties are paid.see at.reversing the judgment below only insofar as it allows royalties to be collected which accrued after the last of the patents had expired emphasis added id.at.holding unenforceable an attempt to project the payment monopoly into a term after the expiration of the last of the patents emphasis added.we previously referenced this interpretation of brulotte scope in passing,see eng g geo.ashlock,cir,and it is not seriously in dispute.the parties agree,as has every appellate court to consider the question.see,scheiber dolby,cir pitney bowes,mestre,cir modrey american gage machine,cir.
the district court,however,read scheiber to support its conclusion that brulotte can render void contractual obligations to pay royalties on valid patents.in scheiber,the plaintiff owned a patent and a canadian patent.at.as part of a settlement agreement with the defendant,scheiber agreed to receive royalties on both patents through the end of the canadian patent term,which ended two years after the patent.id.the defendant,however,refused to pay royalties on any patent after it expired.id.at emphasis added.the seventh circuit,applying brulotte,found the contract unenforceable to the extent that the patentee extends the patent beyond the term fixed in the patent statute.id.at see also id.at describing brulotte as refusing enforcement to contracts for the payment of patent royalties after expiration of the patent emphasis added.accordingly,the relief granted by the court was not voiding the entire contract but rather a partial rescission of the license agreement.id.at emphasis added.although scheiber states later in the opinion that the contract is voided on grounds of illegality,id.at,and unenforceable,id.at,the context provided by the previous lengthy discussion,as well as the limited relief sought,makes clear that this is true only of the portion of the contract seeking to extend the patent,id.at,and not anything else.there is thus no support that for the notion that brulotte erects a general barrier to the enforcement of otherwise valid contract terms unless and until that last applicable patent expires.
unpaid canadian royalties 
nor does brulotte extend its powers to contracts for foreign patents.brulotte concerned patent rights in the united states,at.citing,which grants rights throughout the united states,and reflected the court fear that a patent holder would abuse his monopoly to extract payments beyond the term of that patent.at.the patent at issue in brulotte is an american one,and its dispositive effect on state contract law is a consequence of the supremacy clause.see id.at.p atents are in the federal domain.state law is not displaced merely because the contract relates to intellectual property which may or may not be patentable the states are free to regulate the use of such intellectual property in any manner not inconsistent with federal law.aronson,at.emphasis added.the rights and obligations bestowed by the international patent regime played thus no role in brulotte.
nor should they.the canadian patent is an entirely separate asset from the patent.see paris convention for the protection of industrial property,july,patents applied for in the various countries of the union shall be independent of patents obtained for the same invention in other countries.the fact that the asset is a foreign patent,as opposed to foreign real estate or other real property held outside the country,does nothing to change the propriety and competency of state contract law to dispose of it.brulotte has no international effect and only displaces state contract law with respect to royalty obligations related to patent rights.
in light of these observations,it is clear that summary judgment against tinnell on his claim for the unpaid canadian royalties was improper.even if the principle announced in brulotte were to obviate zila obligation to pay royalties on the patent once it expired,an issue we discuss below,it neither r
