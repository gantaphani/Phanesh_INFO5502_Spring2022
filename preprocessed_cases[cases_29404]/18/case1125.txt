background 
on april,daw,in need of capital,sold investors certain preferred convertible securities.prior to the sale,daw provided investors with various materials,including a copy of daw form for the year ended december,which contained a copy of daw december,financial statements financial statements.of import here,the financial statements were audited and given an unqualified opinion by grant thornton.the audit the standard language of the profession stated 
grant thornton has audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of daw technologies,and subsidiaries as of december,and,and the related consolidated statements of operations,shareholders equity,and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december.these financial statements are the responsibility of the company management.our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
we conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurances about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.an audit includes examining,on a test basis,evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
in our opinion,the financial statements referred to above present fairly,in all material respects,the consolidated financial position of daw technologies,and subsidiaries as of december,and,and the consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december,in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
starting in november and continuing for several months,daw made a series of public disclosures regarding its financial statements.in essence,the disclosures informed investors that the financial statements would be restated due to accounting problems daw had discovered with its european operations.the disclosures precipitated a downward trend in the price of daw stock.daw stock was ultimately from the nasdaq due to daw failure to file its quarterly disclosure,which was the result of its inability to effect a timely restatement of the financial statements.daw stock price plummeted further.on april,daw filed several form with the sec,which included copies of its restated financial statements and december,financial statements.
on april,investors filed suit,asserting a claim against grant thornton under section a and various other claims against daw directors.as to grant thornton,investors alleged that the financial statements do not present daw financial position fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap and that grant thornton therefore made a materially false and misleading statement when it opined that they did.
on june,pursuant to.b,grant thornton filed a motion to dismiss,raising two grounds for dismissal investors section a claim was not pled with the specificity required by the pslra and rule b and investors claim was time barred by the limitation period set forth in section c.the motion was denied.during a subsequent hearing a few months later,the district court reconsidered its prior ruling and granted grant thornton motion but also granted investors leave to amend their complaint.on january,investors filed the second amended complaint sac.
grant thornton moved to dismiss the sac on the grounds that investors had not cured the pleading deficiencies in their original section a claim and that the statute of limitation barred it in any event.after a hearing held on september,the district court granted the motion,dismissing investors claim with prejudice.this appeal followed.
discussion 
investors advance two arguments on appeal.they contend the district court erred in holding that they failed to plead,with the requisite level of particularity required by the pslra,all the elements of a section a claim,and the statute of limitation set forth in section c barred their claim.
section a and the pslra 
we review de novo a district court dismissal of a complaint for failure to plead a claim with specificity.see pirraglia novell,cir.in so doing,we apply the same standards as the district court.that is,all factual allegations in the complaint are accepted as true and viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.id.
to succeed under a section a claim,a plaintiff is required to plead and prove the defendant made or caused to be made a statement of material fact that was false or misleading at the time and in light of the circumstances under which it was made,the statement was contained in a document filed pursuant to the exchange act or any rule or regulation thereunder,reliance on the false statement,and resulting loss to the plaintiff.see a see also in re stone webster sec,cir.
in dismissing investors section a claim,the district court focused on the first element.it determined that,pursuant to the pslra,investors were required to plead facts giving rise to a strong inference that grant thornton made the alleged false or misleading statements with scienter.it explained in relevant part that 
an action under section a must comply with the provisions of the pslra which requires,in pertinent part,that a complaint shall,with respect to each act or omission alleged to violate this chapter,state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b investors and grant thornton disagree on whether scienter must be alleged to state a section a claim.the court previously ruled in support of grant thornton position and consistent with language in musick,peeler garrett employers ins.of wausau,d.as stated by this court in its bench ruling at the conclusion of the hearing on december,the supreme court in musick compared section to section b and stated all three causes of action,and b involve defendants who have violated the securities laws with scienter.id.at.plaintiffs have not convinced the court that its prior ruling was wrong.
at.the district court in turn held that the sac failed to meet this standard.
investors contend that the district court erred in holding that a claim under section a requires them to plead scienter.we agree.the district court reliance on musick,peeler garrett employers ins.of wausau,d in support of its holding is misplaced.the state of mind with which the defendant acted enters the case as a defense,to avoid liability under section a,the defendant must prove that he acted in good faith and did not know that the statement at issue was false or misleading.see a in re suprema specialties.sec,cir stone webster,at magna inv.john does,cir.
but our inquiry does not end there.because the legal sufficiency of a complaint is a question of law,we may affirm the district court dismissal order if we independently determine that investors failed to state a claim.issa comp usa,cir internal quotations,citations,and alterations omitted.as such,we now undertake our own determination of whether the factual allegations contained in the sac were adequate to state a claim under section a,considering the pleading requirements of the pslra.
we start by noting that the pslra certainly bears on the particularity with which a plaintiff is required to plead a section a claim.as noted,to survive a motion to dismiss such a claim,a plaintiff is required to plead that the defendant made or caused to be made a statement of material fact that was false or misleading at the time and in light of the circumstances under which it was made.see a as to whether a statement is false or misleading,the pslra pleading requirements are.it requires the complaint to specify each statement alleged to have been misleading,the reason why the statement is misleading,and if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief,the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.id.b stone webster,at,referring to these standards as the requirements throughout this opinion,we will refer to this provision of b as the pslra requirements.
investors argue that the sac easily satisfies these standards.investors start with the supposition that when an auditor certifies a company financial statements,which subsequently prove to contain a materially false or misleading statement,the auditor certification is itself a false and misleading statement within the meaning of section a.following that line of reasoning,they contend they fulfilled the statement requirement when they set forth in the sac grant thornton opinion that the financial statements present daw financial position fairly in conformity with gaap.they maintain that they satisfied the reason requirement when they specified how the financial statements were not so presented.and they urge they fulfilled the basis requirement by,for example,identifying the gaap standard applicable to a certain portion of the financials statements and showing how it was violated.in support of their contention,investors refer us to stone webster,wherein the first circuit allowed a class of a functionally similar method of proceed against a company auditor under section a.see at.
we find investors position unpersuasive and must respectfully disagree with the first circuit to the extent its holding in stone webster lends support thereto central to that holding is our determination that investors rest their pleading theory on a supposition that impermissibly reads certain,grant thornton audit report outside the context of their concomitant parts.
we recognize that an accountant who audits a public company financial statements has what the supreme court has emphasized is a special public responsibility.united states arthur young,d emphasis in original.and in view of the great reliance investors place on financial statements,it is almost axiomatic that an auditor independent scrutiny plays a necessary role in ensuring that the integrity of the securities markets will be preserved.see id.at.see also touche ross,cir breaches of professional responsibility jeopardize the achievement of the objectives of the securities laws and can inflict great damage on public investors in our complex society the accountant certificate and the lawyer opinion can be instruments for inflicting pecuniary loss more potent than the chisel or the crowbar.internal quotations and citations omitted.
but auditors do not certify a company financial statements in the sense that they guarantee or insure them.see aicpa,au see also alvin arens,randal elder mark beasley,auditing and assurance services,an integrated approach ed hereinafter arens arthur young,cir.nor do they,by virtue of auditing a company financial statements,somehow make,own or adopt the assertions contained therein.rather,the end product of an audit is the audit report,which usually contains three concomitant paragraphs the introduction,the scope and the opinion.a brief overview of these paragraphs,namely the first two,elucidates the relevant context in which grant thornton rendered its unqualified statement investors contend gives rise to section a liability.
in the introductory paragraph of the audit report,grant thornton explained that an opposed to another form of assurance services,a review or performed,identified the financial statements that were audited,and remarked that those statements are the responsibility of management.see.at aicpa,au b and c.important for the purposes of our discussion,grant thornton also stated that its responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on its audits.at emphasis added see aicpa,au c.
next,in the scope paragraph grant thornton made a factual statement about what it did in the audits.arens at.specifically,grant thornton stated that it conducted its audits in accordance with gaas.see.at aicpa,au d.it further represented that it planned and performed its audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements were free from material misstatements.see.at aicpa,au e.the use of the term reasonable connotes that an audit can not be expected to completely eliminate the possibility that a material misstatement will exist in the financial statements.see aicpa,au absolute assurance is not attainable because of the nature of audit evidence and the characteristics of fraud.in addition,grant thornton stated that it believe s that its audits provide a reasonable basis for its opinion.at emphasis added see aicpa,au g.
last,in the opinion paragraph grant thornton stated its conclusions with regards to daw financial statements,which were based on the audits it purportedly performed in conformity with gaas 
in our opinion,the financial statements present fairly,in all material respects,the consolidated financial position of daw technologies,and subsidiaries as of december,and,and the consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december,in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
the opinion paragraph,as the term suggests,is stated as an opinion of grant thornton rather than a statement of absolute fact or a guarantee.see arens at but see bily arthur young,et,cal th,d,finding auditor opinion a representation of fact in the negligent misrepresentation context actionable by client.moreover,the phrase in our opinion indicates that there may be some information risk associated with the financial statements,even though the statements have been audited.arens at.
investors conveniently attempt to read grant thornton opinion that the financial statements present daw financial position fairly in conformity with gaap as an isolated statement of material fact.that is,investors attempt to characterize it as a categorical statement separate from its stated basis.the audit report does not,however,allow for such a cropped reading.to the contrary,the audit report must be read in its entirety.when so read,it is readily apparent that the introductory paragraph tethers grant thornton opinion to its stated basis grant thornton factual assertion that its audits were performed in accordance with gaas and therefore provide an adequate basis for its opinion.it is against this backdrop that we must assess whether the sac satisfies the pslra requirements.
assuming arguendo that the sac satisfies the statement requirement by specifying grant thornton opinion as a false and misleading statement,it fails as to the reason requirement.because grant thornton opinion is couched in terms of a stated basis,a claim that the former is false or misleading must necessarily specify the reason or reasons why in terms of the latter.such a showing would,for example,specify how grant thornton did not actually form its opinion regarding the financial statements based on its audits or it did not have a reasonable basis for its opinion because it did not plan and perform its audits of the financial statements in accordance with gaas.we of course recognize that in assessing a motion to dismiss for insufficient pleading,we must read the sac in the manner most favorable to investors and draw reasonable inferences in their favor.pirraglia,at.but our review of the sac reveals that investors made no attempt to specify the reason or reasons why grant thornton opinion wa
