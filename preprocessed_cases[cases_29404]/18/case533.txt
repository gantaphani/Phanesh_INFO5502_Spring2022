the appellant appeals the dismissal of his qui tam suit for failure timely to serve process and to prosecute.we affirm.
in may,appellant sued appellee,a corporation,alleging claims under the qui tam provisions of the false claims act,the fca.in august,the united states filed its notice of election to decline intervention,stating that it would decline to intervene and directing the district court to the provision of the fca,id.b,that allows the relator to pursue the action in the name of the united states 
that same month,the court ordered the complaint,the government notice of declination,and its order unsealed and required that those documents be served on appellee.appellant,however,never served the complaint or any other documentation on appellee.nor did he take any other action in the case,such as filing motions or pleadings,seeking discovery,or notifying appellee of the pending claims,during the two years that the case remained unsealed and pending.
in may,an attorney for the united states informed appellee that a qui tam complaint had been filed against it.it was only through that conversation that appellee learned of appellant lawsuit that the district court had ordered unsealed months earlier.
in july,appellee filed a motion to dismiss under federal rules of civil procedure b and b and for failure to prosecute under federal rule of civil procedure b.appellee requested that the court dismiss with prejudice for failure to plead the fca claims with the particularity required by rules b and b and,alternatively,for failure to prosecute the lawsuit during the two years it had been unsealed.
in august,the court dismissed the complaint for failure to prosecute and was silent as to appellee grounds for dismissal based on rules b and b.despite appellee request that the dismissal be with prejudice,the court decline d to dismiss the case with prejudice and,in its discretion,dismisse d it instead without prejudice.
on appeal,appellant asserts that some of his fca claims could be under the act statute of limitations,and thus the dismissal without prejudice should be reviewed more stringently as a dismissal with prejudice as to the claims that would not be barred by limitations upon refiling,we treat the dismissal as without prejudice and affirm.federal rule of civil procedure m provides that if service of the summons and complaint is not made on a defendant within days after the filing of the complaint,the court,upon motion or its own initiative after notice to the plaintiff,shall dismiss the action without prejudice.appellant has been unable to show good cause why process has not been served during the two years after it was ordered by the court.he can refile these claims,because the statute of limitations has not yet run.
we treat the dismissal without prejudice as a dismissal with prejudice,however,as to appellant claims that would be barred by limitations.berry,at.rule b dismissals with prejudice will be affirmed only on a showing of a clear record of delay or contumacious conduct by the plaintiff,and where lesser sanctions would not serve the best interests of justice.
appellant argues that a dismissal with prejudice is appropriate only if,in addition to the two requisite factors described above,one of several aggravating factors is also found.the aggravating factors are the extent to which the plaintiff,as distinguished from his counsel,was personally responsible for the delay,the degree of actual prejudice to the defendant,and whether the delay was the result of intentional conduct.rogers,at.
we disagree with appellant contention that,to affirm a dismissal with prejudice,an aggravating factor must be present the presence of requisite factors can alone justify dismissal.id.we have stated that aggravating factors must usually be found we have not said they must always be found 
in any event,at least two aggravating factors are present in this case.first,there is actual prejudice to the defendant.we found similar actual prejudice resulting from failure to serve process within the statute of limitations period in veazey young yacht sale,cir.unit a may,although we did not use the term aggravating factor.nonetheless,in rogers,at,we noted that veazey had all the three aggravating factors 
in veazey,we explained that failure to serve process within the statute of limitations period is extremely prejudicial because it affects all the defendant preparations 
we view a delay between filing and service as being more likely to result in prejudice than a delay occurring after service,for in the former situation the defendant is not put on formal notice and allowed a full opportunity to discover and preserve relevant evidence when the matter is still relatively fresh and the evidence is intact and available.
veazey,at.delay alone can result in prejudice if the statute of limitations has run e vidence deteriorates or disappears,memories fade,and witnesses die or move away.id.further,if the statute has run,a potential defendant that has not been served is entitled to expect that it will no longer have to defend the claim if service can be delayed indefinitely once the complaint is filed within the statutory period,these expectations are defeated and the statute of limitations no longer protects defendants from stale claims.id.
another aggravating factor that is present here is that the delay could have only been intentional.appellee is a corporation with a known address.therefore,appellant counsel could not have encountered any hardship in perfecting service.as we explained in veazey,in light of a prolonged delay and despite the habitual slow movement of cases in the district,we can only conclude that counsel intentionally failed to cause effectuation of service when the furnishing of information for service of process is a simple task 
the explanations offered by plaintiff counsel,including the move of his office location,the transfer of the case from the docket of one judge to the docket of another,and the suggested habitual slow movement of cases in the district do not justify the extent of inaction we perceive in this record.the furnishing of information for proper service of process was not that difficult or laborious a task.we can only conclude that counsel intentionally failed to cause effectuation of service.
veazey,at.further,appellant has not missed the deadline by only a day or a week or two,but by almost days.therefore,the delay is not a simple inadvertence.
appellant contends he was not informed about the delay by his attorney.it is,however,that a party is bound by the acts of his attorney.link wabash,d.also,although it is true that this case has had periods of inactivity in the past,when before the unsealing the government took two years to make a decision with respect to intervention,it would be unreasonable for appellant to expect similar delays after the unsealing.after the unsealing,appellant retained new counsel,and the burden to prosecute rested solely on appellant,not the government.
one does not have to be legally sophisticated to understand that if he is the only plaintiff in the case and does not hear from his attorney for almost two years,his case is not being diligently prosecuted.we believe that there comes a point at which the deficiency in counsel performance puts the plaintiff on notice that,unless a new lawyer is obtained,the very continuation of the lawsuit is threatened.callip harris county child welfare dep t,cir affirming dismissal with prejudice.
moreover,the issue of whether the delay was the result of intentional conduct does not depend on whether the intentional conduct was by the party as distinguished from his attorney.rather,as explained,conduct by the attorney is sufficient there is a separate aggravating factor dealing with delay attributable to the party,rather than his attorney.
with respect to the requisite factors,there is a a clear record of delay in this case almost two years of total inactivity on appellant side the other requisite factor is also present.as we explained in veazey,
a delay between filing and service ordinarily is to be viewed more seriously than a delay of a like period of time occurring
