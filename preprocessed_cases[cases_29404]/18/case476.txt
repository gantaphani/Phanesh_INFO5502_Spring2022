frank porter stansberry and pirate investor llc collectively,appellants offered and sold an stock tip.the offer and the tip contained representations that information in both documents was the product of conversations with a senior executive inside the company that was the focus of the tip.after conducting a bench trial,the district court concluded that the representations concerning the source of information in the stock tip were false,and it determined that appellants had violated section b of the securities exchange act of,b west,and rule promulgated thereunder,by offering and selling the stock tip.the district court ordered disgorgement of appellants profits from the sales of the stock tip,imposed civil penalties,and issued an injunction against future violations of section b and rule appellants argue that the facts of this case do not support the district court finding of liability,and that the injunction against future violations of b is overbroad.for the following reasons,we affirm.
pirate investor llc is a maryland limited liability company that publishes investment newsletters pirate also provides an service to its subscribers called the blast.pirate is wholly owned by agora,a maryland corporation that publishes books,magazines,and newsletters covering a wide range of topics stansberry is the of pirate,and in this capacity he writes and publishes investment newsletters.
sometime in april,stansberry became aware of a company called usec.usec is a provider of services that began as an arm of the united states government the company currently is the executive agent of the united states government under a disarmament pact that was signed between the united states and russia in.under the pact,known as megatons to megawatts,russia sells uranium that was formerly used in soviet nuclear warheads to the united states for use as fuel in nuclear power plants.the pact further requires usec and oao techsnabexport tenex,its russian counterpart,to periodically renegotiate the price of the uranium.any new pricing agreement is subject to approval by both the united states and russian governments.the pricing agreement between usec and tenex expired at the end of,and the two companies negotiated a new agreement in february of.neither the russian nor the united states governments had approved this new agreement as of may,however,and usec requested that the united states government place the pricing agreement on the agenda for a summit between president george bush and russian president vladimir putin that was planned for that month.
after becoming aware of the circumstances surrounding usec pricing agreement,stansberry contacted steven wingfield,usec director of investor relations,and on may,conducted a telephone interview with wingfield.this case revolves around two special report on usec usec special report and a solicitation hawking that report super insider tip that stansberry prepared following that telephone conversation.
the super insider tip was a promotional document calling on investors to double your money on may with this super insider tip.at.specifically,the document purported to contain information obtained from a senior company executive that would allow investors to know exactly when a major international agreement between the united states and russia would be concluded,resulting in substantial profits for a particular company.at.the document identified may as the day the deal would close and inveigled investors with assurances that t his is the kind of insider information that could make you a lot of money.at.
the super insider tip also included some back ground on the company,as well as details of how the upcoming deal would benefit the company the document did not provide the name of the company.for that nugget of information,investors were told that they would have to pay.stansberry signed the under the pseudonym jay mcdaniel.
those who responded to the super insider tip and paid would receive the usec special report.this communication identified usec as the company referenced in the super insider tip.the usec special report engaged in a financial analysis of usec fundamentals and discussed its role as the united states agent under the disarmament pact.it observed that usec had reached an agreement with its russian partner regarding a pricing agreement for nuclear fuel,but cautioned that implementation of the agreement is subject to review and approval by the and russian governments.at.the usec special report then repeated the claim made in the super insider tip that a usec senior executive has assured me that the new russian agreement will be approved prior to the upcoming summit.in fact,he said watch the stock on may.at.
on may,stansberry sent the super insider tip to the pirate investor blast database,a list of addresses of subscribers to pirate products.after an initial favorable response stansberry caused the super insider tip to be sent to numerous other electronic databases associated with agora products,as well as at least one database that had no affiliation with agora.ultimately,over individuals received the super insider tip.investors purchased copies of the usec special report,resulting in net proceeds of.pirate received of that sum.
of course,what investors did not know,and what became the focus of the sec case against stansberry and pirate,was that wingfield had never told stansberry that approval of the pricing agreement would be announced on may indeed,nothing was announced on may,and the pricing agreement was ultimately announced on june.on april,the united states securities and exchange commission sec filed a civil complaint charging agora,pirate,and stansberry with securities fraud under b of the securities exchange act of.following a bench trial,the district court concluded that appellants violated b by falsely claiming that a company insider provided the information in the super insider tip and the usec special report.appellants were held jointly and severally liable for disgorgement of the profits of the scheme,plus prejudgment interest.civil penalties were also imposed on appellants,and the district court entered a permanent injunction enjoining them from further violations of b appellants timely appealed,raising three issues whether the conduct in this case constituted a violation of b whether,if the conduct here does fall within the purview of b,the first amendment entitles appellants to the heightened protections it affords the media in other contexts and whether the permanent injunction entered by the district court is an improper prior restraint on speech.
we begin with appellants claim that their conduct did not constitute a violation of b.in a civil enforcement action under b,the sec must establish that the defendant made a false statement or omission of material fact with scienter in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.mcconville sec,cir.the sec bears the burden of establishing each element by a preponderance of the evidence.herman maclean huddleston,d preponderance of the evidence standard applies to b actions.we address each element in turn.
section b requires that a defendant act deceptively in order to fall within the coverage of the statute.santa fe,green,d the language of b gives no indication that congress meant to prohibit any conduct not involving manipulation or deception.deceptive acts include misstatements,omissions by those with a duty to disclose,manipulative trading practices,and deceptive courses of conduct.stoneridge inv.partners,llc,d.the facts of this case easily satisfy this element.the district court found that wingfield never told stansberry that approval of the pricing agreement would be announced on may,and the appellants do not challenge that finding on appeal.thus,appellants representations that they based their predictions on information obtained from a source within usec were misstatements of fact 
it is not enough,however,for the sec to point to a false misrepresentation must concern a material fact.see basic levinson,d it is not enough that a statement is false or incomplete,if the misrepresented fact is otherwise insignificant.greenhouse mcg capital,cir the plain language of rule requires any successful suit to allege a fact that is both untrue and material.we have adopted the following standard for addressing materiality 
a fact stated or omitted is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable purchaser or seller of a security would consider the fact important in deciding whether to buy or sell the security or would have viewed the total mix of information made available to be significantly altered by disclosure of the fact.
longman food lion,cir.determining whether the facts of a particular case meet this standard requires delicate assessments of the inferences a reasonable shareholder would draw from a given set of facts and the significance of those inferences to him,and these assessments are peculiarly ones for the trier of fact.tsc,northway,d.accordingly,we review for clear error the district court determination,made after a bench trial,that appellants misrepresentations were material.see miller thane int l,cir reviewing district court findings on materiality for clear error sec merchant capital,llc,cir same lawton nyman,cir same sec maio,cir same.
applying that standard,we see no clear error in the district court finding of materiality.appellants promised investors that the information they were receiving was the product of a conversation with a company insider.the materiality determination thus turns on whether the reasonable investor would treat a particular stock recommendation differently depending on whether or not the recommender was acting on inside information.we fail to see any clear error in the district court determination that an investor would consider this question important in deciding whether to purchase the recommended security.bankshares,sandberg,d noting that statements by directors raise no serious question of materiality because directors usually have knowledge and expertness far exceeding the normal investor resources.moreover,purchasers of the usec special report testified that it was important to them that the information conveyed in the report came from a source inside usec,and that this characteristic influenced them to purchase the report and,subsequently,usec stock.see harris union,cir finding no error in jury determination of materiality where the jury heard testimony from various purchasers and market experts alton box board goldman,sachs,cir noting the relevance of testimony from sophisticated institutional purchasers that omitted facts would have been important to them.in short,we find no clear error in the district court conclusion that the misstatements in this case concerned material facts.
next,we consider whether appellants acted with the requisite intent,or scienter.t he term scienter refers to a mental state embracing intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud.ernst ernst hochfelder,d.the sec meets its burden of proving scienter by establishing that the speaker acted intentionally or recklessly the negligent speaker,however,avoids liability.ottmann hanger orthopedic group,cir.here,the district court determined that the sec met its burden of proving that stansberry acted with the requisite intent,and the court imputed stansberry scienter to pirate 
in challenging the district court scienter determination,appellants contend that the first amendment protections recognized by the supreme court in new york times sullivan,d,apply to this case.they claim that the sec needed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that they acted with actual malice.to support this claim,they direct us to bose consumers union of united states,d,a case involving the application of the new york times standard to a product disparagement action.
in bose,the supreme court was concerned with determining the proper standard of review for courts of appeals to apply when confronted with a district court finding that a particular statement was made with the actual malice required by new york times.after determining that the constitution requires independent appellate review of t he question whether the evidence in the record in a defamation case is of the convincing clarity required to strip the utterance of first amendment protection,id.at,the bose court moved on to a review of the facts of that case and noted that the only evidence of actual malice on which the district court relied was the fact that the statement was an inaccurate description of what the defendant had actually perceived,id.at.the bose court then held that the defendant statement fell within the protections afforded by the first amendment.id.at.
relying on the bose court statement that there is a significant difference between proof of actual malice and mere proof of falsity,id.at,appellants argue that we can not uphold the district court resolution of the scienter issue because the district court confused proof of falsity with proof of fault.appellants br.at.they claim that there is no evidence in the record to support the district court finding of scienter,absent the falsity of the claim that an insider provided the information on which they based the tip,and implore us to follow bose lead by holding that an absence of additional evidence of intent necessarily means that the clear and convincing evidence standard mandated by new york times has not been satisfied.
as we discuss elsewhere in this opinion,see infra part iii,we do not believe that the new york times standard is applicable to this case.thus,we reject appellants argument insofar as it relies on the mistaken belief that the sec needed to prove intent by clear and convincing evidence,rather than under the preponderance of the evidence standard typically applicable to civil enforcement actions under b.similarly,we reject the notion that independent appellate review of the district court scienter determination is necessary under bose and instead review the district court finding that appellants acted with scienter for clear error.see merchant capital,at questions of scienter are reviewable under the clearly erroneous rule see also healey chelsea,cir matters of misrepresentation,knowledge,reliance,causation,and scienter are questions of fact,and the trial court findings as to those facts may not be set aside unless they are clearly erroneous.
after reviewing the record,we are convinced that the district court conclusion that appellants acted with scienter was not clearly erroneous.the district court rested its conclusion on the circumstances surrounding the phone call between stansberry and wingfield.having concluded that wingfield did not,in fact,disclose to stansberry that approval of the pricing agreement would be announced on may,the district court simply inferred that stansberry,having been a party to that conversation,must have known that his claim that he had heard from a senior usec executive that the announcement would occur on may was false.the district court surmised that stansberry could not possibly have had a belief that the information he provided in the super insider solicitation and special report was correct in all material respects because he knew full well that wingfield had not told him that the pricing agreement would be announced on may.at.
we see nothing clearly erroneous about this conclusion.the district court did not premise its finding on the falsity of the statements,but on the fact that stansberry was in a position to know whether or not his statements were true.as other courts have recognized,the fact that a defendant publishes statements when in possession of facts suggesting that the statements are false is classic evidence of scienter.aldridge cross,cir see also.state bd.of admin.green tree fin,cir one of the classic fact patterns giving rise to a strong inference of scienter is that defendants published statements when they knew facts or had access to information suggesting that their public statements were materially inaccurate.stansberry,having conducted the interview with wingfield,would have known whether or not wingfield told him to watch the stock on may.once the district court found that wingfield never made such a statement,there is nothing controversial in drawing the logical stansberry would know that his claim was false 
in addition,it would take an act of willful blindness to ignore the fact that appellants profited from the false statements.appellants surely knew that absent claims of insider knowledge,it is highly unlikely that investors would pay for a stock recommendation.this inference is borne out by the emphasis that the solicitation placed on the inside nature of the tip as it encouraged investors to purchase the usec special report.given such a clear financial motive for the misrepresentations,the district court conclusion that they were made with scienter is hardly surprising.the clear error standard of review demands something much more egregious than what confronts us here.parts motors,sterling,cir to be clearly erroneous,a decision must strike us as wrong with the force of a,unrefrigerated dead fish.
finally,we turn to b fourth requirement,the in connection with requirement.appellants claim that the fraud in this case did not make the necessary connection to securities transactions because appellants did not trade in usec stock or breach any fiduciary duties.we disagree,and for the reasons discussed below we find no error in the district court determination that appellants committed fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.
the supreme court has consistently embraced an expansive reading of b s in connection with requirement.sec wolfson,cir see also sec zandford,d in its role enforcing the act,the sec has consistently adopted a broad reading of the phrase in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.we construe the statute not technically and restrictively,but flexibly to effectuate its remedial purposes.zandford,at.internal quotation marks omitted.under supreme court case law,fraudulent activity meets the in connection with requirement of b whenever it touches or coincides with a securities transaction.merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,dabit,d under our precedents,it is enough that the fraud alleged coincide with a securities by the plaintiff or by someone else.superintendent of ins.of bankers life cas,d holding in connection with requirement satisfied where injury occurred as a result of deceptive practices touching a sale of securities.
of course,to say that a fraud is in connection with a securities transaction whenever it coincides with that trans action hardly clarifies the matter.we find direction in several factors that other courts have considered relevant when determining whether the in connection with requirement has been satisfied in a particular case.these factors include,but are not limited to whether a securities sale was necessary to the completion of the fraudulent scheme,zandford,at.whether the parties relationship was such that it would necessarily involve trading in securities,rowinski salomon smith barney,cir whether the defendant intended to induce a securities transaction,united int l holdings,wharf holdings,cir,aff,d and whether material misrepresentations were disseminated to the public in a medium upon which a reasonable investor would rely,semerenko cendant,cir.importantly,these factors are not mandatory requirements that a fraud must satisfy in order to meet b in connection with requirement.they exist merely to guide the inquiry,and we do not presume to exclude other factors that could help distinguish between fraud in the securities industry and common law fraud that happens to involve securities.see zandford,at.see also stoneridge inv.partners.at though b is not limited to preserving the integrity of the securities markets,it does not reach all commercial transactions that are fraudulent and affect the price of a security in some attenuated way.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.moreover,a fraud need not satisfy all of the factors to be in connection with a securities transaction a close fit with one factor may well be enough for a fraud to result in b liability.the application of the factors should be rooted in the understanding that the in connection with requirement is a flexible one and that questions concerning its scope are best examined on a basis.see semerenko,at noting that the scope of the in connection with requirement must be determined on a basis chem.bank arthur andersen,cir in cases near the borderline,courts have warned that i t is important that the standard be fleshed out by a cautious approach.quoting smallwood pearl brewing,cir.
we first consider whether a securities transaction was necessary to the completion of the fraudulent scheme.in zandford,for example,the supreme court noted that the stock sales in that case were a fundamental component of the defendant fraudulent scheme 
e ach sale was made to further respondent fraudulent scheme each was deceptive because it was neither authorized by,nor disclosed to,the woods.with regard to the sales of shares in the woods mutual fund,respondent initiated these transactions by writing a check to himself from that account,knowing that redeeming the check would require the sale of securities.
zandford,at.see also alley miramon,cir t he in connection with test is satisfied when the proscribed conduct and the sale are part of the same fraudulent scheme.in re franklin mut.funds fee,d,t he only way for this scheme to succeed was for investors to purchase securities shares of the defendant mutual funds.
appellants argue that the fraud in this case was complete when investors purchased the usec special report because the purchase price was the only material benefit that appellants received.under this theory of the case,appellants derived no benefit from the purchasers securities trading.they claim 
t he alleged fraud was consummated and concluded when the report was sold and the reader paid.if there was a fraudulent scheme,no subsequent securities transactions were necessary to it,as neither the publisher nor the author derived any benefit from such trading.indeed,the defendants would have committed fraud if not a single purchaser of the report bought usec shares,or if the report named a fictitious company with a fictitious ticker symbol,because they still would have defrauded readers of the cost of the publication.
reply br.at.we believe that this is a rather view of the fraudulent scheme and,taking the facts in the light most favorable to the sec,we conclude that appellants did benefit from securities trading by purchasers of the usec special report.
first,appellants characterization of the fraud fails to recognize that appellants used stock purchases by early purchasers of the usec special report as a way of enhancing the credibility of the report.over investors received the super insider tip that offered the usec special report for sale,but they did not receive the solicitation at the same time.rather,appellants sent out the solicitation in waves to various groups of investors.and,later versions of the solicitation pointed to a rise in usec stock the district court determined was the result of purchases by early recipients of the solicitation and special supporting the trustworthiness of the tip.
when stansberry first circulated the solicitation to the pirate investor blast database,on may,the solicitation noted that the stock was only a stock.at.on may,however,stansberry edited the solicitation to reflect a change in the stock price.future versions of the reflected the stock updated price of a share.moreover,and most importantly,future versions of the solicitation used this jump in price as a selling point.the pointed out that the stock in question has jumped this week and looks poised to go much higher,and quickly followed with an offer to sell the identity of the company for.at.thus,the rising stock was important to the success of the scheme because it served to motivate later purchasers to part with their requisite payment.the fraud was not complete when investors paid to learn the identity of the company in question appellants also needed those investors to purchase the stock thereby increasing the stock price so as to boost the credibility of the solicitation to obtain more payments.
these facts are similar to those that the third circuit faced in rowinski.in that case,salomon smith barney,a stock brokerage and investment firm,allegedly provided research that was unlawfully biased in favor of the firm investment banking clients,to the detriment of its retail brokerage customers.rowinski,at.specifically,the plaintiffs alleged that salomon smith barney systematically misrepresented the value of securities to investors who used the firm retail brokerage services in order to curry favor with investment banking clients and reap hundreds of millions of dollars in investment banking fees.id.at.seeking to avoid the provisions of the securities litigation uniform standards act of slusa,which provides for the removal and federal preemption of certain state court class actions alleging a misrepresentation or omission of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security,f a west,the plaintiffs argued that the fraud in that case did not occur in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.
much like appellants argument that the conduct in this case sounds in common law fraud,the plaintiffs in rowinski argued that their complaint stated a straightforward breach of contract claim,salomon smith barney agreed to provide unbiased investment research and failed to provide it.rowinski,at.the third circuit disagreed,observing 
for this purported scheme to work,investors must purchase the misrepresented securities.absent purchases by duped investors and a corresponding inflation in the share price,salomon smith barney biased analysis would fail to benefit its banking clients and,in turn,would fail to yield hundreds of mil lions of dollars in investment banking fees.the scheme,in other words,necessarily coincides with the purchase or sale of securities.
rowinski,at.in other words,the alleged fraud was not confined to the firm representations to individual court realized that the stock purchases of investors who acted on that advice would lead to third parties,the companies,providing a benefit to the firm.likewise,in this case appellants used the inflation in the stock price caused by investors who purchased usec stock in reliance on early versions of the usec special report to influence third who received the updated versions of the purchase copies of the usec special report.thus,securities transactions helped appellants to maximize the profitability of their scheme.
in addition,the record shows that appellants were not only relying on the rise in usec stock price to boost the credibility of this particular stock recommendation.they expected that the rise in usec price would lead to a general increase in appellants reputation as trusted purveyors of internet investment advice.the fraud ultimate success involved not only the purchase price,but also the boost in reputation that would accrue with those who purchased stock in reliance on the reputational gain that would lead to future purchases of future reports on different companies.as stansberry noted in an,i f we able to sell this to people and it works,we be able to charge almost whatever we want next time.at emphasis added.in effect,appellants own definition of success depended on people purchasing securities in reliance on the report.
the next factor that we the parties relationship was such that it would necessarily involve trading in in favor of appellants.appellants sold investment advice ultimately,the decision to purchase securities rested squarely with those who received the solicitation and usec special report.in this respect,appellants differ from the defendant in zandford.in that case the defendant,a broker,possessed a general power of by his him to engage in securities transactions on their behalf.at.the very purpose of the relationship is trading in securities.rowinski,at.no such relationship existed in this case.
indeed,we believe that the lack of a trading relationship serves to distinguish this case from one of the cases relied on by the sec and the district court,sec terry tips,d.like appellants,the defendant in terry tips was an online financial advisor who made trading recommendations.id.at.significantly,however,the sec case against the defendant in terry tips revolved around misrepresentations relating to the defendant provision of services.in an arrangement,subscribers authorize an online financial adviser to direct trades on their customers often are not aware of the trades until after they have already occurred in such a scenario,the adviser is no longer merely a purveyor of information to investors who can choose to invest or not invest.rather,in such a relationship investors explicitly delegate their authority to the online investment advisor the parties relationship becomes one that would necessarily contemplate trading in securities.the parties in this case contemplated no such arrangement.
the third factor we consider is whether appellants made their misrepresentations with the intent to induce a securities transaction.compare united int l holdings,at representations made with the purpose of inducing the purchase of an option are made in connection with the purchase or sale of a security,and sec jakubowski,cir statements made directly to the issuer in order to induce the issuer to accept an offer to purchase satisfy the in connection with requirement,with ketchum green,cir in connection with requirement unsatisfied where the purpose of the deception was not to cause a securities transaction.see also zandford,at.noting defendant secret intent to keep the proceeds from sales of his client stock sec rana research,cir noting that defendant intended to affect the market for the stock.on this point we find no error in the district court conclusion that t he very essence of the fraudulent scheme was to induce its victims to purchase usec stock prior to may,at.we have already discussed how securities purchases by recipients of the misrepresentations would inure to the benefit of appellants,and we believe that the text of the usec special report itself forecloses any argument that appellants did not intend for investors to purchase securities in reliance on the false statements.
the usec special report,which,it bears repeating,appellants sent to investors after those investors had parted with their,repeated the false claim that a usec senior executive has assured me that the new russian agreement will be approved prior to the upcoming summit.in fact,he said watch the stock on may.at.the report also called upon investors to call your broker now and tell him to buy shares of usec.at.this raises the question if,as appellants claim,the misrepresentations were only intended to induce investors to purchase the usec special report,why were they repeated in the report itself,which directly called investors to action the record evidence compels the conclusion that appellants intended the recipients of the solicitation and the usec special report to trade in securities.
finally,we turn to the factor that the district court primarily relied on in making its determination that the fraud satisfied the in connection with appellants utilized a device that would cause reasonable investors to rely thereon and so relying,cause them to purchase or sell a corporation securities.in re.sec,cir internal quotations omitted.this standard is derived from a second circuit opinion,sec texas gulf sulphur,cir en banc.in texas gulf,the second circuit held that rule is violated whenever assertions are made in a manner reasonably calculated to influence the investing public id.at.subsequent decisions have refined texas gulf,and several circuits now agree that 
where the fraud alleged involves public dissemination in a document such as a press release,annual report,investment prospectus or other such document on which an investor would presumably rely,the in connection with requirement is generally met by proof of the means of dissemination and the materiality of the misrepresentation or omission.
rana research,at see also wolfson,at semerenko,at.
under the texas gulf standard,the sec must establish two distinct elements the misrepresentations in question were disseminated to the public in a medium upon which a reasonable investor would rely
