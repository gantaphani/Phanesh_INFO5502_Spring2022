opinion of the court 
richard fraser,an independent insurance agent for nationwide mutual insurance company,was terminated by nationwide as an agent.we decide whether he has stated a viable claim for wrongful termination under pennsylvania law he is entitled to damages under the electronic communications privacy act and parallel pennsylvania law for nationwide alleged unauthorized access to his account an agents review board process reviewing his termination was properly conducted a provision in his agency agreement is enforceable and the district court abused its discretion in refusing to allow fraser to amend his complaint and in not sanctioning nationwide for alleged discovery violations.we affirm the district court on all but the and discovery violations issues.as to the former,we remand to the district court for reconsideration in light of new caselaw from the pennsylvania supreme court.we also remand fraser discovery sanctions claim,which the district court did not address.
background 
this dispute stems from nationwide september,termination of fraser agent agreement the agreement.it provided that fraser sell insurance policies as an independent contractor for nationwide on an exclusive basis.the relationship was terminable at will by either party.
the parties disagree on the reason for fraser termination.fraser argues nationwide terminated him because he filed complaints with the pennsylvania attorney general office regarding nationwide allegedly illegal conduct,including its discriminatory refusal to write car insurance for unmarried and new drivers fraser also contends that he was terminated for criticizing nationwide while acting as an officer of the nationwide insurance independent contractors association the contractors association and for attempting to obtain the passage of legislation in pennsylvania to ensure that independent insurance agents could be terminated only for just cause.
nationwide argues,however,that it terminated fraser because he was disloyal.it points out that fraser drafted a letter to two insurance company erie and zurich american insurance zurich expressing contractors association members dissatisfaction with nationwide and seeking to determine whether erie and zurich would be interested in acquiring the policyholders of the agents in the contractors association.fraser claims that the letters only were drafted to get nationwide attention and were not sent.were the letters sent.however,they would constitute a violation of the exclusive representation provision of fraser agreement with nationwide.
when nationwide learned about these letters,it claims that it became concerned that fraser might also be revealing company secrets to its competitors.it therefore searched its main file which all of fraser was any to or from fraser that showed similar improper behavior nationwide general counsel testified that the search confirmed fraser disloyalty.therefore,on the basis of the two letters and the search,nationwide terminated fraser agreement.it is this search of his that gives rise to fraser claim for damages under the electronic communications privacy act of ecpa,et,and a parallel pennsylvania statute,et.
after nationwide terminated fraser in september,he filed an appeal with the agents administrative review board the board.fraser agreement with nationwide provides that the agent shall have access to the agents administrative review board,and its procedures,as it may exist from time to time.the agreement did not,however,specify any particular procedures that the board would follow,nor did it guarantee the availability of board review.board procedures were laid out in the agents compensation and security handbook the handbook,which stated explicitly that the procedures were not part of the agreement between an agent and nationwide.in considering fraser case,the board split,and nationwide employee,acting as the tiebreaker,affirmed fraser termination.fraser argues that the review process was a sham and contends that nationwide conducted the review process in bad faith.
within a year of his termination,fraser went to work for a competitor of nationwide,thereby triggering a provision in his agreement.that provision specifies that an agent will forfeit deferred compensation by becoming employed by another insurance business within a mile radius within one year of cancellation of the agent agreement.fraser contends that,because of the provision,he forfeited several hundred thousand dollars of deferred compensation he argues that the provision is invalid under pennsylvania law because it is unduly restrictive.
as a result of these events,fraser filed suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania to contest his termination the alleged violation of his privacy rights under the ecpa and parallel pennsylvania statute the board review procedure and the provision in his agreement.events during litigation in the district court also have spawned issues on appeal.first,fraser alleges that nationwide committed numerous discovery violations.he claims that i t is no hyperbole to state that in this case,no discovery was received from nationwide without a court order compelling discovery,no court order compelling discovery from nationwide went unviolated and more than one nationwide witness was less than candid.on this basis,fraser seeks discovery sanctions against nationwide.second,the district court denied fraser leave to amend his complaint a third time to add two more causes of action conversion and invasion of privacy.the court believed that fraser third amendment was merely a dilatory tactic because he sought leave to amend the day before fraser response to nationwide motion for summary judgment was due.the court granted summary judgment for nationwide on all counts.fraser appeals 
ii.discussion 
wrongful termination claim 
whether pennsylvania grants a cause of action for wrongful termination in this context is a question of law,over which we exercise plenary review.borse piece goods shop,cir.fraser argues that,notwithstanding that his agency relationship with reliance was,his termination was wrongful and actionable because it was motivated by his agitations for nationwide found undesirable,his reporting of nationwide allegedly illegal activities,and his leadership position in the contractors association.he notes that,while the general rule is that employees may be terminated for any or no reason,courts have forbidden the firing of employees when doing so would offend pennsylvania public policy.see geary steel.he asserts that his termination fits this exception.nationwide responds that fraser was not an employee but rather an independent contractor,and thus the cases prescribing this public policy exception do not apply here.
because no pennsylvania case addresses whether there are limitations on a company ability to terminate an independent contractor as opposed to an employee,the district court assumed arguendo that the public policy cases apply equally to independent contractors.we too proceed by so assuming without deciding the question.
we begin by noting that pennsylvania courts have construed the public policy exception to employment narrowly,lest the exception swallow the general rule.see clay advanced computer applications,exceptions to the rule that terminations from positions may not be challenged have been recognized in only the most limited of circumstances,where discharges of employees would threaten clear mandates of public policy.in hennessy santiago,a pennsylvania court recognized three limited circumstances in which public policy will trump employment.a n employer can not require an employee to commit a crime and fire the employee for refusing to do so,can not prevent an employee from complying with a statutorily imposed duty,and can not discharge an employee when specifically prohibited from doing so by statute.id.at internal citation omitted.the pennsylvania supreme court has never formally adopted hennessy three exceptions to the employment doctrine.however,in shick shirey,the supreme court did say that public policy is not limited to that which has been legislatively enacted.id.at.but it also went on to note that a expressed public policy must be extremely clear to be cognizable in this context indeed acceptance must be virtually universal.quoting mamlin genoe,it stated 
it is only when a given policy is so obviously for or against the public health,safety,morals or welfare that there is a virtual unanimity of opinion in regard to it,that a court may constitute itself the voice of the community in so declaring.there must be a positive,universal public sentiment,deeply integrated in the customs of and beliefs of the people and in their conviction of what is just and right and in the interests of the public weal.
shick,at quoting mamlin,at.
fraser argues that his case fits within hennessy first two exceptions nationwide fired him for refusing to commit a crime and for his attempt to comply with a statutorily imposed duty.we find these arguments unconvincing.even assuming that the pennsylvania supreme court would also view these as exceptions to an employer right to fire an employee,fraser has presented no evidence that nationwide directed him to commit any crime,nor has he pointed us to any statutory duty to report nationwide violations of the law.compare field philadelphia electric,holding termination wrongful when employee had a statutory duty to report violations,with hennessy santiago,rejecting the argument that a counselor could not be fired because she reported a rape of another to the district attorney because the employee had no statutory duty to report the rape.
fraser also relies on shick pronouncement that public policy may be broader than what is legislatively enacted.he notes that in novosel nationwide insurance,cir,we held that firing an employee for his refusal to participate in a political lobbying effort contravened public policy and therefore was impermissible.in light of novosel,fraser asserts we should view the first amendment of the united states constitution and the pennsylvania constitution as limitations on employers discretion to fire employees.yet we have declined to read novosel so broadly and,indeed,have previously rejected fraser position.in borse,we noted that the superior court has refused to extend constitutional provisions designed to restrict governmental conduct in the absence of state action.borse,at citing martin capital cities media,cisco united parcel.we predict ed that if faced with the issue,the pennsylvania supreme court would not look to the first amendment as a source of public policy when there is no state action.id.at.moreover,we note that pennsylvania courts have repeatedly rejected claims that a private employer as opposed to a public employer violated public policy by firing an employee for whistleblowing,when the employee was under no legal duty to report the acts at issue.donahue fed.express,as a result,we have essentially limited novosel to its firing based on forced political speech.
in this context,we predict that the pennsylvania supreme court would decline to find a cause of action for termination under fraser circumstances and hence affirm the district court on this ground.
ecpa claims and parallel state law claims 
fraser argues that,by accessing his on its central file server without his express permission,nationwide violated title i of the ecpa,which prohibits intercepts of electronic communications such as the statute defines an intercept as the aural or other acquisition of the contents of any wire,electronic,or oral communication through the use of any electronic,mechanical,or other device.nationwide argues that it did not intercept fraser within the meaning of title i because an intercept can only occur contemporaneously with transmission and it did not access fraser at the initial time of transmission.
on this matter of statutory interpretation which we review de novo,moody sec.pac.bus.credit,cir,we agree with nationwide.every circuit court to have considered the matter has held that an intercept under the ecpa must occur contemporaneously with transmission.see united states steiger,cir konop hawaiian airlines,cir steve jackson games,secret,cir see also wesley college pitts,summarily aff,cir.
the first case to do so,steve jackson games,noted that intercept was defined as contemporaneous in the context of an aural communication under the old wiretap act see united states turk,cir,and that when congress amended the wiretap act in to create what is now known as the ecpa to extend protection to electronic communications,it did not intend to change the definition of intercept.steve jackson games,at.moreover,the fifth circuit noted that the differences in definition between wire communication and electronic communication in the ecpa supported its conclusion that stored could not be intercepted within the meaning of title i.a wire communication under the ecpa was until recent amendment by the usa patriot act,see note any aural transfer made in whole or in part through the use of facilities for the transmission of communications by the aid of wire,cable,or other like connection between the point of origin and the point of reception and such term includes any electronic storage of such communication.emphasis added superseded by usa patriot act by contrast,an electronic communication is defined as any transfer of signs,signals,writing,images,sounds,data,or intelligence of any nature transmitted in whole or in part by a wire,radio,electromagnetic,photoelectronic or photooptical system but does not include any wire or oral communication.emphasis added.thus,the fifth circuit reasoned that because wire communication explicitly included electronic storage but electronic communication did not,there can be no intercept of an in storage,as an in storage is by definition not an electronic communication.steve jackson games,at.
subsequent cases,cited above,have agreed with the fifth circuit result.while congress definition of intercept does not appear to fit with its intent to extend protection to electronic communications,it is for congress to cover the bases untouched.we adopt the reasoning of our sister circuits and therefore hold that there has been no intercept within the meaning of title i of ecpa.
fraser also argues that nationwide search of his violated title ii of the ecpa that title creates civil liability for one who intentionally accesses without authorization a facility through which an electronic communication service is provided or intentionally exceeds an authorization to access that facility and thereby obtains,alters,or prevents authorized access to a wire or electronic communication while it is in electronic storage in such system.a.the statute defines electronic storage as a any temporary,intermediate storage of a wire or electronic communication incidental to the electronic transmission thereof and b any storage of such communication by an electronic communication service for purposes of backup protection of such communication.id.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of nationwide,holding that title ii does not apply to the in question because the transmissions were neither in temporary,intermediate storage nor in backup storage.rather,according to the district court,the was in a state it described as storage.we agree that fraser was not in temporary,intermediate storage.but to us it seems questionable that the transmissions were not in backup term that neither the statute nor the legislative history defines.therefore,while we affirm the district court,we do so through a different analytical path,assuming without deciding that the in question was in backup storage.
c excepts from title ii seizures of authorized by the person or entity providing a wire or electronic communications service.there is no circuit court case law interpreting this exception.however,in bohach city of reno,a district court held that the reno police department could,without violating title ii,retrieve pager text messages stored on the police department computer system because the department is the provider of the service and service providers may do as they wish when it comes to accessing communications in electronic storage.id.at.like the court in
