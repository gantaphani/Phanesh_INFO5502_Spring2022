the defendant,frank peters,was charged in the united states district court for the western district of new york with various counts related to a scheme to defraud chase manhattan bank chase by overvaluing assets used to secure and maintain a revolving line of credit.in addition to imposing a term of imprisonment and ordering restitution,the district court william skretny,judge ordered forfeiture in the amount of pursuant to a.the district court concluded that section requires forfeiture of the receipts of the criminal violation,the draws from the revolving line of credit between july and october.united states peters.the district court also concluded that although the loan proceeds were disbursed to corporations owned and controlled by peters and his wife,because they were in fact his corporate alter egos,it would pierce the corporate veil and hold the defendant liable for the proceeds reaped by the corporations.
the defendant advances several arguments challenging his conviction and the loss amount calculated for sentencing guidelines and restitution purposes,all of which we resolve in a summary order filed today.in this precedential opinion we address only the defendant challenge to the order of forfeiture.the defendant objects to it on two grounds section requires him to forfeit only the profits of the fraudulent scheme,not all payments that his companies received under the chase loan,and the district court erred when it pierced the corporate veil to find that he personally obtained the loan proceeds paid to his companies.
we conclude that section requires forfeiture of the gross receipts attributable to the criminal violation,not only the profits,and in light of his near total control over the companies and their assets,the defendant indirectly obtained the chase loan proceeds and can be held accountable for criminal forfeiture of those proceeds pursuant to section.
background 
peters and his wife,marta chaikovska,purchased world auto parts,wapi in.in,wapi acquired a company peters and his wife renamed bighorn core,bighorn.wapi and bighorn together,the companies sold aftermarket auto parts.chaikovska was wapi chief executive officer and owned percent of the companies.peters was the president and owned percent.peters owned one percent,and a fourth individual,peter van domelen,owned one percent.
the chase loan 
in,the companies entered into an credit agreement with chase in which the bank agreed to extend to the companies a million revolving line of credit secured by the companies assets.in june,the parties renewed the agreement for two years,raising the available credit to million.the cash available to the companies on any given day was determined by the companies borrowing base the sum of the values of the companies inventory and accounts receivable.the companies were permitted under their arrangement with the bank to borrow up to an amount equal to percent of the value of current accounts receivable,plus percent of the value of the current inventory,less whatever loan principal was outstanding never to exceed the million maximum.
the loan agreement provided that the companies would deposit all payments from customers into blocked accounts at chase,from which only the bank could make withdrawals.chase would then sweep the accounts periodically,using the money taken from them to pay down the companies loan balance.
certain accounts receivable were deemed ineligible for purposes of determining the borrowing base because the bank considered it unlikely that those amounts would be repaid.for example,the companies were not permitted to borrow against accounts receivable more than days past due or purchase orders that had not yet been fulfilled.the companies would periodically file a borrowing base report,which was supposed to reflect the combined value of accounts receivable and inventory.to confirm the information in the borrowing base report,and to verify generally the companies accounting standards,chase field examiners were permitted to audit random samples of the companies records.one such field examiner,edward grayeski,testified at trial that he had conducted field tests between and,and that his review raised red flags with respect to some of the accounts receivable.although the companies were initially able to deflect the bank concerns about the accuracy of their records,examiners eventually uncovered the fraudulent scheme,described below,that underlies this case.
the scheme 
peters does not dispute that the companies engaged in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the accounts receivable in order to inflate their borrowing base.starting sometime in,the companies began experiencing shortages due to a low sales volume.in response,the companies developed ways to increase cash flow.gregory samer,a wapi employee who pleaded guilty under the same indictment that named peters as a defendant,testified as a cooperating witness at peters trial.samer detailed three different fraudulent accounting practices committed by peters and the companies in order to increase the cash available through the chase loan holding the month open prebilling and rebilling.
the practice of holding the month open consisted of including in a particular month an account receivable that did not actually ripen until the following month.for example,samer might instruct cheryl martinez,who worked in wapi billing department,to include invoices from the first two weeks of february in the january accounts receivable report.martinez would then backdate what should have been a february invoice to make it appear as though the goods sold had been shipped in january.if the product did eventually ship to the customer,martinez would produce a invoice that reflected the actual date of shipment.
prebilling referred to the practice of creating a sales invoice for an order before any goods were shipped,thereby making an unripe purchase order appear to be an account receivable.for example,in january,a company named atco placed a purchase order with bighorn for worth of cores.bighorn lacked both the inventory to fulfill the order and sufficient cash to purchase the inventory.employees at bighorn created an invoice falsely indicating that the atco order had shipped,which allowed them to include an order in the accounts receivable report for that month.as a result,chase was duped into lending the companies more that chase expected to be repaid through a sale that,in fact,might never come to fruition.
the practice of rebilling was,in effect,an around chase policy of excluding accounts receivable that were more than days old from the borrowing base.employees at the companies would generate a new invoice for an old sale with a false date somewhere within the previous days so that the receivable could be included in the borrowing base report.
although there was evidence in the record that chase was aware of at least some of these practices,the bank appears to have been unaware of the extent to which the companies employees were artificially inflating the companies borrowing base.chase ultimately uncovered the full extent of the fraud in or around may,when a bighorn employee named ron hall disclosed it to chase examiners.
the creation of itec 
in early,peters created a corporation named innovative transmission and engine company itec into which he spun off the companies equipment department.peters opened a bank account for itec at another institution,m t bank.several customers who had sent payments to wapi were sent correspondence informing them that wapi had changed its name and asking that the payment be reissued to itec.the reissued checks were deposited in itec account at m t bank,instead of in the companies chase accounts,where the loan agreement required that such payments be deposited.chase was thus deprived of money that was supposed to have been used to pay down the loan.
procedural history 
on october,a grand jury in the united states district court for the western district of new york returned an indictment against peters,samer,and the chief financial officer of the companies,mark hoffman.the indictment charged peters with a host of crimes,including one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud,in violation of and,in connection with the companies accounting practices and the creation of itec four counts of making a false statement to a bank,in violation of,in connection with four separate instances of fraudulently inflating the borrowing base four counts of bank fraud,in violation,three of them alleging false statements in connection with alleged payments from the companies to the defendant,and the fourth in connection with the atco prebill one count of money laundering,in violation of and three counts of mail or wire fraud,in violation of and,in connection with the diversion of payments to itec.
samer was charged with the conspiracy and bank fraud counts,and hoffman was charged with the conspiracy and mail and wire fraud counts.the last five counts sought criminal forfeiture of the proceeds of the allegedly fraudulent activity.in february,samer pleaded guilty to the conspiracy count and agreed to cooperate with the government.
a jury trial began in may.although all parties agreed that a fraudulent scheme to inflate the borrowing base had occurred,peters disputed that he participated in it and argued that he was in fact its victim.on july,the district court granted peters motions for acquittal on three counts the counts alleging payments to peters for personal use and the money laundering count.on july,the jury convicted peters of one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud,one count of making a false statement to a bank,one count of bank fraud,two counts of wire fraud,and one count of mail fraud.the jury acquitted him of three counts of making a false statement to a bank.hoffman was acquitted of all counts.
on january,the district court sentenced peters principally to months imprisonment,and ordered him to pay in restitution.the government and peters had agreed that the district court would resolve the forfeiture counts,which it did in march by entering a forfeiture money judgment of.peters,at.
discussion 
on appeal,the defendant advances several arguments challenging the fairness of his trial and his sentence.we address most of these arguments in a summary order decided simultaneously herewith affirming the defendant conviction and the amount of restitution awarded at sentencing.see united states peters,app x,wl.lexis cir.date.the defendant also argues that the district court erred by entering a forfeiture order in the amount of because the criminal forfeiture statute,a,requires forfeiture only of profits,not of gross receipts,and the district court erred in finding that the companies were his alter egos such that the court could impose a forfeiture order against him personally.it is this challenge to the forfeiture award that we consider here.
we review a district court legal conclusions including those regarding the application of the forfeiture statute de novo,and all underlying factual findings for clear error.united states gaskin,cir.
criminal forfeiture under a 
the forfeiture statute at issue here is a,which provides in relevant part 
the court,in imposing sentence on a person convicted of a violation of,or a conspiracy to violate 
a section,or of this title,affecting a financial institution 
shall order that the person forfeit to the united states any property constituting,or derived from,proceeds the person obtained directly or indirectly,as the result of such violation.
federal rule of criminal procedure b a requires a trial court,a s soon as practical after a verdict of guilty against a defendant,to determine what property is subject to forfeiture under the applicable statute.id.if the government seeks a personal money judgment,the court must determine the amount of money that the defendant will be ordered to pay.id.the government must establish the nexus between the offense and the forfeiture request by a preponderance of the evidence.see united states capoccia,cir.
criminal forfeiture under section is a form of punishment,separate and apart from any restitutive measures imposed during sentencing.forfeiture of money under section,unlike restitution,constitutes punishment,because the statute directs the court to order it as an additional sanction when imposing sentence on a person convicted of the relevant offense and because criminal forfeiture serves no remedial purpose,is designed to punish the offender,and can not be imposed upon innocent owners.united states bajakajian,d see also libretti united states,d our precedents have likewise characterized criminal forfeiture as an aspect of punishment imposed following conviction of a substantive criminal offense.a court discretion in ordering criminal forfeiture is cabined by the eighth amendment excessive fines clause.the amount of forfeiture must bear some relationship to the gravity of the offense that it is designed to punish.bajakajian,at.
ii.the district court decision 
the defendant elected to have the district court,rather than the jury,resolve the criminal forfeiture charges against him.the government requested an order of forfeiture in the amount of,which represented the sum of all disbursements under the chase loan,payments the defendant diverted from wapi to itec,and payments made from the companies directly to the defendant,as salary,car payments,and rent between and.
the district court ordered criminal forfeiture by peters in an amount equal to the sum of all disbursements under the chase loan,and all payments diverted from wapi to itec.peters,at.in doing so,the court rejected peters argument that he should be liable only for the profits generated by the fraud.id.at.the district court also concluded that wapi and bighorn were the defendant corporate alter egos for the purpose of piercing the corporate veil and finding the defendant personally liable under section a.id.at.the court rejected the government request for forfeiture of payments made to the defendant from the companies between and,concluding that there was insufficient evidence to connect any pre payments to any offenses for which the defendant was convicted.id.at.
after doing the arithmetic,the court imposed a money judgment against peters in the amount of.id.at.
iii.analysis 
proceeds versus profits 
on appeal,peters urges us to read proceeds in section to include only the profits of his fraud.section does not supply a definition of the term proceeds.neither have we determined whether,as used in section a,proceeds means profits or gross receipts.we ultimately agree with the district court that the term proceeds is not limited to profits.
textual arguments.when a term in a statute is undefined,we are to give it its ordinary meaning.fdic meyer,d.proceeds,however,can mean either receipts or profits.both meanings are accepted,and have long been accepted,in ordinary usage.united states santos,d.the term p roceeds,moreover,has not acquired a common meaning in the provisions of the federal criminal code congress has defined proceeds in various criminal provisions,but sometimes has defined it to mean receipts and sometimes profits.id.at.
the defendant argues that this case is controlled by santos,a case involving an illegal lottery.in santos,the supreme court construed the word proceeds in the federal laundering statute,to mean profits,rather than gross receipts.a plurality of the santos court found that because f rom the face of the statute,there is no more reason to think that proceeds means receipts than there is to think that proceeds means profits,the rule of lenity required that the tie must go to the defendant.id.at.
the defendant would have us conclude that the term proceeds under section a must therefore also be limited to profits.the problem with the defendant argument is that,under the rule announced by the supreme court in marks united states,d,the holding in santos is limited to the position taken by those members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds,id.at internal quotation marks omitted.and as we explained in united states quinones,cir,cert.denied,d,justice stevens concurrence controls the scope of the court holding in santos.id.at citing santos,u.at.unlike the plurality,justice stevens would have held that proceeds meant profits when the laundering stat
