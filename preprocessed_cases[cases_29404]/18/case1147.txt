daron edison,a prisoner in a florida state prison,filed this action pro se,alleging violations of the american with disabilities act,the ada.the district court granted summary judgment to defendants,and edison appeals.
daron edison brought this action against timothy douberly,brenda williams,and timothy lovell,alleging violations of title ii of the ada by defendants in their official capacities as employees of geo care group,geo,a private prison management corporation operating a florida state prison.edison sought injunctive relief and damages as the result of defendants alleged violations of title ii,which prohibits a public entity from discriminating against qualified individuals with disabilities because of their disabilities.
only public entities are liable for violations of title ii of the ada.of corr.yeskey.the district court granted summary judgment to defendants on the grounds that geo is not a public entity and,therefore,not liable under the statute it is to this question we now turn.
edison contends that geo is a public entity under the ada because section b of the statute defines a public entity,in part,as an instrumentality of a state.edison bolsters his contention by application of traditional canons of statutory interpretation to the term instrumentality of a state.
we agree with this approach to interpreting the term instrumentality of a state.in fact,we agree with the court of appeals for the second circuit that interpretation of the ada use of the term instrumentality of a state is entirely controlled by the statutory language itself.green new york,cir.
in green,the plaintiff alleged that a private hospital was a public entity for purposes of the ada because it carried out a public function pursuant to a contract with new york city to provide certain services.id.at.the second circuit,however,said that the plaintiff theory failed to grapple with the actual words of the statute.id.
the court observed that,under the rules of statutory interpretation,the term public entity must be given its plain meaning,and,if those words are susceptible to more than one such meaning,their interpretation must be guided by the canons of statutory construction.id courts are not free,and may not elect,to adopt other interpretations of statutory language and expand the reach of a statute merely because some might find it desirable.
with these limitations in mind,the second circuit looked to the definitions section of title ii.that section defines public entity to mean any department,agency,special purpose district,or other instrumentality of a state or states or local government.b.the court,reasoned,therefore,that the private hospital there could be a public entity only if it were an instrumentality of a state,as it fit no other statutory category id.the question,then,is what does the statute mean by the words instrumentality of a state.id.
instrumentality,the second circuit observed,is a word susceptible of more than one meaning.id.at.turning then to the canons of statutory construction,the court noted that under the canon noscitur a sociis,a word is known by the company it keeps.id.citing jarecki searle,although noscitur a sociis is not an inescapable rule,it is often wisely applied where a word is capable of many meanings in order to avoid the giving of unintended breadth to the acts of congress.
the company which instrumentality keeps in this definition of public entity include the words department,agency,and special purpose district.the court noted that all of these words are qualified by the remaining words in the definition of a state or states or local government.green,at.agencies and departments are units of a governmental entity.a special purpose district in new york,as well as in florida is set up to serve the special needs of a governmental entity,such as water conservation.the defining characteristic of all of these entities is that they are either traditional governmental units or created by one.thus,the second circuit concluded,the words instrumentality of a state were intended to refer,as do all the other words around them,to a governmental unit.id 
the private hospital in green was not such a governmental unit,the court concluded.nor was it created by a governmental entity.instead,it is a parallel private entity.id.even where such a private entity contracts with a government to perform a traditional and essential government function,it remains a private company,not a public entity.a private contractor does not,the court held,become liable under title ii merely by contracting with the state to provide governmental services,essential or otherwise.id.the second circuit affirmed the district court dismissal of the private hospital.
we too have long recognized that our authority to interpret statutory language is constrained by the plain meaning of the statutory language in the context of the entire statute,as assisted by the canons of statutory construction.nguyen united states,th cir shotz city of plantation,th cir.we have affirmed many times that we do not look at one word or term in isolation but rather look to the entire statute and its context.see united states silva,th cir.our job in this case,then,is to interpret the ada use of the words instrumentality of a state in a manner consistent with their plain meaning and context,and in this endeavor we are persuaded that the second circuit has got it right.we,too,hold that the term instrumentality of a state refers to governmental units or units created by them.
all of the courts that have considered this question have come to the same conclusion.in cox jackson,d,the district court held that a private medical provider for a prison could not be considered a public entity under the statute because it was not a governmental entity.the court adopted the holding of green that a private contractor does not become a public entity under title ii merely by contracting with a governmental entity to provide governmental services.id.
in hahn linn county,d,the district court held that the plain meaning of the language of title ii limits its liability to a public entity and that a contractual relationship between a private corporation and a county government does not transform the private corporation into a public entity.
similarly,in metro ride,d,the district court held that a private corporation was not a public entity merely because it contracted with the public entity to provide a specialized transit program for disabled persons.
finally,in doe adkins,ohio,the court held that a private mental health services corporation that provided contract services to a local mental health agency was not an instrumentality of that governmental unit for the purposes of the ada.the court opined that because the defendant is not a department,agency,or special purpose district,or other instrumentality of a state or local government we find that it is not a public entity for purposes of section of the ada.
we agree with these courts that a private corporation is not a public entity merely because it contracts with a public entity to provide some service.since geo is such a private corporation,we hold that geo is not a public entity subjecting it to liability under title ii of the ada and is,therefore,not a proper defendant in this action.accordingly,the judgment of the district court is 
barkett,circuit judge,dissenting 
the majority analysis is flawed because it conflates government contracting with government function.in doing so,the majority fails to recognize the extremely significant distinction between a private company that can lawfully perform a function without state involvement and one that can not.it is simply not possible for any entity to lawfully operate a prison without authorization from and a contract with the state.unlike hospitals,which can be operated on behalf of the government through a contractual agreement or can be operated independently,prisons can never be operated independently of the government.that vital difference leads me to dissent.
the supreme court has made clear that the operation of a prison is a primary function of government so much so that i t is difficult to imagine a
