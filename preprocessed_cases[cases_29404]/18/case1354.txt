in this case we are presented with an issue of first impression in california does the remedy of rescission in a securities fraud claim brought under corporations code sections and require privity of contract between the plaintiff and defendant in other words,can a purchaser of securities sue for rescission under sections and,which provide for liability against control persons and aiders and abettors,if those persons or entities did not sell the security to the plaintiff we conclude that privity of contract is necessary to maintain an action for rescission under sections and,and therefore a purchaser of securities may not maintain such a claim against someone other than the direct seller.that is so because rescission requires the contracting parties to be placed in the position they were in prior to contracting,and a,who did not receive any money from the purchaser,can not return that money to the purchaser.we affirm.
introduction 
this action arises out of plaintiffs audrey viterbi and dan smargon together,plaintiffs purchase of worth of securities from a company named economic inventions,llc ei,which held patents on expirationless options,a type of derivative security.plaintiffs sued ei,its president,vergil daughtery ii,two board members,david gleeson and steven wallman,and the defendant and respondent on this appeal,geneva wasserman.wasserman is a former employee of viterbi who worked as an analyst on viterbi biotech investments.it is undisputed that wasserman did not sell the securities to plaintiffs.rather,plaintiffs alleged that wasserman failed to disclose to them that ei had granted an exclusive license to the patents to nextrade holdings,nextrade,which they assert made the stock worthless,failed to disclose her interest in ei,and misrepresented to them that her parents had invested in ei.
the court dismissed the action against gleeson and wallman based upon a lack of jurisdiction,and this court affirmed that dismissal.smargon gleeson,nonpub.opn.ei and daugherty filed for bankruptcy and the action was stayed as to them,leaving only wasserman as a defendant.
the court granted wasserman motion for summary adjudication as to all claims except for constructive trust and for statutory securities fraud brought under sections and.thereafter,the court granted a nonsuit on the securities fraud claim,finding plaintiffs had no damages remedy because they continued to own the securities and they could not seek rescission against wasserman because she did not sell them the stock and therefore there was a lack of privity of contract.the court also ruled that its previous ruling granting summary adjudication eliminated any issue as to false representation,scienter,intent to defraud and.the court ruled the constructive trust claim was stayed by ei bankruptcy.
this appeal concerns only the court grant of nonsuit as to the securities fraud claim.plaintiffs allege the court erred in granting nonsuit on this claim because sections and do not require privity of contract to obtain a rescissionary remedy and the court erred in relying on the findings it made on its previous summary adjudication ruling in granting nonsuit.
we conclude that because wasserman did not sell the securities to plaintiffs,and thus was not in privity of contract with them,they have no remedy of rescission against her,and therefore the court properly granted a nonsuit in her favor on their securities fraud claim.accordingly,we need not address whether the court erred in also granting nonsuit based upon the findings it made on wasserman summary adjudication motion.
factual and procedural background 
because we are concluding as a matter of law plaintiffs have no right to rescission in the case,we address the facts relating to the underlying dispute only to the extent necessary to understand the nature of the dispute between the parties.
a.the parties 
viterbi has a doctoral degree in electrical engineering and computer science.she is the cofounder and partner in linkagene and the viterbi group,companies that invest in private and public companies.her partner in the viterbi group is her father,andrew viterbi,cofounder of qualcomm.viterbi is a venture capitalist and considers herself a sophisticated investor.smargon is a securities trader who trades stock index futures.
linkagene and viterbi group focused their investments in the areas of biotech,life sciences,telecom and beyond that.
viterbi and wasserman met at a charity event in and became friends.viterbi at the time was looking for somebody to work on biotech investments with,and she seemed to have the necessary qualifications,which included an,and an undergraduate degree in biology.viterbi hired wasserman as an analyst on biotech investments.wasserman looked at potential investments and advised viterbi on them.
b.the investment in ei 
beginning in,wasserman received and forwarded to viterbi various documents about ei.in an attaching information about ei,wasserman identified herself as being a of that company.viterbi reviewed the business plan,as well as the private placement memorandum ppm and subscription agreement.
the ppm warned that 
these securities are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.only persons who can afford to lose a portion or all of their investment and have no need for a current return on their investment should consider the purchase.
the ppm warned of several primary risk factors,including ei execution platform partner failing to perform market disinterest in expirationless options a failure to meet projections of market volume and a failure to win regulatory approvals.the ppm stated that these risks could reduce or eliminate patent residual payments,which were described as ei primary source of future income.
in her deposition testimony,viterbi acknowledged that she read and understood these risk factors before investing in ei.she understood and acknowledged she could lose all her money.she acknowledged that that it was important to her to know what the risk factors are before investing money.
the ppm also warned that no investor should invest in the company unless willing to entrust all aspects of the management of the company to its officers and directors.viterbi did not contact any ei director or officer before investing.this was despite the fact viterbi frequently spoke to ceos or other corporate officers before investing funds in their companies.
shortly before investing in ei,viterbi was sold on the investment and was enthused with making the investment.she sought advice from a childhood friend,who was a former employee of bear stearns.her friend advice was negative.in an sent to viterbi a week before she invested in ei,her friend told her the following 
i do see any ability to get the kinds of revenues they are talking about.i am not sure what is the big deal here with their perpetual options,and the contention that issuing options that extend beyond three years is being prohibited by their patent sounds laughable to me i am not a patent expert,but i can imagine all sorts of ways to create comparable instruments.so i would find other ways to lose money.italics added.
viterbi read that and acknowledged that it was very negative.nevertheless,viterbi did not follow up with her friend.she did not vet ei concept with anyone else.
in may viterbi and smargon bought membership interests in ei for in cash.they both signed the subscription agreement.that subscription agreement recited that they had obtained independent professional advice with respects to the risks inherent in their investment the suitability of the investment based on their objectives and financial needs their ability to lose the money invested their access to full and complete information regarding the company to their satisfaction,or have waived the opportunity to have such access and their recognition of the high degree of risk inherent in the investment.
it is undisputed wasserman did not sell the securities to viterbi and smargon.wasserman did not receive any money from them.
alleged securities fraud 
before plaintiffs purchased their shares in ei,ei entered into an exclusive license agreement with nextrade.plaintiffs allege they were not aware of this agreement,or its terms,and did not receive a copy of the agreement until.they alleged the terms of the agreement were not disclosed in the offering documents,and the statement therein that ei was the exclusive licensor of its patents was false given the exclusive license already given to nextrade.
they alleged the terms of the agreement with nextrade were a disaster for ei.the agreement gave to nextrade in perpetuity a worldwide royalty free exclusive license,thereby stripping ei of the rights necessary to commercialize the patents.the agreement gave to nextrade all the intellectual property owned by ei for no fee or royalty.it granted to nextrade all rights to patents arising from ei existing patent for no fees or royalties.the agreement gave nextrade the right to sublicense the patents to third parties.
the only thing ei received in return was of any sublicense fees and of any net income nextrade received from use of the patents.the agreement did not require any performance or diligence obligations of nextrade,which plaintiffs allege are essential,customary and standard in patent licenses.
according to plaintiffs,ei has received no money from the agreement and has no income.ei is bankrupt,with assets of and liabilities of approximately million.
also according to plaintiffs,wasserman knew of the agreement and its problematic terms,but did not disclose them to plaintiffs prior to their investment.
plaintiffs also allege the offering documents falsely stated the founders of ei had invested over in ei.in fact,the founders of ei invested approximately.
plaintiffs allege that,before they made the investment,wasserman falsely represented to viterbi that her wasserman parents had invested in ei.according to plaintiffs,viterbi knew wasserman parents and did not believe wasserman would put her parents in a problematic investment.
wasserman involvement with ei 
wasserman represented herself to be an officer,director and member of the advisory board of ei,and led its fundraising efforts.she was also its attorney.she was a shareholder in ei,having been given units for.wasserman was employed by ei and maintained an account with them.
as a result of her efforts in getting plaintiffs to invest in ei,she received a percent finder fee and an additional units in ei at no cost to herself.
plaintiffs continued ownership of ei stock 
according to plaintiffs,the securities they purchased are not marketable and are worthless.they are restricted and there is no trading market.thus,they continue to own the securities.
wasserman summary adjudication motion 
wasserman moved for summary judgment on the claims for fraud,negligent misrepresentation,constructive trust,accounting,and securities fraud.the court granted summary judgment as to smargon on all causes of action and granted summary adjudication as to viterbi on the causes of action for fraud,negligent misrepresentation,accounting and securities fraud.the court found there was no evidence of an actionable statement by wasserman,no evidence of scienter,no triable issue of fact as to causation or damages,and that wasserman lacked authority to perform an accounting.the court denied the motion as to the cause of action for constructive trust,finding there was conflicting evidence as to her responsibility,if any,for an alleged diversion of ei corporate assets.
plaintiffs brought a motion for reconsideration and for new trial.the court granted the motion for reconsideration as to the cause of action for securities fraud,finding that relevant disputed evidence precluded summary adjudication on that claim.
trial and motion for nonsuit 
shortly before trial,wasserman brought a motion for nonsuit as to the cause of action for securities fraud,arguing plaintiffs had no claim for damages as they still owned the stock rescission,plaintiffs sole remaining remedy,was unavailable as a matter of law because of a lack of privity of contract and the court prior grant of summary judgment eliminated any issues as to false statements,scienter,materiality or causation.
the court issued a tentative ruling,granting the motion.the court found that t he remedy of rescission is not available against a defendant who is not a party to the contract sued on.privity of contract is an essential element of any cause of action seeking rescission.the parties are not in privity of contract.plaintiffs continue to own the shares of ei that are the subject of the litigation.under the allegations of the sixth cause of action,only rescission is available to plaintiffs as a remedy.as rescission can not be ordered against defendant wasserman,the motion is granted.
thereafter,the court heard plaintiffs opening statement and further argument of counsel.the court then supplemented its tentative ruling to find that its findings on the motion for summary adjudication disposing of the fraud claims,to the extent the same evidence was presented at trial that was presented in opposition to that motion,would also preclude the securities fraud claim.
after hearing oral argument,the court issued its final ruling,confirming its initial tentative ruling.however,the court reversed itself on the supplemental tentative ruling regarding the findings made in granting summary adjudication,stating those findings are not incorporated into its ruling on defendant motion for.
thereafter,the court entered judgment in favor of wasserman.this timely appeal follows.
discussion 
principles of rescission 
plaintiffs do not dispute that because they still own the ei stock,their only remedy on their cause of action for securities fraud is rescission.a prerequisite to any claim for rescission is a contract between the parties.witkin,cal.procedure ed.pleading.this is because rescission requires each party to the contract to restore to the other everything of value received under the contract t o effect a rescission a party to the contract must,promptly upon discovering the facts which entitle him to rescind if he is free from duress,menace,undue influence or disability and is aware of his right to rescind a give notice of rescission to the party as to whom he rescinds and b restore to the other party everything of value which he has received from him under the contract or offer to restore the same upon condition that the other party do likewise,unless the latter is unable or positively refuses to do so,italics added.
it is undisputed that in this case there is no privity of contract between the plaintiffs and wasserman.the contract was between ei and plaintiffs.wasserman did not sell the stock in ei to plaintiffs and did not receive the from them.thus,wasserman can not restore to plaintiffs the investment and place the parties in their precontractual positions.under ordinary contract principles wasserman can not be held liable to plaintiffs for rescission.
nevertheless,plaintiffs assert that under the securities laws,they were not required to prove privity of contract to obtain what they call rescissionary relief.this contention is unavailing.
applicable securities law provisions 
section provides 
it is unlawful for any person to offer or sell a security in this state or buy or offer to buy a security in this state by means of any written or oral communication which includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading.
section,under which plaintiffs sued wasserman,provides for secondary liability against persons in addition to a seller of securities if they control the seller 
every person who directly or indirectly controls a person liable under section or,every partner in a firm so liable,every principal executive officer or director of a corporation so liable,every person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions,every employee of a person so liable who materially aids in the act or transaction constituting the violation,and every or agent who materially aids in the act or transaction constituting the violation,are also liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as such person,unless the other person who is so liable had no knowledge of or reasonable grounds to believe in the existence of the facts by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist.
section,under which plaintiffs also sued wasserman,provides for secondary liability against persons who assist sellers in violations of the securities laws commonly referred to as aiders and abettors 
any person who materially assists in any violation of section,or,or a condition of qualification under chapter commencing with section of part of this division imposed pursuant to section,or a condition of qualification under chapter commencing with section of part of this division imposed pursuant to section,or an order suspending trading issued pursuant to section,with intent to deceive or defraud,is jointly and severally liable with any other person liable under this chapter for such violation.
section provides the remedies available to a purchaser of securities any person who violates section shall be liable to the person who purchases a security from him or sells a security to him,who may sue either for rescission or for damages if the plaintiff or the defendant,as the case may be,no longer owns the security italics added.
thus,under section,because plaintiffs still own the securities at issue in this action,their sole potential remedy is rescission.the question presented is whether they may maintain an action for rescission under california securities laws against someone who did not sell them the securities,against someone with whom they are not in privity of contract.
in support of their position that they may maintain an action for rescission in this case,plaintiffs cite several california cases holding that a control person under section and an aider and abettor under section can be sued for damages without privity of contract.see bains moores th,people ex rel.dufauchard th,apollo capital fund llc roth capital partners,llc th.however,these cases do not answer the question presented here because by definition control persons and aider and abettors are most often not the seller of the security,but someone only associated with the person or entity selling the security.
plaintiffs have cited no california case,and we could locate none,allowing the remedy of rescission for securities fraud against a defendant who is not in privity of contract with the purchaser.the issue has been addressed,however,in two federal cases construing analogous federal statutes.those cases held that rescission is not available against persons who are not the direct seller and therefore not in privity of contract with the purchaser.
federal case law holds privity required for rescission in securities fraud claims 
sections,and are modeled after section of the securities act of et the act of.in re gap stores securities litigation.w hen a state law is patterned after a federal law,the two are construed together.moreland dep t of corps.d.thus,federal cases construing federal securities laws are persuasive authority when interpreting our state law.ibid.
huddleston herman maclean cir huddleston,affirmed in part and reversed in part on other grounds in herman maclean huddleston,involved a class action securities action wherein the jury found the defendants,individual corporate officers and accountants who lacked privity with members of the plaintiff class,liable for securities fraud.however,some of the class members,like plaintiffs here,were still holding their securities.huddleston,supra,at.the district court granted those class members rescissional relief.ibid.
the circuit reversed.in doing so,the court noted that the remedy of rescission is usually limited to cases involving either privity between plaintiff and defendant or some specific fiduciary duty owed by brokers to their customers.huddleston,supra,at.i f the purchaser did not buy from the defendant or if he no longer owns the security,then the parties can not be returned to the status quo ante and section of the act of provides that damages,not rescission,is the proper remedy.huddleston,supra,at.if the rule claimants have purchased securities on the open market and did not deal face to face with the defendants,the price the purchasers paid did not accrue directly to the defendants.the defendants can not,in effect,return the purchase price that they never received or rescind a transaction to which they were not party,citing green occidental petroleum cir,sneed,concurring.
in mcfarland memorex,the plaintiffs sued accountants in a class action for securities fraud under section of the act of and sought rescission.the accountants brought a motion to dismiss,arguing there was no privity between them and the plaintiffs because the plaintiffs did not purchase the securities from them.mcfarland,supra,at.the district court agreed,stating,the express remedy rescission,or damages if the security is no longer owned strongly suggests section of the act of should be read literally to require direct privity.for it would indeed be strange,as the accountants have been quick to note,if a victorious plaintiff could present to the accountants for repurchase securities that they never owned.ibid.the court stated that to allow a plaintiff to pursue the remedy of rescission against someone other than the person or entity who sold the security would let a plaintiff undo by rescission an event that never occurred ibid.
as in these cases,wasserman never owned the securities,did not sell them to plaintiffs,and did not receive money from plaintiffs.wasserman can not return money she never received or rescind a transaction to which she was not a party.
plaintiffs assert that we should not follow huddleston and mcfarland because they are federal cases that are not precedent for this court and did not apply california securities law.however,as we have noted,ante,federal cases construing federal securities laws are persuasive authority when interpreting our state securities law.moreland dep t of,supra,d at.
addressing mcfarland specifically,plaintiffs assert that case holding has since been eroded by the united states supreme court holding in pinter dahl pinter and numerous federal cases following pinter that have expanded the term seller in of the act of to include more than just the person who sold the security.this contention is unavailing.
pinter in fact expressly refused to expand the definition of seller in the way plaintiffs suggest 
we do not agree that congress contemplated imposing act of liability under the broad terms petitioners advocate.there is no support in the statutory language or legislative history for expansion of act of primary liability beyond persons who pass title and persons who offer,including those who solicit offers.indeed,act of failure to impose express liability for mere participation in unlawful sales transactions suggests that congress did not intend that the section impose liability on participants collateral to the offer or sale.when congress wished to create such liability,it had little trouble doing so.pinter,supra,at.
in pinter,the supreme court rejected the substantial factor in causing the sale test employed by some federal courts to determine if a person met the definition of a seller under section of the act of 
the deficiency of the test is that it divorces the analysis of seller status from any reference to the applicable statutory language and from any examination of act of in the context of the total statutory scheme.those courts that have adopted the approach have not attempted to ground their analysis in the statutory language.citation.instead,they substitute the concept of substantial participation in the sales transaction,or proximate causation of the plaintiff purchase,for the words offers or sells in act of.the purchase from requirement of act of focuses on the defendant relationship with the.the test,on the other hand,focuses on the defendant degree of involvement in the securities transaction and its surrounding circumstances.thus,although the test undoubtedly embraces persons who pass title and who solicit the purchase of unregistered securities as statutory sellers,the test also would extend act of liabili
