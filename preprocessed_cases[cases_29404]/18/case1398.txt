james cristler,john purves,james harrod,sydney moroff and mark lambert,individually and as the representative of a class of similarly situated persons collectively cristler,sued a parcel delivery company,express messenger systems,doing business as california overnight express messenger.the lawsuit contained a number of causes of actions,all based on a core contention that express messenger improperly classified its employees as independent contractors.the case was litigated before a jury and,with respect to certain claims,a trial court.express messenger prevailed.
cristler appeals,contending that the trial court erred in a number of respects.cristler argues that the trial court i abused its discretion by failing to amend the class definition in light of developments subsequent to class certification ii erred in instructing the jury as to both the burden of proof and with respect to the pertinent classification factors that distinguish employees from independent contractors iii applied incorrect legal standards in adjudicating cristler unfair and unlawful business practices causes of action iv abused its discretion by allowing the introduction of irrelevant and inflammatory evidence as to the relative benefits of independent contractor status and v erroneously permitted express messenger to recover costs for the production of exhibits that were not used at trial.as discussed below,we conclude these contentions are without merit and affirm.
express messenger is a regional overnight package delivery company with operations in california.express messenger delivery system consists of a number of large hubs and local facilities that collect,sort and route packages for next day delivery.
in december,express messenger discontinued its system of using employee drivers to perform local pickup and delivery work in california and implemented a program designed to switch the majority of its employee drivers to independent contractor status.express messenger hired subcontracting concepts,sci to facilitate this change.
drivers who elected to continue working with express messenger after the change entered into written independent contractor agreements with sci to perform delivery services for express messenger.the drivers then bid on available routes and negotiated a route management fee with express messenger.
in december,cristler filed a complaint against express messenger on behalf of themselves and other similarly situated contractors of express messenger.in the complaint,cristler alleged causes of action for unfair and unlawful business practices in violation of business and professions code section failure to pay overtime compensation in violation of labor code sections,and failure to provide properly itemized wage statements in violation of section failure to fully compensate for business expenses in violation of section and wrongful termination in violation of public policy.all of the causes of action arose from a core contention that express messenger classification of its delivery personnel as independent contractors was improper because the drivers were,in fact,employees under california law.
at the outset of the litigation,the trial court granted cristler motion to pursue the litigation as a class action.the case was then tried to a jury in january.at the conclusion of the trial,the jury returned a special verdict,finding that the drivers in the are independent contractors,not employees.as a result of the special verdict,the class members claims with respect to failure to pay overtime compensation,failure to provide properly itemized wage statements and failure to fully compensate for business expenses were denied.the trial court then independently determined that the remaining causes of action for unfair and unlawful business practices,and unlawful termination were without merit and entered judgment in favor of express messenger.
discussion 
cristler raises a number of challenges to the trial proceedings.prior to addressing these contentions we set forth some background legal principles regarding the distinction under california law between independent contractors and employees,which informs our subsequent discussion.
legal principles regarding classification of independent contractors and employees 
employers have varying responsibilities with respect to persons performing services on their behalf.these responsibilities depend,in part,on whether those persons are classified as employees or independent contractors under the labor code.see,indemnification for expenses,workers compensation coverage,overtime compensation unemp,income tax withholding.the labor code defines e mployee s to include virtually all persons in the service of an employer under any contract of hire,but specifically excludes independent contractors.an independent contractor is defined as any person who renders service for a specified recompense for a specified result,under the control of his principal as to the result of his work only and not as to the means by which such result is accomplished.
due to the numerous variables that can inform the contractor distinction,our supreme court has supplemented these statutory definitions with a host of classification factors.in doing so,the court has consistently emphasized,in keeping with the statutory definition,that the most important factor is the right to control the manner and means of accomplishing the result desired.empire star mines cal.emp.com.cal d,empire star mines.the court has also stated that s trong evidence in support of an employment relationship is the right to discharge at will,without cause,and that o ther factors to be taken into consideration are a whether or not the one performing services is engaged in a distinct occupation or business b the kind of occupation,with reference to whether,in the locality,the work is usually done under the direction of the principal or by a specialist without supervision c the skill required in the particular occupation d whether the principal or the workman supplies the instrumentalities,tools and the place of work for the person doing the work e the length of time for which the services are to be performed f the method of payment,whether by the time or by the job g whether or not the work is a part of the regular business of the principal and h whether or not the parties believe they are creating the relationship of,citing rest d agency.
this early discussion in empire star mines was later summarized with approval in tieberg unemployment.bd.cal d,tieberg,which listed the same factors and reiterated that t he right to control the means by which the work is accomplished is clearly the most significant test of the employment relationship and the other matters enumerated constitute merely secondary elements.id.at,citing rest d agency.
most recently,in borello sons,department of industrial relations cal d,borello,the court cited tieberg,empire star mines and the restatement second of agency in again listing these considerations as the pertinent classification factors.borello,at.while borello discussed the pertinent factors as they applied to certain cucumber harvesters,it emphasized w e adopt no detailed new standards for examination of the issue.to that end,the restatement guidelines heretofore approved in our state remain a useful reference.id.at.and,e ach service arrangement must be evaluated on its facts,and the dispositive circumstances may vary from case to case.borello,at,see also estrada fedex ground package system,th,d estrada citing borello in listing pertinent factors that mirrored the instruction in the instant case air couriers internat.employment development th,d air couriers recognizing that borello set forth exactly the same secondary factors to be considered in addition to the issue of control that were enumerated in the earlier case law and explicitly declined to adopt detailed new standards for examination of the issue.
borello caveats reflect that t he determination of employee or status is one of fact borello,supra,cal d at.as a result,appellate case law in this area arises primarily in the context of substantial evidence review of the determinations of the relevant fact finder.see tieberg,supra,cal d at,finding substantial evidence to support trial court conclusion,on writ of mandate review of director of employment decision to the same effect,that writers were employees of lassie television empire star mines,supra,cal d at,affirming trial court conclusion that the california employment commission erred in labeling certain miners independent contractors borello,at,upholding trial court ruling after court of appeal reversal that division of labor standards enforcement properly labeled cucumber harvesters employees rather than independent contractors estrada,supra,th at,d upholding trial court finding that certain delivery personnel were employees as supported by substantial evidence air couriers,supra,th at,d upholding trial court finding that drivers were employees as supported by substantial evidence.consequently,as is generally the case,appellate courts have no authority to simply the conclusion reached by the fact finder instead,the substantive determination employee or independent contractor is one of fact and thus must be affirmed if supported by substantial evidence.estrada,at,d.
cristler has not carried its burden of demonstrating that the trial court abused its discretion in declining to amend the class definition 
cristler first contends that the trial court abused its discretion by neglecting its duty to continuously monitor class certification and refusing to amend or modify the class definition.capitalization omitted.specifically,cristler argues the trial court should have narrowed certain exemptions to the class definition to ensure that the definition did not needlessly exclude otherwise eligible class members and that class membership was not manipulated by express messenger.
procedural history regarding class certification 
in granting cristler motion to pursue the litigation as a class action,the trial court defined the class,consisting of two subclasses,as follows 
the independent driver subclass 
all persons classified as independent contractors who have worked as drivers,messengers,delivery drivers,or route drivers for express messenger systems,dba california overnight in the state of california between november,and the present time,and who used their personal vehicles with gross vehicle weight ratings of less than lbs.in the course and scope of their work.
excluded from the class are the following categories of persons or entities contractors including partnerships,limited partnerships,corporations,and limited liability companies who utilized their own employees subcontractors,the employees or subcontractors of such contractors,and contractors who simultaneously provided pickup or delivery services to california overnight and one or more package delivery services.
the terminated employee driver subclass 
all persons classified as employees who have worked as drivers,messengers,delivery drivers,or route drivers for express messenger systems,dba california overnight in the state of california who were terminated or resigned their employment solely because of california sic overnight reclassification of drivers as independent contractors.
the class definition adopted by the trial court was identical to a definition that had been proposed by cristler.
in a february,pleading,however,cristler requested that the first exclusion to the class definition be amended to include the modifying language for the period of time that they had such employees or subcontractors.the proposed modification was intended to allow drivers who otherwise would qualify for inclusion in the class,but for the fact that they employed their own employees or subcontractors,to qualify for class membership for the period of time in which they did not employ any employees or subcontractors.
cristler also sought to amend the third exclusion to the class definition so that drivers who occasionally delivered one or two packages for sci clients other than express messenger would not be excluded from the class.the trial court rejected the proposed modifications to the class definition on the ground that they would render the class unmanageable and continuously subject to change.
reversal is not warranted even if the class definition was erroneous because there has been no showing of prejudice 
the trial court rulings regarding whether to certify a class and the necessity of modifying an existing class certification are reviewed on appeal for abuse of discretion.occidental land,superior court cal d.under the abuse of discretion standard,a reviewing court should not disturb the exercise of a trial court discretion unless it appears that there has been a miscarriage of justice.denham superior court cal d.the burden is on the party complaining to establish an abuse of discretion,and unless a clear case of abuse is shown and unless there has been a miscarriage of justice a reviewing court will not substitute its opinion and thereby divest the trial court of its discretionary power.ibid.similarly,under the california constitution,n o judgment shall be set aside,or new trial granted,in any cause for any error as to any matter of procedure,unless the court shall be of the opinion that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.cal,art.vi.
in the instant case,regardless of whether the trial court erred in defining the class,cristler fails to carry its burden of establishing reversible error as there is no showing of prejudice from the trial court assertedly erroneous rulings.a ruling that resulted in no discernible prejudice can not,of course,be characterized as a miscarriage of justice.see,people watson cal d,explaining that a miscarriage of justice will be found when it is reasonably probable that a result more favorable to the appealing party would have been reached in the absence of the error putensen clay adams,d.
as express messenger argues in its brief,the narrowed class definition that resulted from the rulings that cristler now challenges on appeal did not harm cristler,but instead strengthened cristler ability to demonstrate that the drivers who remained in the class were employees.in light of the trial court refusal to expand the class definition,the drivers who remained in the without any employees of their own and who did not deliver even an occasional package for clients other than express the most likely to be characterized as express messenger employees rather than as independent contractors.nevertheless,the jury and trial court found that even the members of this core group of drivers were independent contractors.had the class been expanded,as cristler now urges,to include drivers less likely to be considered employees,the verdict would have been the same.the only difference in the outcome of the proceedings would be that a larger group of drivers would have had their contentions considered,and rejected,by the triers of fact.we see no basis on which to construe this consequence as in any way prejudicial to cristler or otherwise constituting a miscarriage of justice.
as indicated above,express messenger includes a lengthy discussion of the absence of prejudice under a separate heading in its appellate brief.cristler provides no response to this discussion in its reply brief.cristler only discussion of prejudice anywhere in its briefing is buried in a footnote in its reply brief where cristler highlights express messenger assertion that if anyone was prejudiced by the narrow class definition,it was express messenger.cristler then asserts reversal is warranted because prejudice was apparently suffered by all parties.see people williams cal th,d,contentions perfunctorily asserted without argument in support are not properly before appellate court.
given the adverse findings by the jury and the trial court with respect to the class members remaining in the class,there is no indication in the record and cristler points to none that would suggest that cristler was prejudiced by the more narrow class definition that resulted from the trial court rulings.cristler therefore,fails to carry its burden of demonstrating that the trial court error,if any,in its rulings with respect to the class definition was sufficiently prejudicial to warrant reversal.
the trial court instructions were not erroneous 
cristler contends that the trial court erred in instructing the jury with respect to the burden of proof and with respect to the factors the jury should consider in distinguishing employees from independent contractors.we address each of these instructional challenges below after setting forth the applicable standard of review.
standard of review 
the trial court duty to instruct the jury is discharged if its instructions embrace all points of law necessary to a decision.thompson pacific construction,city of sunnyvale th,d thompson pacific.a party is not entitled to have the jury instructed in any particular fashion or phraseology,and may not complain if the court correctly gives the substance of the applicable law.ibid.
when a party challenges a particular jury instruction as being incorrect or incomplete,we evaluate the instructions given as a whole,not in isolation.people rundle cal th,d,rundle.for ambiguous instructions,the test is whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury misunderstood and misapplied the instruction.ibid.the propriety of jury instructions is a question of law that we review de novo.see people cole cal th,d.
burden of proof instruction 
cristler contends that the trial court erroneously instructed the jury on the burden of proof as to whether the class members were properly classified as employees or independent contractors.we disagree.
as pertinent to this challenge,the trial court instructed the jury as follows 
the issue for you to decide is whether or not the plaintiffs are employees or independent contractors.
the plaintiffs allege that they were defendant employees.
the defendant claims that the plaintiffs were independent contractors,and were not employees.
plaintiffs have the obligation to prove that they were defendant employees.the defendant has the obligation to prove that the plaintiffs were independent contractors.
cristler contends that these instructions were erroneous because they obscured the fact that california law required express messenger to bear the burden of establishing that persons in its service were independent contractors.for this contention,cristler relies on section,which states any person rendering service for another,other than as an independent contractor,or unless expressly excluded herein,is presumed to be an employee.cristler contends that the trial court instruction,as quoted above,wrongfully deprived them of th is evidentiary presumption.see lujan minagar th,d there is a rebuttable presumption that one who furnishes services for an employer is an employee.
we find no error in the instructions.in evaluating jury instructions,we consider the jury instructions as a whole.rundle,supra,cal th at,d.here,the entirety of the instructions included not only the statements quoted above,but also the following discussion of employees and independent contractors 
any person rendering service for another,other than as an independent contractor,is presumed to be an employee.
employer means any person who directly or indirectly employs or exercises control over the wages,hours,or working conditions of any person.
employee means every person in the service of an employer under any appointment or contract of hire or apprenticeship,express or implied,oral or written,whether lawfully or unlawfully employed.
independent contractor means any person who renders service for a specified recompense for a specified result,under the control of his principal as to the result of his work only and not as to the means by which such result is accomplished.
considering the instruction alongside the instruction challenged by cristler demonstrates that there was no error.
the trial court instruction that cristler had the obligation to prove that the class members were express messenger employees did not improperly shift the burden of proof on the question of independent contractor status to cristler.the instruction,in context,simply required cristler to trigger the rebuttable presumption in section by coming forward with some foundational evidence that linked the class members and the services they provided to express messenger,that the class members delivered packages on behalf of express messenger as opposed to,say,federal express.the court instructions included a definition of employee that encompassed any person who,by agreement,provided a service to an employer,and an instruction that any such is not an independent presumed to be an employee.
given these instructions,the ultimate legal question presented to the jury was not whether cristler could show that the class members were employees.rather it was whether the class members,while otherwise indisputably employees,were exempted from the broad definition of employee by virtue of being independent contractors.on this question,the trial court instruction unambiguously placed the burden on express messenger,stating the defendant has the obligation to prove that the plaintiffs were independent contractors.thus,the instructions in their entirety were sufficiently clear in establishing that express messenger bore the burden of establishing cristler independent contractor status,and that the class otherwise falling within the expansive definition of employee did not have the burden of disproving such status.rundle,supra,cal th at,d,ambiguous jury instructions do not warrant reversal unless there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury misunderstood and misapplied the instruction.
in addition,the instructions noted above included a verbatim restatement of section itself.thus,to the extent cristler was entitled to have the jury informed of the evidentiary presumption contained in section,the trial court recitation of that section verbatim satisfied that entitlement.while section may be somewhat tautological yellow cab cooperative,workers comp.appeals bd.d,cristler can hardly complain that the trial court instructions failed to communicate the substance of section when the court provided the jury with the precise language of that section.see metcalf county of san joaquin cal th,d,instructions in the language of an applicable statute are properly given.
b.the instruction on the relevant substantive considerations 
cristler also contends that the trial court erred in instructing the jury as to the factors to consider in resolving whether the class members were independent contractors.
with respect to this challenge,the trial court instructed the jury as follows 
in determining whether the plaintiffs and other class members drivers were employees or independent contractors,you must consider a number of factors.you will need to weigh all of these factors based on the evidence that you have heard.
the most important factor to consider is the extent to which the defendant has the right to control the details of the work performed.the following additional factors are to be considered 
the right to discharge at will without cause 
whether the drivers are engaged in a distinct occupation or business 
the skill required in this occupation 
whether the driver or california overnight pays for vehicles,equipment,and business expenses 
the length of time for which the services are to be performed 
the method of payment to drivers,whether by the hour or by the job 
whether or not the work done by drivers is part of the regular business of california overnight 
whether or not the parties believe they are creating an relationship 
the driver opportunity for entrepreneurial profit or loss depending upon managerial skill 
the drivers use of and 
the degree of permanence of the working relationship.
these individual factors can not be applied mechanically as separate tests they are intertwined and their weight depends often upon particular combinations.
cristler contends that the instruction quoted above is erroneous because it is inconsistent with our supreme court opinion in borello,supra,cal d,we disagree.
the trial court instruction is drawn from the body of case law summarized at the outset of this opinion that includes borello itself.thus,it is incorrect to suggest that the trial court instruction is inconsistent either with california law generally or borello in particular.the challenged jury instruction simply lists,in a neutral fashion,the pertinent factors identified in the case law prior to borello,in borello itself,and in the case law that followed borello.see estrada,supra,th at,d air couriers,supra,th at,d.in so doing,the instruction provided the jury with a correct statement of the substance of the applicable law.consequently,there is no basis to conclude that the trial court erred in providing the instruction to the jury.thompson pacific,supra,th at,d a party is not entitled to have the jury instructed in any particular fashion or phraseology,and may not complain if the court correctly gives the substance of the applicable law.
cristler highlights the fact that the trial court instruction emphasized the importance of the right of an employer to control the details of the work,without explaining that,in borello,the supreme court concluded that the control of the details factor was not necessarily dispositive in every circumstance.see borello,supra,cal d at.the borello opinion itself recognized,however,that while not dispositive in the case of the cucumber harvesters,the right of the employer to control work details is the most important or most significant consideration,and emphasized only that the factor should not be applied rigidly and in isolation and the authorities also endorse several secondary indicia of the nature of a service relationship.borello,at.as noted above,the trial court here did not list only the control of the details factor,or suggest that it should be applied rigidly or in isolation,but included the numerous secondary indicia recognized in borello in its instruction ibid,and emphasized that the jury should weigh all the factors,and t hese individual factors can not be applied mechanically as separate tests they are intertwined and their weight depends often upon particular combinations.
cristler also emphasizes other language in borello that discussed the application of certain considerations to the facts of that case,and was not included in the trial court instruction,pervasive control of the operations,the integration of the worker service into the core business of the employer,and the relative strength of the factor.this nuanced critique of the trial court instruction does not demonstrate error 
as we have noted,the trial court was required to provide the jury with the substance of the applicable law,not an exhaustive summary of the various ways in which that case law had been applied in other cases.thompson pacific,supra,th at,d.here,the trial court performed its duty by providing the jury with a list of pertinent factors drawn from the controlling case law,and highlighting,as the case law does,the control factor as the most important factor.while certain cases such as borello emphasize other of the factors in various evaluating whether substantial evidence supports a finding of the trier of cases do not purport to redefine the factors themselves.nor does borello,as cristler counsel suggested at oral argument,purport to separate out a class of cases for which instructional amplification of the first borello factor is mandated.borello specifically stressed that w e adopt no detailed new standards for examination of the issue and contains no suggestion that different legal standards apply in the context of different occupations.rather,the court stated,each service arrangement must be evaluated on its facts,and the dispositive circumstances may vary from case to case.borello,supra,cal d at,italics added.
in sum,the trial court,after listing the pertinent factors,was permitted to allow the jury to apply the factors as it saw fit and was not required to frame the jury deliberations in precisely the fashion preferred by cristler.
the trial court did not err in its ruling on the unfair and unlawful business practices claims 
echoing its contentions regarding the allegedly erroneous instructions discussed in the preceding section,cristler contends that the trial court also erred when it resolved cristler unfair and unlawful business practices claims in favor of express messenger.
specifically,cristler argues that the trial court erred because it applied the same erroneous legal principles in resolving cristler equitable claims as it provided to the jury.cristler summarizes when this court finds that the trial court erroneously interpreted and applied borello in the instructions it gave to the jury,it should similarly find that the trial court own misinterpretation and misapplication of borello in its subsequent statement of decision also requires reversal.
as discussed in part iii,ante,the trial court instructions to the jury were not erroneous and consequently,even if we assumed that the trial court applied these same legal principles in resolving cristler nonjury claims all of which were predicated on the same core claim,there would be no cause for reversal.
cristler fails to carry its burden of demonstrating any evidentiary error 
cristler contends that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing testimony regarding the ability of the class members generally,and master contractors who were not included in the class in particular,to earn increased profit as independent contractors.we conclude that cristler has failed to carry its burden of demonstrating reversible error.
prior to trial,cristler submitted an in limine motion seeking to exclude evidence about the amount employee drivers were compensated.after a lengthy discussion in a pretrial hearing of the relevance of evidence of the drivers earnings,the trial court denied the motion.
focusing our review at the outset on the in limine ruling,we perceive no abuse of discretion.the motion sought to completely preclude inquiry into a broad subject matter that was virtually identical to one of the classification factors recognized in the case law and submitted to the jury t he driver opportunity for entrepreneurial profit or loss depending upon managerial skill.see borello,supra,cal d at,recognizing this factor as logically pertinent to the inherently difficult determination whether a provider of service is an employee or an excluded independent contractor.consequently,the trial court acted well within its discretion in denying the in limine motion.
of course,the possibility remains that specific testimony offered by express messenger at trial on this topic was irrelevant,or unduly prejudicial or misleading,and should have been excluded.indeed,cristler asserts that at trial,the trial court time and again allowed a steady drum beat of testimony about the financial advantages and freedoms drivers enjoyed as independent contractors.cristler,however,fails to identify in its appellate brief any specific objectionable testimony that was presented during the trial and provides no record citations to assist the court in locating any such testimony in the transcript of trial proceedings.this is fatal to his claim.see air couriers,supra,th at,d party on appeal has the duty to support the arguments in the briefs by appropriate reference to the record,which includes providing exact page citations,and w e have no duty to search the record for evidence and may disregard any factual contention not supported by proper citations to the record people desantis cal th,d,reviewing court not required to scrutinize the record to find support for counsel assertions people stanley cal th,d,it is not the role of reviewing court to independently seek out support for appellant conclusory assertions,and such contentions may be rejected without consideration paterno state of california th,d an appellate court is not required to examine undeveloped claims,nor to make arguments for parties cal.rules of court,rule a c any reference to a matter in the record must be supported by a citation to the volume and page number of the record where the matter appears.the sole specific evidence on increased earnings that cristler references,and provides a record citation for,is the testimony of a defense expert robert wallace,a cpa economist who inten
