background 
on april,a grand jury of the united states district court for the district of columbia indicted,operator of an alternative payment system involving online transactions gold and silver reserve,gsr,the operator of website and a digital currency exchange service known as omni pay,through which funds could be with douglas jackson,chairman and chief executive officer of and gsr and majority owner of gsr barry downey,secretary and director of and gsr and owner of percent of gsr and reid jackson,managing director of and gsr and owner of three percent of gsr.the indictment alleged one count of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business in violation of,two counts of operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business,and one count of money transmitting without a license.on april,while the indictment remained sealed,the united states filed an ex parte application and a supporting affidavit with the united states district court seeking to seize for forfeiture to the united states property held in two digital currency accounts,one in the name of and the other of gsr.the application alleged that the accounts constituted property involved in an unlicensed money transmitting business in violation of.the district court properly issued the seizure warrant upon a finding that there is probable cause to believe that the property at issue may become worthless property for purposes of its forfeitures and that,at this time,conversion of property valued as into gold or funds denominated as united states currency is reasonable and necessary.the court further ordered gsr to the held in the account s at issue into gold or into the funds denominated as united states currency within hours of the execution of this warrant and to provide that gold or currency through the federal law enforcement officers serving the warrant.the restraining order also imposed restrictions on further transactions by the defendants.the government obtained from appellants under the seizure warrant.
appellants move to vacate the civil seizure warrant and modify the restraining order to permit,inter alia,the use of the seized assets for the purpose of retaining counsel in defense of the action.in their motion,appellants sought an evidentiary hearing as to the propriety of the seizure of assets,and specifically as to the existence of probable cause to believe that the defendants had committed an offense warranting the issuance of the seizure warrant and restraining order.in a bench ruling,reflected in a minute order,the district court denied appellants motion,and in so doing,ruled the defendants were not entitled to a evidentiary hearing.
appellants filed the instant appeal,arguing that the seizure without a evidentiary hearing violated their due process rights in violation of the fifth amendment.appellants further argue the seizure violates the sixth amendment right to counsel because they were unable to afford counsel of their choice without the seized assets.during the pendency of this appeal,a magistrate judge ruled that the individual defendants had made a showing of financial inability to retain counsel and were eligible for appointed counsel.
for the reasons more fully set forth below,we conclude that appellants have established that their constitutional rights are being violated by the continued seizure of their assets without a evidentiary hearing.we therefore vacate the order of the district court and remand the case to the district court for such a hearing.
ii.analysis 
jurisdiction 
the government first asserts that this appeal should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.as in any appeal,this court,as a court of limited jurisdiction,must first ascertain if we have jurisdiction to entertain the controversy before us.the government argues that we do not have jurisdiction over this case.
while the government argument is not simplistic,it rests on the simple proposition that our appellate jurisdiction in criminal cases is limited to final decisions of the district courts.in the government view,review of the court ruling on the seizure warrant and the restraining order does not fall within our jurisdiction,as the court ruling did not constitute a final decision.that is,we will not have jurisdiction to review the court rulings until a trial and final judgment.the government candidly admits that there are exceptions to the rule of finality,but it argues that this case falls within none of those exceptions.appellants assert that the restraint of their assets pending trial and judgment is reviewable on interlocutory appeal under a.we agree.
while we have not previously passed on the jurisdiction of circuit courts to hear interlocutory appeals in cases like the one before us,other circuits have.in united states kirschenbaum,cir,the seventh circuit considered the same argument the government makes before us.that circuit analyzed a,which establishes the jurisdiction of the circuit courts to hear appeals from 
interlocutory orders of the district courts of the united states granting,continuing,modifying,refusing or dissolving injunctions,or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions,except where a direct review may be had in the supreme court.
the kirschenbaum court concluded that the order before it,paralleling the order under review in this case,constituted such a refusal to dissolve or modify an injunction and was therefore within the jurisdiction of the court to hear interlocutory appeals.id.at.we agree.as the seventh circuit noted,there is considerable weight of authority from numerous circuits in support of this proposition.the seventh circuit noted the following cases to that effect 
united states floyd,cir pretrial ex parte protective order under b seizure of property is injunction covered by a united states ripinsky,cir same citing united states roth,cir restraining order under e see also united states field,cir reviewing postindictment ex parte restraining order under b without discussing basis for appellate jurisdiction.and courts have reached the same conclusion regarding restraining orders under e,which b incorporates.roth,at postindictment ex parte restraining order under e appealable under a united states monsanto,cir same,vacated on rehearing en banc on other grounds,cir per curiam,and rev on other grounds,d reviewing merits without addressing jurisdictional basis united states estevez,cir.
id.additionally,the tenth and third circuits reached the same conclusion with respect to parallel forfeiture orders under other statutes.see united states musson,cir reviewing order under rico,e in re assets of martin,cir same.
the government argues that a is inapplicable to forfeitures under,as the forfeiture involved is,in the government view,not the subject of an injunction.that statute,as the government reminds us,provides that seizures pursuant to this section shall be made pursuant to a warrant obtained in the same manner as provided for a search warrant under the federal rules of criminal procedure id.b.the word injunction is not used either in or in the order of the district court.
however,the formal denomination of the court order,either in the rules or in the order itself,is not dispositive.
the definition of an injunction under a is broad it is any order directed to a party,enforceable by contempt,and designed to accord or protect some or all of the substantive relief sought by a complaint in more than preliminary fashion.
pension fund benefit plan a cooper industries,quoting united states western,quotation marks omitted.in this case,the seizure warrant and restraining order,among other things,ordered the defendants to convert the in the relevant accounts into gold or united states currency,provide the gold or currency to the government within hours,and to do so by cash,wire transfer,or certified check.we do not understand the government to be contending that these words were unenforceable or that the defendants would not,at the very least,have been penalized by contempt had they failed to comply.shakespeare had juliet famously opine that that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.shakespeare,romeo and juliet,act,sc.indeed,as gertrude stein pointed out,a r ose is a rose is a rose.stein,sacred emily,in geography and plays.in this case we would advise the government that an injunction is an injunction is an injunction.that which we call an injunction by any other name is reviewable on interlocutory appeal.
we therefore join our fellow circuits and hold that the seizure warrant and restraining order are properly within our jurisdiction to hear interlocutory appeals under a.
due process 
having determined that the seizure warrant and restraining order are properly before us for review,we must then determine the merits of appellants claim that seizure of their assets upon the issuance of the indictment without an opportunity for adversary hearing constitutes a violation of their due process rights under the fifth amendment,at least in a case in which they have demonstrated the inability to retain counsel of their choice without access to the seized assets.we hold that the due process clause does require such an opportunity to be heard.
as in the case of the jurisdictional question,this circuit has not yet considered the question before us.other circuits have,as we will discuss more fully below.to begin with,we repair to first principles.in ascertaining the requirements of the due process clause in affording a hearing to those whose assets are the subject of seizure,we look first to the supreme court declarations in mathews eldridge,d.that case commands that the fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.id.at.quoting armstrong manzo,d.
so far as the meaning of meaningful time is concerned,a fundamental norm of the due process clause jurisprudence requires that before the government can constitutionally deprive a person of the protected liberty or property interest,it must afford him notice and hearing.national council of resistance dep t of state,citing mathews eldridge,at.we recognize that in many,the circumstances of this may be impossible to afford a full adversarial hearing before the initial seizure of the property in question.it may well be that in the case of a criminal proceeding in which the government may ultimately have rights in the property at issue,immediate protective measures must be taken in order to prevent dissipation or deterioration of the assets before the time for trial is reached.this does not,however,compel a conclusion that an adversarial hearing after the initial seizure may be finessed without violating the due process rights of the persons whose assets have been seized.to make that determination requires further inquiry.
in mathews eldridge,the supreme court set forth three elements of inquiry which the courts must apply in determining the due process rights of citizens who were subjected to the seizure of their property or other constitutionally protected interests 
first,the private interest that will be affected by the official action second,the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used,and the probable value,if any,of additional or substitute procedural safeguards and finally,the government interest,including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.
we have previously employed the mathews eldridge analysis in determining the constitutional necessity of a hearing to invasions of constitutionally protected interests occurring pretrial where circumstances may compel protective seizure before merits adjudication.see national council of resistance dep t of state,at.we have not,however,applied that analysis to civil seizure under or similar statutes.but as we noted above,other circuits have.
in united states monsanto,cir,the second circuit considered just the question before us on circumstances paralleling those we review.in monsanto,the second circuit,en banc,reviewed the case on remand from the supreme court decision in united states monsanto,d.the supreme court had held that although a pretrial asset restraining order based upon a grand jury finding of probable cause to believe that the assets are forfeitable may make unavailable any funds that a criminal defendant wishes to use for his private purposes,including funds needed to pay for his counsel of choice,it did not inherently run afoul of the fifth amendment due process rights of the property owner or his rights to counsel under the sixth amendment.id.at.however,the supreme court left open for the circuit decision on remand the question whether the due process clause requires a hearing before a pretrial restraining order can be imposed.id.at.the second circuit then determined the question before us in the present case,and we find its reasoning most instructive.
on remand,the en banc court first considered whether notice and a hearing were required before the initial seizure.the second circuit held,and we agree,that because the seizure operates to remove the assets from the control of the defendant on the claim of the government that it has a higher right to those assets,at,even though the seizure is potentially temporary,the deprivation of property is subject to the constraints of due process.id.at quoting north georgia finishing,d.thus,faced with the underlying principle that t he due process clause of the fifth amendment generally requires notice and an opportunity to be heard,a hearing would normally be in order.id.at quoting united states property at livonia,livonia,cir.however,the second circuit noted,and again we agree,that in extraordinary situations notice and a hearing may be postponed until after the deprivation.id.quoting fuentes shevin,d.
the extraordinary circumstances for the postponement of the due process hearing are satisfied where 
f irst,the seizure has been directly necessary to secure an important governmental or general public interest.second,there has been a special need for very prompt action.third,the state has kept strict control over its monopoly of legitimate force the person initiating the seizure has been a government official responsible for determining,under the standards of a narrowly drawn statute,that it was necessary and justified in the particular instance.
id.quoting fuentes,at.
like the second circuit,we hold that the circumstances giving rise to the seizure of assets upon probable cause that the assets were used in violation of specified criminal statutes meets the extraordinary circumstances test for seizure without a predeprivation hearing.there is no doubt that the first requirement is met.as the second circuit noted,the several governmental and public ends includ e separating a criminal from his gains,caplin drysdale,chartered united states,d obtaining substantial funds for the furtherance of law enforcement,see permitting recovery of assets by their rightful owners,and lessening the economic po
