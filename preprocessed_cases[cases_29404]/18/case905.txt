background 
summit is a corporation headquartered in minneapolis,minnesota,which provides clinical outcomes medical database software and related products and services.according to the first amended complaint,million shares of summit common stock began trading publicly on august,at per share.following the initial public offering,the summit stock price increased even though no profit was shown by summit.a secondary public offering was made in june.at the end of,the summit stock price began to decline,and it eventually fell below the price at which the stock was initially offered to the public.on march,summit publicly disclosed that it had been improperly recognizing revenues.following an investigation,summit announced that it planned to restate its financial results dating back to.on april,summit filed revised statements with the sec showing the total revenues for the years and,and the first nine months of,to be million less than originally reported,representing an cumulative shortfall.see in re summit,d at.
following summit public disclosures,numerous lawsuits were brought against defendants,resulting in the present consolidated action.see joint appendix,vol.i,at magistrate judge order consolidating complaints,appointing lead plaintiffs,and approving lead counsel,pursuant to the private securities litigation reform act of pslra,a.on august,the lead plaintiffs in this consolidated case filed the first amended complaint.see id.at.in their factual allegations,plaintiffs averred that summit initially filed a draft registration statement and prospectus with the sec on june,that summit thereafter filed several amendments to its draft registration statement and prospectus,and that summit filed its final registration statement and prospectus on august.see id.at.hereinafter the registration statement refers to the final version filed by summit on august.according to the first amended complaint,the registration statement identified e y as an expert which had audited and certified summit financial statements,and it set forth e y opinion that summit consolidated financial statements presented fairly,in all material respects,the consolidated financial position of summit for the and fiscal years,and the results of summit consolidated operations and its consolidated cash flows for,and,in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap.id.at in count iii of the first amended complaint,plaintiffs asserted that,because of summit premature recognition of revenue in violation of gaap and summit own revenue recognition policies,the registration statement contained materially false and misleading statements and omissions regarding summit actual financial status and accounting practices from as early as.see id.at.in their prayer for relief,plaintiffs sought,among other things,monetary damages,attorneys fees,and their costs of litigation.whitney mcfarlin,though not a lead plaintiff,was identified in the first amended complaint as a named plaintiff.see id.at.
defendants,including e y,moved to dismiss the first amended complaint on several grounds.the district court granted in part and denied in part defendants motion to dismiss.in re summit,d at.as to the claim against e y,the district court held,as a matter of law,that only those plaintiffs who purchased their stock in the summit initial public offering had standing to sue.see id.at.in support of this holding,the district court relied upon gustafson alloyd,d gustafson holding that aftermarket purchasers of securities did not have a claim under of the act.the district court explained that the act must be read as a whole and that,based upon the shared legislative history and legislative intent behind and of the act,the standing principles announced in gustafson apply equally to section and claims.in re summit,d at citing in re wrt energy sec,wl,at,dismissing,for lack of standing,a claim brought by aftermarket purchasers of securities,based upon interpretation and application of gustafson.the district court dismissed the claim of all the named plaintiffs except for two one of whom was mcfarlin who appeared to have acquired their stock in summit august initial public offering.id.as to the other plaintiffs,the district court dismissed their claim without prejudice and with leave to replead the claim to establish standing consistent with the district court interpretation of the statute.id 
plaintiffs subsequently filed a second amended and consolidated class action complaint the second amended complaint,see joint appendix,vol.ii,at,which again included under count iii a claim against e y and others.this time,however,it was brought by the two plaintiffs who appeared to have purchased their summit shares in the august initial public offering,on behalf of the members of the class who had purchased their summit shares in the initial public offering.see id.at.e y moved to dismiss the claim in the second amended complaint,and the district court scheduled a hearing.at the hearing,held on november,plaintiffs acknowledged that mcfarlin was the only named plaintiff who had purchased stock in summit august initial public offering,and they asked to have mcfarlin appointed a lead plaintiff.the district court orally denied plaintiffs request on the ground that it would be inconsistent with the pslra to appoint mcfarlin as a lead plaintiff at that point in the litigation.see joint appendix,vol.ii,at transcript of proceedings that,in my view,both contravenes the words of the designation,and in fact contravenes the strongly expressed spirit of congress inherent in the passage of the pslra.thereafter,pursuant to.b,the district court dismissed plaintiffs claim against e y as set forth in the second amended complaint.in re summit,order.
following an agreement by the parties to settle the remaining claims against summit and its officers and directors,the district court entered an order approving the terms of the settlement and entering final judgment.id,judgment.this appeal followed.
