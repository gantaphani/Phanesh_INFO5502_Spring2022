mcdonald corporation mcdonald and related parties appeal from orders granting a preliminary injunction to syed ali husain and khursheed husain the husains permitting the husains to continue operating three mcdonald restaurants in marin county pending completion of a trial in this action.we affirm the orders.
factual and procedural background 
factual background 
husain and his wife have owned mcdonald franchises since the early.by,they held five mcdonald franchises in san francisco and daly city.in june,the husains entered into an agreement with third parties the magruders to purchase an additional seven mcdonald restaurants in marin county.the magruders franchise agreements with mcdonald required they obtain mcdonald consent to the transfer of ownership.in two separate assignment agreements between the husains,the magruders,and mcdonald,mcdonald consented to the magruders assignment of their franchise agreements to the husains the dispute in this case centers on whether mcdonald made an enforceable promise to the husains to extend or rewrite the franchise terms for three of the restaurants novato,fourth street,and merrydale either in the assignment agreement or otherwise.
when mcdonald opens a new restaurant or rewrites an existing franchise,it normally grants franchise rights for a year term,absent lease tenure issues.however,the corte madera,northgate,novato,fourth street,merrydale,and mill valley locations all had five years or less remaining in their franchise terms at the time of the husains purchase.only the hamilton franchise,not due to expire until,had substantially more than five years left to run 
the husains assumed considerable financial obligations in connection with the purchase of the new locations.pursuant to mcdonald borrowing guidelines,the husains financed the purchase of the marin franchises with a,million note,refinanced in by a,million note,which was secured by all of the fixtures and equipment at the husains existing and newly acquired restaurants.the loans also financed approximately in renovations and other reinvestment at the marin franchises which mcdonald required the husains to complete by august,under the assignment agreements.the husains acknowledged in the agreements timely completion of these reinvestments was a material term of the magruder franchise agreements which they were assuming.
paragraph of the assignment agreement stated in relevant part as follows in consideration of mcdonald consent to this assignment and the issuance of a rewrite to assignee,assignor waives,releases,and disclaims any claim for a rewrite of the franchise for the corte madera location.italics added.paragraph goes on to include a general release releasing mcdonald from any possible future claims by the magruders,including claims arising from the corte madera franchise.the husains contend paragraph constitutes mcdonald promise to the husains that it would rewrite the franchise agreements for all of the restaurants covered by the assignment agreement with the exception of the hamilton location,which had more than years remaining on its franchise.mcdonald contends the paragraph promises only that it would rewrite the corte madera franchise agreement since it had already denied the magruders a rewrite for that franchise 
there is no dispute mcdonald did offer the husains new year franchise terms in january for the novato,fourth street,and merrydale franchises under a program known as plan to win.under the program,after the sale of a franchise between existing mcdonald operators,a new year franchise term would be offered to the purchaser if the remaining term for the acquired restaurant was less than years and certain other criteria were met.the purchaser would have to agree to pay a prorated portion of the initial franchise fee mcdonald charged for new year franchise terms.in january,jodi breen of mcdonald sent husain three offer letters offering,respectively,to extend the terms on the husains novato,fourth street,and merrydale franchises to.the offers required husain to pay prorated initial franchise fees totaling approximately for the three locations.
mcdonald denied receiving any response from husain to the offers.breen testified she left a voicemail message for husain after the deadline for responding to the offers had passed,but got no response.in march,breen sent husain a letter confirming she had received no response to the offers and advising him the offers were no longer on the table.husain denied receiving the march letter.
husain contended he did timely accept the offers by mailing his signed acceptance from the capuchino station post office in burlingame on january,and he submitted a copy of a post office certificate of mailing to substantiate that contention.mcdonald presented evidence the capuchino post office branch was closed on january,and called an expert to establish husain could have easily fabricated the certificate of mailing.
as of the summer of,the husains had not begun the vast majority of the reinvestment work they were supposed to have completed by that time.however,according to a business review mcdonald completed in august,the husains restaurants met all of the national franchising standards and were eligible for growth and rewrite.
in and,the husains suffered business setbacks,including financial losses caused at least in part by a store manager embezzlement from one of the san francisco stores,which was not discovered until april.according to the manager confession to police,his embezzlement began in the fall of and was ongoing until he was tripped up after the installation of a new computer software program in.the husains began falling consistently behind in their payment of fees and rent to mcdonald beginning in december,and also missed payments to the regional operators cooperative for coordinated advertising and their primary food distributor.by the summer of,the husains owed mcdonald over and the cooperative over.mcdonald threatened to terminate the husains franchises if these arrearages were not paid in full.in july,husain borrowed on his home and brought himself current with mcdonald and the advertising cooperative.there were no further arrearages after that point.
husain contended the financial issues took him by surprise and he attributed them primarily to the employee embezzlement that was discovered later he testified he believed at the time someone had hacked into his bank accounts.mcdonald offered evidence husain was fully informed all along about the growing arrearages,and he was less than candid with mcdonald about the causes of the problem,telling the company falsely the bank was investigating the possible hacking of his mcdonald accounts.by all accounts,the parties business relationship soured in,and mcdonald began warning husain it was not going to approve future rewrites of his franchises,pointing to his substantial arrearages in and his continued failure to complete agreed reinvestment work on his restaurants.
unless rewritten by mcdonald,the franchise term for the novato restaurant was due to expire on december.in,the husains had still not completed the reinvestment work on the novato restaurant,including the enclosure of its restrooms.the mcdonald rewrite committee rewrite committee met on december,and voted not to offer the husains a new franchise term for the novato restaurant,citing the husains financial condition as reflected in their past failure to timely pay their debts to mcdonald,and their continuing failure to live up to their contractual reinvestment obligations,which mcdonald believed was having a negative impact on its brand image.a month before the final decision,mcdonald invited the husains to submit any relevant information they wished to offer on the issue of the rewrite for the three franchises in issue.in response,husain submitted a written narrative and a large packet of documents,and spoke at length with a mcdonald representative about the issue.he did not mention in any of his submissions or conversations either that he believed mcdonald had promised him new year franchise agreements for the marin restaurants as part of the magruder transaction,or that he had signed and returned the breen plan to win offer letters in january.
following the rewrite committee decision,mcdonald urged the husains to sell the three marin franchises prior to their expiration dates.to facilitate the sale,mcdonald offered to grant new franchise terms for the restaurants to any approved purchasers.mcdonald contends this was consistent with the policy assertedly reflected in paragraph of its two assignment agreements with the husains that after denying an operator a rewrite for a franchise it would assist the operator in selling the franchise by agreeing to rewrite it for an approved purchaser.
injunction proceedings 
the husains advised mcdonald they did not intend to sell the stores,and filed this lawsuit in december.the husains sought injunctive relief to prevent mcdonald from removing them from the novato restaurant on december,when their franchise expired.mcdonald,and applied for a preliminary injunction requiring the husains to surrender the restaurant.
the trial court set an evidentiary hearing on the competing motions,permitting the husains to remain in the novato restaurant in the interim.more than days of evidentiary hearings were held in may,june,july,august,and september.the trial court issued its written ruling on december,by which time the husains franchise agreements for fourth street and merrydale had also expired.the court denied mcdonald motion,granted the husains motion,and issued a preliminary injunction requiring mcdonald to permit the husains to continue operating the three restaurants in issue during the pendency of the suit.the court found paragraph of the assignment agreement was ambiguous and susceptible to the meaning ascribed to it by the husains,and that some of the extrinsic evidence supported the husains interpretation.the court also found the balance of harms resulting from an error in granting or denying interim injunctive relief weighed strongly in the husains favor.
mcdonald timely appealed from the court december,ruling case no.and from an ensuing order granting the husains preliminary injunction motion and denying mcdonald motion case no.
ii.discussion 
mcdonald contends the trial court prejudicially erred in granting injunctive relief to prevent the breach of a contract for personal services that,as a matter of law,can not be specifically enforced finding the husains had a likelihood of success on the merits of their contract claim and assessing the balance of harms to the two parties from erroneously granting or denying interim relief.

specific performance of franchise agreements 
relying principally on woolley embassy suites,d woolley,mcdonald argues its franchise agreements with restaurant operators are,in essence,contracts for the personal services of the franchisee not subject,as a matter of law,to the remedy of specific enforcement by either party in the event of a breach.it emphasizes language in its franchise agreements to the effect that the maintenance of a close personal working relationship with mcdonald is the essence of the franchise.
the plaintiffs in woolley owned hotels throughout the that were franchised to embassy suites embassy.woolley,supra,d at.embassy also managed of the hotels for the plaintiffs under individual management agreements pursuant to which the owner had the right to terminate the manager on certain conditions.ibid.the plaintiffs filed suit against embassy,alleging material breach of the management agreements and seeking,among other things,a judicial declaration the agreements could be terminated.ibid.embassy sought and obtained a preliminary injunction enjoining the plaintiffs from terminating or attempting to terminate any of the management agreements,and the plaintiffs appealed.id.at.there was no dispute regarding the embassy franchise agreements.id.at,fn.
the court of appeal reversed the preliminary injunction order on several grounds,including the principle that an injunction can not be granted to prevent the breach of a personal services contract.woolley,supra,d at.the court found the management agreements at issue called for the rendition of a performance that is of a distinctly personal and character in the same category as the contracts of actors and artists,managers,sales agents,mechanics,cooks,and contracts for the furnishing of personal care and support.id.at,quoting corbin,contracts at,italics omitted see also,obligations to render personal service or employ another in personal service can not be specifically enforced.the appellate court reasoned the management agreements entrusted embassy with such,complex,discretionary decisionmaking,and required such special skill and judgment on embassy part,they could only be considered contracts for the rendition of personal service by embassy the manager duties include hiring and firing managerial personnel and hundreds of other employees,contracting for utility services,landscaping,maintenance and security,processing reservations,arranging for advertising and promotion,and filing legal actions on the owner behalf to collect rent charges,cancel leases or dispossess guests.in other words,the contracts call for a series of complex and delicate business decisions and require mutual cooperation and trust,both of which have ceased to exist in the wake of rancorous litigation between the parties.woolley,at.
in our view,woolley is distinguishable.the court in woolley emphasized the discretionary nature of the decisionmaking authority held by embassy and the complexity and delicacy of the business decisions entrusted to it.it found the services required to be as distinctly personal and as the services of an actor or artist.woolley,supra,d at.in other words,the court found the contract in issue was for personal services because management of the hotels by embassy and no other was central to the contract.the husains franchise and licensing agreements with mcdonald were of a completely different and opposite character.
the form license agreement between mcdonald and the husains for the novato restaurant explains the essence of the mcdonald system is to ensure comprehensive control by mcdonald over every material aspect of the restaurant operations so the uniformity of the mcdonald customer experience could be assured in every one of its locations the mcdonald system is a comprehensive restaurant system for the retailing of a limited menu of uniform and quality food products,emphasizing prompt and courteous service in a clean,wholesome atmosphere the foundation of the mcdonald system and the essence of this license is adherence by licensee to standards and policies of licensor providing for the uniform operation of all mcdonald restaurants including,but not limited to,serving only designated food and beverage products the use of only prescribed equipment and building layout and designs strict adherence to designated food and beverage specifications and to licensor prescribed standards of quality,service and cleanliness italics added.the license agreement requires the husains to comply with all business policies,practices,and procedures imposed by mcdonald,serve only those food and beverage products mcdonald designates,maintain the building,equipment,and parking area in compliance with standards designated by mcdonald,and purchase fixtures,lighting and other equipment,seating,and signs in accordance with mcdonald designated standards.mcdonald also dictates the restaurant hours,the uniforms worn by employees,all containers and paper products used,and all food and beverage flavorings and ingredients.
in in re sunrise restaurants,b,the court analyzed whether a form of franchise agreement indistinguishable from that used by mcdonald was a personal service contract.in that case,a bankruptcy debtor who owned four burger king restaurants sought to sell the restaurants and associated franchise agreements,along with other assets,in order to pay off creditors.id.at.burger king opposed the sale and contended its franchise agreements with the debtor could not be assigned under the bankruptcy code because they were contracts for personal services.in re sunrise restaurants,at.the court rejected burger king position there is hardly any question that the relationship between parties was nothing more than a strict business transaction to furnish economic gains to both contracting parties.to run a burger king retail establishment does not require a special knowledge in a conventional sense,that is a special judgment,taste,skill or ability.the entire franchise operation is based on the strict rules and conditions imposed by the contract,and no retail operator is permitted to utilize his own independent culinary skills to cook hamburgers or to serve any other food items which are not generally served in burger king establishments according to their standard.this being the case,the objection by burger king to the debtor right to assume or assign the franchise agreements and other contractual rights is without merit and must be rejected.id.at.
applying california law,the court in in re health plan of the redwoods health plan,found a physician group contract with a bankrupt hmo to provide medical services to its members was not a personal service contract under california law because it did not involve a personal relation of confidence between the parties or rely on the character and personal ability of a party a test it derived from coykendall jackson d.health plan,at.in order to be considered a personal service contract,there must be a special relationship between the parties or the party to perform must possess special knowledge or a unique skill,such that no performance save that of the contracting party could meet the obligations of the contract,italics added.the court stated while a contract for a physician services might have been considered ipso facto a personal service contract or years ago,everything about these contracts and the nature of modern medical care militates against a finding that the contracts in question here are personal service contracts.absolutely nothing supports a finding that the contracts or the services to be rendered under them are sui generis.all of the physician contracts are essentially identical,and do not require the physicians to perform personally.they only require that the physician provide services to members,and require physicians to make arrangements to assure care of member patients after hours or when physician is otherwise absent,consistent with health plan administrative requirements.id.at.
a close personal working relationship does not automatically equate to personal services as defined by law.that depends on the nature and substance of the relationship.here,the husains are not providing personal services to mcdonald except in the limited sense that they are expected to work in the business rather than be passive investors.although they are providing their services to mcdonald customers,they do so in a manner mcdonald strictly controls.from the perspective of mcdonald,the husains are primarily providing a flow of income to the corporation.that is wholly unlike the management agreement at issue in woolley.the plaintiffs in woolley paid embassy consideration to make a myriad of complex managerial decisions directly impacting the value of and return on the plaintiffs very sizeable hotel investments.here,mcdonald is not paying the husains in order to benefit from their special skills,taste,or managerial judgment,but has granted them a franchise based on their willingness and ability to faithfully carry out the mcdonald system and secure for mcdonald the target flow of revenues it expects to achieve from the franchised locations.mcdonald relies on its right to control the husains performance,not on their special tastes or abilities 
mcdonald tacitly acknowledges its franchise agreements are not personal service contracts by arguing in another context that there is a very robust market for the sale of mcdonald franchises,and the husains could have easily sold the franchises to an approved purchaser just as the magruders had done.in that light,and considering that all of mcdonald franchise and licensing agreements with its many thousands of franchisees are standardized,and comprehensively dictate the terms of each franchisee performance,it can hardly be said no performance save that of the husains could meet the obligations of the contract.health plan,supra,at.
we recognize some cases applying florida law as set forth in burger chef systems,burger chef of.so d burger chef have held franchise agreements are not subject to specific performance as a matter of law.see,burger king e z eating,civ.civ wl burger king weaver.however the seminal decision,burger chef,involved a permanent injunction,not an interim injunction pendente lite.so d at.the burger chef court did not suggest the same rule would apply to interim injunctive relief and,in fact,cited with apparent favor two decisions upholding temporary injunctions against the termination of franchises until the merits of the dispute could be decided.id.at,fn,citing bateman ford motor company cir and semmes motors,ford motor company cir.in any event,we do not find burger chef and the cases relying on it persuasive.the burger chef opinion is devoid of any analysis supporting its per se rule that no contract involving an element of personal service,including franchise agreements,can be subject to specific performance 
we therefore reject mcdonald contention that the injunction violates california law and policy regarding the availability of specific performance.
likelihood of success on the merits 
the trial court concluded the husains had met their burden of showing a reasonable probability of success on the merits of their claim that paragraph of the assignment agreement promised them rewrites of the novato,merrydale,and fourth street franchise agreements.mcdonald disputes this.viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the husains and indulging all reasonable inferences in favor of the trial court order,we must determine if any substantial evidence in the record supports the trial court finding.gleaves waters d.
the trial court found extrinsic evidence would be admissible at trial to construe whether paragraph constituted a promise by mcdonald to rewrite all five franchises subject to the assignment agreement that would be expiring within a few years,or merely a promise to rewrite the corte madera franchise.the court further determined there was disputed extrinsic evidence relevant to proving the parties conflicting contractual interpretations and under city of hope national medical center genentech,cal th city of hope,a reasonable jury could interpret the assignment agreement either in the limited manner mcdonald proposed or the more expansive manner propounded by the husains 
mcdonald contends as an initial matter the trial court should not have considered extrinsic evidence at all because the assignment agreement language is perfectly clear on its face.but as mcdonald acknowledges,the test of whether parol evidence is admissible to construe an ambiguity is not whether the language appears to the court to be unambiguous,but whether the evidence offered is relevant to prove a meaning to which the language is reasonably susceptible where the meaning of the words used in a contract is disputed,the trial court must provisionally receive any proffered extrinsic evidence which is relevant to show whether the contract is reasonably susceptible of a particular meaning if in light of the extrinsic evidence the court decides the language is reasonably susceptible to the interpretation urged,the extrinsic evidence is then admitted to aid in the second step interpreting the contract.citation.citation.the trial court determination of whether an ambiguity exists is a question of law,subject to independent review on appeal.citation.the trial court resolution of an ambiguity is also a question of law if no parol evidence is admitted or if the parol evidence is not in conflict.however,where the parol evidence is in conflict,the trial court resolution of that conflict is a question of fact and must be upheld if supported by substantial evidence.wolf superior court th,fn.omitted.
the husains argue the following evidence supports their interpretation of the contract husain testified derrick pratt and general manager of mcdonald pacific sierra region who negotiated the conditions of the assignment agreement with husain and ultimately approved the sale specifically advised him any franchise husain acquired with less than a year remaining term would be renewed and pratt was approving him for new year terms.husain testified he would never have purchased the marin franchises and would not have paid million for them if he thought the franchises were not going to be rewritten.husain was not represented by an attorney in the negotiations with pratt because he trusted mcdonald.mcdonald drafted the assignment agreement and husain had no input into it.husain also produced evidence that when he was considering selling one of his restaurants in,pratt predecessor had sent him a letter stating it was mcdonald rewrite policy that if you the restaurant prior to the franchise expiration date,the purchaser will be given a new term franchise consistent with our real estate tenure.
john kujawa mcdonald of national franchising testified it was mcdonald policy starting in or to offer new franchise terms to existing operators who purchased restaurants from other operators with less than years remaining on the term,if certain conditions were met and the restaurant qualified.kujawa further testified the magruder husain transaction qualified under that policy moreover,kujawa acknowledged mcdonald signed off on the financial viability of the transaction before agreeing to the assignment.it may reasonably be inferred as the court did infer mcdonald knew or should have known the franchises needed an extended term to provide the husains with a return on their million investment.
thus,there is substantial evidence in the record that mcdonald had a general policy of providing new year terms to franchise purchasers to facilitate the sale of franchises,this policy was communicated to husain previously and he was aware of it in,mcdonald specifically assured husain in he would get a rewrite of the marin franchises with a remaining term of less than years,mcdonald and husain understood the husains investment was premised on new franchise terms for those restaurants,and mcdonald drafted the assignment agreement and was in the best position to make the scope of its obligations to the husains clear 
is paragraph of the assignment agreement reasonably susceptible to the interpretation that it promised the husains a rewrite of the five marin franchises with less than years remaining in their terms the paragraph states in relevant part in consideration of mcdonald consent to this assignment and the issuance of a rewrite to assignee,assignor waives,releases,and disclaims any claim for a rewrite of the franchise for the corte madera location.italics added.the term rewrite is not defined in the agreement.paragraph was part of an agreement entitled,assignment and consent to assignment of franchise to an individual purchaser,that expressly defined the singular words franchise and restaurant to refer collectively to all six franchise agreements and restaurants,respectively,that were covered by the agreement.thus,when paragraph promises the issuance of a rewrite to assignee,it is far from clear a rewrite refers solely to the issuance of a rewrite for the corte madera restaurant.if that was mcdonald intention,it would have been easy to make the intention clear by inserting the words of the corte madera franchise after rewrite in the operative sentence or by defining the term rewrite to limit it to corte madera.but,as drafted,we agree with the trial court the sentence is ambiguous as to whether a rewrite refers to a rewrite of the corte madera franchise or a rewrite of all of the franchises.unless the weight and credibility of the extrinsic evidence as evaluated by the fact finder supports its resolution in mcdonald favor,the ambiguity will support the husains position.city of hope,supra,cal th at.
mcdonald claims the assignment agreement is not ambiguous in the respect claimed because paragraph of the agreement disclaims any offer of a new franchise,and specifies no such franchise or offer could come into existence without a separate writing signed by mcdonald.paragraph states no future franchise or offer of franchises for additional mcdonald restaurants has been promised to assignee and no such franchise or franchise offer will come into existence,except by means of a separate writing however,mcdonald does not dispute that paragraph did expressly promise a new franchise for the corte madera restaurant.if paragraph is not inconsistent with that promise,there is no reason to suppose it would be inconsistent with a promise of rewrites for other locations.moreover,by its own terms,paragraph addresses future franchises for additional mcdonald restaurants.the language mcdonald relies on is arguably silent about any offer of franchises for the six existing restaurants addressed in the assignment agreement.we find no language in paragraph or elsewhere within the assignment agreement that settles the ambiguity in paragraph.
we also reject mcdonald contention that contract integration language found in paragraph the franchise and this assignment constitute the entire agreement between the parties and contain all of the terms,conditions,rights,and obligations of the parties with respect to the restaurant and the franchise precludes the consideration of any extrinsic evidence the presence of an integration clause does not preclude the consideration of extrinsic evidence to explain what the parties meant by the language they used in the written contract.software design application,price waterhouse th,aragon haas family security ins.services,d.the trial court correctly found extrinsic evidence is admissible for that purpose.
mcdonald also calls our attention to its own extrinsic evidence which,if credited by the fact finder,would tend to negate husain contract interpretation claim.thus,mcdonald witnesses explained that after mcdonald denies a franchisee a rewrite it normally wants to facilitate the sale of the franchise to a qualified operator and therefore offers a rewrite to prospective purchasers.it had denied the magruders rewrites for the corte madera and mill valley franchises and the sole intention of paragraph in the two assignment agreements was to provide rewrites to the husains for these two locations to facilitate the sale so mcdonald did not have to give up
