janice konkol and several other investors filed a lawsuit against diebold,diebold or the company,alleging that between and diebold engaged in a series of schemes to prematurely recognize revenue in order to inflate the price of its stock.holding that the investors complaint failed to sufficiently allege scienter,the district court dismissed the lawsuit for failure to state a claim.the investors appeal that holding,as well as the district court failure to explain its refusal to allow them to file a second amended complaint.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual background 
diebold,a ohio corporation,manufactures,distributes,and services electronic voting machines and automated teller machines atms.in addition to diebold,the complaint named nine individual defendants,all of whom were employed by diebold in senior management positions during the class period between october,and september,these individuals are hereinafter referred to as the defendants.all of the investors purchased diebold stock during the class period.they filed suit in april,alleging that the defendants manipulated diebold revenue during the class period through three primary schemes 
first,defendants purposely caused diebold to improperly recognize revenue for voting machines sold to california and ohio counties even though defendants knew that the machines were not in compliance with federal and state certification requirements and had not been fully delivered and accepted by the state and local governments 
second,defendants caused diebold service representatives to send out phony invoices at the end of each financial quarter to artificially inflate revenue in order to meet the company revenue and earnings targets 
third,defendants systematically bundled together the company software products with training,maintenance,services and rights to software updates,and then prematurely booked revenue for the portions of the sale that had not yet been earned.
according to the investors,the defendants purposely decided to ignore generally accepted accounting principles gaap and booked millions of dollars of revenue before it was actually earned,choosing to lie to investors and issue false earnings announcements and financial statements in violation of federal securities laws.
procedural history 
diebold and the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint,pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,in july.before the district court ruled on that motion,the investors filed a motion to amend their complaint for a second time.without explicitly addressing the investors motion to amend,the district court dismissed the complaint in its entirety in august.the investors have timely appealed both the dismissal of their lawsuit and the district court failure to explain its refusal to allow them to file a second amended complaint.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
the investors allege that diebold and the defendants violated section b of the securities and exchange act of the act and rule promulgated thereunder,which prohibit fraudulent,material misstatements or omissions in connection with the sale or purchase of a security.see morse mcwhorter,cir.they also allege that the defendants violated section a of the act,which imposes liability on e very person who,directly or indirectly,controls any person liable under the act and accompanying rules,unless the controlling person acted in good faith and did not directly or indirectly induce the illegal acts.see a.such a claim is contingent upon the investors ability to establish an underlying violation of section b and rule.pr diamonds,chandler,cir.
the investors lawsuit is thus a action,which falls under the requirement of rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure that claims of fraud be plead with particularity.see pr diamonds,at.moreover,the private securities litigation reform act of pslra imposes additional and more e xacting pleading requirements for pleading scienter in a securities fraud case.frank dana,cir alterations in original quoting tellabs,makor issues rights,d.plaintiffs must state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b.to qualify as strong,an inference of scienter must be more than merely plausible or must be cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference of nonfraudulent intent.tellabs,at.this at least as compelling standard replaced the old standard used by this court,which provided that plaintiffs are entitled only to the most plausible of competing inferences.see helwig vencor,cir emphasis added.
negligence alone on the part of a defendant can not support a finding of scienter.ernst ernst hochfelder,d.recklessness,however,is a sufficiently culpable state of mind for liability under section b and rule.mansbach prescott,ball turben,cir.this court has long defined recklessness as highly unreasonable conduct which is an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care.while the danger need not be known,it must at least be so obvious that any reasonable man would have known of it.id.at.
the investors allege that the defendants made fraudulent misstatements in diebold quarterly and annual press releases and conference calls from the third quarter of through the second quarter of.in these press releases and conference calls,the defendants touted the strength of diebold and its record earnings and sales figures.these statements were allegedly false because the figures were not the result of diebold legitimate business operations,but were instead the result of the defendants scheme to prematurely recognize revenue.
the investors also allege that the defendants made fraudulent misstatements in diebold quarterly and annual securities and exchange commission sec filings during the class period.each of these filings contained a certification that the reported earnings represented the actual financial condition of diebold,that diebold internal disclosure controls were effective,and that diebold policy and practice was to account for revenue according to the terms of the relevant contract and to recognize service revenue when it was actually earned.
we must therefore analyze the investors complaint to determine whether the facts alleged,taken as true,give rise to a strong inference that the defendants were at least reckless as to the falsity of these statements and whether that inference is at least as compelling as any inference of nonfraudulent intent.our analysis is de novo because the district court dismissed the investors complaint pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.see biegas quickway carriers,cir.
investors request for a remand 
as an initial matter,the investors argue that because the district court applied the most plausible pleading standard from helwig,we should remand the case and instruct the district court to apply the tellabs standard.see frank,at remanding a case back to the district court because it erroneously applied the helwig standard.although the earlier portion of the district court opinion in the present case does contain scattered references to the most plausible standard that was overruled in tellabs,the record reflects that the court ultimately applied the correct standard.the court,citing tellabs,specifically acknowledged that it must ask would a reasonable person deem the inference of scienter at least as strong as any opposing inference remand is therefore unnecessary.
alleged evidence of scienter 
the investors complaint pleads two sets of facts as evidence that the defendants either knew or were reckless as to the falsity of the earnings statements and sec certifications.first,the investors allege that scienter can be inferred from the fact that the defendants had access to and actually used detailed financial reports and accounting software,and that they attended weekly accounting meetings.second,the investors allege that scienter can be inferred from the suspicious timing of insider sales of diebold stock by the defendants.both sets of alleged facts are analyzed below.
defendants access to financial information 
f raudulent intent can not be inferred merely from the individual defendants positions in the company and alleged access to information.pr diamonds,at holding that the defendants access to financial reports and control over public earnings statements were insufficient to support a finding of scienter absent more particular facts.the investors complaint alleges access to information,but it lacks sufficiently detailed facts regarding the financial reports,how they were used,and their connection to the defendants.there are no allegations,for example,as to whether the reports were used to produce the earnings press releases and sec reports,whether they were ever compared to other reports that accurately reflected revenue,or whether the defendants were the ones who created the reports.
in the absence of greater particularity,we have no way of distinguishing the plaintiffs allegations from the countless fishing expeditions which the pslra was designed to deter.fischer vantive in re vantive.secs.litig,cir alterations,citation,and internal quotation marks omitted.generalized facts alleging that the defendants had access to diebold financial information,in short,do not support a strong inference that the defendants knew of or recklessly disregarded the falsity of diebold earnings statements and sec certifications.see pr diamonds,at citing in re peritus software.secs,d,holding that general allegations that a defendant,through his executive position,had access to internal corporate information and therefore had actual knowledge of misstatements or reckless disregard for the truth were insufficient to support a strong inference of scienter.the standard from tellabs requires specific facts that those reports were known to defendants and reflected the scheme in such a way that it would have been obvious that diebold was improperly inflating its revenue.see in re peritus software,d at rejecting an allegation of scienter because it did not achieve the level of specificity required by the pslra.
in their appellate brief,the investors suggest that they can not compile this more detailed information because they have not yet engaged in discovery and that the district court incorrectly held plaintiffs to the burden of alleging how these accounting reports specifically detailed the company revenue recognition schemes.the district court,however,was not asking for information that can be obtained only through discovery.for example,the exact amount of money reflected in the reports is not relevant at this stage.but what is relevant is the role of these reports in perpetuating the alleged accounting scheme and the role of these reports in the defendants process.moreover,because the investors had confidential witnesses who provided generalized statements about the reports,one would reasonably expect those witnesses to be able to provide more details about the reports and to be able to specifically connect them to the defendants.
the days sales outstanding dso reports are the one type of relevant report for which the investors provided some detail in their complaint.these reports allegedly reflected the false scheme because the accounts receivable would age and the dso would therefore increase.the only connection between these reports and the defendants,however,is that the defendants allegedly monitored the high dso.but this general allegation is not sufficient to support a strong inference of scienter.
other reports cited in the complaint are even less helpful to the investors in creating a strong inference of scienter.the complaint,for example,alleges that the defendants had access to scorecards in which sales and service employees were ranked based on the amount of revenue they brought in.but ranking employees based on the amount of revenue they produce is not relevant to whether the defendants knew that diebold was reporting false earnings unless these reports clearly reflected the scheme,which is not alleged in the complaint.
the investors also claim that,in addition to the financial reports,diebold used data software to track its sales and revenue.again,however,the complaint fails to provide key information about this software.it does not,for example,explain what the software reflected and what would have been obvious to a reasonable person upon examining the software.similarly,the complaint fails to connect this software to eight of the defendants.as for the ninth defendant,the complaint simply alleges that he used the software.
the investors raise similar allegations regarding the defendants attendance at weekly and monthly finance meetings to discuss the company financial performance and results.but attendance at such meetings,without more,does not support a finding of scienter given that the complaint does not allege that the scheme was discussed in the meetings.
moreover,the investors allegations regarding the defendants access to financial materials and software,and their attendance at meetings,are based solely on two confidential witnesses confidential witnesses and.when confidential sources are used to support vague and conclusory allegations,the allegations are not accorded much weight.ley visteon,cir citing higginbotham baxter int l,cir holding that allegations of confidential witnesses must be discounted and u sually that discount will be steep.statements,such as the allegation that the scorecards were of huge importance to the of the company,are the type of vague and conclusory allegations from confidential witnesses that are properly discounted.
even less weight should be given to the confidential witnesses allegations due to the lack of information about them.see higginbotham,at a nonymity conceals information that is essential to the sort of comparative evaluation required by tellabs.to determine whether a strong inference of scienter has been established,the judiciary must evaluate what the complaint reveals and disregard what it conceals.the complaint does not provide any details about most of the confidential witnesses,such as dates of employment,job description,employment location or sector,or which defendants interacted with them.given the general nature of the allegations and the absence of critical details,the fact that the defendants received financial reports,had access to financial software,and attended financial meetings is insufficient to support a strong inference that the defendants had knowledge of,or a reckless disregard for,the falsity of diebold earnings information.
insider sales of diebold stock 
the defendants highly lucrative and suspiciously timed insider sales are the second set of facts alleged in the complaint in order to establish scienter.five of the defendants sold nearly shares on february,two weeks after diebold reported earnings that pushed the stock near its high price.these five defendants did not make any other sales during the class period.
i nsider trading at a suspicious time or in an unusual amount is one of the nine factors usually relevant to scienter that this court first applied in helwig vencor,cir.the fact that five employees sold a significant amount of stock on the same day could be probative of the fact that they knew or at least suspected that diebold earnings reports were misleading.insider trading,however,is suspicious only when it is dramatically out of line with prior trading practices at times calculated to maximize the personal benefit from undisclosed inside information.zucco partners,llc digimarc,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.thus,f or individual defendants stock sales to raise an inference of scienter,plaintiffs must provide a meaningful trading history for purposes of comparison to the stock sales within the class period.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
the investors failed to provide such a history.a meaningful trading history requires information on period sales,the amount of stock retained by the defendants,or,as the defendants allege,whether the amount of stock owned by the defendants actually increased during the class period.absent key background information confirming their suspicious nature,the stock sales in february do not by themselves raise a strong inference of scienter.
investors arguments on appeal 
in their complaint,the investors primarily relied upon the two sets of facts discussed above to establish scienter.on appeal,the investors argue that the complaint alleges at least seven additional facts that support a strong inference of scienter.each allegation is addressed in turn below.
the nature and pervasiveness of defendants accounting violations 
the first additional fact relied on by the investors is that the alleged accounting violations were so basic,pervasive and calculated to mislead investors that they could not be missed unless the company executives were engaged in knowing or reckless conduct.but the failure to follow gaap is,by itself,insufficient to state a securities fraud claim.hoffman comshare,in re comshare.secs.litig,cir.despite this general rule,common sense and logic dictate that the greater the magnitude of a restatement or violation of gaap,the more likely it is that such a restatement or violation was made consciously or recklessly.pr diamonds,chandler,cir quoting in re microstrategy.secs,d.
one can not determine from the complaint whether the magnitude of diebold alleged accounting violations are the type of extreme in your face facts that cry out scienter.see id.at.the complaint does not specify the total amount of revenue that diebold allegedly overstated.nonetheless,diebold is a company and,as such,the amount of improperly recognized revenue would have to be significant in order to support a finding of scienter.no such significant figures are alleged.the investors do not contend,for example,that diebold reported profits when it should have been reporting losses over several different quarters.see in re telxon.secs,d,holding that the investors complaint adequately plead scienter,based in part on the magnitude of the accounting errors emphasis in original.
aside from the uncertainty regarding the amount of the purportedly overstated revenue,the alleged scheme is not the type of conduct from which scienter can be strongly inferred by the magnitude of the errors alone.the alleged scheme involved different product lines,and the revenue came from three very different sources uncertified sales,software bundling,and false service invoices.even if the amount of revenue prematurely recognized was significant,it would have been spread out among these different sources and therefore would not likely have served to put the defendants on notice of the misstated revenue.
the fact that the confidential witnesses were able to describe the fraudulent scheme in detail 
the second additional fact relied on by the investors to establish a strong inference of scienter is that several of the confidential were diebold insiders and knew about the inner working of the able to describe parts of the fraudulent accounting scheme in detail,and stated that the individual defendants had extensive knowledge about the true financial condition and accounting practices of the company.nowhere in the complaint,however,are any specific facts alleged that connect the defendants to the scheme.instead,the investors rely on general statements from the confidential witnesses,such as that the false invoicing scheme was perpetrated at a high level within the company,i t was very obvious what they were doing,and the false invoicing practice was openly known within the company.these generalized statements can not substitute for specific facts through which a factfinder can strongly infer that the defendants themselves knew of or recklessly disregarded the falsity of the earnings statements,especially because the majority of the confidential witnesses are not identified as having any contact or interaction with any of the defendants.see.employees benefits funds ceridian in re ceridian.secs.litig,cir holding that the plaintiffs failed to meet the pslra pleading standard,in part,because they did not allege specific facts giving rise to an inference that the defendants knew their statements were false.
the proximity in time between the false statements and the disclosure of the fraud 
the third additional fact relied on by the investors is the proximity in time between the allegedly false statements by the defendants and the later corrections.on august,diebold stated in an sec filing that its disclosure controls and procedures were effective.three days later,another sec filing stated that such controls and procedures were not effective.the investors argue that t he fact that these two statements were made a mere three days apart strongly suggests that defendants knew the first statement was false when it was made.
c loseness in time of an allegedly fraudulent statement and the later disclosure of inconsistent information is one of the nine helwig factors supporting a finding of scienter.helwig vencor,cir.the difference of only three days suggests that the defendants knew or had reason to know that their certification that the controls were effective was false when it was made.proximity alone,however,does not support a strong inference of scienter.fidel farley,cir holding that the plaintiffs had not adequately plead scienter despite the temporal proximity of statements because there is no indication from the class members allegations that the defendant knew or recklessly disregarded information it had before it at the time it issued its allegedly false statements.because the investors in the present case do not allege any specific facts establishing that the defendants knew or recklessly disregarded the falsity of their statements,the proximity of the inconsistent statements is not sufficient to support a strong inference of scienter.
the doj and sec criminal and civil investigations 
the fourth additional fact relied on by the investors is the existence of investigations by the department of justice doj and the sec into diebold operations.according to the investors,as a matter of common sense,the fact that two government agencies armed with access to the company internal accounting records have dedicated resources to investigating potential accounting fraud suggests that more is amiss than technical accounting violations or management negligence.
the existence of the doj investigation was first pled in the investors proposed second amended complaint and is therefore not relevant to whether the investors complaint of record gives rise to a strong inference of scienter.although a government investigation is not altogether irrelevant to the scienter analysis,a decision by government agencies to investigate a company is not sufficient to meet the heightened tellabs standard on its own,see in re ceridian,at holding that an allegation of an ongoing sec investigation w ithout more is not sufficient to establish scienter,or even in combination with the factor discussed above.government investigations can result from any number of causes,and the investors have not pointed to any facts suggesting that the sec investigation was the result of knowing or reckless behavior by the defendants.see pension fund hutchinson,in re hutchinson.secs.litig,cir w e consider the sec opening and closing an investigation irrelevant to the issue of the plaintiff complaint sufficiency.the mere existence of an sec investigation does not suggest that any of the allegedly false statements were actually false,nor does it add an inference of scienter.
the investors related argument is that the investigations should have served as red flags to notify the defendants of the accounting fraud.see,in re health.secs,finding that the sec investigation into the company accounts receivable served as a red flag that should have caused the company to investigate further.this argument is without merit,however,because neither government investigation was initiated until after the close of the class period in,so the investigations could not have alerted the defendants to the possible falsity of the statements during the class period.
defendants own class period statements 
the fifth additional fact relied on by the investors is that the defendants own statements during the class period show that they were intimately familiar with
