ii.background 
in,sala realized over million of income primarily from the exercise of stock options.before year end,sala invested approximately million in a foreign currency investment program known as the deerhurst program.the deerhurst program was managed by deerhurst management company,deerhurst management,which was principally owned and managed by andrew krieger,a foreign currency trader.sala admits he participated in the deerhurst program,in part,to generate a tax loss he believed would result in approximately million in tax savings.
the deerhurst program required investors to deposit in separate accounts as part of a brief test period during which investors could withdraw their funds at any time without incurring a penalty.once the test period ended,investors wishing to continue participating had to deposit additional funds totaling at least fifteen percent of the tax loss they expected to achieve through their participation in the deerhurst program.krieger would use these funds to acquire a combination of long and short foreign currency options for each investor.investors were to contribute these options to a partnership known as deerhurst investors,gp deerhurst gp.this transfer was necessary to obtain the desired tax benefits because,assuming the helmer rule controlled,only the value of long options would be used to calculate a partner basis in his partnership interest as a result,a partner could inflate the basis of his partnership interest such that,upon liquidation of the partnership,a tax loss could be generated while minimizing the potential for any actual economic loss to the partner.indeed,as part of a series of steps in the investment plan,deerhurst gp would be liquidated prior to year end so any tax loss could be claimed in the tax year.if deerhurst gp was profitable in,participants were required to reinvest all proceeds with deerhurst trading,llc deerhurst llc for a minimum of five years,or face a significant penalty.
on october,sala deposited an initial sum of into a personal account with refco capital markets,which was managed by krieger through deerhurst management.opting to participate beyond the test period,sala contributed another to his refco account on november.krieger used the funds in this account to acquire a combination of long and short foreign currency options on sala behalf,resulting in a net cost to sala of.the options had a total sales price of for the short options,if exercised,and a total purchase price of for the long options,if exercised.in other words,the long and short options essentially offset one another.
on november,sala transferred all of these options to solid along with approximately million in cash.in turn,solid transferred the options and cash to deerhurst gp in exchange for a partnership interest.applying the rule in helmer,solid calculated its adjusted basis in deerhurst gp by disregarding the short options.thus,only the value of the long options,approximately million,plus million in cash solid contributed to the partnership were used to calculate solid basis in its partnership interest.see.
during the existence of deerhurst gp,the long and short options were sold,resulting in a profit of between and.deerhurst gp was liquidated prior to december.solid share of the partnership assets upon liquidation consisted of million in cash and two foreign currency contracts.solid basis in these foreign currency contracts upon distribution was equal to the adjusted basis of solid interest in the partnership reduced by any money distributed in the same transaction.b.because solid calculated its adjusted basis in its partnership interest as approximately million and received million in cash upon liquidation,solid basis in the foreign currency contracts was calculated as approximately million.solid then sold the foreign currency contracts for less than million,resulting in a total calculated tax loss of.in reality,however,this loss was wholly artificial as solid suffered no actual economic harm but instead profited from participating in deerhurst gp.because deerhurst gp was profitable during its short existence,sala complied with the terms of the agreement and transferred his deerhurst gp proceeds to deerhurst llc.krieger managed these funds until.
when sala filed his personal federal income tax return for the tax year,he reported total losses of attributed to a loss from solid.this loss nearly offset sala entire income for he reported his adjusted gross income as.consequently,sala reported owing no federal income taxes.
in november,sala amended his return by filing a form in which he did not include the loss.he then paid approximately million in taxes,interest,and penalties.in september,however,sala filed a second form reclaiming the loss for the tax year and asserting his right to a refund of.when the internal revenue service disallowed the refund,sala filed the instant action.after an trial,the district court ruled in favor of sala.the government now appeals.
iii.discussion 
the government primary argument is that the transaction giving rise to sala claimed tax loss had no economic substance.when considering a district court economic substance determination,this court reviews findings of fact for clear error and any legal determinations de novo.see keeler comm r,cir.the ultimate determination of whether a transaction lacks economic substance is a question of law.james comm r,cir w e review de novo the ultimate characterization of the transactions as shams.see also frank lyon united states,the general characterization of a transaction for tax purposes is a question of law.but see nicole rose comm r,cir treating the ultimate determination of whether a transaction lacks economic substance as a question of fact.
before analyzing the question of economic substance,however,this court must first determine which transactions control the inquiry.the district court concluded the entire deerhurst program,from onward,should be reviewed as a single transaction.the deerhurst gp phase,however,can not be legitimized merely because it was on the periphery of some legitimate transactions.james,at.rather,a transaction must stand or fall on its own merit.see coltec,united states,t he transaction to be analyzed is the one that gave rise to the alleged tax benefit.see also black decker united states,cir indicating courts must focus on the specific transaction whose tax consequences are in dispute.
