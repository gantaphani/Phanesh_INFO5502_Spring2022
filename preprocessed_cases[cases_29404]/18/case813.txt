mayer hoffman mccann,mhm,a professional corporation organized in missouri,is a national certified public accounting cpa firm.mhm sued its former and barton,anthony krier,james stelzer,and john walter collectively,appellants,all cpas licensed by the state of enforce restrictive covenants contained in contractual agreements between the appellants and mhm.following a bench trial,the district granted judgment to mhm,awarding mhm permanent injunctive relief and in liquidated damages.appellants bring this appeal,contending that enforcement of the restrictive covenants is contrary to missouri law and even if the restrictive covenants are enforceable,the liquidated damages provision is void and unenforceable under missouri law.we reject these contentions and affirm the judgment of the district court.
from at least until august,appellants,along with cpa tim talbott,were employees and shareholders of bertram,vallez,kaplan talbot bertram vallez,a cpa firm located in new hope,minnesota.in august,bertram vallez entered into an administrative services agreement with a predecessor to cbiz,cbiz a public company that provides various financial services,including some accounting services employee services and technology solutions.pursuant to the agreement,bertram vallez and cbiz agreed to operate under the alternative practice structure model aps bertram vallez provided attest to clients,and cbiz performed nonattest for clients and provided bertram vallez with a variety of management advisory and services,including certain administrative,personnel,marketing,and other support services.appellants app.in exchange for cbiz provision of administrative services,bertram vallez agreed to pay of its revenues to cbiz.also in august,barton executed an executive employment agreement with cbiz.krier,stelzer,and walter entered into confidentiality and nonsolicitation agreements with cbiz confidentiality agreements on december,august,and january,respectively.
in,bertram vallez met with william hancock,the president of mhm.at that time,mhm and cbiz operated under an aps.the parties discussed bertram vallez joining mhm new hope office.in additional discussions with cbiz management,bertram vallez indicated that they did not want to move to mhm minneapolis location.there was no binding agreement reached,but talbot understood that mhm would maintain its new hope office for a period of at least three years.
on august,four agreements relevant to this appeal were executed the termination agreement between bertram vallez and mhm,the restated administrative services agreement between mhm and cbiz,the subscription and affiliation agreement between each appellant and mhm,and the stockholder agreement 
under the termination agreement,bertram vallez agreed to halt its accounting practice in exchange for mhm agreement to provide accounting services to the bertram vallez clients.mhm also agreed to include bertram vallez as a predecessor company on its professional liability insurance so that appellants and talbott continued to receive insurance coverage for acts that occurred during the time they worked for bertram vallez.
pursuant to the restated administrative services agreement,mhm and cbiz agreed to continue operating under the aps,with mhm providing attest services and cbiz performing nonattest services as well as administrative and other support services.in return for cbiz provision of administrative services,mhm agreed to pay of its attest revenues to cbiz.
under the subscription and affiliation agreement,each appellant purchased shares of mhm stock.per the agreement,each appellant recognize d that he may not resell the shares unless he compl ied with the terms of the stockholders agreement,and then,the shares may only be sold to mhm or to individuals who are not disqualified under applicable law to be stockholders of mhm.appellants app.
in the stockholder agreement,subject to certain conditions,mhm agreed to repurchase each appellant shares of mhm stock upon the termination of his employment with mhm.appellants agreed that for the restrictive period,a period of two years following the termination of their employment,they would not solicit,directly or indirectly,or attempt to solicit mhm clients or otherwise interfere with mhm relationship with its clients,or solicit mhm employees.appellants further agreed not to copy,disseminate,or use mhm confidential information at any time.the specific contractual provisions are as follows 
the shareholder agrees that during the period in which the shareholder is employed by mhm and during the restrictive period the shareholder shall not,without the prior written consent of mhm,either directly or indirectly,solicit,attempt to solicit,take away,attempt to take away,or otherwise interfere with mhm relationship with any customer including any customer in mhm data base 
nonsolicitation.
the shareholder agrees that he shall not at any time whether during or after the shareholder termination of employment with mhm,without the prior written consent of mhm,either directly or indirectly i solicit or attempt to solicit,induce or attempt to induce,cause or facilitate any employee,director,agent,consultant,independent contractor,representative or associate of mhm to terminate his,her,or its relationship with mhm,or ii solicit or attempt to solicit,induce or attempt to induce,cause or facilitate any supplier of services or products to mhm to terminate or change his,her,or its relationship with mhm,or otherwise interfere with any relationship between mhm and any of mhm suppliers of products or services.
nondisclosure.
the shareholder agrees that he shall not at any time whether during or after the period of his employment with mhm directly or indirectly copy,disseminate or use,for the shareholder personal benefit or the benefit of any third party,any confidential information,regardless of how such confidential information may have been acquired,except for the disclosure of such confidential information as may be i in keeping with the performance of the shareholder employment duties with mhm,ii as required by law,or iii as authorized in writing by mhm.
appellant add.the stockholder agreement also provides that it is identical to the stockholders agreements executed by mhm and all other mhm shareholders and that missouri law governs the rights and obligations of the parties.
from to,appellants were employees and shareholders of mhm.talbot served as both an employee and shareholder of mhm as well as cbiz managing director of the new hope office.appellants had access to a substantial amount of confidential mhm client information in the fall of,appellants learned that mhm planned to merge its new hope office into its minneapolis office on april,appellants formed glennco,llc which they later renamed barton,walter krier,llc bwk in anticipation of their departure from mhm.
in july,appellants prepared a letter addressed to our valued clients and friends,which was dated august,valued clients letter.see appellants appx.each appellant had valued clients letters for the clients they had worked with at mhm.the valued clients letter states that appellants have resigned from mhm and are forming a new firm.see id.the valued clients letter further states 
it is my hope that you will join me at our new firm.in order to make the transition at this time i am providing you with a termination letter to end your relationship with cbiz and an engagement letter to begin a new relationship with bwk.it is imperative that we receive these letters back as soon as possible.
id.the valued clients letter also requests that clients not contact cbiz to discuss this matter.id.
on friday,august,appellants left resignation letters on talbott desk which he found on monday,august.each letter stated that the appellant was resigning his employment with mhm effective at on august.the letter further provided that the appellant was tendering his mhm shares for purchase by mhm as provided for in the stockholder agreement appellants sent identical letters to hancock for delivery on august.
from august through august,appellants personally called on mhm clients and provided them with the valued clients letter,engagement letter,and the termination letter.the appellants also emailed or faxed the letters to other mhm clients,having obtained email addresses and fax numbers from mhm email contacts.in addition,appellants successfully recruited four mhm employees to go to work for bwk.
on august,mhm filed this lawsuit in the circuit court of jackson county,missouri,alleging that appellants breached the stockholder agreement by soliciting mhm customers count i soliciting mhm employees count ii and using and disclosing mhm confidential information count iii the state court granted mhm request for a temporary restraining order tro that same day,enjoining appellants from soliciting mhm customers and employees and using trade secrets or confidential information obtained from mhm.the state court also ordered appellants to return all of mhm trade secrets and confidential information following the entry of the tro,bwk computers and devices,as well as the bwk server,contained mhm confidential information in documents and emails in addition,mhm files were saved to the bwk server as late as september.
on august,appellants removed this action to federal court.after an evidentiary hearing on september,the district court entered a preliminary injunction,enjoining appellants from soliciting,directly or indirectly,or attempting to solicit mhm clients and employees seeking to perform any additional attest services for mhm clients and using trade secrets or confidential information obtained from mhm.the district court also ordered appellants to return mhm trade secrets and confidential information,retaining no copies for themselves.the court further ordered that defendants provide immediate access to bwk computers and servers and the home computers of defendants and their employees for inspection by a computer forensic expert,without delet ing or transfer ring any data from these computers until images have been made.order granting prelim.inj,
the parties filed for summary judgment however,the district court did not rule on the motions.following a bench trial,the court determined that the stockholder agreement was supported by sufficient consideration in the form of mutual promises mhm had a protectable interest in its customer relationships,even though some of its clients were formerly bertram vallez clients the restrictive covenants in the stockholder agreement are reasonable under missouri law and appellants knowingly and intentionally breached the restrictive covenants by soliciting mhm customers and employees and willfully taking mhm confidential information.
the court determined that mhm was entitled to liquidated damages because there was no evidence suggesting the parties intended the provision to be a penalty the undisputed evidence showed that the damages in this case were difficult to quantify and the provision was reasonable and binding under the circumstances of this case.the court stated that the agreements point to the method of calculation found in the relevant cbiz agreements to determine liquidated damages,and concluded that i t was clear from the circumstances that the stockholder agreement refers to mhm fees,not cbiz fees.mayer hoffman mccann barton,wl,at,unpublished.the court observed that mhm presented evidence that t he total owed to mhm for appellants breach of the stockholder agreement under the liquidated damages provision of the relevant contracts is,mhm total billings between august,and july,for clients solicited by the appellants.id.at because the appellants stipulated that they had each solicited all of the mhm clients and the prospective client included in mhm liquidated,the court awarded mhm in liquidated damages and found appellants jointly and severally liable for such damages.the court also granted mhm a permanent injunction,concluding that mhm had shown irreparable injury in that at least mhm clients had moved their business from mhm to bwk after defendants solicited their business and imposition of such an injunction was not against public policy.the district court denied appellants motion to alter and amend the findings and judgment.appellants bring this appeal.
as a threshold matter,we note that appellants largely concede the facts underlying the violations of the restrictive covenants in the stockholder agreement.rather,the thrust of their appeal is that both the restrictive covenants and the liquidated damages provision are unenforceable under missouri law.as an appellate court sitting in diversity,we review these questions of missouri law de novo.see praetorian ins.site inspection,llc,cir.
appellants assert that the restrictive covenants are unenforceable under missouri law because there was no consideration given by mhm in exchange for them they are not ancillary to the requisite type of agreement mhm does not have the required protectable interest they are not reasonable in scope and they aid mhm in its violation of antitrust law.we address each argument in turn.
appellants first argue that the restrictive covenants fail for lack of consideration.just as with every other kind of contract,a contract containing a restrictive covenant must be supported by consideration.see sumners serv.vending,consideration is a basic element of a valid contract.the burden of showing legally sufficient consideration rests on the party relying on the contract,here,mhm.allison agribank,fcb,per curiam as a general rule,consideration is a necessary element for establishing the existence of a valid contract.
consideration is something of value that moves from one party to the other.sumners,at.more specifically,consideration is 
a benefit to the party promising,or a loss or detriment to the party to whom the promise is made.benefit,as thus employed,means that the promisor has,in return for his promise,acquired some legal right to which he would not otherwise have been entitled,and detriment means that the promisee has,in return for the promise,forborne some legal right which he otherwise would have been entitled to exercise.
id.quotation omitted.a bilateral contract,like the stockholder agreement,in which there are mutual promises imposing some legal duty or liability on each promisor,is supported by sufficient consideration to form a valid,enforceable contract.id.
in superior gearbox edwards,the missouri court of appeals enforced a noncompetition covenant in a stock purchase agreement.id.at.in the stock purchase agreement at issue there,superior employee,edwards acknowledged that the milling machinery and procedures developed and used by superior were unique and were a valuable part of the company assets,and agreed that,if he should ever cease to be a superior employee,for years thereafter he would not engage in a business anywhere in the united states that manufactures or sells gearboxes or uses plunge milling procedures or technologies.id.at.per the agreement,edwards was to and did receive a five percent annual bonus as long as he remained with superior.id.eventually,edwards left superior and operated a company in violation of the noncompete clause.id.superior brought suit against edwards for breach of contract.id.at.the trial court granted superior injunctive relief,enforcing the terms of the noncompete clause.id.the missouri court of appeals affirmed but reduced the injunction to years.id.at.however,in enforcing the noncompete clause,the court did not specifically address whether the clause was supported by adequate consideration.see id.at.
however,in sturgis equipment falcon industries sales co,the missouri court of appeals refused to enforce a restrictive covenant contained in a agreement,concluding that it was not supported by adequate consideration.id.at there,edwin johnson,a salesman for sturgis,executed a stock agreement,in which he agreed not to compete with sturgis for two years following his termination.id.at.in addition,sturgis obtained a right of first refusal to purchase johnson stock and was bound to purchase any balance remaining unsold at the end of sixty days following johnson termination.id.at.eventually,johnson left sturgis,without tendering his stock,and formed his own company that competed with sturgis.id.at.sturgis brought suit for breach of contract,and the trial court found for sturgis and awarded him in damages.id.
however,the missouri court of appeals reversed,holding,in part,that there was inadequate consideration to support the noncompete clause.id.at.the court explained 
here,the agreement basically stated that in exchange for sturgis agreeing to sell stock to johnson and to buy back johnson stock if he desired to sell or if his employment terminated,johnson agreed to not compete with sturgis for two years if he voluntarily terminated his employment.the agreement did not state that the purpose of the clause was to protect any special interest of the company.no additional consideration was specified in the contract.the clause was not part of an employment contract johnson was an employee at will.the restriction contained in the agreement was greater than fairly required for sturgis protection and was not supported by sufficient consideration.
id.the sturgis court also distinguished superior gearbox,stating 
there,as part of that covenant,the superior shareholders acknowledged that the milling machinery and procedures developed by the company were unique and were a valuable part of the company assets.additionally,as part of the same agreement,the shareholders received a five percent annual bonus for remaining with superior.
sturgis,at.therefore,under superior gearbox and sturgis,missouri law does not provide that a stock purchase agreement containing a noncompete clause can never,as a matter of law,be supported by adequate consideration.thus,the question before us is whether the stockholder agreement at issue here is distinguishable from the stock agreement in sturgis.
in the stockholder agreement,appellants promised not to solicit mhm clients or employees for a period of time following the termination of their employment with mhm and not to,at any time,disclose or use mhm confidential information.mhm agreed that it would purchase the appellants mhm shares within days of the termination of their employment.the sturgis court held that the consideration of agreeing to buy back the employee stock,without more,was insufficient to support the broad clause at issue there id.however,the sturgis decision recognized the clause might have been enforced if the stock purchase agreement had provided sufficient consideration such as state ing that the purpose of the clause was to protect any special interest of the company,providing additional consideration,or being part of an employment contract.id.
as part of the stockholder agreement in this matter,appellants acknowledge d that the restrictions contained in sections through are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of mhm.appellant add.those legitimate interests were identified in the stockholder agreement and included confidential information or knowledge relating to mhm business plans,strategies,pricing,sales methods,customers,technology,programs,finances,costs,employees,employee compensation rates or policies,marketing plans,development plans,computer programs,computer systems,inventions,developments,trade secrets,know how or confidences.appellant add.because this stockholder agreement clearly provides that the restrictive covenants are necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the business and identifies those interests,sturgis does not bar enforcement of the restrictive covenants.see at.furthermore,the restrictions are not greater than fairly required for mhm protection,as was the case in sturgis.id.accordingly,we reject appellants argument that the restrictive covenants are unenforceable for lack of consideration.
next,appellants assert that missouri law restricts the kinds of contracts that can contain restrictive covenants and that the stockholder agreement does not fall within this class of contracts.the purpose of the restrictive covenant is to protect an employer from unfair competition.schmersahl,treloar mchugh.restrictive covenants that limit individuals in the exercise or pursuit of their occupations,standing alone,are contracts in restraint of trade that are unlawful in missouri.however,a covenant not to compete that forms part of a legitimate transaction is often described as an ancillary restraint.jtl consulting,shanahan,citations omitted.the missouri court of appeals discussed the types of agreements to which restrictive covenants may be ancillary in renal treatment,braxton.the court stated,promises imposing restraints that are ancillary to a valid transaction or relationship include the and relationships and partners against partnerships.id.at.the court also noted that this was not an exclusive list.id.emphasis added.the missouri court of appeals lengthened this nonexclusive list in jtl consulting,to include partnership agreements,independent contractor agreements,and shareholder agreements in close corporations.at.
here,mhm is a professional corporation under missouri law.professional corporations are governed by the law of general corporations,but additional statutory provisions specific to professional corporations must be read in conjunction with,and take precedence over,general corporation law.see.we find no missouri authority addressing whether a restrictive covenant can be ancillary to a shareholder agreement for a professional corporation.when there is no state supreme court case directly on point,our role is to predict how the state supreme court would rule if faced with the issues before us.northland cas.meeks,cir quotation omitted.missouri courts have expressly stated that the list of agreements,which they have recognized as giving rise to a legitimate interest sufficient to sustain a restrictive covenant,is not exclusive.see jtl consulting,at renal treatment centers,at.because jtl consulting provides that restrictive covenants can be ancillary to shareholder agreements in close corporations,see at,and professional corporations are a special species of a close corporation,william meade fletcher,fletcher cyclopedia of the law of private corporations,ed,we believe that the missouri supreme court would hold that a stockholder agreement between a professional corporation and a shareholder falls within the class of contracts wherein restrictive covenants are appropriate.thus,the appellants assertion that the restrictive covenants can not be ancillary to the stockholder agreement fails.
appellants also contend that the restrictive covenants are unenforceable for lack of a protectable interest.missouri law requires that a party seeking to enforce a noncompete agreement in an employment situation prove that it has a legitimate interest in doing so.see,passmore.missouri courts have identified two such protectable interests.these are customer contacts and trade secrets.id.customer contacts are essentially the influence an employee acquires over his employer customers through personal contact.mchugh,at quotation omitted see also schott beussink,missouri courts recognize that public policy approves employment contracts containing restrictive covenants because the employer has a proprietary right in its stock of customers and their goodwill.
mhm client contacts are clearly a protectable interest under missouri law.see,at.appellants do not dispute that they had substantial contact with,and influence over,their clients while employed by mhm.however,they argue that mhm did not have a protectable interest in its client contacts for two reasons.first,appellants assert that mhm never acquired any rights to these customer contacts as the contacts remained the property of appellants upon the dissolution of bertram vallez.second,appellants contend that mhm contacts with the clients appellants solicited can not be a protectable interest of mhm because such clients had been appellants clients at bertram vallez prior to appellants execution of the stockholder agreement.we reject both of appellants arguments.
first,although the articles of dissolution for bertram vallez provide that its remaining property was to be distributed among its shareholders,including appellants,the district court found that the only remaining property owned by bertram vallez was cash.this conclusion is supported by the language of the termination agreement,executed by bertram vallez and mhm,which states that bertram vallez wishes to terminate its practice of public accountancy and to make arrangements for the future servicing of its clients and mhm is willing to provide accounting services to the clients of bertram vallez as of august.appellants app.the agreement further provides 
orderly transfer of client work papers.bertram vallez hereby agrees to provide for the orderly transition of client work papers for clients listed on schedule a hereto.mhm agrees to provide accountancy services to the clients,to retain such client files for a period of at least seven years and to make such files available to bertram vallez and its current owners at its new hope office upon reasonable notice.
id.thus,pursuant to the termination agreement,mhm took control of bertram vallez client papers.accordingly,appellants did not retain the rights to bertram vallez contacts with the solicited clients.
second,despite the fact that appellants had a relationship with the mhm clients that they solicited prior to joining mhm,missouri law recognizes that an employer may protect customer relationships even if the employee had contact with some of the same customers before joining the employer.naegele biomedical.corp,emphasis added.in naegele,the plaintiff,mary anastasia naegele,was employed by matria health care matria for years where she provid ed monitoring services to obstetric physicians specializing in managing high risk pregnancies.id.at.she then worked as the national director of sales for biomedical systems corporation biomedical women health services division,and,in taking the position,she executed a confidentiality,nondisclosure,and noncompetition agreement.id.naegele eventually decided to return to matria.id.at.after informing biomedical of her decision,she filed a petition for declaratory judgment,and biomedical counterclaimed,seeking an injunction.id.following the trial court ruling for biomedical,naegele appealed,arguing that biomedical had no protectable interest in preexisting customers that she initially developed a relationship with when she worked at matria because they were not contributed as part of an equity investment in a business venture and biomedical did not assist in developing these contacts.id.at quotations omitted.
the missouri court of appeals rejected both arguments,explaining 
the fact that biomedical did not purchase the customer contacts at issue as part of an equity investment in a business venture is immaterial.as naegele employer,biomedical had the right to require naegele to develop strong relationships with any and all customers that she could.the evidence in the record showed that biomedical invested considerable money,time,and effort to allow naegele to develop,maintain,foster and preserve biomedical relationships with its customers,including the customers naegele originally met during her matria employment.biomedical had a legitimate business interest in restraining naegele from pursuing those customers with whom she developed or strengthened a relationship while working for biomedical,regardless of whether those customer contacts originated with naegele while she was working at matria.
id.at emphasis added.thus,naegele refutes the appellants argument that their preexisting relationship with mhm clients disqualifies mhm contacts with such client from constituting a protectable interest under missouri law.accordingly,mhm had the requisite protectable enforce the restrictive covenants at issue 
appellants next assert that the restrictive covenants are unreasonable in scope and,therefore,unenforceable.the purpose of restrictive covenants is to protect an employer from unfair competition by a former employee without imposing unreasonable restraint on the employee,at.because r estrictive covenants limit the exercise or pursuit of an individual occupation and are in restraint of trade,such covenants must be reasonable as to time and space in order to be valid and enforceable.id.the party claiming benefit of a noncompete clause within a contract has the burden of proving the reasonableness of the clause.id.
the time period for the restrictive covenants at issue here is two years.this amount of time has been found reasonable under the overwhelming weight of case authority in missouri.alltype fire prot.mayfield.although the restrictive covenants in this case are not restricted geographically,missouri law recognizes that a customer restriction may substitute for an explicit geographical restriction.see schott,at,concluding that a restriction on cpas soliciting their former employer customers,or doing any accounting work for them,was enforceable,without a geographical restriction,because the covenant does not prevent employees from practicing in any particular geographical area,it merely prohibits them from soliciting employer clients mills murray,determining that a restrictive covenant was reasonable,even absent a geographical restriction,because the former employee was only restricted from soliciting his former employer clients such that he could even conduct a competing business at his former employer doorstep as soon as he left his former employer service.as the schott court observed,where the specificity of limitation regarding the class of person with whom contact is prohibited increases,the need for limitation expressed in territorial terms decreases.at quoting seach richards,dieterle.under schott and mills,the restrictive covenant at issue here is not unenforceable,even though it lacks a geographical restriction,because it only prohibits appellants from soliciting mhm from performing services for mhm clients whom the appellants did not solicit.furthermore,even if the restrictive covenant completely barred the appellants from doing any accounting work for mhm clients,the appellants would still be free to provide accounting services to all clients anywhere.therefore,the scope of the restrictive covenants at issue here is reasonable under missouri law.
finally,appellants allege that the restrictive covenants should not be given effect because they purportedly aid mhm in its alleged violation of antitrust law,mhm and cbiz operation under the aps mhm equates this argument with the affirmative defense of illegal contract and asserts that the appellants have waived the argument by failing to raise it until they opposed mhm motion for summary judgment.see.c listing illegality as an affirmative defense that must be raised in response to a pleading coury prot,cir affirming the trial court determination that defendant had waived the affirmative defense of illegality of contract by failing to plead it.however,even if appellants have not waived their argument,it still fails for two reasons.first,appellants offer no authority demonstrating that the aps violates antitrust laws,and we find none.second,appellants argument is inconsistent with the purposes of antitrust law.competitive tactics alone do not constitute an antitrust violation int l welch food,cir.
the purpose of the sherman antitrust act is not to protect businesses from the working of the market it is to protect the public from the failure of the market.the law directs itself not against conduct which is competitive,even severely so,but against conduct which unfairly tends to destroy competition itself.it does so not out of solicitude for private concerns but out of concern for the public interest.spectrum sports,mcquillan.here,appellants do not invoke the protections of antitrust law in order to protect the public.rather,they do so in order to avoid their contractual obligations that,as the preceding analysis establishes,are enforceable under missouri law.accordingly,we find appellants injection of antitrust law into this contractual dispute inappropriate 
in sum,we reject each of appellants arguments and hold that the restrictive covenants contained in the stockholder agreement are enforceable.
appellants next contend that,even if this court concludes that the restrictive covenants are enforceable,the award of liquidated damages must be reversed because the liquida
