hector barretto,administrator of the small business administration sba,seeks interlocutory review of a district court order allowing the principals and employees of diamond ventures llc diamond ventures access to applications submitted to the sba in connection with the sba small business investment company sbic program.the district court granted access via a protective order issued pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure in diamond ventures lawsuit against the sba.for the following reasons,we grant the sba interlocutory appeal,reverse the district court order and remand for further proceedings.
under the sba sbic program,see et,a successful applicant is granted a license to operate as an sbic,a small venture capital resource for small businesses the sba guarantees the sbic securities in the event the sbic fails,allowing the sbic to better leverage capital investment.the heart of the application process involves an applicant completion of the management assessment questionnaire maq,which includes detailed descriptions of the applicant proposed operations,investment strategies,expertise and proposed sources of capitalization,including general categories of anticipated investment funds.maq,reprinted at joint appendix ja.the maq states that the information included therein will be kept confidential to the extent permitted by law.id.between december and october,diamond ventures applied for an sbic license from the sba four times and was denied a license each time.see,letter from jeffrey pierson,sba associate administrator for investment,to earl peek,managing partner,diamond ventures,ja.diamond ventures principal organizer,earl peek,then filed a complaint on its behalf against the sba,alleging diamond ventures applications had been denied on the basis of race in violation of the equal credit opportunity act,et 
pursuing discovery,diamond ventures sought production of all maqs submitted by other sbic applicants to the sba.the sba offered diamond ventures counsel access to all of the more than sbic applications it has on file but opposed disclosure of the applications to diamond ventures principals and employees on the grounds that each sbic applicant has an expectation of privacy regarding its own maq and that the sba policy is to treat the information contained therein as confidential.the parties could not agree on a protective order and eventually filed simultaneous motions for a protective order under federal rule of civil procedure c ja.the two motions were identical except that diamond ventures version sought to allow its officers and other personnel who have a need to use protected materials in order to prepare for and assist in the prosecution of this action access to the maq applications while the sba limited access to diamond ventures counsel compare diamond ventures proposed prot.order a ii,ja,with sba proposed prot.order a,ja.diamond ventures counsel argued that diamond ventures could not adequately press its discrimination claim without peek assistance because of peek expertise.diamond ventures counsel also stated that hiring an outside expert to review the maqs would be prohibitively expensive.pl.mot.re def.mot.for prot.order,ja.
on january,the district court by minute order denied the sba motion,ja denial order,and one week later granted diamond ventures motion,entering a protective order that allowed diamond ventures principals and employees access to the maqs.ja protective order.the sba filed a motion for reconsideration.on april,the district court denied the sba motion,stating that it was not persuaded that the information in the maqs is confidential,or,as defendant claims,that the applicants have an expectation of privacy in the information they submit,reconsideration order at,ja reconsideration order.the reconsideration order noted that diamond ventures argued persuasively that it would be cost prohibitive for it to hire independent experts merely to review the documents.instead,it must rely on its principals expertise to assist counsel in determining what competitive information is relevant and necessary to the claims.id.the sba appeals the three orders and in the alternative petitions for a writ of mandamus preventing release of the information.see appellant br.
jurisdiction 
in cohen beneficial industrial loan,the united states supreme court set forth the collateral order doctrine authorizing the interlocutory appeal of an order so long as the order conclusively determine s the disputed question,resolve s an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,and is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.will hallock,d quotations omitted.the doctrine is stringent ly applied so as not to overpower the substantial finality interests of id.
the first and third cohen factors are plainly met in this case.the protective order conclusively determines the sole issue in this dispute diamond ventures principals and employees access to the maqs.in addition,the order granting such access would be unreviewable at the litigation end because the harm the sba harm to the sbic applicants caused by diamond ventures principals review of the formers not be undone on appeal.see providence journal fbi,cir confidentiality lost once documents were surrendered pursuant to court order t he status quo could never be restored.the closer issue is the second cohen requirement,which itself consists of two prongs separability and importance.as to separability,diamond ventures management access to the maqs has nothing to do with the merits of its discrimination claim.diamond ventures argues that the importance factor is lacking because confidential information,unlike privileged material,is discoverable under the federal rules.appellee br.citing and distinguishing in re sealed case medical records,medical records discovery order compelling disclosure of privileged information was important in cohen sense because appellant claimed information was protected by psychotherapist privilege and interests promoted by protecting it from disclosure were weightier than the societal interests advanced by the ordinary operation of final judgment principles citation and quotation marks omitted.an important issue under cohen is determined not by the nature of the information being sought but by the interest that would be harmed if immediate review were not allowed weighed against the interest in finality.see united states philip morris,under cohen,issue is important if the interests that would potentially go unprotected without immediate appellate review of that issue are significant relative to the efficiency interests sought to be advanced by adherence to the final judgment rule citing digital equip.desktop direct,d id.at the importance prong requires weighing the institutionally significant status or relationship at stake.quotations omitted.in philip morris we held that a discovery order implicating the privilege was significant compared to the counterbalancing interest in finality because the privilege rests at the center of our adversary system.philip morris,at.in medical records,the significant interest under cohen second factor was that the documents sought to be discovered were covered by the psychotherapist privilege under federal rule of evidence and by the medical records privilege under the district of columbia municipal code.medical records,at.
using the philip morris test,we believe the privacy and competitive interests of the sbic applicants that would potentially go unprotected without immediate appellate review overcome the interest in finality.as the sba points out,the maq contains information of the type routinely protected under the trade secrets act,see appellant reply br.citing,and under exemption of section of the freedom of information act mcdonnell douglas dep t of air force,concluding disclosure of pricing information likely to cause substantial competitive harm and therefore exempt from disclosure.the sba submitted declarations from current and former sba officials stating that the sba has in the past successfully invoked foia exemption to protect maq information from disclosure.see decl.of margaret theresa dennin,chief administrative officer for sba investment division,ja sba has never disclosed confidential business information contained in maqs in response to a foia request decl.of michael wyatt,former sba general counsel,ja sba takes the position and advises applicants that their maq submissions fall within foia exemption.while we do not equate the maq with a trade secret we do believe that the notice on the face of the maq itself that the information submitted will be kept confidential to the extent permitted by law as well as the sba and sbic applicants institutional interests in confidentiality bring the maq within caselaw allowing interlocutory appeal.
an sbic applicant relies on the notice,along with other assurances given by the sba in deciding to submit the maq which discloses vital business strategies such as the categories of investors from whom it has solicited funds before applying,see maq at,ja,categories of anticipated sources of investment funds,id.at,ja,names and contact information of its equity partners,id.at,ja,and its investing strategy.its investing strategy,according to the maq,represents the ideal dollar distribution of an applicant investments among industry sectors and its overall investment and risk reduction philosophy.id.at,ja.the cost of delay,philip morris,at,would be the release of the to the sba with notice the information would be kept confidential to the extent permitted by a potential competitor.this cost outweighs the costs of piecemeal review,id.at,that underlie the finality rule because,once the information is disclosed,the sbic applicant confidentiality interest is permanently lost.as in philip morris,where we held that the release of information covered by the privilege would eviscerate the institutional interest in full and frank communication between client and attorney,id.at,releasing maq information whose confidentiality an applicant is notified will be protected would eviscerate the full and frank disclosure between the applicant and the sba necessary to the effective enforcement of the sbic program.if an applicant hesitates to disclose information regarding its business plan to the sba,the agency may then have to make a licensing decision without the benefit of full resulting in a loss to the public fisc given the fact that the sba guarantees an sbic securities in the event of default.see b authorizing sba to purchase,or to guarantee the timely payment of all principal and interest as scheduled on,debentures or participating securities issued by sbic.moreover,the sbic program could also be crippled by future applicants unwillingness to disclose information regarding their business plans upon learning of the disclosure of the maqs here.appellant br.see also akzo int l trade,cert.denied,d disclosure of sensitive materials to a business adversary would undoubtedly have a chilling effect on the parties willingness to provide the confidential information essential to the agency processes.we believe the confidentiality of an sbic applicant maq information is a sufficiently important interest to authorize our review under cohen.
b.the merits 
as noted,the district court has wide discretion in managing discovery.medical records,at rule vests the trial judge with broad discretion to tailor discovery narrowly,and it is appropriate for the court,in exercising its discretion,to undertake some substantive balancing of interests quoting britton,d alterations in medical records and laxalt mcclatchy,wright and miller,federal practice and procedure ed determining reasonable protective measures to minimize the effect on the party making the disclosure of confidential information within trial court discretion.we review the district court discovery ruling for abuse of discretion.medical records,at.with respect to a protective order issued pursuant to rule c,the district court is to undertake an individualized balancing of the many interests that may be present in a particular case.id.quotation omitted see in re sealed case,remanding discovery order because district court did not show engagement in this essential balancing process.
the sba argues that the district court made three mistakes of fact that led it to improperly weigh the competing interests.first,the district court stated it was not persuaded that the information in the maq was confidential or,as defendant claims,that the applicants have an expectation of privacy in the information they submit.reconsideration order at,ja.second,it was not convinced that disclosure of the maq information to competitive bidders could be harmful to applicants and chill the bidding process inasmuch as there is no competitive advantage because sbics do not compete with each other for funding.id.third,the district court found that diamond ventures lawyers had to rely on its principals expertise to assist them in determining what maq information was relevant to the discrimination claim because it would be too costly for diamond ventures to hire an outside expert 
we agree with the sba that the district court erred in finding that sbic applicants have no expectation of privacy in their notice on the face of the maq that the information included therein will be kept confidential to the extent permitted by law belies its finding.the district court ignored the notice and rejected without explanation the sba uncontested showing that maq applicants have an expectation of privacy in their applications and believe the sba will not disclose the information contained in them.see dennin decl,ja wyatt decl,ja moreover,the fact that sbic applicants may not directly compete with each other for sbic licensure does not mean that sbic licensees do not compete in the venture capital market for diamond ventures principals,and peek in particular,review other maqs,they will gain information about successful sbics strategies,investor categories and funding sources and be able to use the information either to apply once again for sbic licensure or to compete for funding in the venture capital market or both.in short,the district court erroneously discounted an sbic applicant confidential and competitive interests in its maq.
on the other side of the scale,the district court overvalued diamond ventures purported need for an expert to review the maqs in order to support its discrimination claim the information relevant to its,the race of the principals of other sbic applicants as well as the business strategies of other sbic applicants for comparison to its be collected,we are confident,by counsel without an expert assistance.diamond ventures argument that hiring an outside expert to review the documents would be too factor on which the district court expressly relied,see reconsideration order at,ja plaintiff argues,persuasively,that it would be cost prohibitive for it to hire independent experts merely to review the documents.instead,it must rely on its principals expertise to assist counsel in determining what comparative information is relevant and necessary to the claims.and the court finds that plaintiff interests in prosecuting this case and having adequate legal representation outweigh defendant competing interests arising from unfounded fears of public disclosure and competitive harm.is irrelevant to the balancing.that peek originally filed his action pro se and was accorded in forma pauperis status by the district court has no bearing on diamond ventures financial health because a corporation can not file a pro se action or appear in forma pauperis.see rowland men colony,d it has been the law for the better part of two centuries that a corporation may appear in the federal courts only through licensed counsel.diamond ventures alleged inability to hire an expert should not be balanced against the legitimate confidentiality interests of all other maq applicants and the district court erred as a matter of law in doing so.see koon united states,d because a district court by definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law,t he abuse of discretion standard includes review to determine that the discretion was not guided by erroneous legal conclusions medical records,at quoting koon
