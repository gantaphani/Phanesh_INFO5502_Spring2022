appellant,the commodity futures trading commission cftc,appeals from the district court trial order granting judgment in favor of appellee,forex capital markets fxcm,on the cftc claim that fxcm should be held vicariously liable under for gibraltar monetary corporation,gmc violations of the commodities exchange act cea and cftc regulations,a and c the district court found that the vicarious liability provision in the cea,a b,on which the cftc relied did not apply to the transactions involved in this matter the identically worded vicarious liability regulation,could be applied to the transactions in this matter the standard for vicarious liability under either the vicarious liability regulation or the cea is the common law test for agency and fxcm could not be held vicariously liable as gmc principal under this test.
on appeal,the cftc argues that both the vicarious liability statute and the vicarious liability regulation apply to this matter the test for vicarious liability under either of these provisions is a totality of the circumstances standard and under either a totality of the circumstances or a common law agency standard the district court committed clear error in finding that gmc was not acting as fxcm agent.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the district court judgment in favor of fxcm and hold that under a b and,the test for vicarious liability is common law agency,and the district court did not commit clear error in finding under this test that gmc was not acting as fxcm agent when it violated the cea.
background 
appellant cftc is an independent federal regulatory agency that administers and enforces the cea and the regulations promulgated under it.defendant gmc was a florida corporation which solicited members of the public to invest and trade in foreign currency options and advised these members on trading.gmc was not and was not required to be registered with the cftc.defendants jayson kline,charles fremer,edward johnson,and thomas clancy were officers and employees of gmc.prior to the incorporation of gmc,kline,fremer,and johnson were involved with other companies charged with fraud by the cftc.at the time relevant to this action,kline was under an enforcement order and cease and desist order from the cftc.fxcm is the world largest futures commission merchant or fcm dealing exclusively in retail foreign exchange,or forex.fxcm is registered as an fcm with the cftc and the nfa.fxcm trades spot forex and forex options in trades.
on april,fxcm and gmc signed an introducing agreement the agreement and entered into a business relationship.under the terms of the agreement,gmc agreed to solicit customers to engage in forex options transactions and to refer them exclusively to fxcm to trade.every time a gmc customer made a trade with fxcm,fxcm would put a commission in an account for gmc.fxcm claims that it did not investigate gmc before entering into this relationship and that it was unaware that its officers and employees had previously been charged with fraud.under the terms of the agreement,fxcm did not a control gibraltar location b control or supervise the hiring of gibraltar employees c train,supervise,or discipline gibraltar employees d control,develop,or supervise the trading strategies of gibraltar e control,develop,or supervise gibraltar marketing practices f share common employees with gibraltar or g split commissions with gibraltar.at.
gmc solicited customers based upon fxcm customer qualification standards.gmc sent each customer a package of forms necessary to open a trading account with fxcm.this package included a risk disclosure statement,a notice to traders a trader agreement an fx agreement,an account application form,and a limited power of attorney form the customers mailed their money to fxcm and their completed forms to gmc,which checked over them to ensure the customer had filled them out correctly,and then forwarded them on to fxcm.after the customers were signed up,gmc advised them on trades and the customers had access to online research through fxcm.gmc had clients only thirteen profited from their investment with fxcm most others lost their entire investment.
on february,the cftc filed an enforcement action against fxcm and named gmc,kline,fremer,chancy,and johnson as defendants.the cftc charged that gmc fraudulently solicited customers to trade options with fxcm and in doing so violated the cea,et,and the regulations promulgated under it,et.the complaint charged gmc with derivative liability for its employees fraud under a theory of respondeat superior and fxcm with derivative liability for this same fraud under an agency theory.the court ultimately entered default judgment against gmc.clancy,as gmc compliance officer,executed a consent order and agreed to testify for the cftc.the instant appeal arises out of the trial of the remaining three individual defendants and fxcm that occurred between august and september of.
the evidence at trial consisted primarily of the testimony of seven gmc customers,one state securities compliance officer,one cftc investigator,two representatives from fxcm,two expert witnesses,clancy,and remaining individual defendants jayson kline,charles fremer,and edward johnson.
the seven gmc customers testified at trial about what they were told by gmc about forex investment.their testimony revealed that gmc the risk of forex investment and embellished the potential for gains and the gains that their existing customers were experiencing.gmc agents persuaded customers to buy foreign exchange options for reasons associated with current events such as september,and the iraq war.gmc employees did not explain to customers that there was a chance that their options would expire worthless current events were already factored into the price of forex options nearly all gibraltar investors were losing money on their investments several employees at gmc had worked for investment firms that were sanctioned for sales fraud and a permanent injunction and cease and desist order had been entered against kline to enjoin him for committing commodities fraud.
the customers testimony also revealed that gmc agents coached customers on what to say to gmc compliance officer when questioned about their understanding of the risk associated with forex trading some of gmc customers believed that gmc and fxcm were working together some customers thought their investment would be safer because fxcm was licensed and regulated some customers contacted fxcm directly for information on accessing online trading accounts and tax advice on loss and some customers complained directly to fxcm about gmc management of their accounts.one customer testified that he asked fxcm whether he could trade directly with fxcm using the account that was created when gmc acted as his agent fxcm informed him that he would have to open a new account.in,the utah department of commerce investigated gmc,and an investigator posed as an interested client.at trial,the investigator testified that a gmc agent made comments to her similar to those testified to by the real gmc customers.
when former compliance officer clancy testified at trial,his testimony revealed that gmc referenced fxcm registered and regulated status to make customers more relaxed about placing trades through gmc and that if gmc customers complained to fxcm,then fxcm directed the complaints back to gmc.one particular message from fxcm to clancy following a complaint by a gmc customer,on which the court relied,stated 
a s you recall,we have already discussed the need for you guys to monitor your marketing advertising methods,and i feel that i must this.as these complaints reflect on the way we do business.i must now ask you to give me a written description of the kind of advertising marketing methods you are using,include a copy of any material you may use.
at.clancy explained the normal procedure for placing a trade he would call the fxcm order desk and give fxcm the client number,quantity of purchase,and month of expiration the fxcm employee responded with a strike price and he generally accepted the price offered without making a counteroffer.he explained that gmc selected the expiration date of the option,while the customers selected the quantity of options to purchase.
on the basis of the above facts and testimony,the district court found that defendant johnson violated b and a c defendants kline and fremer violated b and cftc regulation and defendant kline violated the court ordered defendants kline,fremer,and johnson to pay more than in restitution to of gmc customers.the court also entered civil penalties against these individuals and granted injunctive relief.
the court declined to hold fxcm vicariously liable for the actions of gmc and its employees.the court found that the vicarious liability provision of the cea did not apply to the relationship between fxcm and gmc,but that the identically worded vicarious liability regulation promulgated by the cftc did apply.the district court discussed the standard for vicarious liability using the language of both common law agency and the totality of the circumstances.the court ultimately relied,however,on a test it drew from webster aiello,cftc lexis at cftc,
to demonstrate the existence of implied actual authority,a party must provide evidence that the purported agent and purported principal acquiesced to the relationship,the purported principal gave sufficient support to the purported agent,and the purported principal exercised control over the purported agent.
at emphasis added.
the district court found that the parties had not acquiesced to a relationship because the record contained no evidence that fxcm authorized or condoned the use of its name by gmc or that gmc indicated to potential clients that it was fxcm agent.the court concluded that fxcm did not provide gmc with sufficient support because there was no evidence in the record that fxcm provided gmc with market and research reports,manuals to be used in business operations,or customer leads.finally analyzing control,the court found that fxcm exercised far less control over gmc than in other cases where the purported agent was determined to have been acting autonomously.the court found it particularly relevant that gmc and fxcm were incorporated independently,maintained separate ownership,had no common employees,and did not coordinate their sales efforts.the cftc appealed.
ii.discussion 
we must determine whether the district court correctly articulated the test for vicarious liability under the vicarious liability statute and vicarious liability regulation at issue and whether the district court clearly erred in applying that standard to find that gmc was not acting as fxcm agent when it violated the cea.
on appeal,the cftc argues that the district court erred when it required that the cftc demonstrate that fxcm controlled gmc in order to establish vicarious liability the cftc insists that while control is a relevant factor it is not dispositive,and the cftc has traditionally considered a much broader range of evidence in cea cases and has applied a totality of the circumstances test.the cftc maintains that had the court applied this totality of the circumstances test,it would have found fxcm vicariously liable.in the alternative,the cftc contends that the district court erred in finding that fxcm did not control gmc.
the district court determination of the correct standard for vicarious liability under the relevant vicarious liability provisions is a matter of law which we review de novo.united states trainor,cir.the district court determination regarding the scope of vicarious liability and the relationship is a question of fact.wood holiday inns,cir the existence and scope of relationship is generally for the jury to determine.we review a district court findings of fact for clear error.archer,cir naviera neptuno all intern.freight forwarders,cir.this standard is very deferential and we will not reverse the district court unless we find that after making all credibility choices in favor of the and reviewing the record as a whole,it is clear that a mistake has been made.hale container line,houston sea packing,cir.under clear error review,the district court determination must be affirmed so long as it is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety.merrill stevens dry dock yeocomico ii,cir quotation marks omitted.in other words,where there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.jemison nagle,cir.
district court correctly applied common law rules of agency 
we have discussed vicarious liability under the cea on a number of occasions however,this is the first time we have been called on to determine whether it requires an element of control see cftc sidoti,cir holding brokerage house guilty for fraud of its agents,salespeople or registered associated persons under regulation and section a jcc,cftc,cir same clayton brokerage commodity futures trading commission,cir addressing employee and employer situation and quoting.part i,sess,reprinted in cong.ad.news,finding that cea provides respondeat superior and general standards for imposing liability on employers and principals for the acts of their employees or agents.
numerous other courts of appeal have considered the standard for vicarious liability under the cea.a majority of these decisions,like the district court opinion here,use language which conflates the totality of the circumstances test and the control test for common law agency.a survey of this appellate case law reveals no clear precedent as to whether the vicarious liability statute and regulation are broader than the common law as the cftc suggests.one group of cases uses a mixture of totality of the circumstances,respondeat superior,and common law agency language without explicitly addressing control one group of cases addresses factually similar,but legally distinguishable circumstances,and finds control necessary and a final case addresses factually similar but legally distinguishable circumstances and finds control unnecessary district courts,as expected,are split on this issue as well 
given the unclear nature of the federal case law,the parties encourage us to look at cftc administrative case law to establish whether control is required to prove agency by implied actual authority.the bulk of the cftc case law suggests that while control is relevant,it is not dispositive and courts should assess agency based on a totality of the circumstances while we find these cases,many of which are initial opinions issued by administrative law judges rather than final decisions issued by the cftc board itself,to be helpful,we find the history of vicarious liability in the commodities context to be more so.
congress first used the current language of the cea vicarious liability provision and cftc vicarious liability regulation on september,when it enacted the grain futures act gfa,stat.in section a of the gfa under a heading entitled,p rincipals responsible for acts of agents,congress included the language of the current provisions 
the act,omission,or failure of any official,agent,or other person acting for any individual association,partnership,corporation,or trust within the scope of his employment or office shall be deemed the act,omission,or failure of such individual,association,partnership,corporation,or trust,as well as of such official,agent,or other person.
congress retained the language fourteen years later when it passed the cea in order to expand its jurisdiction over commodities trading and introduce additional mechanisms to prevent fraud and manipulation,stat.june.congress reaffirmed the language again in when it passed the commodities futures trading act cfta,stat,establishing the cftc and expanding the cea to commodities.dunn cftc,d.when congress passed the cfta it gave no indication that the cftc should change the standard for vicarious liability in any way or that there was a gap in which the agency needed to regulate.therefore,on january,when the cftc promulgated regulation containing the exact vicarious liability language of the original gfa and cea,the cftc adopted the meaning given to this language in those earlier statutes.this history indicates that congress conceived of this languag
