this case concerns a lease the lease and a purported joint venture agreement the joint venture agreement entered into between a son and his father,the former president and majority shareholder of a real estate development corporation.the lease grants the son,nam tran nam,control over a property for a period of years in exchange for a payment of.the joint venture agreement covers nam development of this property.after the father death,the corporation,alphonse hotel corporation ahc,under the control of a temporary administrator,sought damages for nam use and occupancy of the property and a judgment declaring that the lease and joint venture agreement were void.nam counterclaimed,seeking a declaratory judgment that those agreements were valid and seeking damages for ahc breaches of both agreements.the district court granted ahc motion for partial summary judgment on its declaratory judgment claims and denied nam requests for additional discovery.on appeal,we consider whether nam requests for additional discovery in his rule d motion identified specific materials in ahc possession that were sufficiently germane to the case and not cumulative such that the district court abused its discretion in denying that motion for production whether under new york law the lease,which was executed by nam father in his former capacity as president of ahc,is void as a gift or corporate waste and if the lease is void,whether under pennsylvania law the integration clause contained in the lease survives such that a separate oral agreement to enter a joint venture is voided by that clause.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court rulings denying nam discovery request and granting summary judgment to ahc.
background 
ahc is a new york closely held corporation that owns and manages real estate,including,among other properties,the former franklin chocolate factory in philadelphia,pa the property,which is the subject of this case.nam,a pennsylvania citizen,is the eldest son of ahc former president,truong dinh tran truong.upon his death in,truong owned of ahc shares,and the four mothers of his children,sang kay nguyen,hung nguyen hung,cham nguyen cham,and hoa pham,each owned.truong served as ahc president and sole director until september,when he suffered a stroke,at which point he added two seats to the board of directors and appointed two of the mothers,hung and cham,to fill those seats.truong resigned as president in september or october,and hung was elected president.
truong died intestate in may control of ahc and truong estate was contested.shareholders of ahc along with claimants to truong estate commenced litigation.the new york state courts overseeing these actions appointed a temporary administrator of the estate,who took control of truong share of ahc and,in april,assumed the roles of president and sole director.
nam alleges that sometime around he entered into the joint venture agreement with truong,who was acting on behalf of ahc,to develop the then dilapidated property into a development.nam submitted no documentary evidence of this agreement,only his own declaration testifying to its existence and a declaration of his wife testifying to actions,purportedly taken in the name of the joint venture,toward securing design and regulatory approvals for redevelopment of the property.according to nam,under the joint venture ahc would provide the capital for redevelopment and pay to maintain the property,and in exchange nam and his family would provide the sweat equity to design and manage the redeveloped property.as nam explains in his declaration,ahc facilitated this joint venture agreement by leasing the property to nam for years,with rights to sublet the property.during the leasehold period,nam would benefit through receipt of rents and other fees from operation of the redeveloped property,while ahc would benefit by receiving,at the end of years,a property.
as for the lease,ahc has no corporate records of it ever being approved,and no copies could be found among the corporation files.the lease that has been admitted into evidence is the one that nam produced when ahc director asked him about the property after discovering a record indicating that nam was the lessee.according to its terms,the lease is between ahc,as lessor,and nam,as lessee.although the parties dispute the effective dates of the lease and truong resignation,and,depending on that timing,whether truong actually had the authority to execute the lease on behalf of ahc,the parties agreed for purposes of the summary judgment motion to assume that the signatures were effective 
the lease provides that nam will pay ahc a total of in rent for the entire term of years.the lease states that ahc will not sell the property during the years term of this lease.at.the lease does not mention the joint venture agreement,but contains several provisions relevant to its existence.
first,the lease contains an integration clause 
the lessor and lessee hereby agree that this lease sets forth all the promises,agreements,conditions and understandings between the lessor and the lessee relative to the demised premises,and that there are no promises,agreements,conditions or understandings,either oral or written,between them other than as herein set forth,and any subsequent alteration,amendment,change or addition to this lease shall not be binding upon the lessor or lessee unless reduced to writing and signed by them.
second,the lease provides that ahc has no obligation to make alterations to the property 
the lessor has let the demised premises in their present condition and without any representation on the part of the lessor,his officers,employees,servants agents.it is understood and agreed that the lessor is under no duty to make alterations at the time of letting or at any time thereafter.
the lease also prohibits nam from leasing the property,or making any improvements,without the written consent of ahc 
l essee covenants and agrees that he will do none of the following things without the consent in writing of lessor b the demised premises,or any part thereof,or permit another person to occupy the demised premises,or any part thereof d make any alternations,improvements,or additions to the demised premises 
on october,ahc,through its director,filed an action in the new york supreme court seeking both a declaratory judgment that the lease was invalid and money damages for nam use and occupancy of the leased property.in november,nam removed the action to federal court pursuant to ahc filed an amended complaint,seeking an additional declaration that the alleged oral joint venture agreement was invalid.nam answered,pleading eight counterclaims which collectively seek a declaration that both the lease and the joint venture agreement are enforceable and seek money damages for ahc breaches of both agreements.ahc moved for partial summary judgment,arguing that the joint venture agreement and lease are void as a matter of law.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of ahc.this appeal followed.
discussion 
nam motion for additional discovery 
in response to ahc motion for partial summary judgment,nam contended that he had been denied discovery necessary to oppose that motion and submitted an affidavit pursuant to fed.civ.d describing the discovery materials he wanted produced.the district court denied his request.nam renews this argument on appeal.we review the district court denial of nam rule d motion for abuse of discretion.see miller wolpoff abramson,cir.
a party seeking to delay resolution of a summary judgment motion on grounds that he has been deprived of certain discovery materials must show that the material sought is germane to the defense,and that it is neither cumulative nor speculative,and a bare assertion that the evidence supporting a plaintiff allegation is in the hands of the defendant is insufficient.paddington partners bouchard,cir.quotation omitted.
the district court correctly concluded that none of the items specifically requested in nam rule d affidavit is germane to the issues before the court.for instance,nam requested documents regarding the investigation of the temporary administrator appointed to run ahc,drawings of the property,and different types of documents that go towards valuing the property and its condition.at.based on those descriptions alone,these documents do not contain information that would change the outcome of the summary judgment motion seeking a declaration that the lease and joint venture agreement are void.moreover,nam described the requested material that could potentially be germane in such general terms that he failed to explain with any specificity how the facts sought are reasonably expected to create a genuine issue of material fact.paddington partners,at.for example,nam requested communications between the parties,or with the parties and other,concerning the property,the joint venture agreement and the lease.at.he failed,however,to explain his basis for believing that these documents exist.such bare,generalized assertions can not justify delaying the resolution of a summary judgment motion.the district court did not abuse its discretion in so ruling.
ii.choice of law 
in their summary judgment briefing in the district court,the parties disagreed as to which state law should apply,but on appeal,they do not contest the district court decision in that regard.indeed,following the district court lead,both parties on appeal argue that pennsylvania law is applicable to the parol evidence issue and new york law to the corporate waste issue.in a diversity case such as this one,the rules of new york,the forum state,govern.see krauss manhattan life ins,cir.under new york rules,where the parties agree that a certain jurisdiction law controls,this is sufficient to establish choice of law.fed.ins.am.home assur,cir.see also krumme westpoint stevens,cir.the parties briefs assume that new york law controls,and such implied consent is sufficient to establish choice of law.quoting civil envt l eng rs,cir.we therefore apply pennsylvania law to our analysis of the dispute and new york law to the lease dispute.
iii.the validity of the lease 
nam next argues that the district court erred in finding the lease was void as a gift or as an act of corporate waste because ahc decision to enter the lease was protected by the business judgment rule and,in any event,the lease was supported by valid consideration.the essence of a claim of gift is lack of consideration and the essence of waste is the diversion of corporate assets for improper or unnecessary purposes.aronoff albanese.in new york,it is settled law that waste or a gift of corporate assets are void acts and can not be ratified by a majority of stockholders.id.
while the actions of corporate directors are ordinarily protected by the business judgment rule,and thus subject to judicial review only upon a showing of fraud or bad faith,stern,cir.applying new york law,where a corporate director has an interest in a decision,the business judgment rule does not apply,in re croton river club,cir.applying new york law see also auerbach bennett.a director is considered in a transaction where she will receive a direct financial benefit from the transaction which is different from the benefit to shareholders generally.marx akers,see also santiesteban crowder.once a prima facie showing is made that directors have a in a particular corporate transaction,the burden shifts to them to demonstrate that the transaction is fair and serves the best interests of the corporation and its shareholders.norlin rooney,pace,cir.applying new york law.if the director s fail to carry this burden,the transaction will be deemed void.see aronoff,at.these principles apply to,as well as to,corporations.see global minerals metals holme,see also lewis,cir.
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment,construing all evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.rentas ruffin,cir.
the district court in this case correctly concluded that the business judgment rule should not apply to the lease.it is undisputed that truong was the father of the lessee,that the property was a corporate asset leased by truong in his capacity as president and majority shareholder of ahc,and that the terms of the lease required only nominal consideration for control over this asset.as nam acknowledges,truong ran ahc for the benefit of his family and frequently used corporate assets to help out his family members.appellant br.at.nam concedes that the lease is similar to other transactions that truong executed as president and majority shareholder of ahc by which truong intended to create financial security for his family and to provide for his children.appellant br.at.truong corporate decision thus lacked a legitimate business purpose or w as tainted by a conflict of interest.amfesco,greenblatt.as a result,nam may not invoke the business judgment rule protection,and he now bears the burden of showing that the lease was objectively fair and serve d the best interests of the corporation and its shareholders,norlin,at.
nam claims that the sweat equity provided by him and his family to develop the property under the joint venture agreement constituted consideration for the lease and demonstrates the objective fairness of the transaction.the evidence indicates,however,that the majority of this sweat equity was contributed prior to the execution of the lease.these past contributions could not have counted as present consideration given in exchange for a leasehold interest unless the lease explicitly expressed that intention.see oblig.law a promise shall not be denied effect as a valid contractual obligation on the ground that consideration for the promise is past or executed,if the consideration is expressed in the writing and is proved to have been given or performed and would be a valid consideration but for the time when it was given or performed.see also united res.recovery ramko venture,supp,citing umscheid simnacher.the lease does not mention anything about nam development of the property.in fact,the lease terms largely prevent nam from taking steps to develop the property.nam argument regarding what constituted consideration raises no genuine issue of material fact.no disinterested person could find that leasing a valuable real estate property for twenty years in exchange for twenty dollars was a fair or reasonable business decision.see meredith camp hill estates,holding that transfer without consideration of valuable corporate property was so far opposed to the true interests of the corporation as to lead to the clear inference that no one thus acting could have been influenced by any honest desire to secure such interests.quotation omitted.we thus affirm the district court conclusion that the lease was void as a gift or act of corporate waste.
iv.the validity of the joint venture agreement 
we now address the purported joint venture agreement.the district court found the alleged agreement to be unenforceable on grounds that,by operation of the parol evidence rule,the fully integrated lease discharged any oral agreement relative to the property.
the pennsylvania supreme court has explained that 
the parol evidence rule forbids the introduction of parol evidence of antecedent or contemporaneous agreements,negotiations and understandings of the contracting parties for the purpose of varying or contradicting the terms of a contract which both parties intended to represent the definite and complete statement of their agreement.

where the parties,without any fraud or mistake,have deliberately put their engagements in writing,the law declares the writing to be not only the best,but the only,evidence of their agreement.all preliminary negotiations,conversations and verbal agreements are merged in and superseded by the subsequent written contract and unless fraud,accident or mistake be averred,the writing constitutes the agreement between the parties,and its terms and agreements can not be added to nor subtracted from by parol evidence.
