creditors deutsche bank ag london branch and bear,stearns,collectively,appellants challenge the implemented plan of reorganization plan confirmed in the chapter bankruptcy proceeding of metromedia fiber network,and its subsidiaries collectively,metromedia.this appeal is taken from a march,judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york brieant,affirming the august,confirmation order of the bankruptcy court hardin.
first,appellants challenge the reallocation to other creditors of stock warrants that were initially allocated to appellants under metromedia plan.without contesting that cash and stock allocated to appellants were properly reallocated to those creditors under the terms of a prior subordination agreement,appellants argue that they are allowed to keep the warrants by virtue of an exception in that subordination agreement,a.
second,appellants argue that releases in the plan improperly shield certain nondebtors from suit by the creditors.
abovenet,metromedia fiber network,and its subsidiaries collectively,appellees or the reorganized debtors refute these claims on the merits,and also argue that this appeal should be deemed equitably moot because numerous transactions have occurred since the plan september,effective date,and because appellants failed to ask the bankruptcy court or the district court for a stay of confirmation pending this appeal.
appellants objections to the plan were rejected on the merits by the bankruptcy court and the district court.at the same time,the district court ruled that relief if justified by the merits would not have been barred by the doctrine of equitable mootness because effective relief could have been afforded without unraveling the plan.
this court exercises plenary review over the decisions of the district court and bankruptcy court we review conclusions of law de novo and findings of fact for clear error.superintendent of ins.ochs in re first cent.fin,cir.we conclude that the reallocation of the warrants was proper,but that the bankruptcy court erred in approving the nondebtor releases.nevertheless,we affirm because this appeal is equitably moot.
before the bankruptcy,appellants purchased various metromedia notes the notes governed by an indenture agreement that subordinated the rights of the note holders to those of other creditors the senior indebtedness as follows 
upon the payment or distribution of the assets of mfn of any kind or character to creditors upon any dissolution,liquidation or reorganization of mfn any payment or distribution of assets of mfn of any kind or character to which the holders of the notes or the trustee on behalf of the holders would be entitled shall be paid or delivered to the holders of the senior indebtedness 
however,a exempted from subordination 
securities of mfn as reorganized or readjusted,or securities of mfn or any other person provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment,junior,or the payment of which is otherwise subordinate,at least to the extent provided in this article,with respect to the notes,to the payment of all senior indebtedness.
the notes were outstanding when metromedia filed for relief under chapter.the plan provided in relevant small part that i on account of the notes,appellants were to be paid a combination of cash,common stock in the reorganized debtors,and five and warrants to purchase additional common stock at specified prices but ii under the terms of the subordination agreement described above,appellants entire distribution would be reallocated to the senior indebtedness.
appellants concede that the plan properly reallocated the cash and stock to the senior indebtedness but they argue that the allowed them to keep the stock warrants.
the stock warrants are covered by the if they are junior,or if their payment is otherwise subordinate with respect to the notes,to the payment of all senior indebtedness.but the text is not the applicability of the clause in a specific case is not readily apparent and the parties have submitted no evidence as to the drafters intentions.still,such clauses seem to be common in the industry.see in re envirodyne,cir.
helpful guidance is found in the american bar foundation commentaries on model debenture indenture provisions hereinafter commentaries in a nutshell,when subordinated and senior note holders are given securities under a plan of reorganization,an allows the subordinated note holder to retain its securities only if the securities given to the senior note holder have higher priority to future distributions and dividends up to the full amount of the senior notes.this provides for full payment of the senior notes before any payment of the subordinated notes is made.in such a case,the senior note holder enjoys unimpaired the priority to payment that it had under its notes,payments on the subordinated note holder securities are subordinate to the payment of all senior indebtedness.see commentaries,supra,at is triggered where mortgage bonds,preferred stock or similar higher class security are provided to senior note holders and common stock is provided to subordinated note holders because this kind of distribution gives practical effect to the subordination and therefore turnover is not required ad hoc committee for revision of the model simplified indenture,revised model simplified indenture,bus.law,if senior debt were to receive preferred stock and the subordinated debt were to receive common stock,for example,where the preferred stock precluded distributions to common stockholders until the preferred stock was redeemed,the would permit that distribution.this approach assures that the junior creditor remains fully subordinated without requiring it to yield assets that are not required for full payment of the senior creditor and that would therefore make a to the senior creditor and back,with the attendant delay,friction,and transaction cost.
the caselaw on is consistent with this approach.the seventh circuit considered an virtually identical to the in this case,and construed it to exempt from subordination securities allocated to junior creditors that are subordinated to the claims of the senior creditors,and which therefore do not erase the priority of the senior class.envirodyne,at,see also in re pws holding,cir allows securities to be retained if they are subordinated to the same extent as the existing subordinated debt quotation omitted.
the question thus presented is whether appellants can keep the stock warrants without impairing the priority assured to the senior indebtedness by the subordination agreement.the answer is no.under the plan,the senior indebtedness received cash,common stock,and warrants identical to those at issue here.it is undisputed that the senior indebtedness did not receive full payment for its debt under the plan.if appellants can keep their warrants,they would be able to buy the same class of common stock allocated to the senior indebtedness,giving appellants and the senior indebtedness equal priority to any future distribution.therefore,allowing appellants to retain the warrants would effect an impairment of seniority.
ii.the nondebtor releases 
among the claims settled in the plan are those of the kluge trust under the plan,the kluge trust would i forgive approximately million in unsecured claims against metromedia ii convert million in senior secured claims to equity in the reorganized debtors iii invest approximately million in the reorganized debtors and iv purchase up to million of unsold common stock in the reorganized debtors planned stock offering collectively,kluge consideration.in return,the kluge trust would receive i of the reorganized debtors common stock and ii the kluge comprehensive release,which provides that 
the kluge trust and each of the kluge insiders shall receive a full and complete release,waiver and discharge from any holder of a claim of any nature of any and all claims,obligations,rights,causes of action and liabilities arising out of or in connection with any matter related to metromedia or one or more subsidiaries based in whole or in part upon any act or omission or transaction taking place
