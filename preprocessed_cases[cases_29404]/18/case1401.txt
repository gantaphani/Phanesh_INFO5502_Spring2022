from to october,kenneth cleveland was the accountant for interactive strategies,isi,a company that provided technical equipment and facilitated services in the adult telephone entertainment industry.isi officers and shareholders were robert johnson,edward hastings and brian spitler.early in,one of isi officers told cleveland that isi was starting a new division of isi known as the central connection,in which cleveland might be interested in investing.the central connection business was to operate as an internet service provider offering internet connections to its customers.cleveland and a friend,william bickley collectively,cleveland,agreed to invest in the project.cleveland drafted a memorandum to isi summarizing the agreement between isi and cleveland,which both parties signed,and the was provided to isi on february.the terms of the agreement between isi and cleveland were

all expenditures of the capital provided were to be at isi sole discretion,so long as they were related to the internet project.

cleveland was to receive of the net cash receipts from the internet project until all capital invested by cleveland has been recouped.at that time cleveland shall be paid of gross receipts from the internet project.
isi recorded the central connection as a fictitious business name on february.cleveland understanding was that the central connection division would become a separate corporation.
in june or july,johnson asked cleveland to cover losses being incurred by the central connection,which needed more capital,but cleveland said he was going to do so until he received some more information.
in july,cleveland received a copy of a resignation letter from kristina nolan,an isi employee with a series of grievances,the final of which was a critical performance report.nolan had been employed for five months,and was working on the central connection project.in the course of her resignation letter,she complained about,among other things,a lack of objectives and deadlines for the central connection project,and the fact that critiques of her work should not have come for the first time as a response to the heightened financial crisis of the project as specifically caused by the project investor,kenny cleveland,pulling out his funds the latter did not happen.nolan stated she resigned because she did not wish to work for a company whose administration neglects projects to the point of financial disaster 
in september,cleveland met with hastings,who subsequently wrote a memo to cleveland dated september,with an update on the central connection.hastings enclosed a profit and loss statement for the central connection showing revenues of per month against operational costs of per month,and a summary report showing expenses through august of exclusive of rent and utilities hastings observed that this would continue for several months and the overall expenses would exceed.hastings also indicated that repayment of cleveland investment can only come from the central connection.after a fax from cleveland,hastings sent a memo to cleveland on september,with a new report reflecting total income and expenses for the period march,through september,showing income of approximately and expenses of over.
in october,cleveland services as isi accountant were terminated.
in and into,cleveland called all three of the officers of isi but mostly hastings,asking for financial information.at some point in,cleveland testified,they retained an attorney and told me to talk to their attorney.on october,cleveland received a letter from isi attorney,richard marks,about cleveland numerous requests that isi voluntarily provide you with an accounting regarding the expenses incurred by isi.marks enclosed an account quickreport showing expenses and disbursements from february through april.since the information was over a year old,cleveland called marks and said he needed more information,and marks said he would talk to his clients.cleveland called marks several times,and marks kept telling cleveland he would get him the information.cleveland testified that he thought marks got tired of me calling,and so he told me that i needed to,you know,hire an attorney to call him again.and i did understand that,you know,because i just needed the information.and so,you know,i just thought i wait for the information.cleveland characterized the financial information he received as,while incomplete,depict ing a company that was earning revenues but was not profitable and struggling to survive.according to johnson,the central connection operated for about a year and then went out of business.
after the end of,cleveland made no further efforts to get financial information on the central connection business.
in september,jerry smith,isi lawyer,told cleveland that the central connection did not survive and had gone out of business.in reliance on smith representation and information that hastings had moved to palm springs,cleveland decided that further requests for an accounting to confirm that cleveland capital investment was being applied to expenditures related to the central connection was futile.about a year later,in or,cleveland ran into johnson in westlake village,and inquired about the central connection.johnson told him it had gone out of business and cleveland investment was lost.cleveland asked him for some verification,so that he could document the loss of his investment in case he needed to do so for tax purposes.johnson said he would send him something,but never did so.
some five or six years later,in may,cleveland was in the market for an internet service provider for his company,and received a referral to a company called internet specialties west,is west.he visited is west offices and,while waiting and perusing a brochure,saw a picture of johnson,who was described as the president of is west.the brochure described is west business,which was similar to the central connection business,and stated it had been founded in.cleveland suspicions were aroused.he returned to his office,accessed is west web page,and discovered the statement that is west was e stablished in as central connections and that is west incorporated in as a california corporation to be a high speed internet service provider in los angeles and ventura counties.upon investigation,and in the course of this lawsuit,the following facts came to light 
is west was incorporated on june,with johnson,hastings and spitler as founding shareholders,along with ed rubottom.according to johnson,is west did not actually start any operations until by the year,is west had almost in net revenue accrued over the prior four years,and now generates millions of dollars per year in revenue.is west operated from the same location as the central connection and isi.
