section b of the securities exchange act of the act provides for the disgorgement of profits that corporate realize from any purchase and sale,or any sale and purchase,of any equity security of the corporate issuer within any period of less than six months.b.the question presented is whether this profit rule applies when a corporate insider sells shares of one type of stock issued by the insider company and purchases shares of a different type of stock in that same company.we hold,absent any guidance from the securities and exchange commission sec,that b does not apply to transactions of this sort involving separately traded,nonconvertible stocks with different voting rights.
background 
the facts in this case are straightforward and uncontested.between december,and december,john malone a director and large shareholder of discovery communications,discovery engaged in nine sales of discovery series c stock totaling shares,and ten purchases of discovery series a stock totaling shares.just under two years later,michael gibbons brought this shareholder suit seeking disgorgement of profits that malone realized from these transactions.gibbons alleges that malone obtained illicit profits in the amount of at least from these trades.complaint.
discovery series a stock and series c stock are different equity securities,are separately registered,and are traded separately on the nasdaq stock exchange under the ticker symbols disca and disck,respectively.the principal difference between the two securities is that series a stock comes with voting rights one vote per share whereas series c stock does not confer any voting rights.series a stock and series c stock are not convertible into each other.on the open market in late and early,series a stock generally traded at slightly higher prices than series c stock,though occasionally not.on the nine relevant dates in question,the closing prices of series a stock varied from about to higher than the respective closing prices of series c stock.
following a motion to dismiss under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,the united states district court for the southern district of new york barbara jones,judge dismissed gibbons complaint for failure to state a viable b disgorgement claim.the court explained that the statute use of the term any equity security written in the singular undermines gibbons argument,as his theory requires the purchase and sale of any equity securities,rather than of one equity security.gibbons malone,d,emphasis in original.the court further pointed out that,unlike other financial instruments that are treated as functionally equivalent under b,discovery series a stock and series c stock are not convertible and do not have a fixed value relative to each other.see id.at.finally,the court noted

discussion 
we review de novo a district court dismissal under rule b,construing the complaint liberally,accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true,and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor.chase grp.alliance llc city of dep t cir internal quotation marks omitted.to survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,d internal quotation marks omitted.a claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.id.
the issue presented in this appeal is one of statutory interpretation,so we begin by examining the statutory text.see schindler elevator united states ex rel.kirk,d.section b of the act provides,in relevant part 
for the purpose of preventing the unfair use of information which may have been obtained by such beneficial owner,director,or officer by reason of his relationship to the issuer,any profit realized by him from any purchase and sale,or any sale and purchase,of any equity security of such issuer within any period of less than six months shall inure to and be recoverable by the issuer,irrespective of any intention on the part of such beneficial owner,director,or officer in entering into such transaction this subsection shall not be construed to cover any transaction or transactions which the sec by rules and regulations may exempt as not comprehended within the purpose of this subsection.
b.notably,although b is designed to curb the use of nonpublic knowledge by corporate insiders,see note,ante,the provision offers merely the prophylactic remedy of disgorgement,blau lehman,d,and operates mechanically,with no required showing of intent to profit from the use of inside information,at home cox commc ns,cir.the statute,in other words,imposes a form of strict liability.credit suisse sec.usa llc simmonds,d internal quotation marks omitted.
as we have previously explained,if the conversion can be paired with another sale or purchase,and the paired transactions occur within a six month period,the paired transactions are the type of insider activity that section b was designed to prevent,blau lamb,cir,but transactions of securities that can not be paired are not within the scope of b.foremost mckesson,provident sec,d profit rule applies to profits realized from a pair of securities transactions.the question presented is whether a sale of one security and a purchase of a different security issued by the same company can be paired under b.
congress use of the singular term any equity security supports an inference that transactions involving diferent equity securities can not be paired under b.see at home,at.as the district court explained,correctly in our view 
the text limits liability to profits realized from the purchase and sale,or sale and purchase,of any equity security of the issuer.the drafters specifically chose to group purchase and sale and sale and purchase into single compounded units.this indicates that,to incur section b liability,an insider purchase and sale or sale and purchase must both be directed at the same prepositional object the same equity security.
gibbons,d at am.standard,crane,cir the statute speaks of such issuer in the singular.there is no room for a grammatical construction that would convert the singular into a plural.the regulations promulgated by the sec implicitly support this understanding of b by noting that that the statute covers the purchase and sale,or sale and purchase,of a security,and by providing for an exception when the purchase and sale of such security meets certain conditions.b.
gibbons focuses on the statute use of the word any,but that word is unhelpful to his argument.no one doubts that discovery series a stock and series c stock are equity securities as we have just explained,however,the reason that the purchase and sale of different equity securities falls outside of the scope of the statute is because the term equity security is because the securities at issue,viewed alone,would not fall within the meaning of the term any equity security.
accordingly,as we recently observed in passing,b applies to the purcha
