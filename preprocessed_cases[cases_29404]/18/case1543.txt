ii.background 
as noted above,the department action was filed on july.the department complaint alleged speedee oil directly operated and controlled the franchises,which provide oil change service.further,the department alleged speedee oil and calneva,including individual officers and directors acting as such,conspired to and did offer and sell oil change franchises in violation of sections,and,which are part of the franchise investment law.the charging allegations of the department july,complaint specifically asserted that speedee oil and calneva,as well as their named officers and directors filed uniform franchise offering circulars with the commissioner of corporations containing false or misleading statements as to the existence of trademarks and the provision of site selection assistance,training,and advertising fund reports in violation of section provided untrue oral and written information to prospective franchisees in addition to that in the uniform franchise offering circulars concerning the provision of site selection assistance,training,and other assistance necessary to operate a franchise,and provided untrue analysis of expected profitable returns including written projections provided by calneva in violation of section provided uniform franchise offering circulars to prospective franchisees that contained material misstatements and omitted to disclose relevant facts as to the existence of trademarks and the provision of site selection assistance,training,and advertising fund reports,in violation of section and offered and sold unregistered,speedee oil franchises in violation of section.
on october,the franchisees filed an ex parte application to intervene pursuant to code of civil procedure section.on october,the franchisees were granted leave to intervene in the department action.on that date,october,the complaint in intervention was filed.
the operative pleading is the complaint in intervention filed on october.the franchisees joined in the causes of action asserted in the department july,complaint.in addition,the franchisees asserted causes of action for fraud negligent misrepresentation conspiracy intentional infliction of emotional distress breach of contract unfair business practices bus,cartwright act violations bus.code,declaratory relief and injunctive relief.the franchisees dismissed their unfair business practices claim as to all defendants prior to trial.the cartwright act violation allegations were also adjudicated adversely to the franchisees prior to trial.there is no issue in this case as to any business and professions code section claims nor are there any antitrust questions presented.on august,calneva filed a against the franchisees.the alleged breaches of the local franchise agreements and intentional misrepresentation.
the department action and the franchisees complaint in intervention were severed for trial.the department action was tried in june.judge richard kalustian issued a statement of decision on march.as to speedee oil,judge kalustian found it failed to two service marks and to disclose the lapsed registration to franchisees however,no franchisee suffered any detriment as a result of the lapsed registrations.with respect to calneva,judge kalustian found it violated the franchise investment law by,between september and april,failing to notify prospective franchisees that speedee oil had failed to its two service marks although no franchisee suffered detriment as a result creating the misimpression in its uniform franchise offering circulars that a substantial number of franchisees were either in the process of building their stores or very close to it misrepresenting the time actually required to open a location after signing a local franchise agreement misrepresenting available site selection assistance making improper representations regarding potential earnings and misrepresenting the costs to open a franchise.a judgment in favor of the department was entered on september.permanent injunctions were issued as against speedee oil and calneva as well as their responsible officers and directors.they were enjoined from offering or selling franchises in california in violation of any provision of law including but not limited to the franchise investment law.in addition,civil penalties were imposed against the corporate defendants.civil penalties were imposed against speedee oil for failure to disclose the lapsed service mark registrations.
in december,speedee oil and calneva appealed the judgment in favor of the department.speedee oil appeal was dismissed in november for failure to procure the record on appeal.cal.rules of court,rule c.the remittitur was issued on january.in an opinion filed on november,we affirmed the judgment as to calneva,philpot,and james musser.people calneva oil corporation,nonpub.opn.
the matter proceeded,albeit very slowly,as to the franchisees claims.in,judge kalustian granted a summary judgment in favor of speedee oil officers and two directors,copp and bennett.the franchisees appealed.in an opinion filed on may,we held,inter alia,that by intervening and joining in the department claims against speedee oil and others,the franchisees had stated causes of action for violations of the franchise investment law against copp and bennett.southern california intervenors speedee oil change systems may,nonpub.opn.
the case eventually proceeded to trial before retired superior court judge joseph kalin.on april,judge kalin granted the following nonsuit motions as to all causes of action and claims against the individual calneva defendants as to the third conspiracy and fourth intentional infliction of emotional distress causes of action against calneva as to the claim calneva violated the franchise investment law and as to all of the franchisees causes of action against mobil and speedee oil.
the case went to the jury on the franchisees intentional fraud and negligent misrepresentation and contract breach claims against calneva.calneva breach of contract causes of action against the franchisees were also tried at the same time.on april,the jury returned special verdicts finding in favor of the franchisees on their fraud cause of action.stated differently,the jury found calneva committed fraud.the jury also found calneva had breached the local franchise agreements resulting in damages to the franchisees.but the jury further found that the franchisees had breached the local franchise agreements resulting in damages to calneva.judgment was entered on july.on september,the trial court granted calneva new trial motion.
iii.discussion 
a.the franchisees appeal case no.
the franchisees contend it was reversible error to grant a nonsuit in favor of calneva as to their franchise investment law claims.we find no error.we conclude the franchise investment law claims were barred by the applicable statutes of limitations.
the trial court nonsuit order states with respect to the franchisees franchise investment law claims the motion is granted as to any claim that calneva violated the fil.the court finds that the acts pled as violations of the fil,as pled in the department of corporations complaint herein and incorporated by reference by the franchisees,were not knowingly made by calneva given the undisputed lack of authority conveyed by any officer of calneva to a franchise salesman or any other person to provide such information,and disclaimers to the effect that any earnings or sales information was not authorized by calneva see,ufoc item,local franchise agreement,exhibit b.alternatively,the court finds there was insufficient evidence that franchise salesmen were authorized by calneva or its officers or directors to make representations not contained in,or inconsistent with,the local franchise agreement or uniform franchise offering circular,and that calneva franchise salesmen did not occupy managerial positions in the company,and no representation by any salesman was ratified by any officer of calneva.alternatively,the court finds that the evidence established that the applicable statute of limitations,and,barred any and all claims by plaintiffs for violation of,and of the fil.each of the franchisees testified that he purchased his speedee franchise more than four years prior to filing suit.franchisees han and jeff howe testified to facts demonstrating they knew,or should have known,of the alleged fil violations more than one year prior to filing suit.the franchisees presented insufficient evidence of conspiracy or concealment by calneva that might have tolled the running of the statutes.italics added.
the standard of review on appeal from an order granting a nonsuit is as follows a defendant is entitled to a nonsuit if the trial court determines that,as a matter of law,the evidence presented by plaintiff is insufficient to permit a jury to find in his favor.campbell general motors cal d.in determining whether plaintiff evidence is sufficient,the court may not weigh the evidence or consider the credibility of witnesses.instead,the evidence most favorable to plaintiff must be accepted as true and conflicting evidence must be disregarded.the court must give to the plaintiff evidence all the value to which it is legally entitled,indulging every legitimate inference which may be drawn from the evidence in plaintiff favor,at.a mere scintilla of evidence does not create a conflict for the jury resolution there must be substantial evidence to create the necessary conflict.witkin,cal.procedure ed.trial,italics in original.in reviewing a grant of nonsuit,we are guided by the same rule requiring evaluation of the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.carson facilities development cal d.we will not sustain the judgment unless interpreting the evidence most favorably to plaintiff case and most strongly against the defendant and resolving all presumptions,inferences and doubts in favor of the plaintiff a judgment for the defendant is required as a matter of law,quoting mason peaslee d.nally grace community church cal d.
the franchisees contend that judge kalin nonsuit order,which was premised in part upon the franchise investment law statutes of limitations,was in error.the franchise investment law statutes of limitation are found in sections and.the statutes of limitations are complex.accordingly,it is appropriate we describe them in some detail.
the first franchise investment law statute of limitations,section,governs,among other things,actions alleging a franchisee reliance on misleading statements made in documents filed by the franchisor with the commissioner of corporations.section states in its entirety,no action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under section unless brought before the expiration of four years after the act or transaction constituting the violation,the expiration of one year after the discovery by the plaintiff of the fact constituting the violation,or days after delivery to the franchisee of a written notice disclosing any violation of section or,which notice shall be approved as to form by the commissioner,whichever shall first expire.section specifies certain circumstances in which a franchisor may be liable to a franchisee for damages under the franchise investment law.section,the provision of law creating civil liability referred to in the section statute of limitations,states,any person who offers or sells,a franchise in violation of section,or,shall be liable to the franchisee or subfranchisor,who may sue for damages caused thereby,and if such violation is willful,the franchisee may also sue for rescission,unless,in the case of a violation of section or,the defendant proves that the plaintiff knew the facts concerning the untruth or omission,or that the defendant exercised reasonable care and did not know,or,if he had exercised reasonable care,would not have known,of the untruth or omission.as can be noted,section identifies five sections which can give rise to a franchise investment law violation.section prohibits the offer or sale of a franchise that has not been registered with the commissioner of corporations and is not exempt from the registration requirement.section exempts certain franchises from the section registration requirement provided certain written disclosures are made to prospective franchisees.section requires that a prospective franchisee be provided with an offering circular and a copy of the contract at least business days prior to the execution of a written franchise agreement or receipt of any consideration.section makes it unlawful for a franchisor to make any untrue statement of a material fact in any application,notice or report filed with the commissioner of corporations or to willfully omit the material fact in documents filed with the department.see witkin,summary of cal.law ed.corporations,cal.jur d franchises from private parties.section prohibits a franchisor that is exempt from the section registration requirement from making untrue statements or omitting material facts in the disclosure document provided to a potential franchisee pursuant to section,subdivision c.see cal.jur d,supra,franchises from private parties.hence,section is the statute of limitations provision for section,which provides for civil liability in connection with offering or selling an unregistered nonexempt franchise failing to provide the required disclosures to a potential franchisee as required by section,subdivision c in the case of an exempt franchise making untrue statements in documents filed with the commissioner of corporations making false statements in the section,subdivision c disclosure documents provided to franchisees in the case of exempt franchises and failing to provide offering circulars and franchise agreements to prospective franchisees.
the second franchise investment law statute of limitations is set forth in section.the franchise investment law statute of limitations in section governs liability for untrue statements of material fact made to a franchisee other than those covered by section.as noted previously,section involves liability for misleading statements contained in documents filed with the commissioner of corporations.the second franchise investment law statute of limitations in section states in its entirety,no action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under section unless brought before the expiration of two years after the violation upon which it is based,expiration of one year after the discovery by the plaintiff of the facts constituting such violation,or days after delivery to the franchisee of a written notice disclosing any violation of section or which notice shall be approved as to form by the commissioner,whichever shall first expire.section,which provides for civil liability under the franchise investment law,states,any person who violates section shall be liable to any person not knowing or having cause to believe that such statement was false or misleading who,while relying upon such statement shall have purchased a franchise,for damages,unless the defendant proves that the plaintiff knew the facts concerning the untruth or omission or that the defendant exercised reasonable care and did not know,or if he had exercised reasonable care would not have known of the untruth or omission.section provides for civil liability when a franchisor violates section.section states,it is unlawful for any person to offer or sell a franchise in this state by means of any written or oral communication not enumerated in section which includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading.section provides for civil liability on the part of a franchisor for misleading statements other than those covered by section.as noted previously,section makes it unlawful for a franchisor to make any untrue statement of a material fact in any application,notice or report filed with the commissioner of corporations or willfully to omit the material fact in documents filed with the department.therefore,liability under section involves misleading statements or failing to relate material facts to a franchisee other than those matters contained in documents filed with the commissioner of corporations.for example,if a franchisor salesperson orally misrepresents the profitability of a proposed franchise,then the section statute of limitations can apply because the misrepresentation was not made in a document filed with the commissioner of corporations.it is this type of franchisor liability for misstatements or omissions to state material facts to a franchisee that is subject to the second franchise investment law statute of limitations found in section.
as discussed above,the first franchise investment law statute of limitations found in section involves misstatements or omissions in documents filed with the commissioner of corporations.section provides for a period of time in which to file suit.further,the second franchise investment law statute of limitations found in section,involving misstatements or omissions of fact other than those made to the commissioner of corporations,allows for a period of time in which to file suit.also,under both sections and,there is a statute of limitations from the date of discovery by the plaintiff of the facts constituting a violation.finally,as to both sections and,there is a statute of limitations of days after written disclosure of enumerated violations by the commissioner of corporations.there is no issue in this case as to the day statute of limitations.there is no testimony that any of the franchisees were ever provided with a written disclosure of violations by the commissioner of corporations as to any claims relevant to this litigation.
according to the second amended complaint in intervention,the almens entered into their local franchise agreement on october.on march,the almens assigned the local franchise agreement to the beldoon corporation.anderson entered into two local franchise agreements on june,and again on november.the beezleys entered into their local franchise agreement on january.the bradleys entered into a local franchise agreement on september.lau entered into his local franchise agreement on december.mack signed a local franchise agreement on january.the hans signed their local franchise agreement on march.howe testified he entered into a local franchise agreement on march.on august,howe assumed a second local franchise agreement for a speedee oil franchise.
the allegations of violations of the franchise investment law made by all plaintiffs arise from their execution of the local franchise agreements and representations made to them prior to signing the contracts.except for howe and han,all of the local franchise agreements were executed between and january.as has been noted,the longest period of limitations in section is four years and in section only two years.the complaint in intervention was not filed until october.as to the claims of all of the franchisees,except howe and han,their claims for violations of section and the statutory provisions cited therein are barred by the outside statute of limitations in section.further,as to the claims of all the franchisees except howe and han for section violations,they are all barred on their face by the section outer statute of limitations.as to the claims of howe and han,they require further analysis and will be discussed shortly.
the franchisees contend though that their franchise investment law claims did not accrue until later or were tolled premised on three theories.first,they argue that their franchise investment law causes of action did not accrue until damages had been sustained.united states liab.ins,cal d,city of vista robert thomas securities,th,d.second,the franchisees argue that because of the fraudulent and oppressive conduct of the franchisors,the statute of limitations did not commence to run as long as the fraud remained concealed.wyatt union mortgage cal d,just as the statute of limitations does not run against an action based on fraud so long as the fraud remains concealed,so ought the statute to be tolled even after the fraud is discovered,for so long as the sheer economic duress or undue influence embedded in the fraud continues to hold the victim in place.italics omitted.see derose carswell d.third,the franchisees argue that the statutes of limitations were tolled because of a conspiracy among various defendants.molko holy spirit cal d,wyatt union mortgage,supra,cal d at.
however,these delayed discovery or tolling rules do not apply in the case of a franchise investment law claim because of the express language of section.this is an issue of statutory interpretation.we apply the following standard of statutory review described by our supreme court when interpreting a statute our primary task is to determine the legislature intent.citation.in doing so we turn first to the statutory language,since the words the legislature chose are the best indicators of its intent.citation.we must interpret the statute to carry out the legislature intent.freedom newspapers,orange county employees retirement system,supra,cal th at,d,people jones,supra,cal th at,d.further,our supreme court has noted if the language is clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction,nor is it necessary to resort to indicia of the intent of the legislature in the case of a statute delaney superior court,supra,cal d at.however,the literal meaning of a statute must be in accord with its purpose,as our supreme court noted in lakin watkins associated industries cal th,d,as follows we are not prohibited from determining whether the literal meaning of a statute comports with its purpose or whether such a construction of one provision is consistent with other provisions of the statute.the meaning of a statute may not be determined from a single word or sentence the words must be construed in context,and provisions relating to the same subject matter must be harmonized to the extent possible.citation.literal construction should not prevail if it is contrary to the legislative intent apparent in the statute in lungren deukmejian cal d,our supreme court added the intent prevails over the letter,and the letter will,if possible,be so read as to conform to the spirit of the act.citations.an interpretation that renders related provisions nugatory must be avoided citation each sentence must be read not in isolation but in light of the statutory scheme citation 
section provides that civil liability under the franchise investment law only arises under its explicit terms.section states in relevant part,except as explicitly provided in this chapter,no civil liability in favor of any private party shall arise against any person by implication from or as a result of the violation of any provision of this law or any rule or order hereunder.section is located in chapter of part of title of division of the corporations code.chapter is entitled civil liability.chapter contains the provisions in the franchise investment law allowing for recovery of damages specifying the statute of limitations allowing for survival of actions and enacting the limitation on liability in section.the legislature has not referred directly or inferentially to delayed accrual based on when damage is sustained or because of fraud nor is there any reference in sections and to tolling based upon a conspiracy.because the delayed accrual and tolling theories of the franchisees are without merit,except for han and howe whose claims require further explanation,all of the franchisees franchise investment law claims are barred on their face by the statute of limitations in section or the time limit in section.
under similar circumstances,the california supreme court has noted that the code of civil procedure section statute of limitations for legal malpractice is not subject to equitable tolling.this is because the legislative history makes it clear that once an injury has been sustained,the statute of limitations commences to run.laird blacker cal th,d,section,subdivision a,states that in no event shall the prescriptive period be tolled except under those circumstances specified in the statute.thus,the legislature expressly intended to disallow tolling under any circumstances not enumerated in the statute gordon law offices of aguirre meyer th,d.in the present case,section states,except as explicitly provided in this chapter,no civil liability in favor of any private party shall arise this constitutes an express statement of unequivocal legislative intent that the statute of limitations provisions in sections and are to be the sole controlling limits on the time for filing suit under the franchise investment law.
as to han and howe,they argue they filed suit within four years of the execution of their local franchise agreements.hence,han and howe argue they are entitled to the period of limitations in sections and.han alleged that misrepresentations were made concerning the profitability of a speedee oil franchise.han and his late father signed their local franchise agreement on march.there is no evidence han or his late father ever relied on any documents provided to the commissioner of corporations.in the absence of such reliance,no liability can arise under section.therefore,the period of limitation in section is unavailable to han.additionally,no liability can arise under section for other written or oral communications.han executed his local franchise agreement on march.any misrepresentations,other than those appearing in documents filed with or required to be given to a franchisee,are subject to the maximum period of limitation in section.the complaint in intervention was not filed until october.this was more than two years from the date of the last alleged misrepresentations made to han.accordingly,the maximum statute of limitation in section had run as to of his franchise investment law claims are time barred.
howe signed his local franchise agreement on march.howe never testified he relied on any documents filed with the commissioner of corporations.nor did howe testify that he relied on any statements made concerning documents filed with the commissioner of corporations or the contents of the uniform franchise offering circular.in fact,howe testified he did not look at the uniform franchise offering circular that well but merely that he probably looked at it.simply stated,howe never relied on any documents which were provided to him or filed with the commissioner of corporations.therefore,the outside statute of limitations in section governs liability premised on misleading statements in franchise documents filed with the commissioner of corporations or papers required by section to be provided to a unavailable to howe.
the question remains whether howe can benefit from the statute of limitations in section,which applies to written or oral misrepresentations made by a franchisor.howe testified that he relied on oral statements concerning site selection made by various representatives of calneva.however,the representations were all made prior to the march,execution of his local franchise agreement.as noted previously,the section statute of limitations is the outer limit for claims for misleading statements made by franchisor representatives as occurred in this case.since the complaint in intervention was not filed until october,more than two years after the march,execution of his local franchise agreement and representations which led up to its signing,all of howe franchise investment law claims are time barred.
finally,we explain why,as a matter of statutory interpretation,the and periods set forth in sections and respectively impose absolute limits.we apply the standard of statutory review described by our supreme court as set forth above.we conclude that under the plain language of sections and,the and periods,respectively,are outside limits.both statutes specifically state an action must be brought before the expiration of four years or two years after the act or transaction constituting the violation or the expiration of one year after the discovery by the plaintiff of the fact constituting the violation whichever shall first expire,italics added.once the or period expires,a plaintiff belated discovery of the fact constituting the violation can not serve to extend the statute of limitations.in other words,the bar in section and the limit in section are absolute,lampf gilbertson,d federal securities act of,admiralty fund hugh johnson cir,malik universal resources.since howe and han filed their actions beyond the outside limits of the applicable statutes of limitations,we need not consider the discovery alternative.further,we need not address the question whether discovery as used in sections and means actual knowledge or inquiry notice.see eisenbaum western energy resources,d.plain language of,discovery of the facts,means actual knowledge required,not just inquiry notice compare miller bechtel cal d,discovery in fraud statute of limitations,code civ,subd.d,means actual knowledge or inquiry notice debro los angeles raiders th,d discovery in context of,subd.a,means actual knowledge or inquiry notice.notwithstanding the discovery statutes of limitations in sections and,han and howe claims for violations of the franchise investment law were barred.
