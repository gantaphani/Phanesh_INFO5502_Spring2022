bobby maxwell,a senior auditor for the united states department of the interior,brought this qui tam action against oil and gas producer oil gas corporation for defrauding the federal government by underpaying royalties for federal offshore oil leases.after the jury returned a million verdict for maxwell,the district court reversed its prior ruling on whether the court had subject matter jurisdiction to hear the case.the court determined that information underlying the suit had previously been disclosed to the public,thereby removing jurisdiction under the false claims act,e.we now hold that the transfer of information between a federal employee and a state government auditor who is under a duty of confidentiality is not a public disclosure and therefore does not deprive the courts of jurisdiction.
maxwell was a senior government auditor for the minerals management service mms,a division within the united states department of the interior.in,the mms began an investigation of royalty reporting by arising from crude oil produced from federal offshore leases and sold to texon.maxwell was the senior auditor on the team assigned to the investigation,and in the course of that investigation reached the conclusion that had substantially underpaid its federal oil royalties.am.comp.had reported the sales value of oil for royalty purposes without including the fair market value of marketing services provided by texon as partial consideration,resulting in a royalties underpayment of around million.
on november,maxwell sent an audit issue letter to containing a preliminary determination that had underpaid royalties owed to the federal government on its leases.submitted a written response to mms disputing the findings contained in the letter.maxwell then drafted an order for payment of additional royalties,which he submitted to his senior manager.mms did not issue the order of payment.
on june,maxwell filed a qui tam action against under the false claims act fca.he alleged that,based on the information uncovered during his audit,knowingly made false fraudulent statements on the monthly royalty reports submitted to the mms and understated and underpaid its federal royalties.maxwell oil gas,d.the united states declined to intervene in the suit.
before trial,filed a motion for summary judgment for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the fca.e.the court denied the motion,concluding that government auditors were not necessarily barred from acting as relators under the fca,and that maxwell was a direct and independent source of the information on which his allegations were based and voluntarily provided the information to the government before filing the action.united states ex rel.maxwell chemical worldwide,llc,wl.june.the case proceeded to trial and the jury awarded damages of.before entering judgment,however,the court reconsidered and reversed its prior holding,this time determining that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case.maxwell,d at.
the court concluded that the information underlying the suit had been publicly disclosed in an exchange between david darouse,an employee of the state of louisiana,and roman geissel,an mms agent,in early april.an,sent by darouse to geissel dated april,requested a copy of the contract from august to december.in that,darouse stated we analyzed the prices being paid by texon to kerr and found them to be far below gravity adjusted market indices.app.the following day,geissel replied we have done a lot of work at kerr and found numerous problems which will result in a significant underpayment.app.the court found this exchange to be a public disclosure of the facts underlying maxwell suit and that maxwell did not fall within the original source exception,resulting in a lack of jurisdiction under the fca.we disagree and hold that the limited disclosure of information to a government official under a duty of confidentiality is not a public disclosure.
the statutory language at issue in this case is primarily found in the amendments to the false claims act,which broadened the class of qui tam actions falling within the proper jurisdiction of the courts.the prior version of the act removed jurisdiction over suits whenever it shall be made to appear that such suit was based upon evidence or information in the possession of the united states,or any agency,officer or employee thereof,at the time such suit was brought.c.this language effectively prevented any federal employee from filing a qui tam action and thereby eliminated any incentive provided by the fca for government employees to seek out fraudulent activity and bring it to light.
in response,congress adopted the amendments to enhance the government ability to recover losses sustained as a result of fraud against the government,at,reprinted in.the overall intent was to encourage more private enforcement suits.id.at,reprinted in at.one feature of these amendments was to provide a more permissive jurisdictional limitation no court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a government accounting office report,hearing,audit,or investigation e.by focusing not on whether the underlying information was known to the united states,but rather whether the information was within the public domain,the amendment sought to further the dual goals of the fca in avoidance of parasitism and encouragement of legitimate citizen enforcement actions.united states ex rel.springfield terminal ry.quinn.
contends that even under the more expansive scope of the fca as amended,the court lacks jurisdiction to hear maxwell suit.first,it argues that a governmental employee who acquires the information in the course of his official duties can not serve as a relator for a suit based on that information.acknowledges that this argument may be foreclosed by our en banc decision in united states ex rel.holmes consumer ins.group,cir,but seeks to preserve it for further review.second,argues,and the district court agreed,that the exchange of between darouse and geissel constituted a public disclosure under the fca jurisdictional bar,thereby removing jurisdiction over any suit based on information contained therein.it is on this issue that we reverse the district court.lastly,we reject argument that a prior suit related to alleged fraudulent royalty underpayment by constituted a public disclosure upon which maxwell suit was based.
government employee as relator 
section b provides,in pertinent part,that a person may bring a civil action for a violation of section for the person and for the united states government.b.we held in our en banc decision in holmes that a government employee who obtains information about fraud in the scope of his or her employment,and who is required to report that fraud is a person under b and is not otherwise prevented from acting as a relator.at.
attempts to distinguish holmes on the basis that the relator in that case discovered the fraud during her lunch break,in an investigation not within her official duties.our analysis in holmes,however,did not turn on whether or not the fraud was discovered in the employee official capacity.the lack of limiting language on the broad term person as used in b provides no basis for concluding that government employees,whether acting in their official capacity or not,are excluded from the scope of the statute.prior to the amendments,federal employees were effectively barred from bringing qui tam suits because of the jurisdictional exemption for suits based on information already known to the united states.c.but the amendments allow suits based on such information as long as it is not publicly disclosed,and therefore do not prevent federal employees from acting as relators.in holmes,we explicitly adopted the supreme court reasoning in united states ex rel.marcus hess,which interpreted a predecessor to the current fca even a district attorney,who would presumably gain all knowledge of a fraud from his official position,might sue as the informer.marcus,at.we conclude,therefore,that maxwell was not prevented from serving as a relator on the basis that he is
