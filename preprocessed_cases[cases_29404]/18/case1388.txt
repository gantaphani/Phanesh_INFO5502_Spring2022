facts and procedural history 
entry of sister state judgment 
in august,arizona initiated the present proceeding in the superior court of los angeles,when it applied for entry of judgment on a sister state judgment in the amount of about against yuen.an attorney for arizona signed an affidavit attesting that in the arizona corporation commission had obtained a judgment in arizona against yuen.the judgment amounted to approximately,with accrued interest of about,and arizona purportedly had received nothing from yuen on the debt.the clerk of the los angeles superior court entered a judgment by clerk on a sister state judgment in august.
motion to vacate clerk judgment 
in march,yuen moved to vacate the clerk judgment her declaration in support of the motion stated as follows.
yuen was briefly involved with an entity known as forex investment services corporation fisc.fisc attempted to open offices in phoenix in approximately.yuen became involved with fisc through a friend,win ming tam tam.
in,yuen and her three children were living in san francisco with her.yuen husband,scott,was spending about one half of his time in china for his business of exporting california wines to china.about this time,scott yuen told his wife a colleague,sammy lee chun wing wing,needed help in opening a currency trading business in arizona.because he was often out of the country for his business,scott yuen asked his wife to be the incorporating person for wing business.
at her husband request,yuen signed articles of incorporation to form fisc in maricopa county,arizona.although she did not recall it,yuen was also listed as the secretary for fisc.yuen decided to disengage from fisc shortly afterwards.as a consequence,yuen was never involved in any activities of fisc.
yuen never owned any fisc stock or directed the company activities,supervised its employees or arranged or opened accounts for its customers.yuen never traveled to,resided in or conducted business in arizona in or at any relevant time.she never conducted business for fisc even by telephone from san francisco.she never received any monies from fisc and had no idea what was going on,if anything with the company.yuen only involvement with fisc was as incorporator.she had no experience nor any employment,education or training in financial matters,and particularly not in monetary matters.throughout this period,she was a housewife in san francisco raising three young boys.
around,tam called yuen and told her there was a problem with the arizona company and an attorney in arizona needed to speak with her.at tam request,yuen went to tam office in san francisco and had a conference call with an attorney in arizona yuen stated she did not retain the arizona attorney and did not pay him.she received no documents from the arizona attorney nor authorized him to appear on her behalf.she never received nor sent any correspondence to the arizona attorney.other than the conference call,she never spoke with the arizona attorney.
after the telephone conference call,yuen heard nothing else about the fisc matter for the next approximately ten years.
in july,yuen received a letter from a california attorney.the letter notified yuen that arizona had a monetary claim against her.the attorney attached a copy of an opinion and order of the arizona corporation commission to his letter.until yuen read the opinion,she was not aware of any of the facts or findings contained in the opinion.this was the first time yuen learned of any adverse proceedings against her in arizona.
yuen immediately retained an attorney to respond to the demand letter.yuen stated she was not served with any application for entry of sister state judgment or any notice of entry of judgment.she first became aware of the existence of a california judgment against her when a bank gave notice that it had turned over funds in response to a writ of execution.
opposition to motion to vacate judgment 
in opposition to yuen motion to vacate,arizona asked the court to take judicial notice of certified copies of various documents from proceedings in arizona,including certified copies of a july letter from arizona counsel to the arizona corporation commission hearing officer,a procedural order of the arizona corporation commission,an administrative order issued by the arizona corporation commission,and a minute order and judgment entered by the maricopa county superior court in arizona.
the july letter written by counsel for arizona to the hearing officer for the arizona corporation commission referred to partial written waivers of conflict of interest that had been executed by one of the respondents simmons in the arizona proceedings.yuen was one of the named respondents in the proceeding brought by arizona.the letter written on behalf of arizona alerted the hearing officer to potential conflict of interest issues that counsel believed might result in material breaches of procedural due process state supreme court professional conduct rules.
specifically,counsel for arizona raised a concern after reviewing simmons partial written waivers.the letter requested that the hearing officer develop a record in order to comply with arizona rules of professional conduct,rule of the supreme court rules er and decisional law,namely,sellers superior court,sellers,regarding potential conflicts of interests.arizona counsel asked the hearing officer to conduct a inquiry at an upcoming prehearing conference and make certain findings,including whether there are adverse conflicts of interest between any other respondents represented by the same counsel that may hereafter prejudice any such respondent during these proceedings.see id.at.
the subsequent arizona corporation commission procedural order reflects that a prehearing conference was held in july at which all respondents,purportedly including yuen and excepting simmons,were represented by attorneys alan baskin of the arizona law firm of roshka jeyman dewulf,plc baskin and chris youtz of the seattle,washington law firm of sirianni youtz youtz.the procedural order indicates the commission found a written waiver of a conflict of interest regarding baskin and a partial written waiver of a conflict of interest regarding youtz were issued as a result of a fully informed and voluntary decision by simmons.however,the commission found there was presented no evidence of adverse conflicts of interest between any other respondents and that t he parties acknowledged that they had no knowledge of any unresolved conflict or potential conflict of interest.
reply to opposition 
in her reply papers in support of the motion to vacate,yuen argued that baskin purported to represent all but one of the respondents,including tam and yuen,in the arizona proceedings and that arizona was aware that counsel representation of multiple respondents created a conflict of interest under the governing authorities.yuen argued the existing rules of professional conduct and arizona case authority required both the informed consent of,and a written authorization from,the client to waive any conflict of interest.because none was obtained from yuen,she contended she was denied a fair trial.
yuen asserted that although the hearing officer was made aware of an obvious conflict of interest among the respondents,the record showed the effort to address the conflicts was little more than a sham.she argued sufficient findings were never made in the arizona proceeding establishing compliance with the ethical rules of professional conduct.arizona counsel purportedly was in receipt of written waivers of conflict of interest from simmons,the only respondent not represented by baskin and youtz,but there was no showing written waivers of conflict of interest were executed by any other respondent.
yuen asserted that the only findings of fact in the procedural order concerned the absence of any evidence of a conflict moreover,although the procedural order also recited that t he parties acknowledged that they had no knowledge of any unresolved conflict or potential conflict of interest,the order on its face showed no respondent was personally present at the prehearing conference.yuen pointed out any acknowledgment regarding a conflict of interest was made by the attorney who purported to represent her,and it was not based on any statement actually made by yuen herself.
order vacating judgment 
the trial court granted the motion to vacate the sister state judgment against yuen,finding she established she was deprived of a fair trial in the arizona proceedings and had a proper defense to the entry of the sister state judgment.the court relied on yuen declaration that she had only minimal involvement with fisc in.more importantly,the court found yuen never had actual notice of the administrative proceedings before the arizona corporations commission and never retained baskin as her attorney or authorized him to represent her.the court was persuaded that yuen was never presented with a written waiver of conflict of interest nor executed such a document.
motion for reconsideration,denial and appeal 
arizona moved for reconsideration,submitting for the first time a copy of yuen deposition taken in the arizona proceeding.the transcript of the deposition disclosed that yuen deposition was taken over the telephone by an attorney from the securities division of the arizona corporation commission the transcript indicated yuen testified from an office in san francisco,and attorney youtz was present in the san francisco office with yuen when her deposition was taken.during the deposition,arizona counsel asked a single question relating to a possible conflict of interest.examining counsel stated and inquired,you are being counseled here today by youtz,who is also representing other persons in this matter.are you aware of the possible conflicts and risks that may arise from multiple representation by an attorney in a matter such as this yuen replied,yes.arizona counsel did not explain what possible conflicts or risks might result from youtz representation of multiple persons,nor did he at any point inform yuen,a nonnative english speaker,that she was being deposed as a party respondent.he simply asked yuen,do you still wish to proceed today with youtz as counsel and yuen ultimately responded,yes.
counsel for arizona argued the deposition showed yuen was aware of the arizona action,which allegedly contradicted her declaration that she did not know of that action.
opposing the motion for reconsideration,yuen argued the evidence had been available to arizona at the time of the original motion,and the deposition in any event was consistent with her declaration and only underscored the attorney unresolved conflict of interest in purporting to represent both yuen and her correspondents without obtaining the proper waiver.yuen submitted a declaration in opposition to the motion for reconsideration,declaring tam told yuen there was a problem with fisc an attorney in arizona wanted to speak to yuen she went to tam san francisco office and was introduced to an attorney for fisc she was told she was required to answer questions for fisc because her name had been associated with fisc and the attorney,who she now understands was youtz,represented her in the deposition as the attorney for fisc.yuen declared that when she answered yes in her deposition to the question about possible conflicts,she did not completely understand what that meant she answered yes because she understood that youtz,as the attorney for fisc,was a proper person to assist me in the deposition.yuen asserted,at no time was it ever explained to me that i was being personally prosecuted in any way or that i needed an attorney to represent me personally.i was only told there was a problem with fisc.yuen reiterated that,after the telephone conference,which she now understood was actually a telephonic deposition,she heard nothing else about the fisc problems until receiving counsel for arizona letter demanding money from me personally,shortly after july.
the trial court denied the motion for reconsideration.the court found arizona had failed to offer sufficient evidence to justify reconsideration and,in any case,yuen deposition was not inconsistent with her declaration and there was no evidence yuen ever executed a conflict of interest waiver form or authorized attorney baskin to represent her in the underlying arizona action.
arizona timely appealed from the orders.
standard of review 
a ruling on a motion to vacate a judgment rests in the sound discretion of the trial court.tsakos shipping trading,juniper garden town homes,th,d tsakos.we will not reverse the exercise of such discretion except when there is clear abuse.ibid.we view all factual matters in the light most favorable to the prevailing party.ibid.
even though contrary findings could have been made,an appellate court should defer to the factual determinations made by the trial court shamblin brattain cal d.moreover,when substantial evidence supports the trial court order,there is no abuse of discretion.in re daniel d.
discussion 
viewing the record in the light most favorable to yuen,we hold the trial court did not abuse its discretion in vacating the judgment and in denying the motion for reconsideration.the court found that yuen had no notice of the arizona administrative proceedings did not retain baskin as her attorney and never signed a written waiver of baskin conflict of interest in representing clients with opposing interests.
denial of due process 
the evidence before the trial court demonstrates yuen was denied procedural due process and a fair trial under the fifth amendment and fourteenth amendment of the united states constitution justifying the order vacating the judgment.
pursuant to code of civil procedure section,a sister state judgment entered by the clerk may be vacated on any ground which would be a defense to an action in this state on the sister state judgment we are satisfied that yuen made the proper showing for relief under this section.
due process requires that notice be reasonably calculated,under all the circumstances,to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.mullane central hanover bank trust.see also mervyn,superior court.further,t he fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.mathews eldridge,d.
under the full faith and credit clause,art.iv,a judgment entered by one state must be recognized by another state if the state of rendition had jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter and all interested parties were given reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard.world wide imports,bartel d,citing durfee duke,d.when jurisdiction over the parties or subject matter is lacking,there is an entire absence of power to hear or determine the case.airlines reporting renda th,d see milliken meyer.because a judgment of a court lacking personal jurisdiction violates due process,it is null and void everywhere,including the state where it was rendered.burnham superior court of california,county of marin,d yu signet th,d.
whether arizona had jurisdiction to render a judgment against yuen was placed in issue in the court below by arizona assertion that full faith and credit must be given to its arizona judgment.in this case,yuen declared she was unaware of the arizona proceedings against her,had no reason to believe her deposition was taken as a party to the proceedings,and was never served as a party to the arizona proceedings.arizona asserts that the procedural order issued by the arizona corporation commission is res judicata,the order determi
