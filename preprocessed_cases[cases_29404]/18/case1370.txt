in this action for breach of contract,misrepresentation,and related causes of action against respondent thomas chen and seven corporations,the superior court granted summary judgment to chen.zoran contends that chen was the alter ego of the corporate defendants and was therefore liable for the outstanding debts those defendants owed for their purchases of parts from zoran.zoran further contends that chen personally guaranteed payment of those debts.we find triable issues of fact and therefore must reverse the judgment.
background 
plaintiff zoran is in the business of developing digital technologies and applications for home and office applications.zoran sells various equipment components to manufacturers,which incorporate the components into their products.among those who obtained zoran products in and were kent world,kent world protop innotech cyberhome electronics,cyberhome argus electronics,in taiwan argus taiwan argus electronics,in the united states argus usa,a wholly owned subsidiary of argus taiwan citron electronic company citron and iwin international iwin,an affiliate of cyberhome.citron had been formed for the purpose of investing in the chinese factory han hua optics,which manufactured dvd players.argus usa performed customer support for cyberhome and some product development and testing.kent world,cyberhome,and protop innotech merged in their replacement entity was protop technology protop technology or protop.
according to zoran second amended complaint,three world,iwin,and purchase orders to zoran during the period.iwin was a paper entity,which bought three million parts from zoran toward the end of and sold the parts to citron.the zoran products ordered by all three companies were shipped directly to citron.citron assembled the components at its han hua factory and sold the finished goods to protop,which then sold the products to cyberhome.cyberhome marketed those products in the united states.protop product development engineers were housed at the han hua factory.
chen was one of three or four directors of cyberhome in and and one of five directors of kent world until the merger.he was one of the directors of argus taiwan from to and its chairperson until.he was chairman of protop innotech and of protop technology after the merger.according to his declaration,chen did not own stock in any of the defendants except protop and argus taiwan.his wife and younger sister,however,owned minority shares in cyberhome and argus taiwan that sister owned a minority share in kent world as well.chen older brother also owned a minority share in argus taiwan,as did his older sister and her husband.
through may of,zoran extended more than of credit to kent world,citron,and iwin.in september citron promised to be responsible for the debt of kent world,which it represented to be its subsidiary.in december cyberhome represented iwin to be its affiliate and guaranteed payment of iwin obligations to zoran.in february cyberhome similarly guaranteed payment to zoran for chipsets citron would purchase from zoran.on march,chen wrote to zoran to guarantee payment of citron balance in the amount of.citron apparently paid that debt without the necessity of chen further involvement.
in january,zoran and cyberhome entered into a consolidation agreement combining the prior financing obligations of the debtor companies.although all were denoted as in the agreement,only tin wu,president of cyberhome,signed the document as a.
according to zoran,remained unpaid.zoran filed suit in may,naming only chen and argus taiwan as defendants.the second amended complaint,filed in august,named chen,argus taiwan,argus usa,cyberhome,iwin,citron,and kent world.the complaint was later amended to substitute protop technology for one of the doe defendants.zoran pleaded causes of action for breach of contract,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,negligent and intentional misrepresentation,quantum meruit,unjust enrichment,promissory estoppel,and common counts for money due.the sixth cause of action was directed only at chen it alleged breach of his oral personal guaranties of payment on behalf of the argus group companies.
a central theory of the complaint was that chen represented that he directly controlled and dominated the defendant companies,and that for each of them there was a unity of interest and ownership such that any individuality and separateness between chen and the company had ceased and the company was the alter ego of chen.with reference to each,zoran alleged that adherence to the fiction of the entity as distinct from chen would permit an abuse of the corporate privilege and would sanction fraud in the form of chen misrepresentations made on behalf of himself and the entity,which fraud resulted in substantial damage to zoran.
only chen remains in the action.cyberhome declared bankruptcy in september,and the bankruptcy trustee eventually paid zoran in the case against it.in december the court entered defaults against iwin and citron,and it entered protop default on september,after striking protop untimely answer.argus taiwan and argus usa were ordered to pay terminating sanctions for discovery abuses,and their defaults were entered in april.
chen moved for summary judgment or alternatively,summary adjudication.he maintained that he was not liable under any of the causes of action because he had made only one written contractual promise,which he performed he did not make any misrepresentations or enforceable promises on which zoran relied and he did not order or receive any goods from zoran.chen further asserted that he was not the alter ego of kent world,citron,iwin,cyberhome,argus taiwan,or argus usa.finally,chen claimed an affirmative defense to the allegation of breach of oral guaranty based on the consolidation agreement,which chen had not signed and which modified all of the obligations underlying the alleged guaranty.
the trial court considered the moving and opposing papers and both parties evidentiary objections.the court determined that chen had met his initial burden to show that he was not an alter ego of any of the defendant entities,that he had not received goods or services from zoran,and that he had negated at least one element of the causes of action for misrepresentation and promissory estoppel.further,the court ruled,because zoran had not met its burden of raising a triable issue of fact on any of the causes of action,chen was entitled to summary judgment.from the ensuing judgment on june,zoran brought this timely appeal.

scope and standard of review 
the purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties pleadings in order to determine whether,despite their allegations,trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,aguilar.summary judgment is appropriate if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.

allegations of the complaint 
because summary judgment review is defined by the issues raised in the pleadings,we first direct our attention to the material allegations of zoran second amended complaint.zoran alleged that chen had initiated the business relationship between zoran and each of the companies he controlled.when he asked zoran to do business with iwin,zoran was concerned because each of the other companies had overdue balances on their accounts.but chen allegedly assured zoran that he controlled argus taiwan,which controlled iwin,and he would make certain that all such payments were made.subsequently cyberhome,which zoran alleged to be one of the argus group companies,guaranteed iwin payment as cyberhome affiliate.when the debt of iwin and citron where the parts were shipped became,zoran sought additional assurances from cyberhome,which guaranteed payment of citron obligations in february.chen,however,had already instructed some of the companies to wire payments to a taiwan account he controlled.he continued to direct them to do so thereafter,and at least one did.chen,however,refused to forward the payments to zoran.
the complaint attached the march,letter from chen to zoran guaranteeing payment of citron balance in a total amount of.zoran alleged that this letter,along with chen oral representations,induced zoran to continue to extend credit to the defendant companies.a substantial balance continued to accrue,however,and in june chen orally promised that he would personally take care of the matter and make certain that the entire amount owed by the argus group companies to zoran was paid.
on september,tin wu,president of cyberhome,sent zoran an setting forth the payment schedule accounting for million in payments between september and november.on december,and again in january,chen acknowledged the entire outstanding balance owed to zoran and promised zoran that he could and would make certain that it was paid in full.however,chen never intended to fulfill those promises and representations.on january,chen discussed consolidating the debt.on behalf of himself and the defendant companies,chen agreed to the terms of the consolidation agreement,which made chen and all of the companies jointly and severally liable for the entire debt owed to zoran.by this time the companies debt to zoran was at least.chen represented that he would sign the document,but he failed to fulfill that promise or procure the signatures of any other company representative except tin wu of cyberhome.zoran received only two payments after the date of the consolidation on january for and one on march for.the complaint alleged a total amount due of at least.
the causes of action for breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing are based on citron guaranty of the kent world debt,the cyberhome guaranty of the citron and iwin debts,and the debt incurred by cyberhome in the consolidation agreement.the specific allegation against chen is that he breached the chen guarantee re citron by not paying all amounts owed by citron,including the amounts incurred by kent world.
the misrepresentation and promissory estoppel causes of action were based on the assurances of all the defendants,and specifically chen,that the debts would be paid,which lulled zoran into a false sense of security and induced it to continue doing business with the companies and to forbear taking action to collect the amounts due.these representations were also included in the quantum meruit claim,to supplement the allegation that the defendant companies had benefited from the goods for which they had not paid.as neither chen nor the companies paid for the goods,defendants were unjustly enriched and were liable on open book accounts.
finally,the cause of action for breach of oral guaranty alleged against chen alone was based on the alleged series of oral personal guaranties,the promise to enter into the consolidation agreement,and a promise to personally guarant ee the amount due under the consolidation agreement.thus,chen as well as the defendant companies were alleged to be obligated to pay the full claimed as consequential damages.
chen showing 
chen summary judgment motion was premised on the lack of admissible evidence of any contract beyond the march,guaranty of an obligation that had been satisfied in full any representation that he would personally pay the debts of the others any reliance by zoran on any statement or promise chen had allegedly made or chen receipt of any goods or other enrichment by zoran.chen further asserted that the consolidation agreement superseded the prior financing arrangements and thus discharged any oral promises chen might have made regarding the prior debts.addressing zoran alter ego claim,chen argued that zoran was unable to rebut the presumption that each corporate defendant was a separate entity.
taking this approach required chen to support his motion with evidence that zoran did not possess,and could not reasonably obtain,the necessary evidence to show that chen had personally promised to be responsible for paying the defendant entities debts or that he was liable as their alter ego.it was not enough simply to assert that zoran had no evidence supporting an element of each cause of action a moving defendant must indeed present evidence,such as affidavits,declarations,admissions,answers to interrogatories,depositions,and matters of which judicial notice must or may be taken.aguilar,supra,cal th at.
chen produced his march,letter guaranteeing payment of citron debt to zoran.zoran admitted in discovery that this obligation had been paid in full,and that chen had not signed the consolidation agreement or any other written promise to pay the defendant companies debts to zoran.in his supporting declaration chen stated that he had never orally agreed to guarantee payment of those obligations.
this evidence did show that chen was not directly liable for breach of contract,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,or breach of an oral guaranty.but the gravamen of the two contract claims was that kent world,iwin,citron,and cyberhome had breached their obligations to zoran and that each defendant company was the alter ego of chen.the only causes of action identifying specific acts by chen were breach of an oral guaranty and the two misrepresentation claims.as noted above,chen presented affirmative evidence that he had made no written or oral promises to be responsible for the defendant companies obligations,with the sole exception of the march,guaranty.on appeal chen also points to the deposition testimony of karl schneider,zoran chief financial officer,who admitted that he had not documented chen repeated oral assurances that he would see that zoran was paid.chen adds that such assurances were nothing more than his opinions about the future conduct of third parties.schneider did not describe a prediction,however,but reported at least to telephone conversations in which chen had assured him that he would see that the zoran debts got paid.
chen also states that zoran never alleged that chen would pay zoran if one of the defendant companies failed to meet its obligation.the cause of action for breach of oral guaranty,however,clearly makes that allegation.chen further point that zoran never proved that chen orally said he would pay zoran if one of the purchasers did not pay is irrelevant,since zoran was not obligated to prove anything at this stage of the litigation.
nevertheless,chen evidence does demonstrate that chen did not expressly promise to be personally liable for the defendant companies obligations to zoran.in its opposition zoran did not state otherwise instead,it maintained that chen oral assurances that he would make certain zoran was paid if the entities failed to pay made chen the principal debtor and the companies his sureties.schneider deposition testimony supports that assertion he stated that chen told him during the to phone conversations that he would see that the other defendants paid zoran for their past purchases.the most direct expression of responsibility occurred on august,when chen told levy gertzberg,zoran chief executive officer,leave it to me,i will take care of it.i am responsible for this,i will take care of it,do have to worry,trust me,i will take care of it.
as chen notes in part,a surety obligation must be accompanied by separate consideration unless contemporaneous with the original obligation,and it must be in writing,subject to the exceptions for original obligations listed in civil code section.zoran replies that no writing was necessary to make his oral guaranties enforceable,because they were made contemporaneously with each order chen placed with zoran through one of his entities.invoking subdivision of civil code section,zoran contends that chen gained a business advantage from each of these transactions,through earning income for his entities,and therefore himself.
the limited record before us indicates,however,that in the conversations reported by gertzberg and schneider,the parties were discussing past debts of the companies,not future orders.it does not appear that zoran relied on the cited assurances to enter into any new transactions with the defendant companies.to the point that chen was liable for existing debts from their inception,the success of zoran position depends on the viability of its alter ego theory.we therefore turn to that issue.
zoran theory is the primary basis on which zoran premises chen liability,not only in its pleadings but in its opposition papers below and its argument on appeal.rather than contest chen initial showing,zoran argues that it met its subsequent burden to raise a triable issue of fact based on chen domination and control of at least cyberhome,iwin,and citron

in this case the trial court first determined that chen had introduced admissible evidence showing that he was not the alter ego of any of the defendant companies.zoran opposition,on the other hand,had not raised a reasonable inference to the contrary.in the court view,zoran evidence showed that chen influenced and controlled some of the entity defendants in the manner a chairman would typically influence and control a closely knit group of corporations.however,it does not show that chen controlled the entity defendan
