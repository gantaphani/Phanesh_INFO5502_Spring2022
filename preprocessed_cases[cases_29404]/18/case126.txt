medical air technology appeals a judgment rendered after a bench trial involving a closely held corporation financial travails and allegations of fiduciary violations by one of its investors.the plaintiff medical air,the closely held corporation,presents two claims of error that the district court applied the wrong legal standard for a shareholder fiduciary duty to a closely held corporation and that the district court judge improperly found that medical air had waived its right to a jury trial against all of the defendants,and not just one of the defendants.we affirm the district court judgment,because the defendants were not in breach of any fiduciary duties owed,and because there was no evidence that the defendants actions caused the harm that medical air suffered.the reasoning we use in affirming that judgment renders medical air claim,if any,to a jury trial irrelevant and disposes of all claims in the case.
medical air is a closely held corporation,incorporated in,which sold air purification equipment to medical facilities.in search of financing,medical air executed an agreement in january with multifinance holding company mfh.mfh used two related holding companies,marwan investment and marwani holding company,to structure the deal.kalil philip rahbany was the president of mfh and an agent of marwan investment and marwani holding.
the agreement resulted in a total of million in funding for medical air a loan from marwan investment and a purchase of preferred stock by marwani holding.medical air signed an investment and stockholders agreement,a secured promissory note for the loan,and a security agreement.it also amended its articles of organization.the security agreement was executed by medical air and marwan investment only and served to secure the loan from marwan investment.it contained a jury waiver,which provided that 
grantor medical air and marwan hereby waive their respective rights to a jury trial of any claim or cause of action based upon or arising out of this security agreement,the investment and stockholders agreement or any other agreement evidencing,securing,or otherwise executed in connection with any obligations.
the security agreement defines obligations as 
any and all indebtedness,obligations,agreements and liabilities of either grantor to marwan including,without limitation,all indebtedness and obligations of grantor under the investment and stockholders agreement,the notes executed pursuant thereto,and any other indebtedness,obligations,agreements and liabilities of grantor to marwan of every kind and description,direct or indirect,absolute or contingent,due or to become due,regardless of how they arose or were acquired,now existing or hereafter arising.
mfh and medical air also entered into a consulting agreement,under which mfh would provide specified consulting services to medical air for the fee of a month.medical air president,frank paradise,took the lead in negotiating the deal.medical air was represented by counsel in the negotiations and the drafting of the investment agreements,as were the defendants.
within a few months,the relationship had soured.in may,medical air failed to meet the minimum net worth and net working capital requirements to which it had agreed in the investment and stockholders agreement.the investment and stockholders agreement specified that if medical air defaulted on these terms,then marwan investment could accelerate the loan,making it immediately payable,and marwani holding could immediately seek to redeem its stock.if medical air failed to redeem the stock within six months,under the amended articles of organization,its board of directors would double in size plus one,and marwani holding could appoint the new board members.thus,if the stock was not redeemed after default,control of medical air would shift to marwani holding.
medical air attempted to obtain the defendants permission to issue additional stock in the hope that increased funding would allow it to expand its production capacity to take advantage of some inchoate sales opportunities.the defendants opposed this plan,fearing it would dilute their interest in the company.medical air then presented the defendants with the possibility of a by an outside investor,but the defendants were not interested.
instead,between july and august,the defendants sent three separate notices of default to medical air and threatened litigation.efforts were made to restructure the business,but these were unsuccessful.in the august notice,marwan investment exercised its right to demand acceleration of the loan and,the following month,marwani holding requested that medical air redeem its stock.in response,medical air began to look for a new investor to buy out the defendants.during this time,the defendants chose not to exercise their security rights against medical air,waiting to see if medical air could secure new funding.the parties agree that,by the fall of,medical air was out of money to fill orders and,to put it mildly,not doing well.
a company called nortek,expressed some interest in a merger with medical air.on november,nortek and medical air signed a letter of intent,which proposed that medical air shareholders would receive shares of nortek common stock,worth about seven to ten million dollars.nortek reserved decision on a final purchase price for medical air until it saw whether medical air could meet its sales projections for the fourth quarter of.medical air quickly scheduled a shareholders meeting for january.notices of the meeting and proxy were sent to medical air shareholders on december.
on november,after receiving nortek letter of intent,rahbany requested from medical air the due diligence material provided to nortek.under the investment and shareholders agreement,marwani was entitled to receive any reasonably requested information within five business days.rahbany says he was particularly interested in any financial forecasts medical air had made,because he wanted to assess whether nortek interest in medical air had a realistic basis.this concern was not unfounded at trial,medical air financial adviser testified that he warned medical air that,once nortek had seen the due diligence materials,it would attempt to negotiate a lower purchase price.
rahbany says he repeatedly requested the information over two months,but never received copies of what had been provided to nortek.medical air,in turn,was reluctant to produce the documents because corporate officials felt that the defendants were going fishing for evidence for their litigation in the default suit.medical air also asked the defendants to identify the specific items they wanted,and the reasons for each.the defendants refused,and reiterated their request for all the due diligence documents.at medical air request,the defendants signed a agreement,agreeing not to disclose any information about the proposed merger.
medical air says that it supplied rahbany with the information that it judged to be necessary for rahbany review of the proposed deal,including a listing of the due diligence materials but not the materials themselves.medical air ceo testified that he did not recall if he ever supplied the defendants with the fourth quarter sales projections provided to nortek.medical air financial adviser who worked on the merger deal testified that he never provided the defendants with the due diligence materials.
on december,medical air sent a draft merger agreement and certain other draft documents to shareholders for review.the defendants say that they were not able to assess the deal in part because the terms,including the purchase price,had not been finalized at that time.according to the medical air attorney who worked on the deal,merger terms are never final until the closing,and it is customary for shareholder votes to take place before the merger documents are finalized.the defendants also say that they were unable to assess the viability of the deal because medical air fourth quarter financial results were not yet available.the defendants had certain other problems with the draft documents the draft merger agreement stated that marwan investment loan would be repaid at the original interest rate,rather than the default interest rate triggered by medical air may default a difference of less than the shares that marwani holding would receive in the proposed merger would not be immediately saleable and a portion of the shares would be subject to loss if the warranties that medical air made in the merger proved to be false.finally,the draft merger failed to give marwani holding preferred shareholder rights,although medical air amended articles of organization stated that any merger would make appropriate provisions to provide the same privileges to preferred stockholders as nearly as may be,with respect to any shares of stock or securities received in a merger.
five days before the scheduled vote,the parties met to discuss the proposed merger.at that meeting,the defendants asked for five pieces of information a statement from nortek that due diligence was satisfactory a patent assignment release an explanation of how the default loan interest rate would be dealt with a copy of the november financial statements and a valuation of the company.medical air says it provided the november financial statements and a valuation of the defendants stock under the proposed merger plan between and million to the defendants counsel on the following day.rahbany says he was not given sufficient information to determine if that valuation was a credible number,and says that he never received the november financial statements.at that time,the december financial statements were not yet ready.rahbany admitted at trial that he never reviewed the public records of nortek to try to assess the basis for nortek interest in medical air.
medical air failed to meet its fourth quarter projections it had projected sales of for the quarter,but realized only.medical air blames this failure on its problems with the defendants,which it said were distracting its principal officers from business and demoralizing its sales force.
a day or two before the vote,medical air president,frank paradise,was told by an associate of his that marwani planned to vote against the deal.medical air says that,as a result of learning that marwani intended to vote against the deal,it reopened negotiations with nortek on the day before the scheduled vote.the memory of nortek representative was that the negotiations were reopened because medical air had failed to meet its fourth quarter projections.
at the january vote,marwani holding voted against the merger.all other shareholders voted for the merger.marwani holding,holding almost of the shares,was able to defeat the merger because nortek,as part of the proposed merger agreement,had required a minimum of stockholder agreement.still,the terms of the investment and stockholders agreement appeared to allow medical air to proceed with a merger without the defendants approval if the medical air board of directors certified that the purchase price met a certain qualifying price defined in the agreement.this was never done rahbany testified that he voted against the merger because 
i wanted at the same time to know how viable,to find the basis,because i had a fiduciary responsibility to cast a vote,and i had to have a reasonable basis for my action.and when you do know what you doing,you do do anything.
he also testified that he voted against the deal because he did not think that the deal was viable.he admitted that one of the purposes of his vote was to advance the purposes of marwan investment,but stated that he had in mind the multiple entities that he represented all the time and also the separateness all the time.after the shareholders meeting,marwani attorney,who tendered the proxy vote,told medical air attorney that the medical air principals would make a lot of money from the proposed merger,while rahbany was coming up short.
medical air and nortek continued negotiations,and later in january nortek signed a second letter of intent offering shares,while providing that the purchase price would not exceed million.the defendants,for their part,continued to request more information.the merger ultimately did not go through,and medical air blames this on the legal problems caused by the defendants.medical air does not argue,however,that the defendants violated any fiduciary duty with respect to their actions following the january vote.
in april,medical air filed a diversity suit in the district of massachusetts,seeking a declaration that it was not in default to the defendants,an injunction against the sale of its assets,and damages for breach of contract,negligence and other claims based on marwani holding vote against the merger.on january,the district court found that,as of may,medical air was in default of its responsibilities under the investment and stockholders agreement,and permitted marwan investment to sell medical air assets.medical air tech.marwan.medical air does not appeal this judgment.
the defendants did not immediately enforce their security rights against medical air they say they were waiting to see if medical air could find a way to pull itself out of its financial hole.in august,marwan investment began foreclosure proceedings against medical air.at public auction in november,marwan investment bought all of medical air remaining assets with a credit bid of.marwan says medical air still owed a debt of to marwan on the loan.the defendants then moved for a dismissal of medical air case,arguing that their foreclosure purchase had included medical air rights in this case.the district court denied that motion on june.it also denied a motion by medical air shareholders to intervene.
on august,the defendants filed a motion to strike medical air jury demand.on january,the court heard argument on the jury waiver issue.medical air counsel argued that when medical air signed the security agreement it did not understand that it was waiving jury trial,but he conceded that the security agreement effected a valid waiver of the right to jury with respect to marwan investment.nonetheless,he argued that medical air had not waived jury trial for any of the other defendants.the district court judge expressed concern about the feasibility of having a bench trial for one defendant and a simultaneous jury trial for the others.the defendants argued that the plaintiff had presented a claim under.ch,which could not be considered by a jury,and so the judge would have to make findings that would be the mirror findings of the jury findings.the court did not conduct an evidentiary hearing none had been requested,but both parties had submitted affidavits.the court allowed the motion to strike the jury demand without issuing a written order explaining the basis for its decision.however,it appears that the trial judge believed that,in a case arising out of a single transaction and presenting claims against multiple defendants,a waiver against one was a waiver against all 
after the court ruled on the defendants summary judgment motion,three of medical air claims remained for trial breach of contract and of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing as to mfh and marwani holding breach of fiduciary duty as to marwani holding and tortious interference with contractual and business relations as to all the defendants.
at the conclusion of the four day bench trial,the district court ruled for the defendants on each of medical air remaining claims and entered judgment in the amount of,plus interest,for marwan investment on its counterclaim based on medical air default of the investment agreement.it also ruled for the plaintiff on the defendants good faith counterclaim.med.air tech.marwan.
on appeal to this court,medical air primarily challenges two of the district court rulings its order dismissing the jury demand,and its ruling that marwani holding was not in breach of its fiduciary duty as a stockholder.the defendants defend the court rulings on the grounds given by the district court.they also argue,in the alternative,that the district court judgment should be upheld because marwan investment became the assignee of medical air right to pursue this case when it bought all medical air assets in foreclosure.
jury trial 
medical air argues that the trial judge erred in granting the defendants motion to strike medical air jury demand as to its claims against rahbany,mfh,and marwani holding,because only marwan investment was party to the security agreement which contained the jury waiver.
the confusion on this issue evident in the record leads us to review basic principles.there is a presumption against denying a jury trial based on waiver,and waivers must be strictly construed aetna ins.kennedy ex rel.bogash.a s the right of jury trial is fundamental,courts indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver.paracor,capital,cir.in a diversity jurisdiction suit,the enforcement of a jury waiver is a question of federal,not state,law.see simler conner,d.
in general,a contractual waiver binds only the parties who sign the contract.see eeoc waffle house,d it goes without saying that a contract can not bind a nonparty.in waffle house,the supreme court held that the eeoc was not bound by an contractual arbitration agreement,reasoning that a bsent some ambiguity in the agreement,it is the language of the contract that defines the scope of disputes subject to arbitration,and therefore even the federal policy favoring arbitration does not authorize a court to compel arbitration by any parties that are not already covered in the agreement.id.at.
there are some exceptions to this rule.for instance,some courts have applied a theory of equitable estoppel for suits against arising out of the contract itself,reasoning that the party seeking the benefit of a contract could not refuse to be bound by a clause contained within it,grigson creative artists agency,cir,cert.denied,d ms dealer serv.franklin,cir hughes masonry greater clark county sch,cir.
in general,though,we look to the plain language of the contract jury waiver to determine whether it unambiguously covers the claims asserted.in cases where the contractual language is ambiguous,simultaneously executed documents may be relevant as a matter of contractual interpretation.in massachusetts,if the parties execute two or more documents,with a manifested intent that the documents together express their entire agreement,a court reads the documents together,rather than construing each as if it stood alone.donoghue ibc usa publ ns,cir see also fdic singh,cir chase commercial owen,paracor,at holding that this is a principle of interpretation which does not mean that contemporaneously executed documents somehow become a single unified contract binding all signatories to all provisions.
even once it is determined that a contractual jury waiver clause does encompass the asserted claims,courts will not enforce the jury waiver unless it was entered into knowingly and voluntarily.see seaboard lumber united states,telum,hutton credit,cir jury waiver may not be fraudulently induced irving tr,cir.in cases such as this,where the jury waiver was part of a separate contract,signed only by certain parties to the larger transaction,parties seeking enforcement of the waiver may have a more difficult task in showing that the waiver was voluntary and knowing.this is,however,a inquiry see smart gillette.disability plan,cir.
medical air has conceded that it made a valid jury waiver with regards to all claims against marwan investment.the record is sparse as to the basis for the trial court ruling.we do not,though,need to decide the issue.as we hold below,no reasonable jury could find liability for breach of fiduciary duty against marwani holding nor a causal link between marwani holding vote at the january board meeting and the failure of the proposed merger with nortek.
because the core ruling is correct and none of medical air claims could survive a motion for judgment as a matter of law,the jury waiver question is no longer viable.see segrets gillman knitwear,cir in re cases,cir.see generally wright miller,federal practice and procedure ed.supp collecting cases.
fiduciary duty 
alleged breach of duty 
under massachusetts law,shareholders in a close corporation owe a fiduciary duty of utmost good faith and loyalty.zimmerman bogoff,quoting donahue rodd electrotype of new england,internal quotation marks omitted.this is a higher standard than a simple good faith and inherent fairness standard.donahue,at.the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc has articulated a test for determining if this fiduciary duty has been violated.first,the defendant must show a legitimate business purpose for its action that allegedly is a breach.if the defendant makes such a showing,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that the proffered legitimate objective could have been achieved through a less harmful,reasonably practicable,alternative mode of action.zimmerman,at.then the court must weigh the legitimate business purpose,if any,against the practicability of a less harmful alternative.wilkes springside nursing home.in applying this test,courts must be sure not to unduly hamper effectiveness in managing the corporation in the best interests of all concerned.id.moreover,mere errors of judgment do not constitute a fiduciary breach.spiegel beacon participations.
donahue itself involved an attempt by majority stockholders to freeze out minority shareholders.at.see generally peter rosenblum,corporate fiduciary duties in massachusetts and delaware,in how to incorporate and counsel a business massachusetts continuing legal education.by contrast,this case involves actions by minority shareholders.massachusetts law is clear that minority shareholders in close corporations also have fiduciary responsibilities.see chesterton chesterton,cir zimmerman,at donahue,at smith atl.chesterton and smith involved situations in which unilateral action by minority shareholders would result in dire tax consequences to the majority shareholders.see chesterton,at smith,at.further,because the financial obligations were owed to the government,there was no market mechanism to determine the consequences of the action.in that sense,the minority shareholders had effective control over one aspect of corporate finances.here,by contrast,the defendants did not inherently have effective control.their was needed only because the outside purchasers set as a condition of sale that of the shareholders approve the merger.the donahue rule itself involves a balancing of legitimate interests,and the scope of the duties owed may depend,in part,on context.see zimmerman,at t he donahue remedy is not intended to place a strait jacket on legitimate corporate activity.
the district court here found that l acking th e information concerning the basis for the merger,the final terms of the merger,or the price that would be paid,marwani certainly had a legitimate business reason for voting against the merger and,further,that medical air refusal to provide the requested information left marwani with no choice but to vote against merger.the district court then found that the only alternative advanced by medical air was for marwani simply to vote for the nortek merger,an alternative that totally failed to address the problems with the deal itself.this showing does not meet the plaintiff burden.
medical air argues that the district judge improperly construed the massachusetts law governing fiduciary duty in closely held relationships by holding that marwani holding own business interests could be a proper motivating factor for the vote.it argues that marwani vote against the merger was not motivated by legitimate business interests,saying that the vote was really motivated by the defendants own,that marwani wanted more of the proceeds of the merger to go to marwan,rather than the medical air principals.it says that marwani vote against the merger was intended to pave the way for marwan foreclosure of medical air assets,given that medical air financial situation was so desperate in january that the merger was the only way to salvage the business.medical air relies heavily on rahbany testimony admitting that he did take marwan investment and marwani holding interests into consideration in his decision.it also relies on the statement that marwani holding counsel allegedly made after the january vote,complaining that
