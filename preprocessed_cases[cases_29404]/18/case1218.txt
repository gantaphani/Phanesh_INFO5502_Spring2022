in,american home products ahp,sold a subsidiary,for a capital gain of more than million.just before the sale,merrill lynch approached ahp with an investment plan which would enable ahp to claim paper tax losses of a comparable amount,while generating only about million in actual losses.ahp was one of several fortune companies that merrill approached with this idea,and this is the third case before us involving this particular type of scheme.see saba comm r,asa investerings comm r.following merrill lynch proposal,ahp formed boca investerings partnership with another ahp subsidiary and two foreign corporations.after completing the transactions proposed by merrill lynch,ahp filed tax returns which reflected the losses offsetting its capital gains for.after the internal revenue service challenged these returns,ahp filed a complaint in the district court contesting the commissioner of internal revenue proposed adjustments to its partnership returns,and on october,the district court issued an opinion rejecting the commissioner adjustments,and entering judgment in favor of boca.see boca investerings united states,d.we reverse the district court decision as inconsistent with asa investerings.this case is remanded to the district court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
we explored this merrill tax shelter and the regulation on which it depends at significant length in our opinion in asa investerings,at,and therefore will not belabor the details here.the plan proposed by merrill lynch to alliedsignal,the domestic corporation involved in the asa partnership,was virtually identical to the one merrill proposed to ahp in the case before us now.the plan requires the formation of a partnership between a united states corporation and a foreign corporation not subject to united states tax,combined with a series of investment transactions that exploit the terms of temp.reg.c i.that regulation provides a tax accounting rule for contingent installment sales.an installment sale is defined in the code as a disposition of property where at least payment is to be received after the close of the taxable year in which the disposition occurs.b.a contingent installment sale is one where the total purchase price is unknown at the time of the transaction.because the total price is unknown,the total gain on the sale is likewise unknown.the regulation supplies a general rule of ratable basis recovery for situations where a seller at least knows the maximum period over which the purchase price will be paid.the partnership formed between the domestic entities and the foreign entities takes advantage of this regulation by first buying,then immediately selling a debt instrument on an installment basis.
as we noted in our opinion in saba partnership,which also considered this regulation and another virtually identical series of transactions,a lthough the transaction is basically a wash,generating hardly any economic gain or loss,merrill lynch lawyers interpretation of the relevant provisions allows the partnership to claim a massive tax gain,which is allocated to the foreign partner,and a massive tax loss,which the corporation keeps for itself.at.this sentence essentially describes the transactions in which ahp its subsidiary and its foreign partners,syringa and addiscombe,engaged after forming the boca partnership.the massive loss ahp was able to claim for tax purposes was then used to offset the tax gain it realized from the sale of its subsidiary.
the facts in this case are substantially similar to those in asa investerings and saba partnership.in,merrill lynch representatives approached ahp,as it had also approached alliedsignal and brunswick,other fortune companies,with the idea for this scheme to shelter large capital gains.after meeting with the representatives,thomas nee,ahp for taxes prepared a memorandum for ahp chairman and chief executive officer,john stafford,entitled,tax planning re sale of.this memo outlined the proposal as follows,in pertinent part.
formation of partnership 
the partnership would be formed in a favorable tax jurisdiction such as the netherlands,antilles under the new york general partnership law.the members of the partnership would be ahpc,one of its domestic subsidiaries henceforth referred to as ahpc and an unrelated foreign financial institution xyz.ahpc will contribute cash of million representing a ownership and xyz will contribute million.under the partnership agreement,all the income,gain,expense and loss of the partnership will be allocated among the members in proportion to their capital accounts.
purchase of corporate bonds 
i nvest billion in corporate bonds 
installment sale 
the partnership will sell the bonds to a financial institution in exchange for million in cash and million at fair market value,five year libor installment notes.
increase of ahpc partnership interest 
following step,ahpc will purchase a interest in the partnership from xyz for million in cash bringing its total interest to and xyz interest down.
contribution of assets to partnership 
ahpc will thereupon contribute assets with a fair market value of million to the partnership further increasing its partnership interest to.
partial redemption of partnership interest 
the partnership will distribute million fair market value installment note to ahpc and million in cash to xyz.
sale of installment note 
million in cash resulting in a million in capital loss 
the memo also noted that,w e believe that the above transaction is technically sound.we expect it would be vigorously attacked by the irs.merrill lynch is requesting a fee of million.their contribution is significant in that they identify xyz,arrange for purchase of the corporate assets bonds and locate a buyer for the installment notes.
ahp decided to accept merrill lynch proposal and the transaction took form by precisely following the steps laid out in nee memo.boca investerings,d at.on april,the boca partnership was formed between partners ahp another ahp subsidiary and two netherlands antilles special purpose corporations,addiscombe and syringa,with initial partner contributions mirroring those anticipated in the memo.id.merrill lynch received a million fee for structuring the transaction.on may and,boca purchased billion of private placement notes ppns from two japanese banks and pepsico.boca investerings,d at.a week after boca made the purchases,merrill lynch began arranging for the sale of the ppns.during one week in late may,boca sold over billion of the ppns for million in cash,and indefinite debt instruments known as libor london interbank offering rate notes.boca investerings,d at.the district court found that this sale generated transaction costs of million,which was ultimately borne by ahp,id.at,and that boca received less than million in interest on its billion investment in the ppns,id.at.
on its partnership tax return,boca treated the sale as an installment sale under b.id.at.boca reported a capital gain of over million from the transaction,calculated by subtracting the basis from the million in cash generated by the sale of the ppns.id.ten percent of the gain was allocated to ahp and its domestic subsidiary,while the remaining ninety percent was allocated to the foreign partners,who were not subject to tax on the gain.id.abn,a netherlands bank which controlled the two foreign partnerships,id.at,and was also involved in the saba partnership and asa investerings transactions,see saba,at asa investerings,at,entered into swaps with addiscombe,syringa and merrill lynch to hedge the risk on the libor notes.boca investerings,d at.
on july,the parties agreed that ahp would purchase approximately of syringa interest in boca at a million premium.boca investerings,d at.this transaction left the foreign partners with approximately a ownership interest in boca.id.at.in august,boca distributed million in cash to the foreign partners and nearly million in libor notes to the ahp partners.id.at.in september and october,boca redeemed more of the foreign partners interest,resulting in an ownership interest for the ahp partners.id.at.in november,the ahp partners sold the libor notes bo
