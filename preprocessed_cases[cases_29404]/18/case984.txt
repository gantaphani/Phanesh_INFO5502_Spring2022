barbara bauman and other argentinian residents filed a lawsuit under the alien tort claims act against daimlerchrysler ag for human rights violations allegedly committed by mercedes benz argentina,its subsidiary,in argentina during the military regime.daimlerchrysler ag filed a successful rule b motion,the lawsuit was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction,and this appeal ensued.we affirm.
statement of facts and procedural history 
appellants are argentinian citizens and who allege,inter alia,that they or their family members were kidnapped,detained,or tortured by argentinian state security forces acting at the direction of their former employer,mercedes benz argentina mba.appellants allege that during the military regime that governed argentina from to,mba officials maintained close ties with members of the military,and utilized these forces to rid its plant of individuals mba itself viewed as subversive.
in,appellants filed a complaint in the district court for the northern district of california against daimlerchrysler ag dcag,mba parent company,requesting relief.in april,dcag filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction in california.
dcag is a german stock company with its principal seat in stuttgart,germany.mercedes benz usa,llc mbusa is a delaware limited liability company with its principal place of business in new jersey.mbusa is a subsidiary of the daimerchrysler north america holding corporation,a holding company,which,in turn,is a subsidiary of dcag.mbusa has two offices in california,and it is undisputed that mbusa is subject to general jurisdiction in the state.
dcag manufactures mercedes benz motor vehicles and related component parts.mbusa is not involved in the design or production of the vehicles.rather,mbusa is responsible for the marketing and distribution of the vehicles in california,in addition to providing service and sales support.dcag sells its vehicles,manufactured in germany,to mbusa in germany,where title passes.
between and,an independent distributor named max hoffman was the sole distributor of mercedes benz vehicles in the united states.in,hoffman was replaced by an independent subsidiary of the corporation.in,that company went out of business,and distribution was subsequently undertaken by the to mbusa.
according to the of dcag,dcag could not distribute vehicles in california without revising its business model,employing a considerable number of individuals,making massive investments in new facilities,and incurring significant tax exposure.dcag also presented evidence that the most profitable toyota distributor in the united states,southeast toyota distributors,is a wholly independent,nonsubsidiary distributor.
the relationship is governed by a general distributor agreement the agreement.under the agreement,both parties agree upon objectives to be reached by mbusa prior to each sales period.either company may terminate the agreement for good cause and with notice to the other party.in the event of termination,all amounts owed by either party would be immediately due,and dcag would be required to repurchase all vehicles and parts.
dcag has no control over the product ultimate destination within the united states.until,mbusa independently decided against buying dcag vehicles in california,and those automobiles were therefore sold to an independent and unrelated company.
upon request by dcag,mbusa must provide all information relevant to the financial condition,management,ownership,business practices,and corporate reputation of authorized resellers,as well as copies of all relevant agreements,its comprehensive advertising and marketing plan,and its balance sheets.
mbusa must also comply with the standards designated by dcag as binding,although any change requires one year notice.marketing strategy and advertising must be consistent with applicable standards,brand representation,and dcag directives,standards,and processes.
dcag may reject proposed appointments of authorized resellers,must consent before mbusa management positions can be combined,and must approve the replacement of key personnel.furthermore,mbusa must comply with dcag instructions to modify or alter any of their agreements with resellers.offices,sales,and service facilities must be at approved locations and must comply with dcag requirements.finally,dcag reserves the right to approve or disapprove of the type,design,and size of signage.
on november,the district court issued an order tentatively granting dcag motion.the court found that dcag did not have continuous and systematic contacts via the contacts of mbusa under agency jurisdiction and the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable,considering a the extent of dcag purposeful interjection,b the burden on dcag,c conflicts with the sovereignty of argentina and germany,d california interest in adjudicating the dispute,e the availability of alternative fora,f efficient judicial resolution,and g the need to give convenient and effective relief to the plaintiffs 
the court ruling,however,was tentative and it ordered limited jurisdictional discovery on whether an agency relationship existed between dcag and mbusa,and the ability of the appellants to pursue their claims in germany or argentina.in its supplemental opposition to the motion,after discovery,appellants addressed the agency relationship and alternative fora as requested.they also argued that jurisdiction should be conferred upon dcag because of its contacts with the united states as a whole,pursuant to.k,and requested,in the alternative,that the district court transfer the case to michigan if it found that it did not have personal jurisdiction over dcag.
on february,the court concluded that its earlier ruling was correct and granted the motion to dismiss.in its final order,it found that mbusa was not dcag agent for the purpose of conferring general jurisdiction,and both germany and argentina provided an adequate forum for appellants claims.the court did not consider the k and change of venue arguments because both exceeded the scope of its supplemental briefing order.the appellants timely appealed,asserting that the district court erred in finding that it lacked jurisdiction over dcag,and alleging various procedural defects in the lower court ruling.
jurisdiction 
the parties dispute whether there is subject matter jurisdiction over appellants claim pursuant to the alien tort claims act and the torture victims protection act.the district court held that it would resolve the question of personal jurisdiction first.this exercise of discretion was proper.see sinochem int l malaysia int l shipping,d there is no mandatory sequencing of jurisdictional issues a federal court has leeway to choose among threshold grounds for denying audience to a case on the merits.internal quotations omitted see also ruhrgas ag marathon oil,d.

discussion 
personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant is tested by a analysis.chan soc y expeditions,cir.first,the exercise of jurisdiction must satisfy the requirements of the applicable state statute.id.second,the exercise of jurisdiction must comport with federal due process.id.at.b ecause california long arm statute is coextensive with the limits of due process,the court need only consider the requirements of due process.synopsys,ricoh,d.
due process requires that a nonresident defendant have certain minimum contacts with the forum state so that the exercise of jurisdiction does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.int l shoe washington.where the claim does not arise out of a defendant contacts with the forum,there is no specific jurisdiction.however,i f the defendant activities in the forum are substantial,continuous and systematic,general jurisdiction is available.unocal,at.in addition to establishing the requisite contacts,the assertion of jurisdiction must be found reasonable.in re phenylpropanolamine prods.liab,d.
agency jurisdiction 
appellants argue that the continuous and systematic contacts of mbusa,a subsidiary,should be attributed to dcag,its parent,because mbusa was its agent for purposes of personal jurisdiction.
the existence of a relationship between a parent company and its subsidiaries,however,is not sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction over the parent on the basis of the subsidiaries minimum contacts with the forum.unocal,at.a parent corporation may be directly involved in the activities of its subsidiaries without incurring liability so long as that involvement is consistent with the parent investor status.id.at internal quotations omitted.
agency doctrine 
in unocal,we described our agency doctrine,by which the contacts of a subsidiary may be imputed to the parent.id.at.to satisfy the agency test,the plaintiff must make a prima facie showing that the subsidiary represents the parent corporation by performing services sufficiently important to the parent corporation that if it did not have a representative to perform them,the parent would undertake to perform substantially similar services.harris rutsky.ins,bell clements,cir quoting chan,at.the test permits the imputation of contacts where the subsidiary was either established for,or is engaged in,activities that,but for the existence of the subsidiary,the parent would have to undertake itself.id.internal quotations omitted.
the unocal court distinguished an agency relationship between a parent and its subsidiary from that of a holding company and its subsidiary,explaining that in the case of a holding company the parent could simply hold another type of subsidiary.at citing gallagher mazda motor of,emphasis added.if the business of the parent is the business of investment,then the subsidiaries do not conduct business as agents.id.internal citations omitted.where,on the other hand,the subsidiaries are created by the parent,for tax or corporate finance purposes,there is no basis for distinguishing between the business of the parent and the business of the subsidiaries.id.the doctrine supports the exercise of jurisdiction when the local subsidiary performs a function that is compatible with,and assists the parent in the pursuit of,the parent own business.sonora,th at,d.
to that end,a ppropriate parental involvement includes monitoring of the subsidiary performance,supervision of the subsidiary finance and capital budget decisions,and articulation of general policies and procedures.unocal,at internal quotations omitted.i t is entirely appropriate for directors of a parent corporation to serve as directors of its subsidiary,and that fact alone may not serve to expose the parent corporation to liability.id.similarly,consolidated reports are not dispositive.id.at.
the issue of control 
although appellants later conceded that pervasive control is also necessary to confer agency jurisdiction,the parties initially disputed this issue.this court decision in unocal,read in isolation,has given rise to some confusion.the beginning of the opinion refers to the need for control.see,id.at an alter ego or agency relationship is typified by parental control of the subsidiary internal affairs or daily operations.emphasis added.the opinion,however,did not discuss control further.see id.in modesto city sch.riso kagaku,the district court for the eastern district of california found that control was not required by unocal.d,read in isolation,certain phrases suggest that such may be the case however,read in context and in relation to other ninth circuit decisions,the court finds that control is not an element of the general agency test in the ninth circuit.other district courts,citing modesto,have followed suit.see,in re states wholesale natural gas,d,synopsys,d at see also phenylpropanolamine,d at recognizing the conflict between unocal and modesto.
we write to clarify our law in the area of agency jurisdiction because the modesto court misinterpreted unocal.a determination of agency jurisdiction requires a analysis.first,the parent must exert control that is so pervasive and continual that the subsidiary may be considered an agent or instrumentality of the parent,notwithstanding the maintenance of corporate formalities.control must be over and above that to be expected as an incident of ownership.second,the must also be sufficiently important to the parent corporation that if it did not have a representative,the parent corporation would undertake to perform substantially similar services.see rutsky,at.
as an initial matter,a review of our cases reveals that control has always been relevant to an agency determination.see wells fargo wells fargo express,cir e stablishment of the requisite agency control may be even easier when a relationship is involved.emphasis added kramer motors,british leyland,cir these facts are insufficient to make the parent an alter ego or agent because n one of the companies controls the internal affairs or determines how it operates on a daily basis.emphasis added rutsky,at such activity might well be properly characterized as inconsistent with the parent corporation investor status,and more like control over activities.emphasis added.thus,before unocal and consistent with it,this court had already indicated that a high degree of control is necessary to confer agency jurisdiction.
secondly,under common law principles,control is the sine qua non of agency.see restatement third of agency cmt.c a relationship is not one of agency within the definition unless the principal has the right to control the agent acts.
finally,other circuits considering the issue have held that the right to control is of consequence to agency jurisdiction,although the cases vary as to what precise role it plays.see,purdue research found,cir plaintiff has not demonstrated that defendant exerts an unusually high degree of control.jazini nissan motor,cir control as one of several factors hargrave fibreboard,cir conflating agency and alter ego jurisdiction but requiring control for both.
application to dcag 
we now turn to the facts of this case.in determining whether or not dcag exerts control that is so pervasive and continual that mbusa may be considered an agent of dcag,it is necessary to turn to the terms of the agreement.the requirements that mbusa provide detailed information and comply with general marketing standards are consistent with the monitoring and articulation of general policies permitted under our law.see unocal,at.furthermore,although dcag articulates some specific policies for mbusa,the agreement was terminable,mbusa goals are negotiated by both parties,and title to the cars passes in germany.dcag has no control over the product ultimate destination within the united states,and the evidence shows that mbusa had the power to independently decide against buying dcag vehicles in california.this is not pervasive and continual control.
even if dcag did exert pervasive control,appellants have also failed to make a prima facie showing that dcag would undertake to perform substantially similar services in the absence of mbusa.it is true that the question is close.although dcag points to the costs of distribution and the accompanying tax exposure,w here subsidiaries are created by the parent for tax or corporate finance purposes,there is no basis for distinguishing between the business of the parent and the business of the subsidaries.id.at.dcag does not appear to own mbusa solely as an investment rather,mbusa markets and sells cars produced by dcag,thus perform ing a function that is compatible with,and assists dcag in the pursuit of its own business.see sonora,th at,d.the evidence that dcag has previously used independent distributors,however,along with toyota successful use of autonomous distributors,militates against a finding that without mbusa,dcag would personally market and distribute vehicles in california.
because there is insufficient control and because mbusa does not serve as dcag representative,the contacts of mbusa can not be imputed to dcag.
reasonableness of jurisdiction 
in addition to establishing the requisite contacts,the assertion of jurisdiction must be found reasonable.phenylpropanolamine,d at.because we find that dcag did not have continuous and systematic contacts sufficient to confer general jurisdiction,we need not reach the question of reasonableness.we also need not reach dcag request that some of the evidence bearing on reasonableness be disregarded.
procedural issues 
improper conversion of dcag motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction into a motion to dismiss based on forum non conveniens 
appellants assert that the district court improperly converted the defendant motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction into a de facto dismissal on forum non conveniens grounds because its final order discussed only the adequacy of alternative fora.
appellants mischaracterize the underlying record.although the final order only discussed the agency relationship and the alternative fora,the district court considered the other reasonableness factors in its earlier tentative ruling.because a n appeal from a final judgment draws in question all earlier,orders and rulings which produced the judgment,litchfield spielberg,cir,the district court did not convert dcag motion into a de facto forum non conveniens motion.
refusal to consider appellants argument for a finding of personal jurisdiction pursuant to fed.civ.k or its request for transfer to michigan 
the district court did not address either appellants assertion that the court had jurisdiction over dcag pursuant to.k,or their request for transfer,because both exceeded the scope of the supplemental briefing order.
according to the local court rules for the northern district of california,once a reply is filed,no additional memoranda,papers or letters may be filed without prior court approval.cal.civ.d see also spacey burgar,d,denying plaintiff motion to reconsider due to newly presented evidence of k jurisdiction because plaintiff made a deliberate choice not to include the argument in his initial opposition to defendant motion.
furthermore,if a party first raises an issue in a motion which the district court refused to consider because it was untimely and in contravention of local rules,and does not appeal the district court procedural ruling,the issue is waived.palmer irs,cir emphasis added.
when the district court issued its tentative ruling in favor of dcag,it requested supplemental briefing solely on the agency relationship and the adequacy of alternative fora.the k argument and request for transfer were,therefore,in contravention of the local rules.see cal.civ.d.regardless,because appellants repeated their substantive argument rather than address the procedural ruling in their brief,this argument is waived.see palmer,at.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we find that the district court did not have personal jurisdiction over dcag.we therefore affirm the district court order.
the majority has formulated a stringent new test for determining whether an agency relationship exists for the purposes of establishing personal jurisdiction.although the majority goal of providing some clarity to our rather muddled case law on the subject is laudable,the test it imposes goes too far,requiring a much stronger relationship between parent and subsidiary than is necessary or desirable.the result is to shield foreign corporations from actions in american they have structured their affairs so as to reap vast profits from american to deprive plaintiffs,including those who allege grave human rights abuses,of access to justice.accordingly,i dissent.
minimum contacts 
under our existing precedent,if one of two tests is satisfied,we may find minimum contacts to support the exercise of personal jurisdiction over a foreign parent company by virtue of its relationship to a subsidiary that has continual operations in the forum.the first test,not directly at issue here,is the alter ego test.it is predicated upon a showing of control 
t he plaintiff must make out a prima facie case that there is such unity of interest and ownership that the separate personalities of the two entities no longer exist and that failure to disregard their separate identities would result in fraud or injustice.the first prong of this test has alternately been stated as requiring a showing that the parent controls the subsidiary to such a degree as to render the latter the mere instrumentality of the former.
doe unocal,cir internal citations,quotation marks,and brackets omitted.the second test is the agency test.it,by contrast,is predicated upon a showing of the special importance of the services performed by the subsidiary 
the agency test is satisfied by a showing that the subsidiary functions as the parent corporation representative in that it performs services that are sufficiently important to the foreign corporation that if it did not have a representative to perform them,the corporation own officials would undertake to perform substantially similar services.
id.at quoting chan society expeditions,cir quotation marks omitted see also harris rutsky.ins.services,bell clements,cir.
the principal focus of the agency test for purposes of personal jurisdiction,therefore,is not control much less pervasive and continual control,op.at but rather the relative importance of the services provided to the parent corporation.the cases that might be read to require a stronger showing of control use such language imprecisely,describing both the agency and alter ego tests without differentiating between them.see,unocal,at an alter ego or agency relationship is typified by parental control of the subsidiary internal affairs or daily operations.emphasis added kramer motors,british leyland,cir per curiam these facts are insufficient to make the parent an alter ego or agent because n one of the companies controls the internal affairs or determines how it operates on a daily basis.emphasis added.the majority pervasive and continual control standard compounds this confusion by conflating the alter ego and agency tests,with the result that it is difficult to conceive of a situation in which the subsidiary would be the agent of its parent and not the alter ego.
to be sure,control should play some a secondary determining whether personal jurisdiction is established.this is so because control is a traditional element of agency under common law principles even at common law,however,agents may exercise a considerable amount of discretion in performing their functions.see restatement third of agency,cmt.d.it is not the case,as the majority holds,that the parent must exert control that is pervasive and continual op.at emphasis added.indeed,the principal need not exercise control at all in order to preserve an agency relationship the relevant inquiry,rather,is whether the principal has the right to control.see,in re coupon clearing service,cir the right to control,rather than its exercise is sufficient to meet this standard.as explained in the restatement third of agency 
a principal right to control the agent is a constant across relationships of agency,but the content or specific meaning of the right varies.thus,a person may be an agent although the principal lacks the right to control the full range of the agent activities,how the agent uses time,or the agent exercise of professional judgment.a principal failure to exercise the right of control does not eliminate it,nor is it eliminated by physical distance between the agent and principal 
the level of control required by the majority is excessive,therefore,even for purposes of considering traditional questions of liability.but we should in any event require a less stringent showing of control for the limited purpose of establishing personal jurisdiction,for at least two reasons.first,according to the majority control is but one part of a agency test for the purposes of establishing personal jurisdiction we must also determine that the services are sufficiently important.see unocal,at harris rutsky,at.outside the context of personal jurisdiction,we do not require this double showing in order to establish an agency relationship the tasks to be performed by the agent on behalf of the principal need not be of any special importance.see,batzel smith,cir restatement third of agency.by compounding a strict control requirement with a requirement that the services be sufficiently important,the majority has established a test for agency that is significantly more stringent for purposes of personal jurisdiction than the test for purposes of liability.
we must remember that here,we are establishing a test for agency in a specialized context.we are not asked to determine the contours of vicarious liability,or to hold dcag financially liable for the actions of mbusa.we are deciding one question,only whether dcag has sufficient minimum contacts with the forum state such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.international shoe washington.quotation omitted.indeed,our tests for agency and alter ego when the issue is jurisdictional are merely shorthand devices for defining what constitutes traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice for purposes of the due process analysis of international shoe based upon the relationship.in re telectronics pacing systems.fairness is not well served in such cases by a stringent test based on a narrow,overly formalistic conception of corporate control.
in an increasingly complex and globalized economy,corporations such as dcag reap enormous profits from the sale of their goods in the united states,achieved through the use of distributors,frequently in the form of subsidiaries.many multinational companies organize their corporate structure and acquire subsidiaries for the sole purpose of obtaining a maximal benefit from the american market.dcag,for instance,has earned of its annual revenue from its sales in the united states.of its total sales in were in california.given these realities,and the continually evolving ways of doing business in an international arena,it is a mistake for the majority to formalize and rigidify our test for personal jurisdiction with an on control.as noted by our colleague from new york,jack weinstein,nearly three decades ago,such rigid formalism does not map well onto the realities of the business world 
d ifferent control relationships inhere in different multinational structures,and we lose sight of the economic realities if we insist on masking these distinctions behind simplistic formulae.the kind of control,to the extent such a nebulous concept can be made concrete,will vary depending on the kind of subsidiary involved.thus,while control might be required to attribute the activities of a relatively autonomous manufacturing subsidiary to its conglomerate parent,this by no means implies such a requirement as to a sales and marketing subsidiary which is the conduit for the sales of a single product in the new york market.
bulova watch,hattori,weinstein.our inquiry should be flexible enough to allow us to determine,on the basis of corporate realities rather than formalistic legal rules,whether it is fair to bring a parent company into court in the united states.
under the more flexible approach that i would employ,the degree of control that dcag exercises over mbusa would be more than sufficient for the purposes of establishing personal jurisdiction.the evidence adduced may,in fact,support a finding of control even under the majority overly stringent test.the following list details,at a minimum,the ways in which dcag has the power to control mbusa activities 
mbusa must comply with all dcag directives,standards and processes,in its promotion and advertising,which include directives regarding type,design,and size of the signs used by mbusa.
mbusa must submit,at least three months prior to the commencement of each sales period,its comprehensive advertising and marketing plan for dcag review and approval.
mbusa must keep dcag informed of all marketing,advertising,and promotional activities it implements as well as the results of such activities.
dcag owns of the capital stock of mbusa.
dcag retains full ownership of trademark.
mbusa is required to use the dcag financial system and maintain records and operating reports based on the standards set forth by dcag.
mbusa must receive approval from dcag before entering into an agreement with any authorized reseller,and after agreement,must approve the location of each retail sales outlet,showroom and service facility.dcag may,in its sole discretion,reject any such proposed appointment.
mbusa must obtain approval from dcag to replace key personnel including the ceo.
dcag provides the warranty terms for vehicles to consumers.
mbusa can not make alterations to the cars without prior approval,other than alterations ordered by specific customers in connection with vehicles purchased by those customers.
mbusa can use only parts when repairing or maintaining its own vehicles.
dcag can compel mbusa to engage in dealer advertising programs and parts merchandising programs.
mbusa must keep dcag updated on all promotional materials it uses.mbusa must adhere to the details of signage and marketing specifications as set out by dcag,including the type,design,and size of mbusa and authorized resalers signage.
dcag employees hold senior positions within the mbusa board of directors.
mbusa must collect customer data and furnish periodic reports,upon request from dcag.
mbusa works closely with dcag to ensure regulatory compliance regarding manufacturing,sales,and legal requirements.
all of these provisions support the conclusion that dcag is involved has the power to exert sufficient control aspects of mbusa operations.if the services that mbusa provides are sufficiently important,and i turn to that question of more control than dcag possesses here should be no bar to personal jurisdiction.
this brings me to the remainder of my disagreement with the majority opinion.the evidence that dcag has previously used independent distributors to facilitate its car sales in the united states,along with toyota successful use of autonomous distributors,does not undermine the conclusion that there is an agency relationship between mbusa and dcag for purposes of establishing personal jurisdiction.
as an initial matter,the parties dispute whether dcag would be able to rely successfully on the services of independent distributors to market and sell cars in the united states should it terminate its relationship with mbusa.although toyota has used independent distributors successfully,previous efforts to do so by dcag predecessor failed,and it is entirely speculative that future efforts would succeed.dcag capacity to sell cars without a subsidiary is a disputed question of fact that should have been resolved in plaintiffs favor.see am,at in determining whether there is personal jurisdiction over the defendant,conflicts between the facts contained in the parties affidavits must be resolved in plaintiff favor.
more important,however,under the agency test,a subsidiary acts as an agent if the parent would undertake to perform the services itself if it had no representative at all to perform them.unocal,at finding agency if the services are sufficiently important to the foreign corporation that if it did not have a representative to perform them,the corporation own officials would undertake to perform substantially similar services emphasis added the law does not require that the parent would undertake to perform the services if they were no longer to be performed by a subsidiary.rather the question is whether these important services would be performed by a representative if the company did not perform them itself.independent contractors may be considered representatives under certain circumstances and contracting with such
