plaintiff,management,wpmc,appeals from the district court decision to dismiss,on statute of limitations grounds,the common law fraud claims it asserted against pricewaterhousecoopers,llp pwc.wpmc complaint,filed on june,alleged that pwc,as well as telxon corporation and four of its former officers telxon defendants,engaged in a deceptive scheme to falsely inflate telxon financial results from at least march,through december.wpmc,an investment management firm that purchased and held telxon stock,brought five counts of federal securities fraud against the telxon defendants,as well as four counts of state law fraud and negligent misrepresentation against pwc.
wpmc and the telxon defendants have settled,and wpmc has expressly abandoned its negligent misrepresentation claims.as such,wpmc appeal is limited to the portion of the district court june,order dismissing the state law fraud claims as barred by the applicable statute of limitations.wpmc argues that it was error for the district court to find,as a matter of law,that wpmc knew,or had reason to know,of the facts by reason of which the actions of pwc were unlawful no later than february.ohio code b.wpmc further contends that the district court erred in finding that the limitations period was not tolled by the shareholder class action lawsuits commenced against telxon on december,and against pwc on may.see crown,cork seal parker,d.after review of the record,the arguments presented on appeal,and the applicable law,we affirm the district court dismissal of wpmc fraud claims.
introduction 
pwc,or its predecessor coopers lybrand,llp,served as telxon outside auditors from october until the relationship was terminated in july.telxon designs,manufactures,and distributes wireless and mobile information systems including,for example,retail scanners.although telxon became a wholly owned subsidiary of symbol technologies symbol in november,telxon was an independent company whose stock was traded on the nasdaq exchange at all times relevant to wpmc fraud claims.
wpmc alleges that the telxon defendants acted with pwc to falsely inflate telxon financial results in the audited financial statements for fiscal year fy,fy,and fy,as well as the unaudited statements for the first two quarters of fy ending june and september.the individual defendants were officers during the alleged fraud.frank brick was promoted to president of telxon in june,and then served as chairman and ceo from february until his termination in march.kenneth haver was telxon cfo and senior of finance and administration from march until his termination in march.wpmc named two other former officers as defendants james cleveland,who was president from february through january and gary grant,who served as controller from through september 
during brick tenure,telxon reported improved financial results and purported to meet or beat expectations for eleven consecutive quarters.in april,symbol technologies made its first offer to buy out telxon stock at a per share at a time when the stock was trading at.brick touted telxon improved financial condition and its ability to generate consistent and predictable growth in the future.in may,telxon rejected symbol offer as too low.on june,symbol offered per share,or per share in cash and stock.telxon rejected the offer the same day,and wpmc began buying telxon stock.
wpmc alleges that its decision to invest in telxon was based on brick public statements about telxon financial results,the audited financial statements for fy and fy,and pwc certifications that the statements were prepared in compliance with generally accepted auditing principles gaap and that its audits were conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards gaas.wpmc even inputed the data from the fy and fy statements into a computer modeling program and analyzed the results before deciding to accumulate telxon stock.
between june and june,wpmc purchased shares of telxon stock,representing of the outstanding shares,and launched a proxy fight to force a change in the board of directors.the proxy fight resulted in litigation,which was settled in august.telxon agreed that it would not invoke a poison pill if it received a fully financed cash offer for more than a specified premium.as a result of the settlement,wpmc candidate joined the board of directors in november.by december,wpmc had purchased nearly shares of telxon stock for more than million 
in november,telxon advised symbol that it would accept per share if the deal were closed quickly and without an examination of the books.as was reported in the wall street journal on december,symbol insisted on looking at the books and what they found not only helped derail a million takeover,but also was followed within a single week by a restatement of telxon earnings for the quarter ending september.
symbol advised telxon that its due diligence uncovered million in improperly recognized revenue at the close of the second quarter of fy ending september,for purported sale of equipment to one of its value added retailers when there was no end buyer and the sale was indirectly guaranteed by telxon.this,wpmc claims,was a clear violation of gaap and accounted for a jump in profits before nonrecurring items for fy.without this treatment,telxon revenue would have been flat and telxon would have shown a quarterly loss 
restatements 
on december,telxon announced that it would have to restate its financial results for fy,to reflect a change in the timing of recognizing revenues financed under a new arrangement,to a segment of its distributor vad channel.telxon also indicated that it expected to report a net loss for that quarter of per share instead of the previously announced net earnings of per share.that same day,telxon stock fell from to close at per share and the first shareholder class action suits were filed against telxon,brick,and haver.
in late january,telxon announced a further delay in the restatement of its earnings for fy.the wall street journal reported that telxon management and the board audit committee were working with pwc to review certain judgmental accounting matters that telxon was undertaking a number of operating review initiatives to address the decline in operating results and that telxon expected to incur a loss for all of fy.on february,the wall street journal reported that the sec had begun a formal investigation of telxon auditing practices and of possible insider trading.telxon form,filed on february,disclosed the investigation and that telxon was voluntarily cooperating with the sec.
in a second restatement on february,telxon announced that the review of certain judgmental accounting matters had been completed by pwc,telxon management,and the board audit committee.the press release stated,in part,that 
based on that review,with the concurrence of pwc,telxon will restate its audited financial statements for fiscal years,and,and its unaudited interim financial statements for the first and second quarters of fiscal.the restatement of the prior audited periods results from the of the accounting treatment of certain discrete transactions,not from the discovery of any irregularities or wrongdoing of the company.the majority of the aggregate restatement is attributable to asset impairments and valuation allowances,with the balance mostly attributable to adjustments of revenue previously recognized for certain transactions.
telxon also reported that revenues for fy were affected by the loss of a million order,delays in the of two large retail products,and lower than expected demand.while indicating that amended forms and would follow as expeditiously as practicable over the coming weeks,telxon also provided a breakdown of the impact of the restatements on the financial statements for fy,fy,fy,and the first two quarters of fy.in all,the announced restatements essentially wiped out million,or per share,in net income.on this news,the stock price fell another,to close under per share.
on march,telxon announced that its cfo,kenneth haver,was no longer with the company and that a new financial advisor had been hired.telxon also filed a form with the sec that provided some detail concerning items that were being restated for the three and periods ending september,and fy,and for the three and periods ending december,first three quarters of fy.telxon disclosed that it had reversed recognition of million in product revenue and million associated with product financing during fy because the criteria for revenue recognition had not been fully satisfied.
this march announcement revealed other restated items as well,including that telxon increased its product sales return reserves by for the six months ending september,to better reflect the levels of product returns in the company distribution channel that telxon increased its provision for bad debt on past due accounts receivable relating to a single foreign retailer unimicro by million for the six months ending september,and by another million for the nine months ending december,and that telxon deferred million in software license revenue it had recognized in fy because certain contingencies related to the customer acceptance of such software had not been satisfied.telxon also disclosed that it had reversed in software license revenues and royalties for the nine months ending december,and would defer recognition of such revenue until those transactions were settled in cash.in addition,telxon adjusted a gain on the sale of a subsidiary from the quarter ending march,to the quarter ending june,because the conditions of the sale had not been satisfied before march corrected treatment of in severance payments related to its international operations that were improperly accrued as restructuring charges during the quarter ending december,and recognized a million asset impairment of the company equity investment in the referenced foreign distributor.one week later,on march,telxon fired ceo frank brick.
telxon reported in a filed with the sec on june,that it would have to further restate its results for fy to reflect a reduction in revenue resulting from a change in the treatment of a transaction from a sale to an operating lease,due to the company guarantee of customer payments to the lessor.this item was expected to increase the net loss for fy from per share to.per share.telxon also announced a delay in the release of its financial results for the fourth quarter of fy ending march.one month later,on july,telxon dismissed pwc as its outside auditor.
on august,telxon announced that it had recorded a net loss of million,or per share diluted,for fy,as compared to net income of million,or per share diluted for fy.telxon also made its third and final restatement of financial results,which incorporated the items previously disclosed and included some additional restated items.with the additional items,the restatements taken together wiped out about million in net earnings an increase over the million announced on february.
details of the newly restated items were also disclosed at that time.for fy,telxon new restatements included million in additional adjustments for bad debts owed by unimicro reversal of million in software license revenues and in related royalty costs million in impairment charges for uncollected notes receivable in the amount of gain relating to the sale of an investment and an increase of in inventory obsolescence reserves.for fy,wpmc points to additional reversals of million in software license revenues and million in related royalty costs a recharacterization of million in product sales as a lease with revenues defined on a basis increased amortization charges of for notes receivable related to a divestiture of retail software assets the expensing of previously capitalized as product purchase advances a million increase in obsolescence reserves and an increase of in severance charges previously recorded as restructuring charges.finally,adjustments to earnings for fy included the reversal of million in revenue in increased inventory obsolescence reserves and in increased sales returns and allowance reserves.
related class actions 
wpmc did not file its complaint until june,but relies on earlier filed class actions to argue both that the limitations period did not begin to run until may,and that the limitations period on its fraud claims was suspended by the filing of one or both of the class action lawsuits.all three actions,which were assigned to the same district judge,alleged the same scheme to falsely inflate telxon financial results.
telxon class action 
as mentioned earlier,the first shareholder class action suits were brought against telxon,brick,and haver on december.the district court consolidated those suits with another shareholder suits filed against these defendants in the days and weeks that followed.in re telxon.sec,d.on september,lead plaintiffs,william and arthur hayman,filed an amended consolidated class action complaint asserting federal securities fraud claims against telxon,brick,and haver on behalf of all investors who purchased telxon securities between may,and february.
the telxon defendants promptly filed a motion to dismiss,which triggered an automatic stay of discovery under the private securities litigation reform act of pslra,b b lead plaintiffs moved to lift the stay to allow it to conduct discovery against pwc,arguing that the limitations period applicable to federal securities claims might expire before they could determine whether they could allege facts sufficient to satisfy the pslra heightened requirements for pleading scienter.finding it would contravene the purposes of the pslra to lift the stay and allow discovery as to a nonparty,the district court denied the motion in february.
telxon motion to dismiss was denied on september.in re telxon.sec,d.after outlining in detail the alleged misrepresentations and accounting manipulations,the district court concluded that the lead plaintiffs had alleged facts sufficient to give rise to a strong inference of scienter.with this decision,the stay was lifted and lead plaintiffs commenced discovery against pwc.
on may,with leave from the court,telxon filed a complaint against pwc seeking contribution and asserting state law claims for malpractice,fraud,misrepresentation,breach of contract,and breach of fiduciary duty.telxon alleged that pwc was aware of and had access to all information about the restated items,participated in the preparation of the financial statements,and certified compliance with gaap and gaas.telxon also claimed that pwc understaffed the account with inexperienced auditors and coerced telxon into restating its earnings to cover its own actions.in this case,wpmc contends that no reasonable investor could have known of the facts underlying pwc alleged fraud until after telxon filed its complaint on may.
lead plaintiffs motion for certification of a class asserting claims against telxon was granted on september,but no class claims were asserted against pwc.
pwc class action 
on may,william and arthur hayman filed a separate class action against pwc on behalf of investors who purchased telxon securities between may,and february,asserting federal securities fraud claims arising from pwc participation in the scheme to falsely inflate telxon financial results.pwc responded with a motion to dismiss,arguing,inter alia,that the claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations and that the plaintiffs had failed to allege facts sufficient to establish a strong inference that pwc acted with the required scienter.
on march,the district court denied the motion in all relevant respects and dismissed only those claims arising from the unaudited statements for fy.the district court found that although the class plaintiffs had notice of the possibility of fraud by pwc no later than february,there was a question of fact whether plaintiffs had exercised due diligence in attempting to discover the scope of pwc fraud that precluded dismissal of the federal securities fraud claims on statute of limitations grounds.while that decision is not before us on appeal,wpmc maintains that it was inconsistent with the district court later conclusion that wpmc fraud claims were barred as a matter of law by ohio statute of limitations.those arguments will be addressed below.
class certification was granted in the pwc class action on august,but not before wpmc commenced its own action.
wpmc lawsuit 
when wpmc sued pwc and the telxon defendants on june,discovery was already underway in the class action suits.at the request of defense counsel,the district court consolidated wpmc suit with the class actions for purposes of discovery.the defendants filed motions to dismiss wpmc claims on a variety of grounds,which were granted in part and denied in part for the reasons set forth in the district court order of june.in that decision,the district court found the telxon class action tolled the limitations period for some but not all claims against telxon,brick,and haver ruled that other claims were barred by a release granted in connection with the proxy fight and certified questions to the ohio supreme court to determine whether ohio would recognize a claim,either in fraud or misrepresentation,for having caused an investor to hold a security.with entry of final judgment,the certified questions were declared moot.
as noted earlier,this appeal is limited to the portion of the order dismissing the fraud claims against pwc as barred by the applicable statute of limitations.in that regard,the district court found that the limitations period began to run no later than february,that,as a result,the limitations period expired before the pwc class action was filed on may,and that the telxon class action did not toll the limitations period for claims asserted against pwc because no class claims were alleged against pwc.
we review the district court dismissal of the fraud claims de novo.in re comshare.sec,cir.on a motion to dismiss under.b,we must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to wpmc,accept the factual allegations as true,and determine whether wpmc can prove any set of facts that would entitle it to relief.bovee coopers lybrand,cir.in addition to the allegations in the complaint,the court may also consider other materials that are integral to the complaint,are public records,or are otherwise appropriate for the taking of judicial notice.id.at new england health care employees pension fund ernst young,llp,cir,cert.denied,d.
wpmc insists that it was error for the district court to dismiss its fraud claims against pwc in the face of its averments concerning the statute of limitations.wpmc specifically alleged that a reasonably diligent investor could not have known of pwc participation in the fraud until after telxon filed its complaint against pwc on may.wpmc also alleges that the limitations period was suspended,or tolled,by the filing of the class action suits.these,however,are legal conclusions that the district court is not required to accept as true.bovee,at quoting morgan church fried chicken,cir 
statute of limitations 
ohio law is clear that because wpmc fraud claims arise out of or are predicated on the sale of securities,they are governed by the specific statute of limitations set forth in ohio b not the general statute of limitations for fraud claims found in ohio.lynch dean witter reynolds,ohio app d,kondrat morris,ohio app d,hater gradison div.of mcdonald,ohio app d,see also goldberg cohen,wl june,unpublished decision discussing cases.at the time of the district court decision,ohio b provided that no action may be brought 
more than two years after the plaintiff knew,or had reason to know,of the facts by reason of which the actions of the person or director were unlawful,or more than four years from the date of such sale or contract for sale,which ever is the shorter period.
while constructive notice is therefore sufficient to start the period,the ohio courts have not discussed what is required to establish constructive notice under this provision.gounaris apple,wl,unpublished decision actual or constructive notice 
the district court held that notice of the possibility of fraud by pwc was sufficient to trigger the limitations period under ohio b,and that wpmc was clearly on notice of the possibility of fraud by pwc no later than february.incorporating the earlier finding from the pwc class action,the district court reasoned that 
while the mere restatement of financial results is not sufficient,by itself,to state a claim for securities fraud,the court finds that the pervasive nature of these the restatement of three consecutive years of audited financial sufficient to lead a reasonable person to investigate whether he or she might have a claim for fraud against pwc,especially given the accounting irregularities giving rise to the restatements.
in finding that notice of the possibility of fraud was sufficient to start the limitations period,the district court concluded that the ohio statute encompassed only the first prong of the analysis it had applied to the federal securities fraud claims in the pwc class action.
wpmc contends this was error and argues that the ohio courts would apply the same standard for state law securities fraud claims as has been adopted for federal securities fraud claims.in support of this position,wpmc argues that this would be consistent with the interpretation adopted by the ohio court for determining when a plaintiff has constructive notice of a general fraud claim under ohio cause does not accrue until the fraud is discovered.see investors reit one jacobs,ohio,syllabus b have discovered,or should have discovered.
wpmc is correct that constructive notice under has been interpreted to require both notice of the possibility of wrongdoing and a reasonable opportunity to inquire to start the limitations period running as pwc points out,the legislature chose to carve out a different and shorter limitations period for all claims arising out of the sale of securities.while it is not clear how the ohio courts may choose to interpret b,we assume for purposes of this appeal that it will be interpreted to require more than simply notice of the possibility of fraud to start the limitations period running.moreover,we assume because ohio has adopted a limitations period specific to claims arising out of the sale of securities,that the ohio courts would apply a standard consistent with the inquiry notice standard applicable to similar federal securities fraud claims.see e action must be brought within one year after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation one year after the discovery or after such discovery should have been made by the exercise of reasonable diligence.giving wpmc the benefit of this assumption,we consider de novo when the limitations period began to run on its claims against pwc.
inquiry notice 
after the district court decision in this case,we clarified the standard for inquiry notice in new england health care employees pension fund ernst young,llp,cir,cert.denied,d.joining at least seven other circuits,this court held that inquiry notice is sufficient to trigger the limitations period for securities fraud claims brought under b.the court also rejected the view that the limitations period should begin to run when a plaintiff learns facts that would cause a reasonable investor to investigate the possibility of fraud.instead,adopting the majority view,the court held that knowledge of suspicious facts storm warnings,they are frequently triggers a duty to investigate,and that the limitation period begins to run only when a reasonably diligent investigation would have discovered the fraud.at.in other words,the limitations period begins to run when a plaintiff should have discovered,by exercising reasonable diligence,the facts underlying the alleged fraud.id.this,the court found,reflected an appropriate balance between the competing interests in requiring plaintiffs to bring suit promptly while not driving plaintiffs to bring suit before they are able,in the exercise of reasonable diligence,to discover the facts necessary to support their claims.id.citation omitted 
as wpmc emphasizes,the failure to follow gaap,or the fact of a restatement,does not by itself establish fraud on the part of an outside auditor.comshare,at.the recklessness required to find securities fraud on the part of an independent auditor must approximate an actual intent to aid in the fraud being perpetrated by the audited company.pr diamonds,chandler,cir citation omitted.w hen the alleged accounting errors are sufficiently basic and large,their existence,in combination with other factors,may support the requisite scienter inference.id.at citing in re telxon,d at denying motion to dismiss the telxon class action 
in rejecting wpmc position that it should be treated the same as the plaintiffs in the pwc class action,the district court relied in part on a distinction between the pleading requirements for the state law claims under.b and the requirements imposed by the pslra for federal securities fraud claims.although wpmc takes issue with this distinction,this court recognized in pr diamonds that there is a difference when it comes to pleading scienter.rule provides that a defendant state of mind may be averred generally,while the pslra adopted a heightened standard for pleading scienter in federal securities fraud cases.pr diamonds,at.this is relevant to the question of when wpmc should have discovered facts sufficient to allege its state law fraud claims against pwc.
we find that storm warnings were certainly present by february,as the restatements announced at that time wiped out million in earnings,based on the review of certain judgmental accounting matters,the bulk of which were attributed to recognition of asset impairments,adjustments to valuation allowances,and correction of improperly recognized revenue.other storm warnings preceded that announcement,however,including the collapse of the symbol deal following a due diligence review of telxon books the december,restatement of earnings the shareholder class actions filed that day alleging misrepresentations in the financial statements delays in the release of financial results because the review of certain judgmental accounting matters had not been completed and the sec commencement of a formal investigation covering telxon accounting practices.
wpmc argues that it could not have known from the restatements announced on february,of facts supporting a claim that pwc participated in the scheme to falsely inflate telxon financial results.first,wpmc claims that at that point telxon was apparently still content with pwc services since the restatements were made with the concurrence of pwc.on the contrary,pwc concurrence in no way negates pwc alleged participation in the fraudulent scheme.in fact,wpmc alleges that the telxon defendants and pwc acted together to falsely inflate the company financial results.pwc concurrence in the restatements indicated its agreement that the financial statements over a year period had materially misrepresented the company financial condition.
wpmc also relies on the fact that the february restatements did not include all of the transactions that were ultimately restated in august.while that is true,the question is when the plaintiff should have discovered the facts underlying pwc participation in the fraud.the newly disclosed items were of the same nature as those that had been previously disclosed and told nothing new about pwc involvement in the scheme.with the additional items,the restatements for the entire period wiped out about million in net earnings as opposed to the million announced on february.
with the march,disclosures,telxon revealed some detail concerning the restatements that suggested the nature of the accounting manipulations and that they were not small mistakes that could have been overlooked.without repeating all the items,we note that they included the outright reversal of more than million in product revenues and financing because the criteria for revenue recognition had not been recognized an increase in product return reserves by million for a period and a million adjustment to receivables to account for bad debts owed by a single retailer.a week later,telxon also fired brick and haver.these disclosures added to the texture of the information available to wpmc in evaluating the earlier storm warnings,the february restatements,and the facts underlying pwc alleged participation in the fraud.
finally,wpmc urges us to find that it could not have known the facts underlying its claims against pwc until may,when telxon filed its complaint and the class plaintiffs filed their own action against pwc.the crux of this argument is that wpmc could not successfully establish scienter without direct evidence from a participant in the fraud or access to pwc internal work papers.first,we agree with the district court that wpmc was not required to plead scienter with the level of specificity required by the pslra.second,even if it were,we find that wpmc may not delay the commencement of the statute of limitations until after it has secured direct evidence of pwc culpability.this court rejected a similar argument in new england,which was also a securities fraud claim brought against an outside auditor.
new england filed an earlier action against the company,fruit of the loom,alleging the same accounting manipulations that formed the basis of the claims against the auditor.new england argued that it could not have known whether the accountant certification of the financial statements were knowingly or recklessly false until after the accountant workpapers were obtained in the earlier action.rejecting this argument,the court explained that 
we agree that scienter on the part of corporate new england plainly alleged in the fruit not necessarily imply scienter on the part of outside auditors.at the same time,however,direct evidence of scienter is not necessary to a determination of fraud.see,herman maclean huddleston,d noting that scienter may be proved with circumstantial evidence.in this case,we believe,the facts alleged in the fruit complaint strongly suggest that fruit auditors were at least reckless.
for one thing,the alleged fraud relates primarily to departures from gaap contained in audited financial same issues,new england has said,that are addressed in the ernst not to representations that were neither scrutinized nor approved by the auditors.moreover,the scope of the alleged overvaluation of fixed assets and inventory by more than million,premature recognition of more than million in sales,and failure to accrue liabilities and charges totaling such that any reasonable investor would question the auditors oversight.as new england says in its brief,the fraud does not involve little mistakes that the auditors might have overlooked.in the light of the particular allegations against fruit,we are at a loss to understand why new england should not have determined,by july,that ernst knowingly or recklessly participated in the alleged fraud.
new england,at.
seeking to distinguish new england,wpmc argues that it was new england that filed the earlier action against the company as well as the later action against the auditor.the relevance of the prior action was not that new england had filed it,but was that the facts alleged in the earlier complaint provided inquiry notice sufficient to start the limitations period on claims that the auditors participated in the fraud.likewise,we may consider the facts that were known or should have been known to wpmc at the time the original class action suits were filed against telxon.this case is more like new england than it is different.
in denying the motion to dismiss the class claims against the telxon defendants,the district court provided this characterization of the accounting manipulations at issue 
plaintiffs allege over three years of pervasive and escalating accounting manipulations.plaintiffs allege that defendants improperly recognized revenue,understated its charges,improperly valued accounts receivable,improperly recorded charges,and understated its bad debt expenses.while some of these alleged accounting manipulations,by themselves,would appear to be entirely discretionary,such as in which quarter bad debt should be recognized,others nearly create a strong inference of,at least,recklessness even when considered in isolation these accounting decisions are not of the type that are generally within any range of reasonable treatments they are,instead,the kind of accounting entri
