this is an appeal from a decision by the bankruptcy appellate panel of the tenth circuit the bap jurisdiction in this court is conferred by d.
one of the purposes of bankruptcy law is to provide fair remedies to creditors generally,and a corollary of this principle is to prevent,within limits,a debtor from giving preferred treatment to some creditors in derogation of the interests of other,similarly situated creditors.a debtor might be motivated to prefer one creditor or some creditors over his creditors generally for a number of reasons,including personal and business connections.the supervision of the bankruptcy court generally prevents unwarranted preferential treatment.but the law has long recognized and addressed the concern that a debtor could circumvent this policy by making preferential transfers before filing his bankruptcy petition.
the power and duty to address preferential transfers in chapter cases is initially vested in a trustee appointed by the bankruptcy court to supervise the bankruptcy estate.as discussed infra,the bankruptcy code provides that a transfer to any creditor less than days before filing a bankruptcy petition can be set aside if it meets other statutory criteria including generally that the transfer is made for the benefit of a creditor on account of a debt,while the debtor was insolvent,and results in the creditor receiving more than she would if the debtor assets were liquidated in bankruptcy.moreover,the law recognizes that there will be some creditors who may be especially likely to receive favorable treatment under the code,these are termed insiders.consequently,a trustee may avoid,nullify transfers to insiders when the other criteria are present and the debtor made the transfer within one year before filing bankruptcy.see b.
congress has included in the definition of insiders family members and others with close relationships to the debtor,including corporations for which an individual debtor serves as an officer or director.the principal issue presented in this appeal is whether a director emeritus is a director within the meaning of b of the bankruptcy code.the trustee maintains that the bank is both a per se insider and an insider.appellant brief at.
this appeal arose from a bankruptcy proceeding filed by ronald kent kunz the debtor.the bankruptcy court appointed stephen rupp the trustee,appellant in this court,to be trustee of the debtor estate.the issue before us concerns transfers from the debtor to appellee united security bank united.the debtor had been involved in the initial organization of united and had been a member of united board of directors until he resigned from the board in.since resigning from the board,the debtor has held the title director emeritus but has not attended any meetings of the board.debtor has no power,no office,and no staff he is not entitled to attend any meeting on united business.directors emeritus of united receive a fixed monthly honorarium of and are listed in united annual reports.
debtor filed his bankruptcy petition on november.beginning about one year earlier,debtor had attempted,through counsel,to negotiate settlements of substantial debts he owed to united and two other lenders,comerica bank and wells fargo bank.during the year prior to commencement of the bankruptcy action,debtor made payments to each of these three creditors.according to allegations made by the trustee,which are not at issue in this appeal,debtor property transfers and payments to united were preferential in the legal sense of improving united position relative to other creditors.
comerica bank and wells fargo bank each filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy court,while united did not.the trustee alleges that one year prior to bankruptcy,debtor owed united,of which was unsecured.on the date of filing bankruptcy,the trustee alleges,that debt had been reduced to,of which only was unsecured.these amounts are contested,but this interlocutory appeal does not require this court to address those issues.
decision of the bankruptcy court 
the trustee brought an adversary proceeding to avoid and recover the value of transfers by the debtor to united of two parcels of real property,shares of stock in a television company,and in cash payments.the trustee contended that the transfers to united should be rescinded under the relevant provision of the bankruptcy code,which provides that the trustee 
may avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property 
to or for the benefit of a creditor 
for or on account of an antecedent debt owed by the debtor before such transfer was made 
made while the debtor was insolvent 
a on or within days before the date of the filing of the petition or 
b between ninety days and one year before the date of the filing of the petition,if such creditor at the time of such transfer was an insider and 
that enables such creditor to receive more than such creditor would receive if 
a the case were a case under chapter of this title 
b the transfer had not been made and 
c such creditor received payment of such debt to the extent provided by the provisions of this title.
b.the transfers had been made less than one year but more than days before debtor filed his petition,so the trustee had to show that the transfers were to an insider,that is that united was an insider of the debtor.
united and the trustee each filed motions for partial summary judgment.the bankruptcy court denied united motion and granted the trustee motion,concluding inter alia 
united is an insider of the debtor pursuant to the plain meaning of section of the united states bankruptcy code.
section includes,as insiders of a debtor,corporations for which the debtor is a director.
united held the debtor out to the public,to investors,and to customers as a director emeritus.
the term emeritus is an adjective.an adjective is a word belonging to one of the major form classes in any of numerous languages,and typically serves as a modifier of a noun to denote a quality of the thing named,to indicate its quality or extent,or to specify a thing as distinct from something else.webster new collegiate dictionary.
the word director is a noun used in section a iv of the code to define when a corporation is an insider.
the word emeritus is an adjective that does nothing more than modify the noun director.this leaves the debtor as a director in the same sense that a second class director or a voting director is a director of a corporation.
accordingly,the bankruptcy court granted the trustee motion for partial summary judgment and denied united motion for partial summary judgment.
summary of the bap opinion 
the bap granted leave for united to pursue an interlocutory appeal under authority of a and reversed the decision of the bankruptcy court.the bap noted that the only issue before it was whether united is an insider of the debtor 
the bap then noted the statutory definition section provides that the term insider includes a if the debtor is an individual iv a corporation of which the debtor is a director,officer,or person in control.the bankruptcy court had essentially held that a director emeritus is a director because emeritus is merely an adjective.the bap disagreed.for one thing,the bap said,the reliance on the definition of an adjective was misplaced.under that reasoning,a former director would also be a director,because former is an adjective.
the bap then looked at webster dictionary and black law dictionary for the definition of director.under these authorities,the term includes an element of control of the corporation.the legislative history of the statute revealed intent to use the term consistently with that common understanding,the bap further observed.but the debtor,as a director emeritus,had no authority to control united to any extent on the facts presented.
therefore,the bap concluded that the grant of partial summary judgment to the trustee was improper and reversed the bankruptcy court decision.the bap affirmed the bankruptcy court denial of united for partial summary judgment no appeal has been taken from that ruling.
we independently review the decision of the bankruptcy court here,not that of
