background 
delos yancey,and delos yancey iii were,at times material to this case,directors of state mutual.ann rogers was state mutual corporate secretary.in,while working for state mutual,they formed north american together with rodney hale,who was neither an officer nor a director of state mutual the yanceys and hale served on north american board of directors and rogers served as its corporate secretary thus,the yanceys were simultaneously directors of both state mutual and north american.
prior to the formation of north american,state mutual bought a company called atlas life insurance company atlas for million.approximately one year after the formation of north american,state mutual decided to sell atlas.several months into the process,north american expressed an interest in purchasing atlas,which it ultimately did for approximately million state mutual sustained a loss of million on the sale.two years later,north american atlas for approximately million,making a profit of approximately million.
fisher brought this derivative suit to recover north american million profit,alleging that state mutual sale of atlas to north american was void as an interested transaction.the defendants responded that the yanceys had recused themselves from state mutual decision to sell atlas to north american,and,in so doing,had complied with the relevant provisions of georgia safe harbor law such that the transaction was valid and immune to judicial review.
in granting summary judgment for the defendants,the district court found the following facts to be undisputed in,state mutual decided to sell a subsidiary called home federal,which was expected to generate a significant tax liability.in order to offset this liability,state mutual considered the possibility of selling atlas,which was expected to generate a tax loss.several months into the process,north american formed an interest in purchasing atlas.prior to north american engaging in any negotiations with state mutual,however,the yanceys disclosed to state mutual board of directors their affiliation with north american and their resulting conflict of interest.thereafter,the yanceys abstained from any proceedings or negotiations regarding the proposed atlas transaction.
following the yanceys notice,state mutual board of directors formed a special committee consisting of three disinterested directors to review,evaluate,and negotiate the atlas transaction.the board authorized the special committee to retain such advisors as it deems necessary to assist it in determining the value of atlas,the fairness of the proposed transaction,and compliance with all legal requirements applicable to the proposed transaction.accordingly,the committee retained larry warnock,an actuarial consultant,peter mattingly,an investment banker,and james smith iii,an attorney,to assist with the valuation of atlas,and to provide financial and legal advice regarding the potential transaction.based upon the report of the retained experts,the special committee negotiated a sale of atlas to north american for million,which the full state mutual board approved.the yanceys recused themselves from the board discussions and vote.in accordance with georgia law,state mutual then sought and received approval of the atlas sale from the georgia insurance commissioner.
based on these facts,the district court held that the yanceys had complied with the requirements of the georgia safe harbor law.therefore,the court held that the transaction was insulated from judicial review and granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the record and drawing all inferences in favor of the party.see arrington cobb county,cir.
discussion 
fisher first contends that the district court erred in finding that the yanceys complied with the requirements of the safe harbor,and therefore,that the atlas transaction was immune to judicial review.second,fisher argues that the plain language of b only shields from judicial scrutiny transactions that are challenged on the ground of an interest in the transaction of the director,whereas his complaint challenges the atlas transaction on grounds other than an interest in the transaction of the director,specifically,corporate waste,fraud,usurpation of corporate opportunity,and breach of fiduciary duty.we first consider the language of b and,which together constitute the safe harbor.
b,provides in relevant part 
b a director conflicting interest transaction may not be enjoined,set aside,or give rise to an award of damages or other sanctions,in an action by a shareholder or by or in the right of the corporation,on the ground of an interest in the transaction of the director or any person with whom or which he has a personal,economic,or other association,if 
directors action respecting the transaction was at any time taken in compliance with code section 
the transaction,judged in the circumstances at the time of commitment,is established to have been fair to the corporation.
id.emphases added.
in turn,provides 
a directors action respecting a transaction is effective for purposes of paragraph of subsection b of code section if the transaction received the affirmative vote of a majority but not less than two of those qualified directors on the board of directors or on a duly empowered committee thereof who voted on the transaction after either required disclosure to them to the extent the information was not known by them or compliance with subsection b of this code section.
b if a director has a conflicting interest respecting a transaction,but neither he nor a related person of the director specified in subparagraph a of paragraph of code section is a party thereto,and if the director has a duty under law or a professional cannon,or a duty of confidentiality to another person,respecting information relating to the transaction such that the director can not,consistent with that duty,make the disclosure contemplated by subparagraph b of paragraph of code section required disclosure,then disclosure is sufficient for purposes of subsection a of this code section if the director 
discloses to the directors voting on the transaction the existence and nature of his conflicting interest and informs them of the character of and limitations imposed by that duty prior to their vote on the transactions and 
plays no part,directly or indirectly in their deliberations or vote.
under these provisions,the yanceys were required either a to disclose to state mutual any and all knowledge that they may have had regarding the atlas transaction as a result of their affiliation with north american,or,b if they had a conflicting fiduciary duty to north american,to advise state mutual disinterested directors of the existence and nature of their conflicting interest and the character of,and limitations imposed upon them by,that conflicting interest,and then to refrain from playing any part,directly or indirectly,in state mutual deliberations and vote on the atlas sale.
the district court accepted the defendants contentions that a was inapplicable because they had a fiduciary duty to nort
