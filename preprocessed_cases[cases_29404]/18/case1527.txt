this appeal,from a judgment granting a writ of administrative mandamus code civ,concerns the statutory responsibility of appellant escrow agents fidelity corporation eafc to indemnify for losses suffered by member escrow agents as the result of fraudulent misappropriation of trust obligations by their owners,officers,or employees,et at issue is the superior court rejection of a decision by the acting commissioner of corporations commissioner which denied an administrative appeal by david pasternak receiver,receiver of escrow plus,ep,from eafc denial of the receiver claim for compensation on account of approximately million taken by ep president,as part of fraudulent scheme purportedly involving viatical purchases of life insurance policies.the trial court held that the commissioner had erred in concluding that the ep transactions did not involve escrows,and that two particular findings of fact were not supported by substantial evidence.
appealing,eafc defends the commissioner findings and decision.amicus curiae escrow institute of california further contends that a release by the receiver of ep president exonerated eafc of responsibility to the receiver.we conclude that the trial court correctly ruled that the subject transactions involved escrows,and therefore the loss was subject to coverage by eafc.we disagree in part,however,with the court other challenged findings,particularly with regard to how many reimbursable losses ep suffered.finally,we reject amicus contention that eafc has been exonerated.
factual background 
we state the background facts of this controversy,drawing primarily on findings of fact by the commissioner that are not in dispute.in,ep,a licensed escrow company,was owned equally by marla martinez and valerie jenkins.jenkins served as ep president and chief financial officer.in may,pco,a company owned by david laing and doing business as personal choice opportunities pco,approached ep to engage its services in connection with viatical settlements.viatical settlements involve payment to a terminally ill person viator in exchange for being named as beneficiary of the viator existing life insurance policy,bearing death benefits exceeding the amount paid.ep agreed to serve as escrow company for these transactions.neither pco nor laing was licensed in california to enter into such settlements.moreover,their program for funding and implementing the settlements actually was fraudulent,as explained below.
pco program involved loans by individuals,which theoretically were to be used to buy qualified life insurance policies.the lenders were to receive percent interest,and repayment of the amount lent,after one year.under a lender agreement to this effect,the loan funds were initially to be deposited in escrow with ep concurrently,pco was to deposit verification of an insurance policy face value,an irrevocable change of beneficiary,the viator agreement,and a confidential medical prognosis.under the deposit receipt and instructions,ep was to hold the first three of those documents,and also a medical evaluation and diagnosis,the lender agreement,the deposit receipt and instructions itself,and laing irrevocable authorization for the insurance company to send policy benefits to ep.ep was to be entitled to draw its fees first,before paying interest to the lenders any remaining funds after interest would be paid to pco,for purchase of more policies and payment of commissions.escrow agreements recited that policies pco purchased would be held in escrow as collateral for the lenders,and their loans would be repaid from policy proceeds.
the escrow agreements described the escrows as being for safekeeping of policy purchase documents and lender funds,which would be disbursed to purchase policies.an escrow would be opened upon receipt of the loan,the escrow agreement,and the deposit receipt and instructions.funds would be disbursed only if ep held the documents specified by the latter.no disbursement would be made unless ep confirmed that the policies had been sold and transferred to pco.all such policies would be pooled and held as collateral for the loans lenders were not tied to specific policies.
the first lender escrow account was opened on july.later in and in,laing solicited funds in group meetings,in which ep jenkins participated,explaining ep role.after a major such meeting in denver in february,subscriptions and payments by lenders accelerated to approximately million to million per day.approximately escrow accounts ultimately were established.altogether,the total of loans received was approximately million.ep took fees of about million.
through jenkins,ep disbursed million of lender funds,mostly to laing or persons he designated.however,the viatical settlement program was a sham.neither pco nor laing entered into any such settlements,or acquired any policies.ep never received insurance company documentation,nor any policy benefits.
laing apparently did tender documents to ep,but all were fraudulent.the federal bureau of investigation fbi seized envelopes at jenkins home,which laing had allegedly delivered to ep.they contained forged letters purporting to confirm that named individuals were covered by a prudential group life insurance policy,which actually did not cover them.the policy and the misrepresented verifying individual were affiliated with the university of california,riverside,where laing was employed.the envelopes also contained forged designations of laing as beneficiary,seller agreements for the fictitious policy coverages,unmailed letters from laing to prudential claiming beneficiary status,and fabricated physician notes,reciting terminal diagnoses.martinez,ep,testified to seeing laing bring several of these envelopes to ep.
there was no evidence that jenkins relied on any of these documents in making her disbursements of lender money from escrow.moreover,even had the documents been genuine,the disbursements yet violated the escrow instructions,in that jenkins did not receive any policies,confirmations that they had been sold and transferred to pco,directions for payment to ep,or required documentation that the policies had no suicide penalty.
following a tip by a former marketing manager for pco,the department of corporations department investigated ep activities.the department auditor concluded that the pco program did not involve escrows as statutorily defined in section.on february,the department issued a desist and refrain order to laing and pco,against offering securities by way of interests in promissory notes,or investment contracts in the form of loans for viatical agreements,without proper qualification or exemption.jenkins and martinez continued to receive lender funds in march,in nevada.on april,laing,jenkins,and others were arrested,and the pco operation was terminated.
a receiver was appointed for pco,and as of october,he had recovered,out of million originally deposited in escrow,approximately million,million coming from ep and the rest from laing.the next month,jenkins pled guilty to a federal charge of conspiracy to commit mail fraud.laing also was convicted,and imprisoned.
on december,pasternak was appointed receiver of ep.on february,he filed a claim in the form of a proof of loss with eafc,seeking recovery on account of losses caused by jenkins.we briefly summarize the legal structure involved.
eafc is a nonprofit mutual benefit corporation,of which each escrow agent is a member,former.funded by its membership,eafc affords indemnity against loss of trust obligations,subd.a,with coverage of between million and million per location,depending on the member monthly average escrow liability,subd.a,subds.a,b.the subjects of this coverage are described in a series of statutory definitions.a trust obligation includes a ll money and property deposited with a member in an escrow,subd.a.a loss means the loss of trust obligations held by a member as a result of the fraudulent or dishonest abstraction,misappropriation,or embezzlement of trust obligations by an officer,director,trustee,stockholder,manager,or employee of a member.eafc is to pay a member loss to the member or its successor in interest,subd.b.
in sum,eafc reimburses for losses of money,deposited in an escrow,that has been fraudulently or dishonestly misappropriated by an owner or employee of the escrow agency.the definition of escrow in this context,which is at the crux of the present appeal,appears in section.at the time of the events in suit,that definition read as follows escrow means any transaction wherein one person,for the purpose of effecting the sale,transfer,encumbering,or leasing of real or personal property to another person,delivers any written instrument,money,evidence of title to real or personal property,or other thing of value to a third person to be held by such third person until the happening of a specified event or the performance of a prescribed condition,when it is then to be delivered by such third person to a grantee,grantor,promisee,promisor,obligee,obligor,bailee,bailor,or any agent or employee of any of the latter.
the receiver claim initially asserted a loss of million,sustained in june,as a result of jenkins dishonesty.however,the amount claimed exceeded million,allegedly representing about million taken from escrows,less approximately million that had been recovered.the claim alleged that jenkins and perhaps others at ep had misappropriated the funds by making disbursements from escrow accounts with knowledge both that their conditions for disbursement had not been fulfilled and that the underlying transactions were fraudulent.the receiver asserted that the maximum allowable amount of coverage applied.
on may,eafc issued a decision denying the receiver claim.the principal grounds for the denial were that eafc did not cover losses attributable to a fraudulent securities scheme,and that ep escrows did not legally constitute escrows,because the underlying agreements were fraudulent rather than lawful,and pco had not intended to perform.eafc also ruled that under the provisions gearing its coverage to the escrow company average monthly escrow liability,subd.b,ep maximum coverage was million.
the receiver filed an administrative appeal to the commissioner,subd.a.as provided by section,an evidentiary hearing of the appeal proceeded before an administrative law judge alj.the extensive hearing elicited numerous documentary exhibits.following briefing,the alj issued his proposed decision,to deny the receiver appeal.
in its factual findings,the proposed decision reviewed the history of the claim and the underlying transactions,as summarized above.the decision further found that jenkins participation in the pco scheme,and her disbursements to laing,did constitute fraudulent and dishonest abstraction and misappropriation,within the meaning of section definition of loss.however,the decision proceeded to render a legal conclusion that the loss was not covered by eafc,because the money had not been taken from escrows.statutory escrows did not exist because laing had not had a legitimate purpose to transfer property,but only a purpose to obtain funds through fraud neither laing nor pco delivered anything of value to ep,but at best delivered fraudulent documents and there was consequently no transfer of a thing of value.absent the critical elements of legitimate purpose,delivery of a thing of value,and transfer of a thing of value no escrows were created under section.
the proposed decision also found that in october,the receiver had entered into certain settlement agreements with jenkins and martinez,which included general releases of them.although eafc had argued that the settlements impaired its subrogation rights and hence relieved it of responsibility to the receiver,the decision found it unnecessary to determine whether the settlements had so affected subrogation rights.
the proposed decision included two further findings that the receiver later specifically challenged.in finding of fact,the alj found that martinez vague and general testimony about the contents of envelopes from laing that she had examined was insufficient to establish that the more numerous documents,which had been produced at the hearing as fruits of an fbi search of jenkins home,had been delivered to ep by laing in connection with the pco transactions.second,in finding,the decision stated,the pco scam through which millions of dollars of lender funds were abstracted and misappropriated constitutes a systematic and organized scheme,within the meaning of eott energy storebrand internat.ins.th,d eott,a case holding that multiple,orchestrated thefts would constitute a single occurrence.in an accompanying footnote,the alj added that in light of the supervening legal conclusion that there was no eafc coverage,it is unnecessary to resolve the legal issue of whether the holding of eott and the cases cited therein are relevant to interpreting section,which provides for the amount of coverage.
the commissioner adopted the proposed decision as his decision of the appeal.the receiver then commenced the present proceeding in administrative mandamus.the petition named the commissioner as respondent and eafc as real party in interest it alleged that the commissioner legal conclusion,that there had been no escrows,was not supported by the findings,and that in reaching it the commissioner had not proceeded as required by law.in addition,the petition challenged,as unsupported by substantial evidence,administrative finding,regarding the delivery of documents to ep by laing,and finding,regarding jenkins abstractions having been a systematic scheme.code civ,subd.b.
the receiver moved for a peremptory writ.after briefing and argument,the superior court rendered its tentative decision,in the receiver favor.observing that the substantial evidence test applied,the court first stated that regardless of how martinez testimony had been characterized,it was the sole evidence on the issue of delivery by laing to ep,and the alj had not found it unbelievable.hence,the failure to find at least what martinez testified to is not supported by substantial evidence.
the court also rejected finding,regarding a systematic scheme,which it perceived to be more of a legal conclusion than a finding of fact.the court stated it had not reached the same conclusion,and substantial evidence shows multiple losses relating to separate and distinct decisions.finally,the court determined that the commissioner conclusion that there had not been escrows was erroneous,because the statutory definition did not require a legitimate purpose to transfer property,things of,indeed been delivered to ep,and the circumstances that jenkins and laing had acted improperly and that the escrows had not been consummated did not disqualify the escrows,which had been created.
on august,the court issued its statement of decision,and a judgment granting a peremptory writ of mandamus.the statement of decision stated as follows.first,the commissioner finding,that there was insufficient evidence to establish that the documents in envelopes seized from jenkins home policy envelopes had been delivered by laing to ep,was itself not supported by substantial evidence,in that the evidence compels a finding that the policy envelopes were delivered by laing to e p,by reason of martinez testimony and other factors.in other words,the failure to find that the policy documents were delivered to e p by laing is not supported by substantial evidence.
second,finding,that the pco scam though which jenkins misappropriated funds was a systematic and organized scheme under eott,supra,th,d,was not supported by substantial evidence,in that substantial evidence supports a finding that each separate submission of each of the sets of policy documents by laing to e p resulted in a separate decision by jenkins to make a fraudulent and dishonest misappropriation of funds placed in escrow each separate decision by jenkins to make a fraudulent and dishonest misappropriation of funds placed in escrow constitutes a separate loss 
finally,the statement of decision concluded that the commissioner legal conclusion,that the pco transactions did not constitute escrows as defined by section,was not supported by the findings,and that in making it the commissioner had failed to proceed in the manner required by law.in summary,the reasons the findings did not support the conclusion were that each lender had delivered money into an ep escrow account,for the purpose of effecting the transfer and encumbering of personal property to pco,which money was,upon the happening of an event,to be delivered to pco as obligor,promisor and bailor.the findings further showed that lender agreements,deposit receipts and instructions,and escrow agreements also were deposited in each escrow.the fraudulent documents in the policy envelopes,deposited by laing and pco,evidenced the purported encumbering of personal property the policies intended by the lenders.moreover,the fact that laing and jenkins did not complete the viatical process does not alter the fact that escrows were created.in sum,the findings reflected the existence of all elements of an escrow under section.
furthermore,the court ruled,the commissioner had not proceeded as required by law,because his conclusion did not follow the requisites of section,which did not require a legitimate purpose as an element of a valid escrow,and the fraud of jenkins and laing did not disqualify the escrows,but rather made eafc indemnification applicable.in conclusion,the pco accounts at e p constituted escrows as defined under section,and the amounts abstracted therefrom by the fraudulent actions of valerie jenkins are therefore losses citation to trust obligations citation subject to eafc indemnity obligation to its member e p under section.
the court judgment directed issuance of a writ remanding the proceedings to the commissioner,and commanding him to set aside his decision with regard to finding as to which the court had held substantial evidence supported an opposite finding of delivery,finding as to which the evidence supported a finding of multiple decisions and losses,as set forth in the statement of decision,and conclusion of law,as to which the court had held that escrows and losses subject to indemnity had occurred.the commissioner was to reconsider his action in light of the statement of decision.
eafc moved for a new trial,and to set aside the judgment under code of civil procedure section,subdivision.both motions were denied.the court also denied eafc motion to stay the judgment pending appeal eafc filed its notice of appeal,and sought a writ of supersedeas,which we granted.
discussion 
the existence of escrows.
the issue pivotal to the receiver claim for indemnity by eafc is whether jenkins misappropriations of lender funds involved a loss or losses covered by eafc,because the funds were taken from escrows,as defined by section.the commissioner ruled that these misappropriations had not involved escrows.the trial court disagreed.before addressing the issue and its components,we consider the applicable scope of review about which the parties disagree.
eafc asserts that whether the transactions involved escrows was a mixed question of law and fact,which should be reviewed as a factual issue,with deference accorded to the commissioner determination.we believe,rather,that the escrow question is a legal one,deserving de novo review of both the trial court and,where appropriate,the commissioner determinations.several reasons substantiate this approach.the commissioner specifically treated his own resolution of the escrow issue as a legal conclusion.analytically,the issue does present a mixed question,involving applying the law defining escrows primarily section to undisputed facts.but because the inquiry requires a critical consideration,in a factual context,of legal principles and their underlying values,the question is predominantly legal and its determination is reviewed independently.crocker national bank city and county of san francisco cal d,see also people louis cal d.moreover,the trial court conclusion that the commissioner decision of this issue was not supported by the findings likewise merits de novo review derasmo smith d,as does the conclusion that the commissioner misconstrued section.mansell board of administration th,d.
we turn to the issue,whether the trial court correctly ruled that the pco transactions involved escrows,so that jenkins misappropriation from them gave rise to loss subject to eafc coverage.the court first made a positive determination,that the facts found by the commissioner reflected and fulfilled all elements of the statutory definition of escrow,set forth in section ante,a definition that has remained effectively unchanged since the initial enactment of the escrow law in.these facts showed a transaction in which the lenders,for the purpose of transferring their money to pco,delivered it to ep,to be held until the performance of a condition or event,namely pco deposit with ep of specified documents,at which point the money was to be delivered to pco,as promisor and obligor,or bailee.on its face,this arrangement fully satisfied and qualified under section 
the objections to this conclusion variously offered by eafc here and by the commissioner in his decision are not compelling.the commissioner ruled that certain supposed elements of an escrow had been absent,namely a legitimate purpose to transfer property,delivery of a thing of value,and transfer of such a thing of value.this analysis incompletely and incorrectly viewed the transaction from laing standpoint,rather than the lenders.the described lack of purpose was laing,that is,he did not,apparently from the outset,intend to transfer anything of value.but the lenders genuinely intended to transfer their monies,deposited with ep for that purpose,to laing,to enable him to make viatical settlements and pay the lenders interest similarly,laing may not have delivered anything of value at his end of the escrow,but the lenders did at theirs.indeed,in the course of asserting that pco delivered nothing of value to ep,eafc acknowledges that the only items of value delivered to escrow plus were the funds which the investors contributed.finally,the notion that nothing of value was or could be transferred at the end of the escrow is doubly misconceived.again,the lenders money surely qualified.moreover,section does not require a completed delivery from escrow in order for there to be an escrow.rather,the existence of an escrow,as defined,requires only that the transaction contemplate such delivery.the delivery that must occur is the initial deposit.
eafc further arguments are also ineffective.the assertion that there was no transfer of insurance policy benefits is immaterial in light of the deposit and intended delivery of the lender funds.eafc cites elliott title ins.trust,and nat.bk.clark.d,for the proposition that an escrow requires a binding contract between the parties.these cases antedate section,which does not specifically speak of a contract.nevertheless,such contracts were present here,in the form of the lender agreements and escrow agreements,both of which pco and the lenders executed.although eafc avers that the requisite contract must be a valid one,the cited cases do not so state,and in any event the agreements in question were both binding and valid,even if pco entered into them without intention to perform,witkin,summary of cal.law ed.contracts.eafc correlative contention that ep served merely as a depositary,not an escrow agent,because of provisions allowing additional disbursements for the purchase of further policies,is not supported by either the authority or the portions of the record cited.
eafc also argues that the court analysis of how the transactions fulfilled and comported with section does not correspond to the requirement that the transaction be for the purpose of transferring property.eafc urges that the lenders funds were not to be permanently transferred to pco,with title changing,but were eventually to be returned.but there is no requirement in the statute that a transfer of title be the purpose or goal of an escrow.indeed,section identifies the leasing of property as one of the contemplated purposes.nor do the escrows in this case fail to provide for delivery to one of the types of recipients the statute lists at the very least,pco was to be a bailee of the lenders funds.eafc itself observes that transfer of property results in a bailee and neither a bailment nor most of the other types of transactions represented by section enumeration of transferees requires an exchange of property.moreover,eafc characterization of the deposits as being for purposes of investment also does not exceed section dimensions.many traditional real estate transactions utilizing escrows are performed for the purpose of investment as well as transfer or creation of an interest in land.
eafc argument gains no assistance from its references to other portions of the administrative record.for example,that ep employed for pco transactions a computer program that had been adapted from the software ep used with construction fund control transactions did not convert the escrows into some kind of fund controls,not qualified for eafc coverage.see.nor did the commissioner charging pco and ep with securities law violations negative the presence of escrows in the program.eafc expert characterization of the escrows as holding accounts is inconsequential,both because the objective features confirmed the escrows as statutorily defined ones,and because the expert purportedly distinguishing factors were principally that the program assertedly involved securities purchases,whereas independent escrow companies did not usually handle such transactions.
accordingly,we agree with the trial court that ep escrows from which jenkins misappropriation occurred constituted escrows within the meaning of section,and hence eafc provided coverage on account of that misappropriation.
delivery of the policy envelopes.
the receiver writ petition disputed the commissioner finding,to the effect that ep martinez vague and general testimony regarding the contents of envelopes containing viatical documents which laing had brought to ep was insufficient to establish that the policy envelopes,seized from jenkins home and containing similar documents,had been delivered to ep by laing.those envelopes contained fabricated documents that corresponded with many of those whose receipt was the condition for ep release of lender monies to laing.the trial court found this finding not supported by substantial evidence,in that the evidence compels a finding that the policy envelopes were delivered by laing to e p eafc challenges this rejection of finding.
the issue is actually of marginal significance,in that the finding only relates cumulatively to the trial court further determination that ep suffered as many covered losses as there were policy envelopes.although we hold below that that determination is unsound for other reasons,we nevertheless consider the court rejection of finding.we conclude that the court reaction was essentially correct.
finding is set forth in the margin the trial court construed it as not just an evaluation of martinez testimony but a negative finding about delivery,that the evidence,consisting of martinez testimony,failed to establish that laing had delivered to ep the policy envelopes which were later seized from jenkins home and produced at the hearing.the scope of review below was whether the finding was supported by substantial evidence in light of the whole record.code civ,subd.c.we apply the same test to the finding in reviewing the trial court treatment of it.eisenberg,horvitz wiener,cal.practice guide civil appeals writs the rutter group.
the basis for the commissioner finding,as well as the trial court rejection of it,was martinez testimony about the policy envelopes.she testified that she had seen laing bring unsealed envelopes to ep.she had examined the contents of two or three of them,and part of one other one.as she could recall,the contents included a letter from a doctor an agreement between the viator and laing an insurance form of sole beneficiary form sic which would state the policy number and the amount of the insurance policy and a confidentiality agreement between laing and the person who was selling the insurance.that all i can recall right now.asked how many envelopes laing had brought to ep,martinez explained that she had seen more than those she inspected,and that a list of the envelopes was maintained at ep by jenkins and two other individuals,which indicated that there were.the envelopes were first kept in a safe at ep,but beginning about february they were stored in a safe at jenkins home.the envelopes were sealed after delivery to ep,because of confidentiality agreements.
despite eafc claim to the contrary,finding expressed no doubt concerning the credibility of martinez testimony.rather,the finding deemed her testimony about the contents of the envelopes that she looked into vague and general.that characterization is inapt.martinez described virtually all of the types of documents that were contained in each of the policy envelopes produced at the hearing.at least with respect to the envelopes she personally saw laing deliver,her testimony fully supported,if not mandated,a finding that he delivered policy envelopes later found at jenkins home.there is no substantial evidence to the contrary,and to this extent the trial court did not err in finding that the commissioner finding was unsupported 
with regard to those policy envelopes that martinez did not witness laing deliver,her testimony about the envelopes she reviewed,and her further testimony that jenkins stored at home envelopes from ep,constituted powerful circumstantial evidence,even if not direct,that laing had delivered to ep all envelopes,which were later seized from jenkins and produced at the hearing.regardless of any initial reservations by the alj about limited admissibility or weight of the envelopes and their chain of custody,the alj and the commissioner did find in finding that the policy envelopes had been seized at jenkins residence.and there was additional evidence supporting laing delivery of these envelopes to ep.a department examiner testified that in february jenkins had shown her a numbered envelope as were the policy envelopes,which contained documents that referred to the university of california and prudential insurance as did the policy envelopes.moreover,the presence of laing signature on various documents in each envelope bespoke that he was their source.
ultimately,then,martinez testimony strongly and uncontradictedly supported the proposition that the policy envelopes seized at jenkins home and presented at the hearing had originally been delivered to ep by laing.with respect to the envelopes martinez saw laing deliver,her testimony was conclusive.as to the rest,it was circumstantial,but it was also uncontradicted.with respect only to those envelopes,the court went too far in stating that the evidence compel led a finding that laing delivered the policy envelopes to ep.but the ultimate finding that t he failure to find that the policy documents were delivered to e p by laing is not supported by substantial evidence ct was correct.
the systematic and organized scheme,and the number of losses.
we next consider the commissioner finding that the abstraction of escrow funds constituted a systematic scheme,and the trial court superseding findings regarding the number of losses ep experienced.in this regard,we conclude that the trial court erred.
in finding,the commissioner found that the pco scam through which millions of dollars of lender funds were abstracted and misappropriated constitutes a systematic and organized scheme within the meaning of eott,supra,th,d and cases cited therein.eott had ruled that if numerous thefts from an insured were caused by the same systematic and organized scheme to steal id.at,d,the several takings would constitute a single occurrence,for purposes of an insurance policy that imposed a substantial deductible for each occurrence.the commissioner,however,stopped short of holding that eott occurrence analysis applied to losses covered by eafc.in a footnote to finding,the commissioner stated,in light of the legal conclusion set forth below absence of escrows,it is unnecessary to resolve the legal issue of whether the holding of eott and the cases cited therein are relevant to interpreting section.
the trial court ruled that finding was not supported by substantial evidence,in that the substantial evidence supports a finding that each separate submission of each of the sets of policy documents,policy envelopes by laing to e p resulted in a separate decision by jenkins to make a fraudulent and dishonest misappropriation of funds placed in escrow each separate decision by jenkins to make a fraudulent and dishonest misappropriation of funds placed in escrow constitutes a separate loss under section.ct the court thus not only rejected finding to its own extent,but in the process affirmatively determined that ep had suffered losses,by reason of jenkins allegedly having reacted to each of the policy envelopes with a separate decision to misappropriate.both rulings were improper.
in its tentative decision,the trial court had stated that finding deserved treatment as more of a legal conclusion than a finding of fact.not so.the finding of a systematic and organized scheme within the meaning of eott,supra,th,d,was a mixed determination of law and fact,but one primarily involving a factual,practical evaluation.it therefore constituted a factual finding,subject to review under the substantial evidence test,both by the trial court and again here.crocker national bank city and county of san francisco,supra,cal d,see eott,supra,th at,d existence of systematic and organized scheme presented triable issues of fact.but even were the issue deemed to merit de novo review,the result would be the same.the evidence substantially and unequivocally supports the finding that a systematic and organized scheme propelled and embraced jenkins takings from the pco escrows.that is,substantial evidence clearly demonstrated that both the organization and structuring of the pco viatical settlement fraud,with its escrow system and procurement of lender funds,and jenkins disbursement of those funds to laing,comprised a systematic,organized scheme.
the trial court therefore could not properly characterize finding as unsupported by substantial evidence.and the means and reasoning by which the court did so were also incorrect.the court held that the finding lacked substantial evidentiary support,in that substantial evidence supported an alternative finding,that each submission of a policy envelope by laing resulted in a separate decision by jenkins to misappropriate escrow funds,and a conclusion that each such decision constituted a separate loss,reimbursable by eafc.there are several flaws in this analysis.
first,the finding of decisions,tied to policy envelopes,is itself not supported by substantial evidence.there was no direct evidence about jenkins decisionmaking processes with respect to disbursements and the policy envelopes.to the contrary,the commissioner found that there is no evidence that jenkins relied on any document contained in the envelopes to disburse money from the pco accounts.the receiver did not challenge that finding.nor does the evidence otherwise perceptibly link ep disbursements to which there were more than the submission of policy envelopes.moreover,in affirmatively finding the alleged decisions,the court exceeded its function of review under code of civil procedure section.see stanton state personnel bd.d.
second,the court finding of numerous decisions by jenkins did not necessarily contradict the presence of a systematic and organized scheme.in slater fidelity and guaranty slater,the court held that repeated embezzlements,which the parties had stipulated had been made pursuant to a common scheme,yet amounted to separate occurrences,in that each act of appropriating money necessarily was preceded by a decision to adhere to and effectuate that scheme at.thus,the trial court finding that separate decisions negated an organized scheme was incorrect,just as was the disavowal of substantial evidence for the latter on the basis that substantial evidence supposedly showed the former.see mcgill regents of university of california th,fn,d.
our conclusion that the trial court erred in overruling the commissioner finding,and in rendering a superseding finding about the number of decisions to misappropriate jenkins made,also eliminates the basis for the court further conclusion,that ep suffered losses for purposes of eafc reimbursement.indeed,the record and the commissioner decision point squarely to a conclusion that there was only one loss as a result of jenkins misappropriations.in finding,the commissioner adumbrated that conclusion,but stopped short of rendering it,in view of his preemptive ruling that covered escrows had not been involved.our determination to the contrary makes resolution of the question of losses ripe.moreover,the parties and amicus have addressed it,and the question is a legal one,essentially involving applying the escrow law to facts that are not disputed 
eafc relevant statutory framework does not directly resolve the issue.once again,eafc purpose,subd.a and duty,subd.a are to indemnify a member for loss of trust obligations ibid.section defines loss as the loss of trust obligations held by a member as a result of the fraudulent or dishonest abstraction,misappropriation,or embezzlement of trust obligations by an officer,director,trustee,stockholder,manager,or employee of a member as was found here with respect to jenkins under section,subdivision b,coverage is provided in amounts ranging from million to million,depending on the monthly average escrow liability per location.the commissioner found,and there is no dispute,that for the relevant period ep coverage pursuant to this section was million a deductible shall apply to each loss suffered by a member,consisting of plus five percent of the amount by which the loss exceeds.if a member with more than one licensed location suffers a covered loss at more than one location,the deductible shall apply to each location separately in proportion to the amount of the loss suffered at each such licensed location,subd.a.
the text of these statutory provisions sheds little light on whether more than one covered loss occurs when,as here,an escrow agency officer makes several misappropriations of the agency trust obligations as part of a single,systematic and organized scheme.however,those statutory features that do bear on the question point toward one loss.the provision contemplating occurrence of such a loss at several agency locations,and requiring allotment of the deductible among them,subd.a,indicates that more than one taking may comprise a single loss.and the same is true of section references to trust obligations,in the plural,in the definition of loss itself.
statements by eafc president,daniel bovill,made at both the administrative hearing and an earlier time when there was no controversy,also support the understanding that a single scheme would produce a single loss.bovill testified that there could be several separate covered losses,if they involved unrelated takings.during the early days of the pco program,he also wrote to jenkins that eafc indemnifies e p for losses of its trust obligations due to misappropriation or embezzlement on a per occurrence basis.
acknowledging that the statutory terms do not provide a definitive answer,the receiver contends that the issue should be decided by reference to the principles that ambiguities in insurance policies are resolved against the drafter,usually the insurer,and generally in accordance with the insured reasonable expectations,aiu ins.superior court cal d.but those principles do not govern here,because the question of loss arises not under an insurance policy,drawn by an insurer,but under a statute,composed by the legislature.com.insurance superior court cal d,the statute should not be construed strictly against the insurer unlike ambiguous or uncertain policy language.moreover,the expectations of extensive coverage that the receiver cites were essentially by pco,laing,ep,and jenkins,for the consumption of lenders.and eafc avowal that its indemnity ran on a per occurrence basis does not resolve the question of how many occurrences,as so phrased,transpired in this case.
the parties and amicus also invoke judicial decisions regarding insurance coverage for multiple instances of embezzlement or theft,as well as others involving liability insurance policies.the context and reasoning of the embezzlement cases are naturally more apposite to enlighten the issue before us.and those decisions predominantly conclude that multiple takings performed as part of a systematic scheme give rise to only one insured conclusion that we share in this context.
cases from numerous jurisdictions have discerned only one covered occurrence,under fidelity or employee dishonesty policies,in a series of embezzlements by an employee pursuant to a common scheme or episode of dishonesty.for example,business interiors,aetna cas.sur.cir business interiors held that a embezzlement,accomplished by forging or altering checks over seven months,constituted one loss,subject to indemnity.the court found that the employee continued dishonesty was the cause of the loss,just as the court below had observed that the employee intent in writing additional checks after the first one had been to continue the previous dishonesty,not to commit an entirely new and different act of dishonesty.id.at.
similarly,in christ lutheran state farm fire cas,an employee month embezzlement of,by writing checks,was determined to have constituted one occurrence,consisting of related acts.the court held that the checks had been written in furtherance of a continuum of dishonest acts by the employee,not a series of new and individual act s of dishonesty.at.the same held true in valley furniture transportation ins,in which a payroll manager,over six years,embezzled for herself and two other employees amounts well exceeding the limit of liability per occurrence.see also jefferson parish fidelity deposit so d repeated withholdings of employee trust monies constituted one occurrence under commercial crime policy,as the acts were integral parts of a scheme to deprive the trust fund of current premiums so d at howard,weil,labouisse,friedrichs ins.cir several dishonest commodities trades on employer account over four days constituted one loss for purposes of employee dishonesty bond deductible,one ongoing episode having produced the loss.
in the related area of property insurance against theft,peco energy boden cir held that a multitude of thefts of oil by a trucking company over a period constituted a single occurrence id.at,because they all were part of a scheme to steal which was the cause of each.the court elaborated,we therefore hold that when a scheme to steal property is the proximate and continuing cause of a series or combination of thefts,the losses for liability sic insurance purposes constitute part of a single occurrence.id.at.decided under pennsylvania law,peco energy in turn was followed on similar facts as a matter of california law in eott,supra,th,d.
against this spectrum of authority,the receiver cites slater,supra,which held that each act of embezzlement by an employee over two years constituted a separate occurrence,even though the takings occurred pursuant to a plan or scheme at,in part because each act necessarily was preceded by a decision to adhere to and effectuate that scheme,which could have been interrupted at any time before the total amount was taken.the scheme,without more,could not have caused the losses.id.at.we do not find this reasoning persuasive.its notion of separate decisions simply aggrandizes the individual acts of taking.and the quoted refutation of the causal capacity of a scheme is rhetorical.moreover,the slater court relied in part on the rule that ambiguities are to be construed in favor of the insured id.at,which we have previously observed does not govern our analysis here.
moreover,slater stands relatively alone on the issue.american com.ins.mut.fire refused to apply it,observing that slater has not been adopted by any other court considering insurance coverage in the embezzlement context.id.at.with respect to the acts of embezzlement in issue,american commerce instead followed business interiors,supra,albeit finding two occurrences by virtue of two types of related acts,issuing unauthorized checks and diverting customer payments.
the receiver also invokes two cases involving officer and director liability insurance,eureka federal s l american cas.of reading cir,and okada mgic indem.i,affd.in part and revd.in part cir.apart from their entirely different insurance source,these cases are further distinguishable.in eureka,the court held that separate losses were occasioned by disparate acts and omissions by five directors in over loan transactions.at.the court rejected the argument that there had been a single loss by virtue of one corporate lending plan,observing that the loans arose thereafter from numerous intervening business decisions,involving the exercise of independent business judgment,and which were negligently performed.ibid.and in okada,a number of losses were held to have arisen from a series of distinct negligent acts.at,involving a number of disparate corporate transactions.the present record does not reflect any such pattern of independent business decisions by jenkins in performing her disbursements from escrow to laing 
upon consideration of the undisputed facts and the relevant authorities,we conclude that jenkins appropriation of funds that ep held in escrow under the pco program constituted one loss,one loss of trust obligations held by a member as a result of the fraudulent or dishonest abstraction or misappropriation of trust obligations by an officer of a member.although the loss involved numerous disbursements,all of them arose from and implemented the same systematic and organized scheme.as previously held,the evidence does not support the notion that jenkins made separate decisions to misappropriate.her disbursement of funds followed one cause and program.ep suffered one loss from the standpoint of coverage by eafc.
the exoneration issue.
the final issue we confront is raised by amicus curiae.amicus curiae contends that,under the law governing sureties,eafc was exonerated of duty or liability to pay the receiver for loss when,after eafc denied his claim,the receiver entered into a settlement with jenkins,which yielded the receiver substantial fruits but also included a general release of jenkins.the receiver responds,first,that the issue is not properly before us,because it was neither asserted nor decided in the trial court,and amicus curiae is not entitled to raise it.see california for safety education brown th,d.second,the receiver contends that the claim of exoneration is unfounded,most fundamentally because eafc is not a surety,nor subject to the rules governing sureties.
we find it appropriate to decide the exoneration question posed by amicus curiae.essentially the same issue was raised in the administrative proceedings,although the commissioner ultimately did not decide it,in view of his conclusion that there had been no escrows the receiver has responsively briefed the matter.the issue is a legal one,presented under uncontested facts.were we not to address it now,the question would be subject to another round of administrative and trial court consideration,with the prospect of the same appellate review later.
on the merits,amicus position is not persuasive.amicus contends that the receiver release of jenkins operated to discharge eafc the receiver by reason of provisions governing sureties,specifically civil code sections and.but amicus curiae necessarily concedes that eafc is not a surety,first and foremost because its duties to the receiver arise from special statutes,subd.a,not contractual undertakings see,defining sureties 
nor do the terms of civil code sections and readily apply to eafc.these statutes employ the standard terminology of a surety relationship,in which the surety undertakes to answer for the default of a principal with respect to the latter obligation to a creditor or obligee.civil code section provides that a surety is exonerated,except so far as he or she may be indemnified by the principal,if by any act of the creditor,without the consent of the surety the original obligation of the principal is altered in any respect or the remedies or rights of the creditor against the princi
