relator jeff walburn appeals the district court dismissal of his qui tam action brought under the false claims act.walburn suit alleges that defendant lockheed martin altered and submitted false documents for compensation and incentive payments under its agreement with the united states to operate the portsmouth gaseous diffusion plant in piketon,ohio.the district court dismissed the action under the bar of b.we affirm the dismissal.
relator walburn alleges that he was employed as a security officer at the portsmouth plant,patrolling areas of the plant used to enrich uranium and store nuclear materials.the plant is owned by the united states and leased by the united states enrichment corporation,an entity created by congress under the energy policy act of,repealed.lockheed enriches uranium for commercial and national defense purposes at the plant pursuant to a contract with the united states.walburn alleges that federal law required lockheed to maintain accreditation with the department of energy in order to conduct these operations.beginning in,employees at the plant were required to wear thermoluminescent dosimeters that would mechanically measure individual doses of radiation exposure.as a condition of its department of energy accreditation,lockheed was required to keep records of the dosimeter readings together with a record of each employee dosage.walburn alleges that after he was exposed to gases at the plant in,lockheed changed the recorded reading of his dosimeter,and that this was just one of at least to such changes lockheed made to employees dosage readings each year.he alleges that lockheed perpetrated this fraud in order to maintain its department of energy accreditation and continue to receive payments from the united states under its contract to operate the portsmouth plant.
on july,walburn filed a action against lockheed seeking compensatory and punitive damages as a result of his exposure to gases at the portsmouth plant.walburn sought relief in federal court on theories of breach of contract,civil rights violations under,intentional tort,and loss of consortium.on july,the district court entered an order dismissing the action.on may,walburn filed the present qui tam action under seal with the united states department of justice,alleging that lockheed falsification of the dosage readings violated a of the false claims act.see b.following an investigation into walburn allegations,the united states declined to intervene.b b.walburn elected to prosecute the action himself,and on november,the action was unsealed.see b b.reviewing lockheed motion to dismiss,the district court concluded that walburn allegations were encompassed by the allegations in united states ex rel.kenneth brooks lockheed martin,et,no.civ,wl,filed in the district of maryland on april.because the brooks complaint was filed first,the district court dismissed walburn action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the bar of b.united states ex rel.walburn lockheed martin,d.walburn appeals the dismissal.

the history of the false claims act qui tam provisions demonstrates repeated attempts by congress to balance two competing policies.mckenzie,at discussing legislative history united states ex rel.springfield terminal ry.quinn,same.on the one hand,the qui tam provisions seek to encourage whistleblowers to act as private in bringing suits for the common good.see united states ex rel.taxpayers against fraud general,cir.on the other,the provisions seek to discourage opportunistic plaintiffs from bringing parasitic lawsuits whereby relators merely feed off a previous disclosure of fraud.united states ex rel.jones horizon healthcare,cir citing mckenzie,at.to further the latter policy,congress has placed a number of jurisdictional limitations on qui tam actions,two of which are relevant here the bar of b and the public disclosure bar of e a.under these provisions,if walburn qui tam action was based upon information previously made public or if the claim had already been filed by another,the district court was required to dismiss the action.taxpayers against fraud,at.we address the application of each provision in turn.
the district court dismissed walburn action based on b,concluding that the allegations contained in an earlier complaint filed against lockheed by relator brooks encompassed the allegations of walburn complaint.section b provides 
when a person brings a qui tam action,no person other than the government may intervene or bring a related action based on the facts underlying the pending action.
by its terms,this section unambiguously establishes a bar,preventing successive plaintiffs from bringing related actions based on the same underlying facts.united states ex rel.lujan hughes aircraft,cir see also united states ex rel.lacorte smithkline beecham clinical,cir.the bar furthers the policy of the false claims act in that t he claim provides the government notice of the essential facts of an alleged fraud,while the bar stops repetitive claims.lujan,at citing lacorte,at discussing legislative history.
in deciding whether walburn action runs afoul of this bar,we compare his complaint with that in brooks see la corte,at.if both allege all the essential facts of the underlying fraud,the brooks action bars walburn action,even if walburn complaint incorporates somewhat different details.id.at grynberg koch gateway pipeline,cir united states ex rel.hampton healthcare,lujan,at.both complaints allege that lockheed defrauded the government in violation of the false claims act the brooks relator alleges that lockheed falsified,concealed and destroyed documentation relating to plant management and operations and knowingly submitted these false records and statements to the government,all in an effort to fraudulently induce government payment under lockheed contract to operate the portsmouth plant.walburn alleges that lockheed maintained its department of energy accreditation by knowingly concealing its practice of assign ing dosages to a person that differed from the dosages that were read from the dosimeter that the same person was wearing,and then used the department of energy accreditation,which had been falsely or fraudulently obtained to receive payments under the operating agreements for the portsmouth plant.
in comparing the two complaints,the district court concluded that the broad fraudulent scheme alleged in the brooks complaint encompassed the specific subset of fraud regarding the falsification of radiation dosage readings alleged by walburn.the district court conclusion,although undoubtedly correct,is ultimately unremarkabl
