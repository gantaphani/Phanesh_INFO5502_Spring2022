plaintiffs in this matter are shareholders in merrill lynch focus twenty fund,mlf.mlf is a maryland corporation registered as an investment company under the investment company act of ica.et mlf is one of a complex of funds managed and advised by defendant,fund asset management,fam,a merrill lynch and company,ml controlled entity.

when reviewing a district court decision to grant a motion to dismiss,we view the facts in the light most favorable to the party.conley gibson,d in re bank of new york derivative,cir abramson pataki,cir comer cisneros,cir.however,we are not required to accept as true the legal conclusions or unwarranted deductions of fact drawn by the party.hirsch arthur andersen,cir first nationwide bank gelt funding,cir james moore et,moore federal practice b ed.
we have said that where determination of the sufficiency of allegations of futility depends on the circumstances of the individual case,the standard of review for dismissals based on.is abuse of discretion.kaster modification,cir see also lewis graves,cir elfenbein gulf,cir.however,where a challenge is made to the legal precepts applied by the district court in making a discretionary determination,plenary review of the district court choice and interpretation of those legal precepts is appropriate see,fama comm r of corr,cir blasband rales,cir.
a derivative suit permits an individual shareholder to bring suit to enforce a corporate cause of action against officers,directors,and third parties.kamen kemper fin,d citing ross bernhard,d emphasis in original.thus,a derivative action permits an individual shareholder to protect the interests of the corporation from the misfeasance and malfeasance of faithless directors and managers.id.at.citing cohen beneficial loan.see also william meade fletcher et,fletcher cyclopedia of the law of private corporations,describing a derivative claim as an equitable device which developed to enable shareholders to enforce a corporate right that the corporation had either failed or refused to assert on its own behalf 
concerned about the potential for abuse of the remedy,however,equity courts established as a precondition for the suit that the shareholder demonstrate that the corporation itself had refused to proceed after suitable demand,unless excused by extraordinary conditions.kamen,at.citing ross,at.thus,in the usual case,a shareholder seeking to assert a claim on behalf of the corporation must first exhaust intracorporate remedies by making a demand on the directors to obtain the action desired.fletcher see also kamen,at.noting that a ll states require that a shareholder make a precomplaint demand on the directors yet most also excuse demand in limited circumstances.however,demand may be excused where a shareholder is able to show that demand would be futile.fletcher kamen,at.the specifics of what constitutes futility vary from state to state.see fletcher indicating that demand may be deemed futile if it would be directed to individuals who,by reason of hostile interest or participation in the alleged wrongdoing,can not be expected to institute litigation on behalf of the corporation.
the substantive law which determines whether demand is,in fact,futile is provided by the state of incorporation of the entity on whose behalf the plaintiff is seeking relief.see kamen,at.because mlf is a maryland corporation,maryland law applies to the futility analysis 
maryland requirements for a viable claim of demand futility are set forth in the maryland supreme court decision in werbowsky collomb.the werbowsky court,emphasizing the importance of the demand requirement,explicitly noted that demand futility is 
a very limited exception,to be applied only when the allegations or evidence clearly demonstrate,in a very particular manner,either that a demand,or a delay in awaiting a response to a demand,would cause irreparable harm to the corporation or a majority of the directors are so personally and directly conflicted or committed to the decision in dispute that they can not reasonably be expected to respond to a demand in good faith and within the ambit of the business judgment rule.
plaintiffs challenge the district court reliance on werbowsky and argue that w hen applied to registered investment companies,the maryland law of demand is different than when applied to business corporations such as the entity involved in the werbowsky case.br.at.noting that under maryland law.ann.corps.ass ns,a director of an ica registered investment company is independent if he is not an interested person as defined by the ica plaintiffs argue that the inverse is also a director is not independent if he is an interested person within the definition of the ica.drawing from ica a a i,which defines an interested person as an affiliated person of the company,ica a c,which defines an affiliated person as any person directly or indirectly controlling,controlled by,or under common control with the investment company and ica a,which defines control as the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company,plaintiffs argue that all the directors of mlf are controlled by fam and ml by virtue primarily of the very large director salaries paid to them as the result of their having been selected by ml to serve as directors of its managed funds.according to plaintiffs argument,the directors for those reasons are interested persons under the ica and thus by definition fail the test of maryland law,for the consequence that demand upon them is excused for futility.
the problem with plaintiffs argument is that no authority for it can be found in maryland law.although classifies as independent a director who is not interested under the ica,this by no means suggests that every person who is interested unde
