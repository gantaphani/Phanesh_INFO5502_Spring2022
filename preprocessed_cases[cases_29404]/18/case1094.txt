woodruff printing,woodruff printing was incorporated in and throughout its incorporation was wholly owned by members of the woodruff family.rex woodruff owned controlling shares of woodruff printing and managed the corporation until some time in the.during,the time period at issue herein,mark woodruff,rex woodruff son,was the president of woodruff printing.
smith began working for woodruff printing in,and he ultimately became the corporation general manager.smith left woodruff printing in,but later was contacted by rex and mark woodruff and asked to return.smith went back to work for woodruff printing in january.mark woodruff wanted smith to return as accounting manager,but smith insisted that he could only help woodruff printing if he were general manager and put in charge of overall operations.mark woodruff understood that upon smith return,all of woodruff printing departments would report to smith and smith would be making most of the decisions in the operation areas.after smith return to woodruff printing in,smith was also woodruff printing primary contact with the internal revenue service irs for a system smith set up to pay employment taxes electronically.smith was aware from reviewing woodruff printing records prior to his return that woodruff printing financial situation was bleak.
in june,however,smith sent a memorandum to mark woodruff in which he made projections that woodruff printing would have positive net income for.yet by july or august,many of woodruff printing suppliers began demanding payment on delivery.as a result,mark woodruff developed priorities that favored making payments to two of woodruff printing bank lenders,to woodruff printing landlord,and to certain of the materials suppliers.in august,an employee of woodruff printing accounting department sent an to smith and mark woodruff in which she detailed woodruff printing unpaid tax liabilities,including sales taxes,state taxes,and federal employment taxes.according to the,there were then unpaid employment taxes for june and july in a total amount of.despite this unpaid amount,no payments were made to the irs during august.
after mark woodruff received the,he held a meeting with the accounting department employee and smith.mark woodruff testified that he came away from that meeting with the understanding that the accounting department would continue to work on the tax problem.later in the fall of,however,mark woodruff found delinquency notices from the irs in the accounting department.in late october,mark woodruff sent an to smith asking smith to prepare and provide a schedule of payments to be made for the next two months for all woodruff printing accounts payable.in that,mark woodruff pointed out that woodruff printing had paid tax penalties for being late on taxes,and that taxes should always be kept current.
at some point near the end of,mark woodruff informed other woodruff family members about woodruff printing tax problem.it was determined that mark woodruff would monitor woodruff printing payments to creditors more closely,and it was agreed that smith should limit his check writing to amounts less than.mark woodruff testified,however,that he never limited smith authority to pay employment taxes via electronic transfers.the united states also introduced evidence at trial that smith continued to write checks to woodruff printing creditors in amounts larger than.
mark woodruff testimony was inconsistent,at best.he testified that in and,the standard operating procedure was for smith to discuss with him the cash flow problem and the priorities for determining what should be paid.he later testified that in,he and smith discussed how to handle the taxes,and that his strategy then was to keep the presses rolling.he also testified that in,he made the final decision as to which creditors should be paid,and that he was the one who decided to pay or to not pay taxes in.in sum,his testimony at trial alternated between stating that he and smith discussed which bills to pay,and stating that he decided which bills to pay.
it is undisputed that smith was aware throughout the latter part of,and all of until woodruff printing ceased operations,that woodruff printing federal employment taxes were not being paid.at one point smith advised mark woodruff to not pay bank loans and to pay the irs,but smith testified he did not pay the payroll taxes because in july mark woodruff told smith to defer paying the payroll taxes in order to keep the business operating by paying suppliers.during the period in question,there were insufficient funds available to pay all creditors and also pay all taxes.smith testified that he reported to mark woodruff,got payment priorities from mark woodruff,and did not have authority to override mark woodruff.
woodruff printing bookkeeper testified in support of smith.she stated that during,mark woodruff creditor payment priorities were to first pay two bank loans,and then to pay vendors.she also testified that mark woodruff had the final authority in woodruff printing,and that in meetings during,mark woodruff had the final say as to which creditors would be paid.she further testified that in august,she had a discussion with smith about how much was owed to the irs for payroll taxes,and she testified that she discussed the tax problem with mark woodruff three or four times in.finally,she testified that rex and mark woodruff had ultimate authority over the management and finances of woodruff printing.
drew elkins,a former employee of woodruff printing,offered to purchase woodruff printing in march,but his offer was rejected by rex and mark woodruff.elkins testified that smith handled most operational problems,but that mark woodruff had the final word as the owner of woodruff printing.elkins also testified that on a couple of occasions smith had generated checks for a tax deal and given them to mark woodruff to sign,but that mark woodruff refused.elkins testified,however,that he did not know that employment taxes were set up by woodruff printing to be paid electronically throughout.
woodruff printing eventually ceased operations in.the irs made assessments against smith pursuant to,after making a determination that smith was a person responsible for withholding,accounting for,and paying taxes withheld from the wages of the employees of woodruff printing for the last two quarters of and the first three quarters of,who willfully failed to do so.the total assessments made against smith were.smith paid a portion of the assessment and then filed suit,seeking refund of that amount.the united states counterclaimed for amounts still owed 
judgment as a matter of law 
smith timely moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.at,and on appeal he continues to assert that he is entitled to judgment on the facts on the issue of responsibility.aplt.br.at.

under a and a,employers are required to withhold federal social security and income taxes from wages paid to employees,and to remit those withheld amounts to the irs on a regular basis.if an employer withholds these payroll taxes also known as taxes,but fails to pay them over to the government,the employee is nevertheless credited with having paid the taxes,and the government may not require any additional payment from the employee.slodov united states,d.
the irs may then effect payment of the withheld taxes from the employer,via.id.at.t he officers or employees of the employer responsible for effectuating the collection and payment of taxes who willfully fail to do so are made personally liable to a penalty equal to the amount of the delinquent taxes.see also taylor,cir when an officer or employee of a corporation fails to remit withheld taxes to the government,he may be subject,inter alia,to the penalty provisions of.
section of the internal revenue code provides 
any person required to collect,truthfully account for,and pay over any tax imposed by this title who willfully fails to collect such tax,or truthfully account for and pay over such tax,or willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any such tax or the payment thereof,shall,in addition to other penalties provided by the law,be liable to a penalty equal to the total amount of the tax evaded,or not collected,or not accounted for and paid over.

section b defines person as an officer or employee of a corporation,or a member or employee of a partnership,who as such officer,employee,or member is under a duty to perform the act in respect of which the violation occurs.b.the term responsible person has been widely discussed 
courts have generally given broad interpretation to the term responsible person under section.a person is responsible within the meaning of the statute if that person is required to collect,truthfully account for or pay over any taxes withheld from the wages of a company employees.the responsible person generally is,but need not be,a managing officer or employee,and there may be more than one responsible person.indicia of responsibility include the holding of corporate office,control over financial affairs,the authority to disburse corporate funds,stock ownership,and the ability to hire and fire employees.among other things,therefore,a corporate officer or employee is responsible if he or she has significant,though not necessarily exclusive,authority in the general management and fiscal decisionmaking of the corporation.

the evidence at trial showed that smith was the general manager of woodruff printing during and.smith came back to woodruff printing in,insisting that he be placed in charge of overall operations.smith had the responsibility to oversee the finance and accounting functions at woodruff printing during the period.during,smith had the independent authority to draw checks on woodruff printing bank accounts.although there was testimony that smith check writing authority was limited in to,the irs introduced evidence at trial that smith wrote a substantial number of checks in that were for amounts larger than.there was also testimony that mark woodruff never limited smith authority to electronically pay the payroll taxes.
smith argues that he was simply doing what he was told by mark woodruff,and that he had no power over creditor priority at woodruff printing.however,it is clear that smith was aware during the quarters at issue in and that woodruff printing payroll taxes were not being paid and smith paid other creditors rather than paying the payroll taxes.in addition,although mark woodruff and smith had regular meetings discussing creditor priorities,mark woodruff also testified that he did not limit smith authority to make electronic funds transfers for payment of payroll taxes at any time during or.and,mark woodruff sent an to smith in october stating that taxes should always be kept current.
the fact that mark woodruff had more control over creditor payment than smith is not determinative significant control is all that is required.see denbo,at however,while it is clear that allred exercised greater control over the corporation than denbo,section does not confine liability for the unpaid taxes only to the single officer with the greatest or the closest control or authority over corporate affairs.it suffices that denbo had significant,as opposed to absolute,control of the corporation finances.internal quotations omitted see also taylor,at if an individual possesses sufficient indicia of responsibility,he is a responsible person under regardless whether he has the final say as to which creditors should be paid or has the specific job within the corporate structure to see that the taxes are paid over to the government.the crucial inquiry is whether the person had the effective power to pay the is,whether he had the actual authority or ability,in view of his status within the corporation,to pay the taxes owed.liability under extends to all responsible corporate officers or employees,not just to the single most responsible individual.internal quotations and citations omitted.
smith relies on vinick united states,cir,in support of his argument that the facts established at trial do not show that he was a responsible person.in vinick,the first circuit stated the central question in determining whether a taxpayer is a responsible person is whether the taxpayer had the power to pay the taxes during the quarters in question.id.at.the first circuit found that the taxpayer had not exercised any authority over which creditors were paid that another individual was in charge of the operations that merely because the taxpayer had the title of corporate treasurer,because the substance of his work involved no authority over finances,the titular authority was not heavily relevant and that the taxpayer having authority was only relevant if the taxpayer was in a position to exercise his authority,did the taxpayer have access to the checkbook.id.at.
the first circuit repeatedly noted in vinick that the central question was whether the taxpayer had routine involvement in the management such that the taxpayer had control over daily operations.id.at.the vinick court concluded absent a finding that the taxpayer possessed actual,exercised authority over the company financial matters,including the duty and power to determine which creditors to pay,as a matter of law he can not be a responsible person.id.at.
contrary to smith assertion,the vinick case does not support his argument that he is not a responsible person.unlike the taxpayer involvement in the company in vinick,smith did have involvement of woodruff printing.smith was the general manager throughout and he wrote checks to pay woodruff printing accounts payable.smith met routinely with mark woodruff about the payroll tax liability.it is true that there is conflicting testimony about how much power smith had over creditor priority.however,the standard is whether smith had the effective power to pay the is,whether he had the actual authority or ability,in view of his status within the corporation,to pay the taxes owed.taylor,at.it is undisputed that smith authority to make the electronic payments of the payroll taxes was never limited,and mark woodruff directed smith at one point to keep the taxes current.to be a responsible person,smith need not have had exclusive control over the payments made to the accounts payable of woodruff printing.
although the result here appears harsh,the statute at issue,and the line of cases from our circuit interpreting that statute,require us to affirm the district court denial of smith motion for judgment as a matter of law.this is especially true considering the standard of review by which we are bound.see loughridge,at stating that upon review of a motion for judgment as a matter of law,the reviewing court must make all reasonable inferences in favor of the party and that j udgment as a matter of law is appropriate only if the evidence points but one way and is susceptible to no reasonable inferences which may support the nonmoving party position.
although it is a close case,considering the fact that some of the traditional indicia of responsibility are was not a stockholder in woodruff printing and it was a disputed fact whether smith had authority to indicia are merely factors to be considered amongst the totality of circumstances.in denbo we emphasized that courts,including our court,have generally given a broad interpretation to the term responsible person for purposes of liability and denbo states that the responsible person generally satisfies the listed indicia,but need not in every case.given our scope of review,we can not conclude the district court erred in denying smith motion for judgment as a matter of law.when referencing the relevant indicia of a responsible person,we can not say the jury verdict was against the great weight of all the evidence.
motion for a new trial based on jury instructions 
after the jury verdict against him,smith moved for a new trial pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,on the basis that the jury instructions given by the district court were in error.see.at district court order denying smith motion for a new trial.in reviewing challenges to jury instructions,this court must determine whether the jury instructions viewed as a whole properly stated the applicable law and directed the jury to consider matters within its province.gardetto mason,cir.a district court decision to give a particular jury instruction is reviewed for abuse of discretion ultimately,however,we apply a de novo standard of review to determine the propriety of an individual jury instruction to which objection was made at time of trial.reed landstar ligon,cir internal quotations omitted.
smith makes multiple challenges to the jury instructions,alleging that the district court jury instruction number misstated the law defining responsible person the district court jury instruction number misstated the law regarding orders from a superior the district court erred by failing to give smith proposed instructions regarding infusing capital into the corporation,corporations,and a reasonable cause defense and the alleged errors in totality constituted cumulative error.
jury instruction number responsible person defined 
smith contends that the district court jury instruction number failed to accurately state the law defining responsible person.jury instruction number stated,in pertinent part 
the term responsible person includes any person who is connected or associated with the in such a manner that he has the power to see that the taxes are paid,or the power to make significant decisions concerning the corporation,or determines that creditors are to be paid and when they are to be paid.
determining who is a responsible person is fact specific.the facts of each may and frequently do vary.
the term responsible person may include corporate officers,employees,or members of the board of directors.but not every corporate officer,employee,or board member is necessarily a responsible party.the meaning of the term is very broad and is not limited to the person who actually prepares the payroll checks or the tax returns.the responsible person need not even be authorized to draw checks for the corporation so long as the person has the power to decide who will get such checks.in other words,the responsible person is any person who can effectively control the finances,or determine the bills that should or should not be paid.
smith argues that the first sentence the term responsible person includes any person who is connected or associated with the who determines that creditors are to be paid should have used the word which in place of the word that to state who determines which creditors are to be paid rather than who determines that creditors are to be paid as stated in the instruction given.smith also argues that the instruction incorrectly implied that authority was an indicia for responsibility because it stated in other words,the responsible person is any person who can effectively control the finances,or determine that bills should or should not be paid.smith contends these errors amount to a misstatement of the law defining the phrase responsible person.
smith arguments are not persuasive.the determination that a creditor should be paid necessarily requires a determination which creditor should be paid.in addition,the instruction correctly informs the jury that the definition is,tells the jury that the responsible person will have the power to decide who will get such checks,and informs the jury that the responsible person is any person who can determine the bills that should or should not be paid.see taylor,at if an individual possesses sufficient indicia of responsibility,he is a responsible person under regardless whether he has the final say as to which creditors should be paid or has the specific job within the corporate structure to see that the taxes are paid over to the government.the crucial inquiry is whether the person had the effective power to pay the is,whether he had the actual authority or ability,in view of his status within the corporation,to pay the taxes owed.internal citations omitted.
reading the instruction in its entirety,the instruction makes clear that it is not mere authority that determines whether an individual is a responsible person,but that the responsible person must have a higher degree of control over the corporation finances.see denbo,at indicia of responsibility include the holding of corporate office,control over financial affairs,the authority to disburse corporate funds,stock ownership,and the ability to hire and fire employees.among other things,therefore,a corporate officer or employee is responsible if he or she has significant,though not necessarily exclusive,authority in the general management and fiscal decisionmaking of the corporation.internal quotation omitted.the jury instruction properly stated the applicable law.gardetto,at.
furthermore,our review is to determine whether,taken as a whole,the jury instructions accurately state the governing law.id.any ambiguity left by jury instruction number is immediately rectified by jury instruction number,which stated 
a corporate officer or employee is a responsible person if he or she has significant,though not necessarily exclusive,authority in the general management and fiscal of the corporation.
whether a person is a responsible person must be decided by the unique facts of each case.indicia of responsibility include the holding of corporate office,control over financial affairs,the authority to disburse corporate funds,and the ability to hire and fire employees.if an individual possesses sufficient indicia of responsibility,he or she is a responsible person under the law regardless of whether he or she has the final say as to which creditors should be paid or has the specific job within the corporate structure to see that the taxes are paid over to the government.the crucial inquiry is whether the person had the effective power to pay the is whether he or she had the actual authority or ability,in view of his or her status within the corporation,to pay the taxes owed.
at.jury instruction,which is not challenged by smith on appeal,reinforces the point made to the jury in instruction number the factual finding that an individual is a responsible person is and based on the unique facts of each case.jury instruction also reinforces the ultimate question whether smith had the effective authority to pay the is whether he had the actual authority or ability,in view of his stat
