in this case we hold that where the bylaws of a pharmacy corporation provide that one stockholder must give another a right of first refusal on the sale of any stock,it is a breach of fiduciary duty for the selling stockholder to attempt to sell to a third party in violation of the right of first refusal.we thus remand the case back to the trial court to ascertain the proper damages,both to the corporation itself and to the other stockholder,for such a breach.
facts and litigation history 
in,tien le and his wife le owned percent of the corporate shares of newland pharmacy,while lieu pham owned the other percent.corporate bylaws obligated the les to give pham written notice of any intent to sell or transfer.the bylaws also gave pham a right of first refusal on any sale based on that notice of intent,but did not specify the amount of time in which she could exercise her right of first refusal.under the bylaws,the shares could not be transferred to someone other than pham at a price less than,or on terms more favorable than,that stated on the notice of intent to sell or transfer.if so,the transfer would be null and void.
on or about july,pham sent a letter to the california state board of pharmacy to the effect that she would like to buy out the les percent share of the business.
two days july les gave written notice to pham by certified mail of their intent to sell their percent share to paul and kimngang hoang for a total of,cash at transfer.the letter required a written offer from pham within days of the notice.
pham responded with a letter dated july,which was clear that she wanted to buy the les shares.in that letter she said that she wished to retain control of our corporation in my stewardship and will offer to purchase your shares in the corporation.pham letter also said,however,that she would need days to locate appropriate legal counsel and within which she would exercise my option to purchase your share.
pham letter of july was not received by le until august.on that day,after receiving pham letter,the les sold their shares to paul and kimngang hoang.however,the price the les received was,considerably less than the offered to pham.nor was it a cash sale.the hoangs were allowed to make installment payments on the.
paul hoang showed up for a board meeting on september,but pham refused to recognize him as a legitimate director and shareholder and would not allow him to review the corporation books and records.paul hoang did not file a change of ownership form with the california board of pharmacy,an omission which prompted a cease and desist order from the board that closed the pharmacy down for about three months beginning in march.the pharmacy was also on probation until.
the les and hoangs sued pham,contending that the transfer to the hoangs was valid in accordance with newland pharmacy bylaws,also alleging that,after the transfer,pham had failed to permit the inspection of books and records as demanded,failed to file appropriate documents with state agencies,and converted revenue from newland pharmacy for her own personal use.
pham countered with her own,on behalf of herself and the corporation alleging,among other things,breach of fiduciary duty against the les and fraud against paul hoang based on statements he made that he really was the new owner of fifty percent of the pharmacy shares.
after a bench trial,pham prevailed on the les and hoang complaint,while the les and hoang prevailed on pham.that is,the court,in its statement of decision,ruled that the les attempted transfer of shares to the hoangs was null and void because it did not comply with the corporate bylaws.it was obvious,after all,that the les had attempted to sell the shares to the hoangs for a better price as distinct from and on better terms installments rather than cash than had been offered pham in the notice of intent to sell.
as to pham and the corporation against the les for breach of fiduciary duty,the statement of decision concluded that they had failed to carry their burden of proof.the trial judge wrote generally speaking,at trial,little evidence was adduced in support of the.she also wrote,however,that pham did not have an adequate opportunity to exercise her right of first refusal given that le had unilaterally demanded that the written offer be made within days.
as to pham fraud claim against paul hoang,the court held that pham had relied on any misrepresentation from hoang.pham and the corporation,asserting the court erred in exonerating the les on her fiduciary duty claim and hoang on the fraud claim have brought this appeal.
ii.discussion 
a.the standard of review 
this is one of those cases where some exposition on the topic of the standard of review is necessary to sort out the case.the obvious starting point is that,since pham and the corporation are challenging a judgment after a court trial,they initially face the formidable substantial evidence standard of review.
the substantial evidence standard has two components,and both work generally against appellants first,all conflicts in the evidence must be resolved in favor of the prevailing party second,all reasonable inferences from the evidence all conflicts already having been properly resolved must be drawn in favor of the prevailing party.see eisenberg,et,cal.practice guide civil appeals and writs the rutter group.
we should note,then,that pham and the corporation are necessarily in the position of saying that the evidence,despite all the resolution of conflicts and having all reasonable inferences drawn against them,nevertheless compels a judgment in their favor,on the two issues they have raised in this appeal the les fiduciary duty and paul hoang alleged fraud.not surprisingly,the brief filed on behalf of the les and hoang lavishes attention on the substantial evidence rule.the les and hoang are most certainly correct that if we find any substantial evidence obviating either a any fraud on hoang part or b the existence of a fiduciary duty,or the subsequent breach of a fiduciary duty if there is one,we must affirm the judgment.
however,if one digs a little example,by continuing to read the remainder of the respondent turns out that the substantial evidence rule is actually irrelevant in the context of the issue of whether the les owed a fiduciary duty as shareholders to pham,and whether any such duty was breached.there is no conflict as to the facts of ownership of the corporation.there is no conflict in the evidence regarding the sale or,better,attempted sale of the les half of the corporation to the hoangs.and there is no conflict in the evidence as regards the consequences of that attempted sale,namely a cease and desist order from the california state board of pharmacy closing the business for about three months beginning in march 
thus,the les actual argument on the fiduciary duty issue presented in their brief turns out not to be a factual one at all,the les do say there was evidence that we did really own any shares at all,or that we offered our shares to pham at the same price and terms as we offered to the hoangs,but a legal one the les assert that by virtue of the undisputed fact that they were shareholders in the is,were not majority had no fiduciary duties to the corporation or to the other shareholder.of course,when the facts are undisputed and the question on appeal is wholly a legal issue,the proper standard of review is independent review,people superior court cal th,decker because dismissal of attempted murder charges was based on undisputed facts,it constituted a legal conclusion subject to independent review on appeal.
the trial court comments in its statement of decision,then,that at trial,little evidence was adduced in support of the and pham and the corporation had failed to carry their burden of proof,while understandable,miss the mark in analyzing the problem of whether the les had a fiduciary duty toward pham as regards the bylaws provision.
the comments were quite understandable if one thinks about how the trial judge experienced the unfolding of the trial.precisely because the relevant facts involving the attempted sale were undisputed,most of them were pres
