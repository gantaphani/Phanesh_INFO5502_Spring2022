design strategies,design appeals from a judgment entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york marrero.the action arises out of the alleged diversion of a corporate opportunity by marc davis davis during the course of his employment with design.according to design,the corporate opportunity was diverted to info technologies web solutions it web,with the collusion of info technologies,infotech and john goullet goullet,chief executive officer of both infotech and it web collectively,the it defendants.davis was employed by it web following the alleged diversion.
the district court,in an order dated april,precluded design from presenting evidence in support of its claim for lost profits,pursuant to.b,on the ground that it had not disclosed the computation of those lost profits,as required by.a c.in that same order,the district court also rejected a demand by design for a jury trial,the district court having found that all of design remaining claims were equitable and therefore that no jury trial right existed.following a bench trial,the district court concluded,in an order dated august,that davis a had not diverted a corporate opportunity b had not engaged in unfair competition c had breached a fiduciary duty of loyalty,requiring the forfeiture of four weeks of salary d was not liable for overpaid commissions and e had not been unjustly enriched and that f the it defendants had not aided and abetted davis breach of fiduciary duty and g a claim for punitive damages was unsupported.
background 
i.the factual framework 
design is in the business of providing trained personnel to companies needing technical support on specific projects requiring computer technology services.design hires individuals on a contract basis as needed per project and then assigns those individuals to work at a design client site under the client supervision and on the specific temporary projects and duties determined by the client.this aspect of the computer technology industry is known as staffing.design also claims to be involved in the solutions aspect of the provision of the services of trained personnel employed by design on its premises and using the computers and other technical equipment supplied at design laboratory on specific projects to design and develop websites for clients in accordance with given specifications.
marsh newmark is the president of design and has been its sole director and shareholder since the company founding in.newmark hired davis in to work for design as a sales representative and later as sales manager.davis was an employee without a written agreement and was not subject to any restrictive covenant of confidentiality,or.from though february,davis earned an annual salary of.davis commissions in the last four calendar years of his employment at design were and,respectively.
sometime during the summer of,davis was advised by frank murphy,a senior employee and one of his business contacts at microsoft,that microsoft was cooperating with an entity known as brill media brill in a venture that would entail the solicitation of companies for participation in a computer technology project.the project,which came to be known as contentville,called for the creation of a website,powered by microsoft software,to engage in electronic commerce in books and related products in competition with similar businesses operated by and.the company ultimately chosen to work on contentville would be required to provide solutions work.
design contends that davis,while still employed at design,diverted this corporate opportunity from design to it web and subsequently benefitted from that diversion by accepting an offer of employment with it web.design also contends that it web and its sister company,infotech,along with goullet,colluded with davis to divert the contentville corporate opportunity away from design and ultimately hired davis.moreover,design argues that davis was paid a bounty in the form of a commission on the contentville contract once he was hired by it web.davis responded that he notified design of the contentville corporate opportunity first and referred it web to microsoft only after newmark indicated that he was not interested in the project and after microsoft and brill made it clear that a staffing company like design would not be qualified to work on the contentville project.
ii.proceedings in the district court 
design filed its complaint on july,pleading claims against davis for breach of employment agreement,breach of fiduciary duties,unfair competition,and unjust enrichment.design pleaded claims against the it defendants for aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty,wrongful inducement of a breach of fiduciary duty,and interference with employment.design also pleaded a claim of conspiracy to breach fiduciary duties against both davis and the it defendants.design sought several forms of relief.first,design sought injunctive relief against davis and others to preclude davis from a using design documents containing confidential information b soliciting any business from a client of design that davis had contact with at design and c competing with design.design also sought the imposition of a constructive trust on all revenues that all defendants derived from the alleged breach of fiduciary duty,as well as restitution and exemplary damages from davis.finally,design sought damages in an amount to be determined at trial.
following the completion of discovery,the parties for summary judgment.the district court,in a decision and order,dated june,found that the record in this case raises issues of material fact with regard to whether contentville was a corporate opportunity for design,whether davis breached his fiduciary duty to design,and whether the it defendants knew or should have known about davis alleged breach.specifically,the district court found,in regard to design claims of breach of fiduciary duty,unfair competition,unjust enrichment,aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty,and wrongful inducement of a breach of fiduciary duties,that there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether contentville,absent davis alleged breach,could have been awarded to design,whether contentville was a corporate opportunity and whether,and to what extent,davis informed design and newmark about contentville,whether davis breached his fiduciary duty.the district court determined,however,that no claim arising from the alleged breach of employment agreement could be made out because there was no written agreement covering davis employment nor was there any support for finding an oral agreement between design and davis.finally,the district court found that no claim for conspiracy to breach a fiduciary duty could be proven because some of the parties to the alleged,the it not independently owe a duty to design.
in a subsequent order,dated february,responding to the motion by davis and the it defendants to strike design jury demand,the district court found 
t o the extent that design seeks monetary damages for the alleged misappropriation of a corporate opportunity and diversion of corporate assets in the form of the legal remedy of lost profits,in other words,corporate revenues design would have earned out of its business operations but for defendants alleged wrongful conduct,it is entitled to a trial by jury.the court finds that design is not,however,entitled to a trial by jury on any claims with respect to which it seeks only the equitable remedies of disgorgement of profits,restitution,the imposition of a trust,an accounting,exemplary damages,or permanent injunction.
in an order dated april,responding to the motion by davis and the it defendants to preclude design from introducing evidence of its alleged lost profits at trial,the district court found that design had not provided sufficient discovery regarding the amount of or basis for calculating damages based on alleged lost profits to enable it to seek those damages at trial.in accordance with its order of february,the district court therefore held that design was not entitled to a jury trial,because lost profits were the only compensatory damages that it had sought,and the remainder of its remedies were equitable.the court then determined that the central issue for trial is whether or not davis provided design with sufficient notice of and opportunity to compete for a contract with microsoft.
the case proceeded to a bench trial,after which the district court made findings of fact and conclusions of law in a decision and order dated august.the district court found,based on the testimony of murphy and davis,that davis initially sought to procure the contentville contract for design from the time he learned about it until sometime in november.the district court also found that davis had informed newmark about the contentville opportunity but that newmark apparently was at best ambiguous about making the necessary initial capital investment and that it was not until much later,when davis believed that design was not prepared to pursue the contentville business under the terms established by microsoft,that davis turned to it web.
the district court found that in or before early november,davis ceased attempting to solicit the contentville contract for design and,instead,commenced trying to promote it web for the contract.the district court further found that davis took the additional steps of contacting attempting to contact microsoft employee john gomez gomez directly on numerous occasions in late november and early december to encourage him to consider it web for the contentville contract.and,most importantly,the district court found that design would not have obtained the contentville contract even if davis had not promoted it web.the district court reasoned that this was so because design did not satisfy the vendor requirements microsoft and brill had established or the readiness timetable microsoft sought with regard to the contentville contract.according to gomez,prior web solutions business experience and an operational computer lab were firm requirements,and design lacked the experience and the operational capacity to fulfill those requirements.
microsoft awarded the contentville contract to it web in of.it web extended an offer of employment to davis by letter dated december,which davis accepted in january.davis began working for it web in early february.the district court determined that,although davis had first interviewed for a position with the it defendants on september,there was no evidence that the it defendants encouraged davis to provide them with information concerning the contentville contract,or that they in any way affirmatively sought his assistance in obtaining it.additionally,the district court found that no infotech or it web officer ever offered davis a job or payment in exchange for referral of the contentville business or other information about opportunities with microsoft.finally,the district court found that,although infotech was a competitor of design in the staffing aspect of the web business,it web and design were not competitors in the solutions aspect of the business because design had no substantial competence or volume of business in providing web solutions.indeed,the district court found that,between and,of design revenue came from staffing services.
based on the foregoing findings,the district court found that contentville was not a corporate opportunity for design because design would not have been able to meet microsoft demands for the project,newmark had refused to take tangible steps necessary to expand design business to include providing solutions services,and because davis had initially promoted design for the contentville contract.the district court also found that claims sounding in unfair competition were not sustained because design had not presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the contentville contract represented a benefit or property right that belonged to it in any real or legal sense and because the record does not support a finding that during the period of his employment davis set himself up to engage in competition with design on his own,or that he did so in a conspiracy with others.
similarly,the district court found that recovery for unjust enrichment was not warranted because davis was not enriched by a misappropriation and use of a tangible benefit or property that belonged to design,because contentville did not constitute a corporate opportunity for design,and because design would not have been awarded the contentville contract notwithstanding davis disloyalty.as a result,there is no basis on which to find that davis misconduct was at design expense.
the district court,however,did find that davis had breached his fiduciary duty to design by being disloyal to his employer.the district court found that davis advocacy on behalf of it web as a partner with microsoft for the contentville project was inconsistent with his duty of loyalty to design.the district court determined that i n order for davis efforts to advance it web prospects as regards the contentville opportunity to constitute a breach of his duty of loyalty to design,it must further be established that design and it web were competitors.although the district court had already found that it web and design were not competitors in the solutions aspect of the business,the district court,relying on elco shoe,sisk,noted that even if strictly speaking design and it web were not themselves competitors in the web solutions niche of the computer industry,they had sufficiently conflicting business interests at the relevant time to be deemed competitors in the present context.the district court also emphasized that davis had,at the time he began promoting it web to microsoft,already interviewed for a job there,and thus,he had strong personal reasons and business incentives for it web to be selected by microsoft for the contentville services.
having determined that davis violated his duty of loyalty,the district court turned to the question of remedy.relying on this court reasoning in phansalkar andersen weinroth,cir,the district court determined that forfeiture of salary earned during the period of disloyalty was the appropriate remedy.specifically,the district court reasoned that new york law requires forfeiture of salary earned during a period of disloyalty,but not during periods of loyal employment that may follow the period of disloyalty.moreover,relying on phansalkar and musico champion credit,cir,the district court found that davis would not be required to forfeit any commissions earned,even during the period of disloyalty.the district court fixed davis period of disloyalty from of,when he first began to promote it web to microsoft,to of,when he ceased making contact with microsoft.the district court fixed exact dates of november to december,calculated that davis had earned,exclusive of commissions,during this period,and set that amount for forfeiture.
the district court,however,refused to award punitive damages in connection with davis disloyalty because there was 
no evidence in the record to support a finding of the level of extreme moral culpability necessary for an award of punitive damages.in this regard,the c ourt considers particularly compelling its finding that davis initially sought to procure the contentville project solutions work for design,that he informed newmark about the opportunity and newmark apparently was at best ambiguous about making the necessary initial capital investment,and that it was not until much later,when davis believed that design was not prepared to pursue the contentville business under the terms established by microsoft,that davis turned to it web.
the district court found,in relation to design claim that davis was overpaid commissions on a wholly separate deal with merrill lynch while at design,that design did not plead this claim in its complaint or include it in its initial disclosures,nor has it offered any legal theory on the basis of which the court could sustain such a claim.accordingly,design claim for overpaid commissions is dismissed.
finally,the district court refused to award attorneys fees because design had not cited,nor was the court aware of,any basis,such as an agreement between the parties,statute,or court rule,on which to award attorneys fees in this case.
judgment was entered on august.design filed a notice of appeal on september.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to.
exclusion of lost profits evidence 
on october,design filed its initial disclosure,as required by rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure.design listed as claimed damages 
all monies paid to marc davis for salaries based upon breach of fiduciary relationship with plaintiff.
all monies earned by marc davis as a result of unlawful diversion of business from design strategy to the corporate defendants.
all profits earned by the defendants as a result of the unlawful diversion of business from the plaintiff to the defendants,which business was generated with microsoft corporation.
attorneys fees for the prosecution of this action.
punitive damages.
interest costs and disbursements.
the it defendants first set of interrogatories and request for the production of documents,dated november,requested a statement 
in detail of each financial expense or loss allegedly incurred by plaintiffs as a result of any acts or omissions of the it defendants in this action,giving 
a a description of its nature 
b the amount 
c the date incurred 
d the amount of similar estimated future expenses or losses,if any.
design responded to this request on march,repeating the language of its initial disclosure,and adding the descriptive category of l oss of sale of design strategy,under which it affixed various not less than amounts for each descriptive category of claimed damages.
well after the close of discovery,in a proposed pretrial order submitted shortly before trial,design disclosed two of whom it disclosed as an expert testify regarding design lost profits.the defendants filed a motion in limine to preclude design from offering these witnesses or any other evidence of its lost profits on the ground that lost profits had not been listed as a category of claimed damages in design initial disclosure or at any point during discovery,and thus,the offering of evidence or testimony as to lost profits was in violation of rules a c and a.the district court held a telephone conference on april,to resolve objections to these two witnesses and to resolve a question concerning the evidence of lost profits and the extent to which damages can be proven in this case.the district court noted that 
although design indicated that it might seek lost profits by referring to lost revenues in the first cause of action in the c omplaint for breach of employment agreement and thereby arguably put the defendants on notice that lost profits might be sought,design has not provided any specific computation of lost profits nor provided any evidence on the basis of which such computation might be made.
the district court written order of april,further explained that design initial disclosure statement,though describing the damages it sought with some specificity,did not mention lost profits.the district court ruled that design failure to abide by.a c meant that evidence of lost profits would not be admissible.
design objected that it had,in fact,turned over evidence from which a computation of damages could be financial records.when pressed,design argued that it was not obligated to provide a calculation of damages because the calculation of damages from these records would be simple arithmetic if our revenue is and our expenses are,then we have a percent profit margin,and that is the basis on which i would have our people testify.the district court corrected design,noting that rule required more of plaintiffs 
the court dweck design counsel,it is not as simple as simply providing the financial statements to the defendant without your providing as well a specific formula indicating how your theory of damages is supported.that is not something that the defendant is in a position to do for you.
the only way that you can establish that you suffered damages is to be able to set it forth in some theory and then support the theory with facts.simply providing documents to the defendant and assuming that somehow the defendant will divine what your alleged lost profits are by having documents is not sufficient.this court on that basis is persuaded that this record does not support that theory.
dweck i did think we were obligated to do their homework.
the court it is quite the opposite,dweck.you,the plaintiff,are the one who is asserting the damages.if you assert the damages and you claim that you suffered a certain amount of injury,it is for you,you have the burden of proof on injury and the amounts thereof,and they have to be calculated with reasonable certainty.so your saying that you provided documents to the defendant does go far enough in meeting your burden of proof on this issue.
in its written order of april,the district court again found that design had not complied with rule.the district court determined that design has not provided any justification for its failure to disclose information regarding the amount of,or basis for computing,its alleged lost profits,noting specifically design failed argument at the telephone conference.the district court further found that this failure was not harmless because discovery had been closed since october and because the trial date had already been postponed in part at design request.accordingly,
reopen ing discovery for purposes of investigating the subject of lost profits would inevitably result in further substantial delays in the resolution of this case and impose additional costs on defendants.defendants would thus be harmed if the c ourt were to permit design to pursue a lost profits theory of damages,in that defendants would be required either to postpone a trial for which they are otherwise prepared and which has already been significantly delayed,or proceed without having had the opportunity to conduct adequate discovery on this issue.
the district court also noted that 
i n violating rule a c,design has also failed to provide the c ourt with any basis on which to determine whether or not its alleged lost profits are capable of measurement based upon known reliable factors without undue speculation,ashland mgmt.janien,as new york law requires.the absence of any basis on which to make this determination further supports the c ourt holding that design may not pursue a lost profits theory of damages at trial.
in a lengthy footnote,the district court determined that it lacked discretion to decline to impose sanctions pursuant to rule c.specifically,the district court held that 
the plain language of rule c,indicate s that,while trial courts have discretion to determine whether or not a substantial justification exists and whether or not a failure to disclose is harmless,if the trial court finds that there is no substantial justification and the failure to disclose is not harmless,preclusion is mandatory.
b.a district court has wide discretion to impose sanctions,including severe sanctions,under federal rule of civil procedure,and its ruling will be reversed only if it constitutes an abuse of discretion.see patterson balsamico,cir this court reviews the district court exclusion of testimony under rule c for abuse of discretion.daval steel products,a div.of francosteel fakredine,cir discussing discretion under rule b.a district court abuses or exceeds the discretion accorded to it when its decision rests on an error of law such as application of the wrong legal principle or a clearly erroneous factual finding,or its not necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly erroneous factual be located within the range of permissible decisions.zervos verizon new york,cir footnote omitted.
design argues that it was not in violation of rule a c because i n the instant action there was no direct order to the plaintiff to calculate damages.the simplicity of taking design revenue and deducting the cost of operations from the financial statements would have yielded the gross profits.this is a misstatement both of the facts of this case and of rule a requirements.
rule a c of the federal rules of civil procedure provides that 
a party must,without awaiting a discovery request,provide to other parties a computation of any category of damages claimed by the disclosing party,making available for inspection and copying as under rule the documents or other evidentiary material,not privileged or protected from disclosure,on which such computation is based,including materials bearing on the nature and extent of injuries suffered emphasis added.
the district court finding that design had failed to comply with this rule was well within the proper range of its discretion.
first,as correctly noted by the district court,nowhere did design ever disclose lost profits as even a category of damages sought on its initial disclosure statement.although design complaint does include a generic reference to damages in its initial disclosure,design omitted any reference to its own lost profits as a measure of recompense,focusing instead on monies earned by the defendants.moreover,the record does not reflect any supplemental disclosures as required by rule e of the federal rules of civil procedure.the defendants were,therefore,without notice that such claims would be an issue until they were provided,shortly before the commencement of trial,with the names of two witnesses who would testify as to lost profits.
second,by its very terms rule a requires more than any financial statements it requires a computation,supported by documents.the need for computation and supporting documents is especially necessary in a case like this,where the damages claim is for lost profits from a project of a type with which the plaintiff had prior experience.design simple arithmetic calculation is wholly inadequate as a measure of damages,given that it is undisputed that,in order to perform on the project,design would have had to establish an entirely new computer lab and hire all new personnel in the space of two weeks.at the late point in the proceedings when design disclosed that it would be presenting witnesses,much greater detail than previously provided would have been necessary to satisfy rule a.see city county of san francisco,recognizing that rule a c anticipates supplemental disclosures with level of detail as discovery progresses.
third,rule a requires a party to provide a computation of any category of damages voluntarily,without awaiting a discovery request design failure to comply with this requirement was especially troubling because,as noted by the district court,the it defendants specifically requested a calculation of damages.
fourth,rule a requires a addition to providing a calculation of make available for inspection and copying as under rule the documents or other evidentiary material on which such computation is based.the advisory committee notes to rule a c accompanying its promulgation make clear that the rule imposes a burden of disclosure that includes the functional equivalent of a standing request for production under rule.a party claiming damages or other monetary relief must,in addition to disclosing the calculation of such damages,make available the supporting documents for inspection and copying as if a request for such material had been made under rule.advisory committee notes to amendments.design failed to disclose both a calculation of damages and the documents supporting that calculation.
design next argues that,even if it did violate rule,the district court applied the wrong standard to preclude its evidence under rule specifically,design asserts that,before a court may preclude evidence as a discovery sanction,it must find bad faith and callous disregard of the federal rules.see dipirro united states,d,precluding expert testimony under rule c is a drastic remedy and should only be applied in cases where the party conduct represents flagrant bad faith and callous disregard for the requirements of rule a b.as noted above,the district court decided there was no such requirement and observed that this court had not yet passed on this issue.see hein cuprum,de,cir we express no opinion as to whether a showing of bad faith is required before evidence may be excluded under rule c.since rule c by its terms does not require a showing of bad faith,we now hold that such a requirement should not be read into the rule.
in determining whether the district court abused its discretion in imposing the sanction under rule,we are governed by the standard set forth in patterson balsamico,cir.in patterson,two defendants violated rule a by not timely disclosing the names of witnesses they planned to call at trial.id.at.the district court granted the plaintiff motion to preclude,except as to one witness who was named in the original complaint and whose testimony reasonably could have been anticipated.id.on appeal to this court,we held that i n determining whether the district court acted within its discretion,this court must consider the party explanation for the failure to comply with the disclosure requirement the importance of the testimony of the precluded witness es the prejudice suffered by the opposing party as a result of having to prepare to meet the new testimony and the possibility of a continuance.id.citing softel,dragon med.scientific commc ns,cir brackets in patterson.thus,although a violation of the rule is not required in order to exclude evidence pursuant to rule,it can be taken into account as part of the party explanation for its failure to comply.
applying patterson to this case,we can not say that the district court abused its discretion when it determined that the sanction imposed was warranted under rule.although the second patterson factor favors design because design evidence of lost profits was essential to proving these damages,all of the other factors weigh heavily in favor of exclusion.design has not yet explained why it omitted lost profits as a category of damages in its initial disclosure the prejudice to the defendants in having to prepare for this evidence would have been severe,as discovery would have had to be reopened to determine whether design calculations were proper.the expert witness that design wanted to call also would have had to a prepare a report and b be qualified as an expert with regard to the calculation of damages.finally,weighing heavily on both the prejudice and possibility of continuance factors was the fact that discovery had been closed for approximately one and a half years,and at the time of the offer of expert testimony there was only a short time left before trial.on the facts before us,the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that sanctions,including severe sanctions,were warranted for design failure to abide by rule a c.
the district court did,however,err in its determination that preclusion is mandatory under rule c once the trial court finds that there is no substantial justification and the failure to disclose is not harmless.the language in two cases from our sister circuits is in conformity with this viewpoint finley marathon oil,cir,and wilson bradlees of new england,cir.in finley,the plaintiffs failed to disclose expert testimony intended for use as rebuttal evidence to the defendants within days of the defendant disclosure of his expert testimony in violation of.a c indeed,the plaintiffs missed the deadline for disclosure by months.id.at.the seventh circuit held that the district court in that case had not abused his discretion in refusing to permit the introduction of this evidence.id.the seventh circuit reasoned that 
rule c provides that a party that without substantial justification fails to disclose information required by rule a shall not,unless such failure is harmless,be permitted to use as evidence at a trial any information not so disclosed emphasis added.the sanction of exclusion is thus automatic and mandatory unless the party to be sanctioned can show that its violation of rule a was either justified or harmless.
id.alterations in original.
in wilson,the plaintiffs disclosed two videotapes,prepared by expert witnesses,reenacting the accident at issue in that case.wilson,at.these disclosures occurred months after the close of discovery.id.in affirming the district court exclusion of those two videotapes from evidence the first circuit called rule c preclusion sanction near automatic.wilson,at emphasis added.the first circuit explained that 
it is the obligation of the party facing sanctions for belated disclosure to show that its failure to comply with the rule was either justified or harmless and therefore deserving of some lesser sanction.this is a burden that plaintiff made no attempt to shoulder,and the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing rule c sanction.
id.at internal citations omitted.
both finley and wilson find some support in the advisory committee notes accompanying rule,which refers to rule c as an automatic sanction 
paragraph prevents a party from using as evidence any witnesses or information that,without substantial justification,has not been disclosed as required by rules a and e.this automatic sanction provides a strong inducement for disclosure of material that the disclosing party would expect to use as evidence 
advisory committee notes to amendments emphasis added.to the extent that the advisory committee note calls rule c exclusion of evidence automatic,however,that characterization can not be squared with the plain language of rule c itself.rule c itself recognizes that i n addition to or in lieu of this preclusion sanction,the court,on motion and after affording an opportunity to be heard,may impose other appropriate sanctions.thus,the plain text of the rule provides that if an appropriate motion is made and a hearing has been held,the court does have discretion to impose other,less drastic,sanctions.
in another part of its order,the district court did recognize this discretion when it precluded another design expert,john doughty,from testifying about the nature of the solutions and staffing business 
given that defendants have moved to preclude doughty testimony and that the c ourt held a telephone conference on this matter,it is not necessary to invoke rule c automatic sanction in order to preclude doughty testimony.rather,rule c provides that i n addition to or in lieu of the automatic sanction,the court,on motion and after affording an opportunity to be heard,may impose other appropriate sanctions.the court precludes doughty testimony in an exercise of this discretion.
this is a correct statement of the rule and of the court discretion in applying it.
in prior cases in which a district court erroneously imposed a sanction against a party,this court has indicated a preference for remanding the case to the district court to reconsider whether to sanction,and,if so,the appropriate sanction.see,simon debartolo group,richard jacobs group,cir stating,in case involving sanctions pursuant to,that were this an ordinary case,we would likely remand it to the district court for a determination as to whether it will persist in its decision to impose sanctions at all,and only if so for a determination of what those reconsidered sanctions should be hernandez conriv realty,cir concluding,in case involving sanctions pursuant to.f,that district court should reconsider whether to impose sanctions and that i f the court decides to impose sanctions,the court should also reconsider what sanctions are appropriate.here,however,remand is inappropriate because design has not,to this day,presented any evidence of lost profits.as when a district court abuses its discretion by erroneously excluding evidence under the federal rules of evidence,we look to whether this exclusion was likely to have affected the outcome of the case.see.a phoenix associates iii stone,cir.as late as oral argument before this court,design has persisted in characterizing its bare financial statements and the simple arithmetic of figuring its overall profit margin as adequate evidence of its lost profits.for the reasons discussed above,that evidence is insufficient to prove lost profits in this case and therefore the exclusion of that evidence can not have prejudiced design nor have affected the outcome of the case.
ii.denial of a jury trial 
by order dated february,the district court found that design was not entitled to a trial by jury on any claims with respect to which it seeks only the equitable remedies of disgorgement of profits,restitution,the imposition of a trust,an accounting,exemplary damages,or a permanent injunction.design argues that even if this court affirms the judgment of the district court incorporating its decision to preclude evidence,and therefore a claim,of lost profits,that its other causes of action not related to the lost profits claim entitled it to a jury trial.
we review de novo a district court decision to deny a jury trial.pereira farace,cir as this court recently reaffirmed,only those claims that can be classified as suits at common law trigger the right to a jury trial.see id.citing const.amend.vii.
in deciding whether a particular action is a suit at law that triggers this important protection,we are instructed to apply the test set forth in granfinanciera,nordberg,d.first,we ask whether the action would have been deemed legal or equitable in century england.second,we examine the remedy sought and determine whether it is legal or equitable in nature.
id.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
although the district court initially found that design remaining claims were arguably legal because they may be construed as contractually grounded in an implied contract for employment,it ultimately determined that the remedies sought by design,save the lost profits that the district court had precluded evidence of,were all equitable.specifically,the district court determined that t here does not appear to be any significant argument that design claims for an injunction,punitive damages,or attorneys fees and costs were anything but equitable.the district court further determined the claims for constructive trust and restitution were also equitable,reasoning that these remedies do not aim to compensate design for damages it suffered in the form of monetary gains it would have earned but r ather,the relief demanded seeks to remove from defendants the funds that they allegedly obtained unjustly and that in good conscience should be turned over to design.
design arguments as to why the district court erred in so finding are all variations on the same claims were designed to obtain compensat ion.design does not put forward,nor analyze,the holding of granfinanciera,as did the district court.moreover,design does not address at all the district court central proposition that the remedies sought here could not be deemed compensatory in the strict sense.
an examination of design initial disclosure demonstrates that the district court correctly found that all of design claimed remedies were equitable.the initial disclosure stated 
all monies paid to marc davis for salaries based upon breach of fiduciary relationship with plaintiff.
all monies earned by marc davis as a result of unlawful diversion of business from design strategy to the corporate defendants.
all profits earned by the defendants as a result of the unlawful diversion of business from the plaintiff to the defendants,which business was generated with microsoft corporation.
attorneys fees for the prosecution of this action.
punitive damages.
interest costs and disbursements.
as found by the district court,none of these categories is damages in the strict sense of remedying loss to design.rather,all these categories seek monies unjustly earned by davis and the it defendants or monies expended during of these categories has any connection to design actual loss.see dan dobbs,law of remedies,ed.some money claims are not damages representing the plaintiff loss but restitution representing the defendant unjust gains in a transaction.
at oral argument the issue of whether a claim for punitive damages independently entitles a plaintiff to a jury trial under the seventh amendment was raised for the first time in this case.this issue,however,was not argued,nor even mentioned,in the brief.issues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived and normally will not be addressed on appeal.norton sam club,cir.we therefore do not address this issue in this case.
iii.decisions following trial 
having
