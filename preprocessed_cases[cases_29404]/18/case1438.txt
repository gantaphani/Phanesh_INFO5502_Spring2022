these consolidated appeals are from a judgment entered in favor of anna wong,toha quan,and jenny wong,as the owners,officers,or managers of several garment manufacturing corporations.the complaint filed by the california labor commissioner commissioner or labor commissioner,and a complaint in intervention filed by the chinese progressive association and two former employees,alleged a variety of statutory and common law bases for holding defendants personally liable for numerous labor code violations arising out of a period in when the businesses they owned started to experience financial difficulty,and the employees were either paid late,or not at all.the complaint in intervention also alleged a cause of action for violation of business and professions code section,and sought an order requiring defendants to personally pay the wages owed by the corporations as restitution.
we shall affirm the judgment.
toha quan and anna wong,husband and wife,owned the capital stock,and served as corporate officers or directors,of three san francisco garment manufacturers,wins of california wca,wins fashion,and win industries of america collectively,wins corporations,all of which were closely held corporations doing business since the and early.defendants were also the managers and operators of these garment factories.jenny wong performed bookkeeping and payroll work for the three corporations and served on the board of directors of one or more of them.the management,manufacturing,and sales activities of the wins corporations were interrelated and integrated.
for several months in the summer of,the wins corporations failed to meet payrolls,and to pay suppliers and other expenses.during this period,defendants told employees of the wins corporations that there was inadequate cash to meet the payroll,but that the employees would eventually be paid.defendants issued checks to some employees but told them they could not yet be cashed,or issued only pay stubs that defendants stated could be used to verify the amounts owed when cash became available.defendants encouraged the employees to continue working without pay until the wins corporations collected accounts receivable and stabilized their finances.
when employees began to complain about the failure of the wins corporations to pay their wages,the division of labor standards enforcement dlse and the united states department of labor dol took action.the dol filed suit in the united states district court against the wins corporations and defendants in their personal capacity seeking,among other things,injunctive relief that resulted in the closing of the wins corporations,and the seizure of assets and accounts receivables.the dol notified all customers that the wins corporations had been closed down,and invoked a procedure that required all customer payments to go to the dol.these actions made it impossible for the wins corporations to consummate a previously approved bank loan,forcing them to declare bankruptcy in reliance upon federal labor law that permits,in some circumstances,holding corporate principals personally liable for wages not paid by the corporate employer,the dol obtained a stipulated judgment against defendants for approximately.
in the meantime,the commissioner paid wage claims of the wins corporations employees from an account established pursuant to labor code section a portion of the annual registration fee paid by garment manufacturers is deposited in this account to ensure the payment of wages and benefits to workers in the garment industry.pursuant to sections and,the commissioner then filed the instant lawsuit seeking to hold defendants personally liable for unpaid wages owed to the employees of the wins corporations the commissioner sought liquidated damages for unpaid minimum wages and overtime,unpaid vacation pay and penalties for bad payroll checks.the commissioner also sought waiting time penalties for failure to pay wages due at the time of termination and for failure to pay wages at the times specified in section,and penalties pursuant to section that are recoverable in an action by the commissioner and payable to the state treasurer.
as the legal basis for imposing personal liability on defendants,the commissioner original complaint relied exclusively on a provision in the industrial welfare commission iwc wage order applicable to the garment industry that defines employer as a ny person as defined in section of the labor code,who directly or indirectly,or through an agent or any other person,employs or exercises control over the wages,hours,or working conditions of any person,tit,subd.f hereafter the iwc employer definition.the commissioner alleged that defendants employed or exercised control over the wages,hours,and working conditions of the wins corporations employees and therefore were personally responsible for labor code violations arising out of the failure of the corporation to pay wages.
in february,the commissioner amended the complaint to allege additional factual and legal bases for imposing personal liability on defendants.the commissioner amended complaint alleged that defendants had so abused the corporate entity and the limited liability it provides that they should be deemed the alter egos of the wins corporations.it further alleged that defendants were guarantors for the wages not paid by wins corporations because they are persons as defined in section,and were deemed employers within the meaning section.
the chinese progressive association and two former employees,yan fang mei and li qin yang zhou,obtained the court permission to file a complaint in intervention,which they also later amended.the two former employees alleged claims for the same unpaid minimum wages,overtime,and penalties sought by the commissioner,and alleged the same bases alleged in the commissioner amended complaint for holding defendants personally liable.in addition,the chinese progressive association alleged violations of many of these same labor code sections as predicate violations for a cause of action pursuant to business and professions code section,also known as the unfair competition law hereafter ucl.the ucl claim sought restitution from defendants to the two named former employees and all the other former employees of the wins corporations,consisting of the wages owed but not paid by the wins corporations.
the matter was tried to the court,and it issued a tentative decision holding defendants personally liable for million in unpaid wages and vacation pay,and imposed statutory waiting time penalties pursuant to section.it also held that the failure to pay wages constituted an unfair business practice under the ucl.although it did not order payment of wages as restitution,it did tentatively order defendants to pay another in penalties pursuant to business and profession code section.
the court stated that its final decision was contingent upon the outcome of a then pending california supreme court case,reynolds bement,review granted july,because the court had based its finding of personal liability for corporate violations of the labor code upon application of the iwc employer definition that includes a person who exercises control over the wages,hours,or working conditions.the court specified that the ucl claim was derivative of the labor code violations,and therefore the final determination as to that cause of action also was contingent on the pending decision.
after the california supreme court filed its decision in reynolds bement cal th,d,reynolds,the trial court asked for additional briefing,and ultimately filed a detailed statement of decision,and entered judgment in defendants favor.the trial court interpreted reynolds to preclude the application of the iwc employer definition to the alleged labor code violations.it found that under the common law definition,the employers were the wins corporations,not defendants,and defendants therefore were not personally liable for the unpaid wages and penalties.
the court further held that plaintiff had failed to prove any factual grounds to pierce the corporate veil.the court found defendants did not make personal use of corporate assets,or commingle personal and corporate assets,and that the wins corporations were not inadequately capitalized.it found that defendants had put far more personal funds into the corporations in the form of capital infusions and loans than were alleged to have been improperly taken out.it also reasoned that the mere fact that the wins corporations ultimately went broke did not establish that the corporations were undercapitalized.the court found that the wins corporations had successfully made a profit and paid their bills for over a decade,had weathered financial ups and downs consistent with the brutal competition,local and foreign,in the sewing factory business,and had provided steady employment to hundreds of workers for many years.it found no evidence whatsoever that their final lack of funds prior to bankruptcy and closing was due to undercapitalization or a desire to use the company as a fraudulent enterprise.rather,major factors for the final cash crisis were the failure of major customers such as,penney and target to pay for goods,and refusal to accept and pay for a large order.the court concluded having operated as successful corporations for well over a decade,meeting the substantive requirements of corporations,the wins corporations can not justly be stripped of corporate status and the principals made personally liable because they failed to survive a hostile business climate.
the court also held defendants could not be held personally liable under statutory provisions specifically applicable to the garment manufacturing business,either as a wage guarantor under section,or deemed employer under section.with respect to section,the court held that employees could enforce the guaranty only by filing an administrative claim with the commissioner,and they had failed to do so.moreover,although the commissioner is authorized to commence suit on the employees behalf,the court found the commissioner had failed to follow required notice and other statutory procedures.it also held defendants were not personally liable under section based upon the fact that another corporation defendants owned and operated,tomi,had contracted with an unregistered wins corporation.
the court denied the commissioner motion for leave to amend to recover under section,which specifically allows recovery of civil penalties for violation of the wage laws,including failure to pay wages,from a ny employer or other person acting on behalf of an employer,subd.a,italics added.the court found that the commissioner had made a tactical decision not to amend to include section before trial when such a request would have been timely 
finally,the court held defendants were entitled to judgment in their favor with respect to the business and professions code section cause of action alleged by chinese progressive association,and the two named former employees of the wins corporations,on behalf of themselves and the other employees of the wins corporations among other reasons,the court held the monetary relief plaintiffs sought,an order requiring defendants to pay the wages owed by the wins corporations,was not an available remedy in a private action under the ucl,because defendants had not personally obtained any money or property from the plaintiffs 
the commissioner and one of the plaintiffs in intervention,yan fan mei,filed timely notices of appeal.
discussion 
there is no dispute that during the wins corporations failed to pay earned wages and accrued vacation pay when,due to a variety of factors,these corporations went out of business and declared bankruptcy.the issue is whether defendants,as the shareholders,officers,or managing agents of the wins corporations,may be held personally liable for the many violations of the labor code that occurred when these employees were not paid,and the corporations went out of business.
on appeal,neither the commissioner nor intervener yan fan mei intervener challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support the court factual findings and legal conclusions that there were no grounds to find defendants were the alter ego of the wins corporations.nor does either appellant challenge the court conclusion that defendants could not be held liable as wage guarantors,pursuant to section.
the commissioner sole contention on appeal is that the court incorrectly concluded that the common law definition of employer applies to an action brought pursuant to section.he argues that the court should instead have applied the iwc definition of employer to hold defendants personally liable for the alleged labor code violations arising out of the wins corporations failure to pay wages.
intervener contends that the court erred in concluding that defendants could not be held personally liable for unpaid wages as deemed employers within the meaning of section.she also argues that the court erred in concluding that under the ucl the remedy intervener sought,restitution of the unpaid wages,could only be imposed upon the wins corporations,as the employer for whom the services were performed,not upon defendants as individuals.
personal liability under iwc wage order definition of employer 
in reynolds,supra,cal th,d,an employee of two corporate defendants engaged in the automobile painting business filed a complaint pursuant to section as a class representative.the complaint alleged various causes of action based upon the failure to pay overtime compensation in violation of section,and violations of other labor code sections.id.at,d.in addition to naming the corporate defendants,the plaintiff sought to hold several shareholders,officers,or directors of the corporations personally liable under the iwc employer definition contained in the iwc wage order applicable to the automobile painting industry.the complaint alleged that these individuals employed or exercised control over wages,hours,or working conditions,and therefore were personally and jointly liable for the corporations alleged violations of the labor code.id.at,d.the trial court sustained a demurrer filed by the individual defendants,on the ground that they were not employers as defined by common law,and the iwc definition did not apply.when the plaintiff declined to amend as to some causes of action,the court entered judgment in favor of the individual defendants.
our supreme court held that the iwc definition did not apply to hold corporate control figures liable for the failure of the corporation to pay overtime,and affirmed.the court first noted that the plain terms of the iwc employer definition did not expressly impose liability under section on individual corporate agents.reynolds,supra,cal th at,d.since neither section nor section defines the terms employer or employee,the applicable rule of statutory interpretation is that these terms should be construed in accordance with the common law,unless the legislature clearly and unequivocally indicated otherwise.id.at,d.under the common law,corporate agents acting within the scope of their agency are not personally liable for the corporate employer failure to pay its employees wages regardless of whether the corporation failure to pay such wages,in particular circumstances,breaches only its employment contract or also breaches a tort duty of care.id.at,d.
the court found the fact that the legislature had amended sections and several times since the iwc first promulgated its definition of employer in did not evidence an intent to depart from the common law by incorporating the iwc definition into these statutes.reynolds,supra,cal th at,d.the court reasoned,had the legislature meant in section to expose to personal civil liability any corporate agent who exercises control over an employee wages,hours,or working conditions,it would have manifested its intent more clearly than by mere silence after the iwc promulgation of the employer definition in a wage order.id.at,d.
the reynolds court also rejected the commissioner argument in an amicus brief that failure to adopt the plaintiff theory of corporate agent liability would threaten the dlse administrative practice of applying the iwc employer definition in administrative proceedings see,and interpreting it in accordance with the federal decisions under the flsa.in dicta,the court initially noted that the dlse administrative policies are not due general interpretive deference unless they are promulgated in accordance with the administrative procedure act,and that differences between federal and state wage and hour law may render reliance on interpretation of federal law inapposite.reynolds,supra,cal th at,d.the court was not persuaded that the commissioner ability to recover wages on behalf of california employees would be hampered by its decisions because individual corporate agents could be held liable under other established common law or statutory theories the court further noted that pursuant to section,subdivision a,a person acting on behalf of an employer could be subject to penalties equal to the amount of unpaid wages,and that section,subdivision a authorizes employees in some circumstance to bring civil actions to collect these penalties.id.at,fns,d.
in this case,the commissioner relies upon the same iwc employer definition at issue in reynolds to impose personal liability upon defendants for the wages not paid by the wins corporations,in violation of sections,and,and for vacation pay not paid,in violation of section.like section,these sections impose obligations on the employer,but the term is not statutorily defined.the commissioner brought the action pursuant to section section,like section,uses the term employee but does not define it.we therefore are left with the same basic issue of statutory interpretation identified in reynolds,supra,cal th,d,that neither the term employer nor the term employee are statutorily defined in the substantive labor code provisions that were allegedly violated.therefore,absent a clear and unequivocal expression of contrary legislative intent,we must assume the legislature intended these terms would be interpreted in accordance with the common law.
the commissioner argues that reynolds,supra,cal th,d,is distinguishable because the judicial proceedings were initiated by employees pursuant to section,whereas here,the commissioner filed suit on the employees behalf pursuant to section.the commissioner contends the reference in section to orders of the commission is a clear and unequivocal expression of intent to incorporate the iwc employer definition into section,and into the substantive labor code sections the commissioner contends were violated.unlike section,which was enacted in stats,ch,prior to the adoption of the iwc employer definition,section was enacted in stats,ch,long after the iwc promulgated its definition.the commissioner argues the legislature must be presumed to have been aware of the iwc employer definition when it enacted section,and therefore the reference to the orders of the commission evinces a clear and unequivocal intent that the iwc employer definition apply to impose liability on corporate agents or control figures for unpaid wages in actions brought under section.see,people harrison cal d,legislature is deemed to be aware of statutes and judicial decisions already in existence,and to have enacted or amended a statute in light thereof.
in jones gregory th,d jones,the court of appeal rejected a similar argument made by the commissioner in an effort to distinguish reynolds,supra,cal th,d.in jones,the commissioner obtained a judgment against a corporate owner for unpaid overtime,and the owner appealed,contending that he could not be held personally liable.jones,at,d.the commissioner argued that while n either section nor section contains any reference to the iwc employer definition citation,section,subdivision b,expressly provides the labor commissioner may prosecute action s for the collection of wages and other moneys payable to employees or to the state arising out of an employment relationship or order of the industrial welfare commission.id.at,d.the court held the mere statutory reference to the orders of the iwc in section did not evince any legislative intent to make substantive changes to the labor code by importing iwc orders in whole or in part.citation.while section authorizes the labor commissioner to prosecute civil actions in addition to pursuing administrative relief,nothing in section purports to modify the substantive terms of the labor code.moreover,section is untethered to any particular statutory wage requirement,so reynold observation remains true that the iwc employer definition does not expressly impose liability under section or any other labor code provision on individual corporate agents.citation.in other words,if the legislature had intended to depart from the common law by engrafting wage order or a similar iwc regulation onto section or other statutory provision,it would have more clearly manifested that intent.citation.jones,at,d.
although we would caution against reading the narrow holding in reynolds,supra,cal th,d,as a categorical decision that all provisions of the labor code using the term employer or employee must be interpreted in accordance with the common law definitions,we shall conclude,for reasons similar to those stated in jones,supra,th,d,that the mere reference in section to the orders of the commission does not evince a clear and unequivocal legislative intent to depart from the established common law meaning of these terms.
first,the plain language of section does not support the commissioner construction because the phrase orders of the commission does not modify,qualify or otherwise define the word employee.instead,it modifies unpaid minimum wages or overtime compensation that are owed under this chapter or the orders of the commission.the reference to the orders of the commission merely makes explicit that,in addition to statutory provisions of this chapter,the iwc orders contain regulations establishing overtime exemptions and fixing the minimum wage that are relevant to determining whether minimum wages and overtime compensation are owed.
second,both before and after the enactment of section,when the legislature has intended to deviate from the common law that insulates corporate agents from personal liability for obligations or duties imposed on the corporate employer,it has done so explicitly.for example,section,enacted in,imposes misdemeanor criminal liability on e very employer or other person acting either individually or as an officer,agent,or employee of another person for violation of this chapter or any order or ruling of the commission.stats,ch,italics added.section,also enacted in,imposes criminal liability on any person,or officer or agent thereof.stats,ch,italics added.the legislature continued to use similar language when,in,it enacted section,to specify that a civil penalty for minimum wage violations may be imposed on a ny employer or other person acting either individually or as an officer,agent,or employee of another person stats,ch,italics added see also every employer or other person acting either individually or as an officer,agent or employee of another person is guilty of a misdemeanor for certain violations.the absence of any similar language in section further bolsters our conclusion that the mere reference to orders of the commission does not evince any legislative intent to deviate from the common law meaning of employer or employee.
we also note that section,like section,includes a reference to an order of the commission.if the mere reference to an order of the commission meant the legislature intended the term employer to include a corporate employer agents,the phrase or other person acting either individually or as an officer,agent,or employee of another person would be unnecessary surplusage.see people cole cal th,d,statutes should not be construed to render a part surplusage.
in the absence of a clear and unequivocal expression of a contrary legislative intent,we conclude that section,and the labor code sections that the commissioner alleged were violated by the failure of the wins corporations to pay wages and vacation pay,must be interpreted in light of the common law definition of employer.reynolds,supra,cal th at,d.the trial court correctly concluded that,under the common law definition,the wins corporations,not defendants,were the employers liable for the alleged violations of the labor code arising out of the failure of the wins corporations to pay its employees.
personal liability as a deemed employer pursuant to section 
intervener contends that the court erred in rejecting the alternative theory that defendants could be held personally liable for all the alleged labor code violations arising out of the wins corporations failure to pay employees,as deemed employers pursuant to section.
section is part of a system of registration,bonding requirements,and other regulations that address certain abuses that arise due to the structure of the garment industry.the basic problem is that garment manufacturers and retailers often receive the benefits of cheap labor,but are shielded from liability as the employers for labor violations because they contract production work to independent contractors,who in turn hire unskilled immigrant laborers,and force them to work in violation of the minimum wage and overtime law.see goldstein et,enforcing fair labor standards in the modern american sweatshop rediscovering the statutory definition of employment ucla.in,the legislature enacted senate bill,which contained a series of laws addressing some of these abuses by requiring every person engaged in the business of garment manufacturing to register with the labor commissioner stats,ch.the legislature also enacted section,which makes a ny person engaged in the business of garment manufacturing who contracts with any other person similarly engaged who has not registered a deemed employer and jointly liable for violation of section,and certain wage and hour sections enumerated in section,subdivision a.in,as part of a series of amendments intended to protect garment workers from the hardships and misery of sweatshop labor the legislature added subdivision b to section fashion coalition for humane immigrant rights of los angeles th,d fashion.section,subdivision b authorizes employees of an unregistered garment manufacturer to file a civil action against the deemed employer to recover wages,damages and penalties because of a violation by the unregistered person,subd.b.
the factual premise for intervener theory of liability pursuant to section was that defendants also were the sole owners of the stock,and managers,of a utah garment manufacturing company,tomi.during the period when the wins corporations started to experience financial difficulties,the dlse denied wca application for renewal because wca had failed to pay payroll taxes and wca continued to operate without a registration.nevertheless tomi,continued to do business with wca,an unregistered garment manufacturer,until late summer.plaintiffs contended the foregoing evidence established that defendants,through their ownership of tomi,continued to do business with wca when it was not registered,and therefore defendants as individuals may be deemed employers of wca employees pursuant to section and held jointly liable with wca for the failure to pay its employees wages.
the court held that intervener could not prevail on this theory.it found that tomi,not defendants as individuals,contracted with wca as an unregistered garment manufacturer.therefore,the court concluded,although tomi,might qualify as a deemed employer within the meaning of section,to hold defendants personally liable,intervener would have to prove that defendants were the alter ego of tomi,and she had failed to do so 
intervener contends,and we agree,that the legislature use of the term person in section explicitly imposes liability on individuals or business entities who were not the employer,by providing that,if the other statutory terms are met,a person may be deemed to be the employer.indeed,extending liability beyond the employer is essential to the purpose of section to end the practice in the garment industry of manufacturers evading responsibility for certain labor violations from which they benefit because they are not the employers of an independent contractor employees.intervener also correctly states that,a person includes an individual corporation contractor,and any other person or entity engaged in the business of garment manufacturing.intervener,however,takes an unwarranted logical and factual leap when she asserts that since an individual or corporation may be deemed an employer,defendants are deemed employers because they as individuals owned and controlled tomi.intervener argument fails to recognize the importance of the phrase who contracts with in section that further defines the person who may deemed an employer.even if defendants as individuals were person s engaged in the business of garment manufacturing within the meaning of section,they could not be deemed employer s of the wca employees within the meaning of section unless they as individuals also were the persons who contract ed with an unregistered garment manufacturer,in this case wca.the court found,as a matter of fact,that it was tomi,not the defendants,who contracted with wca therefore,under the plain terms of section,tomi,could have been held liable as a deemed employer under section,as the person who contract ed with wca when it was not registered.we find nothing in the plain terms of section that also deems the owners,officers,or managers of the person who contract ed with the unregistered garment manufacturer to be employers.therefore,the court correctly concluded that absent some basis for deeming defendants to be alter egos of tomi,defendants could not be deemed employers within the meaning of section.
the purpose of section is to end the practice of garment manufacturers reaping the benefits of labor code violations by contracting with an independent contractor,but shielding themselves from liability based on the fact that the independent contractor,not the contracting garment manufacturer,is the employer.this purpose is fully served by holding the contracting person,be it an individual,association,partnership,limited liability company or corporation,liable for labor code violations committed by the unregistered independent contractor whose workers performed labor that benefited the contracting person.in the absence of express language including the officers,owners or managers of the person who contracts with the unregistered manufacturer,the extra step that intervener urges,imposing liability also on the individual shareholders or corporate officers of the contracting person,is outside the legislative scheme.of course,when the corporate entity that contracts with an unregistered manufacturer is abused by individual owners or officers who disregard the separate status of the corporate entity and use its assets for their personal benefit,then the doctrine may be applied to also hold these individuals accountable.in this case,however,the court found no factual basis for piercing the corporate veil under the doctrine.
recovery of unpaid wages under the unfair competition law 
intervener also alleged violations of sections,and and of iwc wage order as the predicate statutes underlying a cause of action for violation of the ucl.she further alleged,and sought to prove,that defendants directly and actively participated in the alleged violations and therefore could be held individually liable under the ucl for unfair practices committed by the corporation.see,people toomey d.the remedy she sought was restitution of the unpaid wages.
the court did not make explicit findings on the issue whether defendant had directly and actively participated in the alleged violations.instead,it determined,based upon the facts of the case,that the remedy intervener sought,restitution of the unpaid wages,could only be imposed upon the wins corporations as the employer for whom the services were performed,not upon defendants as individuals.specifically,it found that defendants obtained no money or gains from which to disgorge or pay restitution.intervener contends that this was error,and that the court should instead have ordered defendants to pay the wages not paid by the wins corporations as restitution pursuant to business and professions code section.
although it is well established that an owner or officer of a corporation may be individually liable under the ucl if he or she actively and directly participates in the unfair business practice,it does not necessarily follow that all of the remedies imposed with respect to the corporation are equally applicable to the individual.while the scope of conduct covered by the ucl is broad,its remedies are limited.citation.a ucl action is equitable in nature damages can not be recovered.citation.civil penalties may be assessed in public unfair competition actions,but the law contains no criminal provisions.citation.u nder the ucl,p revailing plaintiffs are generally limited to injunctive relief and restitution.korea supply,supra,cal th,d.t he legislature did not intend to authorize courts to order monetary remedies other than restitution in an individual action.id.at,d.
there is no dispute that,if defendants directly and actively participated in an unfair business practice,they could be subject to penalties pursuant to business and profession code section.such penalties,however,are an available remedy only in a public action.korea supply,supra,cal th at,d.nor is there any dispute that the unpaid wages could be recovered from the wins corporations as restitution pursuant to business and professions code section.a n order that a business pay to an employee wages unlawfully withheld is consistent with the legislative intent underlying the authorization in business and professions code section for orders necessary to restore to a person in interest money or property acquired by means of an unfair business practice.cortez purolator air filtration products cal th,d.the employer has acquired the money to be paid by means of an unlawful practice that constitutes unfair competition as defined by business and professions code section.the employee is,quite obviously,a person in interest citation to whom that money may be restored.the concept of restoration or restitution,as used in the ucl,is not limited only to the return of money or property that was once in the possession of that person.the commonly understood meaning of restore includes a return of property to a person from whom it was acquired citation,but earned wages that are due and payable pursuant to section et of the labor code are as much the property of the employee who has given his or her labor to the employer in exchange for that property as is property a person surrenders through an unfair business practice.an order that earned wages be paid is therefore a restitution remedy authorized by the ucl.the order is not one for payment of damages.id.at,d.
the issue in the case before us is whether these defendants,who were not the employers,and who were not found to have required any employee to work for them personally,or to have misappropriated corporate funds for their own use,may also be required to pay the earned but unpaid wages as restitution 
a n order for restitution is one compelling a ucl defendant to return money or earned wages for service performed obtained through an unfair business practice to those persons in interest from whom the property was taken,that is,to persons who had an ownership interest in the property or those claiming through that person.korea supply,supra,cal th at,d.the problem with requiring defendants,rather than the wins corporations,to pay unpaid wages as restitution is that the labor intervener performed was not for defendants personally,but for the employers,the wins corporations.defendants did not personally obtain the benefit of those services,and the duty to pay wages was owed by the corporations as employers,not by defendants as owners,officers or managers.see reynolds,supra,cal th at,d.
nor is this a case in which defendants misappropriated to themselves,as individuals for their individual advantage,the unpaid wages the wins corporations owed.reynolds,supra,cal th at,d.although intervener cites evidence that she contends establishes defendants did take funds out of the wins corporations for their personal use,the court,as trier of fact,found that defendants did not personally obtain any money or gains from which to pay restitution.it resolved against intervener conflicts in the evidence on the issue of withdrawal of funds from the wins corporations for defendants personal use.it found,instead,that defendants put far more personal funds into the corporations in the form of capital infusions and loans than were alleged to have been improperly taken out e vidence indicated capital contributions and loans from defendants to the corporations in excess of.these capital contributions and loans came largely toward the end of the wins corporations existence in an unsuccessful effort to keep the corporations afloat.
in the absence of a finding that intervener performed labor for defendants personally,rather than for the benefit of wins corporations,or that defendants appropriated for themselves corporate funds that otherwise would have been used to pay the unpaid wages,we agree with the trial court conclusion that an order requiring defendants to pay the unpaid wages would not be restitutionary as it would not replace any money or property that defendants took directly from intervener.korea supply,supra,cal th at,d.t he notion of restoring something to a victim of unfair competition includes two separate components.the offending party must have obtained something to which it was not entitled and the victim must have given up something which he or she was entitled to keep.day v.at t th,d.therefore,restitution is available where a defendant has wrongfully acquired funds or property in which a plaintiff has an ownership or vested interest.feitelberg credit suisse first boston,llc th,d.defendants can not be required to return or restore to intervener something they never obtained.see madrid perot systems th,d noting absence of authority for proposition that a ucl plaintiff may recover money from a defendant who never received it.the intervener provided her labor to the employer,the wins corporations.the wins corporations,not their owners,officers or managers,owed the earned wages that became due and payable when the labor was performed.see reynolds,supra,cal th at,d.not having acquired or directly and personally benefited from intervener labor without paying for it,or having misappropriated for their personal use corporate funds that could have been used to pay her wages,defendants could not be required to pay the unpaid wages as restitution.such relief would not be restitutionary as it would not replace any money or property that defendants took directly from intervener.korea supply,at,d.
the cases upon which intervener relies do not compel a contrary conclusion.although some of the cases uphold judgments holding corporate officers or owners individually liable under the ucl for unfair practices in which he or she actively and directly participated,none addresses the question whether the corporate officer or owner could be directed to return money or property to the plaintiff that the corporation had obtained through an unfair practice,but that the individual defendant had not personally obtained or misappropriated 
in people toomey d.toomey,this court affirmed a judgment against a corporate owner and officer in an action alleging unfair and misleading business practices under the ucl brought on behalf of the public by the attorney general.we upheld the finding of individual liability for unfair practices consisting of misleading advertising and solicitations of discount coupons based upon evidence that the corporate owner and officer actively and personally participated in the misleading advertising and sales solicitations even after an injunction against him as an individual and against his corporation had been issued pursuant to business and professions code section.in addition to ordering the owner to pay substantial civil penalties,the trial court also ordered him to pay restitution to purchasers of the coupons in the form of refunds.toomey,at.the owner did challenge the restitution order,but only on the ground that it improperly required refunds even to p
