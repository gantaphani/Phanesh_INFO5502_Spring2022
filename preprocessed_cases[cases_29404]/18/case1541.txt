plaintiff and appellant catalina investments,catalina,appeals a judgment denying its petition for writ of mandate whereby catalina sought to overturn a decision by defendant and respondent bill jones,secretary of state of the state of california the secretary rejecting catalina attempt to file a certificate of revocation of corporate dissolution.
the essential issue presented is whether the secretary had a legal duty to accept for filing the purported certificate of revocation of dissolution.
catalina,as a dissolved corporation,lacked the capacity to seek reinstatement by means of an alleged revocation of dissolution,subd.c,subd.a.the correction remedy of section does not authorize the retroactive reinstatement of a dissolved corporation,subd.e.further,the proffered certificate of revocation of dissolution did not meet the criteria for the filing of a certificate of correction of instrument because there was no showing of any factual misstatement or other defect in the certificate of dissolution requiring correction,subd.a.accordingly,the judgment is affirmed.
factual and procedural background 
on may,catalina incorporated in the state of california.on august,catalina registered in israel as a foreign corporation.it acquired and continues to hold real property there.
in,nechustan,an israeli corporation,acquired all of catalina stock.
on march,catalina filed a certificate of dissolution with the secretary,certifying the corporation has been completely wound up,its assets had been distributed and its liabilities had been paid,the election to dissolve was made by the vote of all the outstanding shares,and the corporation was dissolved.
in july,in the course of an audit of nechustan,the auditors concluded that if catalina dissolution in california were not reversed,nechustan would incur a liability for real property transfer taxes and fees in israel of approximately.
consequently,on august,catalina submitted a purported certificate of revocation of dissolution to the secretary.the certificate of revocation of dissolution stated the certificate of dissolution was filed in error,the corporation in fact had not wound up,had not distributed its assets,and the corporation board had revoked its election to dissolve.
the secretary returned,unfiled,the certificate of revocation of dissolution,explaining there was no statutory authority for such a filing.
catalina petition for writ of mandate.
on january,catalina filed a petition for writ of mandate to require the secretary,subject to the payment of any appropriate fees and taxes,to reinstate catalina corporate capacity and to certify catalina as an active corporation and in good standing.
the supporting declaration of levi kushnir kushnir,a director of catalina,stated that in,he was advised by an attorney and tax advisor in israel as well as by an accountant,there was no longer any need to maintain catalina as a california corporation because catalina was registered in israel and was not doing business in california or anywhere else outside israel.kushnir believed had a corporate existence independent of catalina.therefore,kushnir instructed his california public accountants to proceed with the formal dissolution of catalina under california law,while assuming that would continue to exist and operate independently.the certificate of dissolution accordingly was filed with the secretary on march.however,in july,kushnir learned his understanding in was erroneous,and as a result of catalina dissolution in california,there would be substantial adverse tax consequences to catalina shareholder,nechustan,and that catalina israeli operations since were under a cloud of uncertainty.
kushnir also asserted that no prejudice would result to any third party if the trial court were to grant the petition and order the reinstatement of catalina corporate existence.
the secretary opposition.
the secretary opposed the petition,contending the threshold issue was catalina lack of capacity in that,as a dissolved corporation,catalina was precluded from bringing any legal action other than one in furtherance of winding up its corporate affairs.as for the merits,even assuming the corporation had been dissolved in error,there is no authority for the filing of a purported certificate of revocation of corporate dissolution.in the absence of any provision in the corporations code for undoing a corporate dissolution,there can be no legal duty,ministerial or discretionary,on the part of the secretary to file the purported certificate.further,neither the secretary nor the court is in a position to assess the consequence of undoing the dissolution,because there is no way of knowing the extent to which third parties may have relied upon the public record maintained by the secretary,which states that the corporation was dissolved on march.
trial court ruling.
on march,the matter came on for hearing.the trial court denied the petition,ruling the secretary rejection of the proffered certificate was not arbitrary,capricious or contrary to law,and catalina had failed to establish a legal duty on the secretary part to file the certificate.
the trial court noted the parties agreed there was no express law that provides for the filing of such a document or for the reinstatement of a dissolved corporation corporate status.section provides for the revocation of an election to dissolve before dissolution has been accomplished the state.section,subdivision a,provides for certificates of correction to be filed to correct agreements,certificates or other instruments with respect to misstatements of fact,defects of execution,or any other error or defect,for corporations whose corporate identity and existence are not in doubt.
the trial court further observed that the integrity of public records would be compromised by any attempted correction to catalina corporate status.the records on file with the secretary disclose that as of march,catalina was completely wound up and its known assets distributed to those entitled thereto.however,the certificate of revocation of dissolution states the assets were never distributed.the secretary should not act where the rights of third parties relying on public records might be affected.finally,pursuant to section,subdivision b,catalina status as a dissolved corporation means it lacks the legal capacity to bring this or any other legal action except one in furtherance of winding up its affairs 
catalina filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment denying its petition for writ of mandate 
contentions 
catalina contends catalina had standing to file the petition in the court below the trial court erred in refusing to apply section,authorizing the filing of a certificate of correction the secretary has a mandatory duty to accept a certificate of correction of the erroneously filed certificate of dissolution the petition should have been granted even if section is inapplicable and the trial court abused its discretion in denying the petition.
