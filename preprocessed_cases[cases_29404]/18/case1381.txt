introduction 
plaintiff vilma go filed a complaint seeking the involuntary dissolution of pacific health services,phs,in which she had been a director and shareholder,pursuant to corporations code section naming as defendants phs,and david sylvia and paul husen,the other directors and shareholders of phs sometimes collectively referred to herein as defendants.defendants sought to avoid dissolution of phs by purchasing go shares under section which,once invoked,requires the trial court to appoint three disinterested appraisers to assist the court in determining the valuation of the corporation at issue.after considering the reports of the appraisers,in accordance with the requirements of section,the trial court stayed the dissolution proceeding and fixed the fair value of go shares,and thereafter entered a decree providing in the alternative for the winding up and dissolution of the corporation unless defendants made payment to go for her shares,in the specified amount,within the time specified by the decree.
go appeals from the decree,contending that the court valuation of phs was erroneous and undervalued her shares.defendants also appeal from the decree,contending that the decree awarded go relief to which she was not legally entitled that if defendants did not make payment within the specified time,the involuntary winding up and dissolution of phs would proceed immediately,without defendants being afforded the opportunity to litigate the merits of the action for involuntary dissolution.in the nonpublished portion of this opinion,part i of the discussion,we conclude that the trial court had substantial evidence before it that supported the valuation it reached.in the published portion of this opinion,part ii of the discussion,we conclude that the alternative decree issued by the trial court followed the statutory requirements set forth in the plain language of section.accordingly,we affirm the decree in its entirety.
factual and procedural background 
go is a licensed nurse.in early,go and david sylvia formed pacific health services,phs,a california corporation that was eventually licensed and certified to provide medicare and home nursing and health care services.go and sylvia each owned half of the shares of phs,and each made an initial investment of.originally,go and sylvia were both directors and officers of phs.
in early,sylvia and go brought paul husen into the corporation as director of nursing.husen,go,and sylvia each became shareholders.
in early,phs received its certification from medicare and and obtained a county license,at which time the company became profitable.until phs obtained its licensure and certification,the business was not permitted to bill for its services.
also in early,sylvia and husen began paying themselves salaries of approximately per month.go did not receive a salary sylvia told her there was not enough money.
go contends that on august,sylvia and husen held an unnoticed board meeting at which they amended the bylaws in order to terminate her from the board of directors.go contends that sylvia and husen set the price of go shares at,then issued to themselves company checks to sylvia and to husen,which they used to fund personal checks which they sent to go for from each of them.they then purported to transfer go shares to themselves.
sylvia and husen contend,however,that in february,they learned that go was breaching her duties to phs by competing with it,and directing potential customers to competing agencies in return for monetary compensation.they assert that they properly removed her from the board of directors and compensated her for the fair market value of her shares 
go sued defendants on september,seeking the involuntary dissolution of phs pursuant to section,subdivisions b and b go also sought damages based on claims of breach of fiduciary duty and fraud as a shareholder derivative action,and as a direct action brought by a shareholder and director.vilma go pacific health services,et,los angeles super.court case no.
on december,defendants filed a for breach of contract,misappropriation of corporate opportunities,and breach of the duty of loyalty.
on april,defendants filed a motion pursuant to section for an order to stay the dissolution proceedings they requested that the court set a valuation date of august,and fix the value of go shares.
go filed a response to defendants motion to stay the proceedings and fix the value of the shares.she did not oppose the request that the court determine the value of the corporation,but requested that the valuation date be set for the time of the actual valuation,sometime in.
defendants filed a reply.
on may,the court issued an order staying the dissolution proceedings,and providing for the appointment of three appraisers.the parties were to each choose one appraiser,and the two appraisers would then choose the third appraiser.the court ordered the valuation date to be september,date go filed ordered the appraisal to be concluded by september.

the court held a hearing on july.the court issued a tentative ruling,which it later adopted as its order,in which it found the fair value of the phs shares to be,and therefore go ownership interest was valued at.the court indicated that it had thoroughly considered each of the three reports,but that it found deakin report and conclusions to be the most compelling.the court stated that it found luna appraisal to be inflated and unreliable.
on august,go filed a motion requesting issuance of an order directing payment of the value of her shares or,in the alternative,for the winding up and dissolution of the corporation,and for an award of expenses.defendants filed opposition.

go appeal valuation of phs 
ii.defendants appeal the propriety of the alternative decree 
defendants contend on appeal that the alternative decree the court issued on september,should be set aside because defendants have not yet had the opportunity to defend themselves against go claim for involuntary dissolution of phs,and that go has not proven that she is entitled to relief under that claim.defendants argue,as they did in the trial court,that once there has been a determination on the merits that go is entitled to commence the dissolution of phs,the entry of a decree with the effect of the alternative decree would be appropriate however,now is not the time for such an order,as the interests of equity and the desire for a determination on the merits justify a delay in the imposition of that relief.they request that we set aside the alternative decree and remand this matter with directions to the trial court to only enter such a decree after go has prevailed on her claims for involuntary dissolution.
we conclude that defendants misapprehend the plain meaning and ef
