the tjx companies,maxx of ca,llc,marshalls of ca,llc,marshalls of ma,and marmaxx collectively tjx filed two petitions for extraordinary writs in connection with a single,now pending class action.the real party in interest here is sean caldwell,plaintiff in the action.the action is based on alleged violations of a portion of the credit card act of,et all further statutory references are to this code unless otherwise indicated.specifically,real party alleges that tjx violated section,which,with certain exceptions,prohibits businesses from requiring customers who use credit cards to provide personal identification information.the statute also bans the use of forms that facilitate the obtaining of such information.finally,the section imposes penalties for violations.we quote the applicable language of the statute,which is central to our decision,in our discussion.
in her complaint,real party alleges violations of section and purports to represent class members who used credit cards within three years of the filing of the action.the complaint encompasses the use of credit cards in connection with the return of merchandise.
tjx moved to strike portions of the complaint,including an allegation that defined the class as users of credit cards within the last three years.the trial court denied that portion of the motion.in case no,contending that section is subject to a statute of limitations,tjx seeks a writ of mandate compelling the trial court to grant that motion.
tjx also demurred to the complaint,contending that the allegations pertaining to customers who returned merchandise were not covered under section.the trial court overruled the demurrer.in case no,tjx contends that section does not apply to returned merchandise and seeks a writ of mandate compelling the trial court to sustain the demurrer.
we issued orders to show cause and stayed the action in the trial court pending our decision.as we explain below,because the statute imposes a penalty it is subject to the statute of limitations of code of civil procedure section.we also explain why the statute does not apply to merchandise returns.because we agree with tjx as to both contentions,we order the issuance of a writ compelling the trial court to reverse its rulings with respect to both the motion to strike and the demurrer.
discussion 
the statute of limitations applies.
tjx seeks relief from the order denying its motion to strike the portions of the complaint defining the purported class as persons who used credit cards within the last three years.whether the motion should have been granted is determined by the applicable statute of limitations.
subdivision a of section states except as provided in subdivision c,no person,firm,partnership,association,or corporation that accepts credit cards for the transaction of business shall do any of the following request,or require as a condition to accepting the credit card as payment in full or in part for goods or services,the cardholder to write any personal identification information upon the credit card transaction form or otherwise.request,or require as a condition to accepting the credit card as payment in full or in part for goods or services,the cardholder to provide personal identification information,which the person,firm,partnership,association,or corporation accepting the credit card writes,causes to be written,or otherwise records upon the credit card transaction form or otherwise.utilize,in any credit card transaction,a credit card form which contains preprinted spaces specifically designated for filling in any personal identification information of the cardholder.
subdivision e of section provides in part any person who violates this section shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed two hundred fifty dollars for the first violation and one thousand dollars for each subsequent violation,to be assessed and collected in a civil action brought by the person paying with a credit card,by the attorney general,or by the district attorney or city attorney of the county or city in which the violation occurred.however,no civil penalty shall be assessed for a violation of this section if the defendant shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error made notwithstanding the defendant maintenance of procedures reasonably adopted to avoid that error.
the issue presented is whether the penalty imposed in subdivision e is a liability created by statute,other than a penalty or forfeiture,subject to the statute of limitations of code of civil procedure section,or a n action upon a statute for a penalty,subject to the statute of limitations of code of civil procedure section.
generally,code of civil procedure section,subdivision a applies if a civil penalty is mandatory.citation.shamsian atlantic richfield th,d.in determining which statute of limitations applies t he key question is whether the penalty is mandatory or discretionary,not whether the provisions awarding damages and imposing civil penalties are found in separate subdivisions of the statute.jensen bmw of north america,th,d jensen.real party acknowledges that the determinative factor as to the application of the one year versus the three year statute of limitations is whether an award of a penalty under section is discretionary or mandatory.
she relies on linder thrifty oil cal th,d,linder,which involved a purported class action based on alleged violations of the credit card act of,including violations of section renumbered as section in,the section at issue here.the trial court denied certification.the court of appeal affirmed its analysis led it to conclude that,based on whether the penalty of the statute applied to each member of the class or to the class in its entirety,the aggregate amount of the potential penalties against the defendant would be either too small to justify the burdens of class treatment or too onerous in relation to the alleged wrongdoing.id.at,d,
in reversing the court of appeal,the supreme court rejected this analysis,stating it was premised upon a false dilemma.contrary to the court assumption,there is an entire range of penalties available between what was perceived as the too small amount of for the entire class and the too onerous amount of for each class member.since the dilemma contemplated on appeal does not actually exist,it constitutes an insufficient basis for upholding the denial of certification.linder,supra,cal th at,d.the supreme court based this conclusion on its holding that section does not mandate fixed penalties rather,it sets maximum penalties of for the first violation and for each subsequent violation.citation.ibid.
real party relies on the quoted language from linder in arguing that the imposition of penalties is not mandatory,and that,hence,the rather than the statute of limitations applies.this overstates the linder holding.the case clearly stands for the proposition,as does the language of section,subdivision e itself,that the amount of penalties to be awarded is discretionary.the linder court spoke of a range of penalties.presumably this could span between a penny or even the proverbial peppercorn we all encountered in law school to the maximum amounts authorized by the statute.linder does not hold that the court may deny a penalty if the conditions of the statute are met.it is the amount of the penalty assessment that would rest within the sound discretion of the trial court.
we must construe the language of a statute in accordance with the ordinary plain meaning of the language used.the rules governing statutory construction are well settled.we begin with the fundamental premise that the objective of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.citations.in determining intent,we look first to the language of the statute,giving effect to its plain meaning.citations.although we may properly rely on extrinsic aids,we should first turn to the words of the statute to determine the intent of the legislature.citation.where the words of the statute are clear,we may not add to or alter them to accomplish a purpose that does not appear on th
