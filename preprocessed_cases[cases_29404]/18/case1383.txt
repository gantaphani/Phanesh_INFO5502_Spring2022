following a bifurcated bench trial the court found,computerxpress,robert yarbray,wayne nichols,franklin scivally and james rather liable for the malicious prosecution of a civil action in riverside county and awarded in general damages for emotional distress and million dollars in punitive damages in favor of lee jackson,barbara jackson,john fecteau,carol fecteau and thomas mitchell,individually,and thomas mitchell,as the personal representative of the estate of doran mitchell collectively jackson parties the jackson parties appeal,contending the trial court erred in concluding they failed to prove best,best krieger,llp bb k,counsel for computerxpress for part of the time the riverside action was pending,had acted with malice and,therefore,was not liable for malicious prosecution.they also contend the court erred in denying any recovery as special damages for attorney fees and expenses incurred in defending the riverside action because those fees were recoverable in connection with the jackson parties partially successful special motion to strike the complaint pursuant to code of civil procedure section yarbray also appeals from the judgment,contending the trial court erred in finding him the alter ego of computerxpress and the joint and several punitive damage award against him is improper and excessive.in addition,yarbray challenges the court liability finding on several grounds.we affirm the judgment in favor of bb k.we affirm the balance of the judgment as it relates to liability,but reverse the compensatory damage award in part and remand the matter to the trial court to determine the amount of attorney fees and costs properly recoverable as special damages by the jackson parties.
factual and procedural background 
the riverside county action computerxpress complaint 
as described in a opinion from the fourth appellate district,division two,reversing in part the trial court order denying the jackson parties special motion to strike pursuant to section and remanding the matter for determination of an award of fees and costs to them computerxpress,jackson th,d computerxpress,the riverside action was initiated by computerxpress following an unsuccessful effort to merge the company with businesses owned by the jackson parties.id.at,d.in a complaint filed in march computerxpress,a company selling products,alleged during negotiations in february the jackson parties had falsely represented their businesses were profitable,causing computerxpress to incur expenses and waste time.based on these allegations the complaint asserted causes of action for fraud,negligent misrepresentation and negligence counts,and.computerxpress also alleged the jackson parties entered into a conspiracy beginning in may to damage computerxpress reputation and to cause it economic harm.in furtherance of that conspiracy,computerxpress alleged,the jackson parties had made numerous false and disparaging statements about computerxpress on the internet and elsewhere to existing and potential customers and investors.based on these allegations the complaint asserted causes of action for trade libel,interference with contractual relations,interference with prospective economic advantage,abuse of process,conspiracy and injunctive relief counts through.ibid.at the time it filed its complaint,computerxpress was represented by nichols.
b.the special motion to strike 
on june,the jackson parties filed a special motion to strike the complaint and each of its causes of action pursuant to section,commonly referred to as an motion computerxpress opposition was filed by nichols on june.the following month bb k substituted into the action as counsel for computerxpress and filed a supplemental opposition to the motion to strike.thereafter,the trial court denied the motion,concluding none of the nine causes of action fell within the scope of section.computerxpress,supra,th at,d.accordingly,the court did not consider whether computerxpress had established a probability of prevailing on its claims.ibid.
the court of appeal agreed the three causes of action relating to the jackson parties alleged misrepresentations during the failed merger discussions and the cause of action for interference with contract relations,based on their purported disparaging statements made directly to a company that had contracted with computerxpress,did not occur in connection with an official proceeding or arise from protected activity involving a public issue or issue of public interest.computerxpress,supra,th at,d.however,the court held the jackson parties had met their threshold burden by showing the remaining causes of action,which involved false and disparaging statements about computerxpress allegedly published on the internet,the filing of a complaint against it with the securities and exchange commission sec and the posting of the sec complaint on the internet,all arose from protected speech or petitioning activity within the meaning of section.in particular,the court found the internet postings,which included statements that the officers and directors of a publicly traded corporation were illegally conspiring to manipulate the value of its stock,were made in connection with an issue of public interest because the subject matter was of concern to a large number of investors and potential investors.see id.at,d.
turning to the second prong of the section analysis,the appellate court held computerxpress had failed to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on any of the causes of action properly subject to the special motion to strike.specifically,the court noted computerxpress had not identified which of the numerous internet postings included in the record were actionable and,in any event,found none of them would satisfy the requirements for trade libel computerxpress,supra,th at,d and none could support a claim for interference with prospective economic advantage.id.at,d.the remaining three claims were also found to be without any merit.id.at,d.
the court of appeal then held following further briefing and reargument on the issue after the jackson parties petitioned for rehearing the jackson parties were entitled to attorney fees and costs under section,subdivision c,as the prevailing moving parties on a special motion to strike,concluding the fact they were only partially successful should reduce but not eliminate their entitlement to attorney fees defendants consequently are entitled to recover attorney fees and costs incurred in moving to strike the claims on which they prevailed,but not fees and costs incurred in moving to strike the remaining claims.the trial court may determine the appropriate amount of fees and costs,upon a proper application by defendants.computerxpress,supra,th at,d.
proceedings on remand 
following remand from the court of appeal,the jackson parties moved for summary adjudication on the fifth cause of action tortious interference with contractual relations on february,marvin zinman replaced bb k as counsel for computerxpress.on behalf of computerxpress zinman filed a notice of nonopposition to the motion,which the court granted on march.
in late february the jackson parties filed a memorandum of costs,seeking in attorney fees using a lodestar multiplier of,in expenses and in other costs relating to its partially successful motion to strike.the declaration of yvonne renfrew filed in support of the application for attorney fees stated she had worked hours in connection with the jackson parties appeal from the denial of their special motion to strike and no more than hours of that total could properly be attributed to time devoted exclusively to matters on which they jackson parties failed to prevail that is,exclusively to issues relating to counts,and.computerxpress moved to tax costs,and the jackson parties filed an opposition.the court heard the matter on april,and awarded the jackson parties in attorney fees.the record on this appeal,as voluminous as it is,contains no copy of any order reflecting this award.counsel for the jackson parties has indicated no written order memorializing this fee award exists.however,a notice of ruling prepared by zinman recites the award of was for attorney fees in connection with legal services at the trial level and on appeal.
on june,computerxpress dismissed all remaining claims in the riverside action.the dismissal purported to be without prejudice.
the malicious prosecution action 
on september,the jackson parties,again represented by renfrew,filed their complaint for malicious prosecution,conspiracy to deprive them of their civil rights in violation of title united states code section and violation of their rights under the unruh civil rights act.a first amended complaint for malicious prosecution only was filed march,and the operative pleading,a second amended complaint for malicious prosecution,was filed july.by this time the case was assigned for all purposes to judge elihu berle in department of the los angeles superior court.
the second amended complaint,which named computerxpress,bb k,yarbray,nichols,zinman,scivally and rather as defendants alleged the riverside action was instituted and thereafter prosecuted by computerxpress and the other defendants,including yarbray and bb k,without probable cause,maliciously and with improper purposes,including chilling and punishing the jackson parties for the exercise of their rights of free speech and petition.as to yarbray,the pleading specifically alleged he was and continued to be the alter ego of computerxpress.it further alleged yarbray was actively instrumental in the institution and the prosecution of the riverside action.the complaint sought both compensatory and punitive damages.
aurora precious metals,identifying itself as a corporation,formerly named,and yarbray jointly answered the unverified second amended complaint with a general denial and asserted as affirmative defenses their reliance on the advice of counsel in proceeding with the riverside action,no favorable termination,lack of malice and the existence of probable cause.the other defendants filed similar answers.
following discovery and extensive pretrial motion practice,the parties waived a jury and the malicious prosecution action was ultimately tried as a matter before judge robert.the issue of the amount of punitive damages,if any,was bifurcated from the issues of liability and compensatory damages.
the in limine rulings on attorney fees as special damages 
prior to before the case was transferred to judge k moved in limine for an order precluding introduction of evidence relating to the amount of attorney fees and costs incurred by the jackson parties in the riverside action in connection with their special motion to strike and the subsequent appeal.bb k argued the amount of reasonable fees and costs for the motion and appeal had been determined by the trial court in the riverside action and the resulting fee award reduced to a money judgment against some of the defendants in the malicious prosecution action.that determination,bb k asserted,was binding under the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel.bb k motion attached as an exhibit the notice of ruling prepared by zinman,reciting the trial court had awarded in fees for legal services in the trial court and on appeal.
the jackson parties filed an opposition to the bb k motion and filed their own motion in limine,seeking an order excluding from trial any evidence of the fee award actually made in the riverside action,as well as any evidence to the effect the jackson parties had failed to enforce that award and,therefore,had failed to mitigate their damages.
following additional briefing on the two motions,as well as on other,unrelated in limine motions filed by the parties,the court on september,granted bb k motion to preclude evidence of the actual amount of attorney fees incurred by the jackson parties in successfully moving to strike certain claims in the riverside action pursuant to section,except as to attorneys fees awarded for the slapp motion,and denied the jackson parties motion to exclude evidence of the amount of that fee award.explaining his reasoning at the hearing on the motions,judge berle stated,i believe that it is binding as collateral estoppel,if not probably even res judicata since the other action is completed and there is a final judgment.there is a final determination of that issue on the attorneys fees for the slapp motion.and i would say to the extent that there are other expenses that were not covered by the motion,certainly that the plaintiff can argue about those other damages.but anything encompassed within that motion,there has already been a determination and that determination is binding.
judge berle further emphasized he was not making any specific determinations on the amounts of what was included here.counsel for the jackson parties then inquired how the court would determine the extent of the earlier fee order.the court responded,we will have a hearing as to the admissibility of the evidence.if there is an argument as you i assume you are going to introduce evidence of damages,and then defendants are either going to say the evidence is admissible or object.the defendants will say,wait a minute.those types of damages are within the scope of the previous award.
on september,the jackson parties filed a motion for reconsideration of the court orders on the in limine motions regarding attorney fees,arguing in part that their counsel,renfrew,had only discovered several days earlier that the file in the riverside action contained no actual court order that could serve as the predicate for applying the doctrine of collateral estoppel.in a supporting declaration renfrew also stated the jackson parties had never received any payment on account of a fee award in the riverside action.in its opposition to the motion for reconsideration,bb k submitted a copy of the reporter transcript for the hearing held in the riverside action on april,which reflected the court decision to reduce renfrew fee request to hours for legal services on the special motion to strike in the trial court and hours in the appellate court at an hourly rate of for a total fee award of.on october,the court denied the motion for reconsideration.
the trial court liability determination and award of compensatory damages 
a.the trial court proceedings and the statement of decision 
trial on issues of liability and compensatory damages began on january,and continued through february.neither computerxpress nor rather appeared at trial.the court issued a tentative decision on march,which found in favor of the jackson parties against all remaining defendants other than bb k,awarded compensatory damages and found by clear and convincing evidence that computerxpress,yarbray,scivally,nichols and rather were also liable to the jackson parties for punitive damages.
on march,the jackson parties filed a request for statement of decision pursuant to section,which identified factual and legal issues many with multiple subparts for the court to address.in addition,the jackson parties filed a document captioned proposals and objections re tentative decision.yarbray and scivally also filed requests for a statement of decision.
on april,the court filed its proposed statement of decision,which essentially adopted its tentative decision with minor changes.the jackson parties then filed objections to the proposed statement of decision,asserting it failed to address either adequately or all item through in their request for statement of decision.yarbray also objected to the proposed statement of decision.on may,the court adopted its proposed statement of decision as the statement of decision.
issues of liability 
the court statement of decision identified four principal issues in the case with respect to liability.first,was there a favorable termination of the riverside action the court concluded there was,observing that five of the nine claims were dismissed on appeal pursuant to the jackson parties special motion to strike,which necessarily included a determination those claims lacked merit.although the remaining four claims were dismissed by computerxpress one only after a motion for summary adjudication had been granted,the court determined these dismissals were effectively terminations on the merits as opposed to terminations for other purposes.the court also found that each of the defendants was actively instrumental in commencing continuing the riverside case against each plaintiff herein.
second,did the defendants have probable cause to file and pursue the riverside action the court made detailed findings regarding the structure and history of the various corporations involved in the initial dealings between the jackson parties and computerxpress and its principals.for purposes of the present appeal,the only relevant finding is the determination that yarbray was the of computerxpress and all of its progeny.the court then concluded there was no probable cause for any defendant to prosecute or maintain the sixth,seventh,eighth or ninth causes of action all of which were ordered dismissed by the court of appeal pursuant to the special motion to strike as to any of the jackson parties and,in a separate section of its statement of decision,no probable cause to initiate or continue any of the claims in the lawsuit against barbara jackson,doran mitchell or john and carol fecteau.as to lee jackson and thomas mitchell,even though the court found there was probable cause to believe they made internet postings relating to computerxpress,the court ultimately concluded the evidence failed to establish the factual or legal tenability of the claims asserted.
third,did the defendants act with malice in pursuing the action the court concluded computerxpress,yarbray,rather,scivally and nichols had acted with malice in the initiation and continuation of the riverside action t he broad scope of the meritless lawsuit was initiated and pursued to overwhelm,intimidate and bully the jackson parties.according to the court statement of decision,introduced at trial revealed the defendants frustration at reading the internet postings relating to computerxpress,prompting them to rashly embark on the misguided lawsuit in an attempt to silence jackson and mitchell with the exception of bb k,the various among the defendants clearly show a malicious intent to bring the lawsuit against all plaintiffs.
fourth,did the nonattorney defendants establish an defense rejecting yarbray claim he had merely delegated the matter to the lawyers,the court found,without any semblance of discerning the broad claims as to each defendant he caused to be sued,he was the one who spearheaded the lawsuit for motives unrelated to any legitimate claim of harm.as to the other defendants,the court rejected their conclusory testimony they had relied on counsel,explaining they failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence the required elements of the defense.
citing the testimony from several of the jackson parties,the court found they had incurred a total of in attorney fees in defending against the maliciously prosecuted riverside action.that sum,the court ruled,must be reduced by the judgment for attorney fees they had already received in that case.the court also found all the jackson parties,except thomas mitchell on behalf of the estate of doran mitchell,were entitled to recover emotional distress damages.the court explained the jackson parties were entitled to recover for emotional distress due to being improperly sued,not for distress resulting from their underlying financial condition resulting from the failed plans to be involved with computerxpress.the court awarded a total of in emotional distress damages each to barbara jackson,lee jackson,john fecteau and thomas mitchell and to carol fecteau.
the court also found by clear and convincing evidence that computerxpress,yarbray,scivally,nichols and rather had acted with malice for the purpose of establishing the jackson parties right to punitive damages.the court stated it would prepare a proposed judgment after the completion of the trial in the punitive damages phase of the case.
punitive damages and the issue of attorney fees revisited 
the court trial on punitive damages was held on april and,following several additional pretrial court proceedings.on may,the court entered its ruling on punitive damages.following extended skirmishing over the need for a statement of decision and the applicability of section and california rules of court,rule to a bifurcated trial limited to the amount of punitive damage,the court recast its may,order as a tentative decision,thereafter adopted its tentative decision as the proposed statement of decision following a request for a statement of decision by yarbray and finally on august,signed and issued its statement of damage phase.
in the statement of decision the court explained its method of evaluating the defendants financial condition and ability to pay and observed with respect to yarbray that his credibility had been and remained an issue throughout the trials.the court awarded a total of million in punitive damages to each of the six jackson computerxpress,yarbray,scivally and rather,explaining the punitive damage award to each of the six plaintiffs is on the low end of any percentage of compensatory damage measurement,when compared to the compensatory damages suffered by that individual.the court also noted nichols had settled this aspect of the case and was not part of the court punitive damage award 
in a minute order also issued on august,the court reported its continuing concern about the issue of amount and scope of attorneys fees.shortly thereafter the court set a september,hearing date to consider the matter.on september,bb k filed and served an extensive set of documents directed to the attorney fee issue,essentially providing judge with the materials previously presented to judge berle in connection with the competing in limine motions and the motion for reconsideration,as well as excerpts from the reporter transcript of those proceedings.renfrew subsequently declared that the only copy of the bb k filing apparently served on her was sent by mail,not by any of the means reasonably calculated to ensure delivery not later than the close of the next business day after filing,as contemplated by section,subdivision c,and further declared that she was unaware of the filing when she attended the hearing on september.
at the hearing on september,following oral argument directed primarily to the meaning of judge berle earlier rulings,but which also revisited the question whether a written order for attorney fees had ever been entered in the riverside action and the adequacy of the evidence presented in support of bb k in limine motion,the court determined that no attorney fees from the riverside case could be recovered as special damages in the malicious prosecution action.although the court explanation is not as clear as it might be,in no small part because counsel for both sides seemed unable to focus on the issue of apportionment that concerned judge,it appears the court determined it was the jackson parties burden to allocate their total attorney fees between legal services covered by the earlier fee award and those not included in that award.having failed to present any evidence on that point,judge concluded,they were not entitled to any fees as damages.
on october,the court signed and entered an order after completion of bifurcated trial,amending the may,statement of decision to exclude the attorney fee recovery.as recited in that order,the court has decided that judge berle has previously rejected plaintiffs theory of attorney fee recovery attributable to the riverside trial.this court adopts that decision.by the same order,the court rejected the jackson parties request for a new statement of decision.
on october,the court also signed and entered its judgment after completion of bifurcated trial.pursuant to that judgment,the jackson parties recovered nothing against bb k,and bb k was awarded its costs of suit.the jackson parties,except for thomas mitchell as the representative of the estate of doran mitchell,recovered a total of in compensatory damages for emotional distress each of the six jackson parties recovered in punitive damages,jointly and severally,from computerxpress,yarbray,scivally and rather,and a total of in punitive damages from nichols,pursuant to the parties stipulation.the jackson parties were also awarded their costs of suit against those defendants found liable to them.
the jackson parties and yarbray each moved for a new trial and to vacate or set aside the october,judgment.the court denied the motions on december.the jackson parties and yarbray filed timely notices of appeal.
contentions 
the jackson parties contend the trial court erred in precluding any recovery for attorney fees and expenses incurred in defending the riverside action and finding they had not proved bb k acted with malice in connection with its involvement in that case.they also contend the trial court failed to properly respond to their requests for a statement of decision.yarbray contends the trial court erred in finding him the alter ego of computerxpress,he was shielded from liability for malicious prosecution by his reliance on the advice of counsel,there was no favorable termination of the riverside action and the award of punitive damages against him was excessive.neither computerxpress itself nor any other defendant found liable by the trial court has appealed from the adverse judgment.
discussion 
the trial court erred in precluding any recovery by the jackson parties for attorney fees incurred in defending the riverside action 
a malicious prosecution action provides a remedy for a party that has suffered out of pocket loss in the form of attorney fees and costs,as well as emotional distress and injury to reputation because of groundless allegations made in pleadings which are public records.sagonowsky v.more th,d.the malicious commencement of a civil proceeding is actionable because it harms the individual against whom the claim is made the individual is harmed because he is compelled to defend against a fabricated claim which not only subjects him to the panoply of psychological pressures most civil defendants suffer,but also to the additional stress of attempting to resist a suit commenced out of spite or ill will,often magnified by slanderous allegations in the pleadings.in recognition of the wrong done the victim of such a tort,settled law permits him to recover the cost of defending the prior action including reasonable attorney fees citations,compensation for injury to reputation or impairment of his social and business standing in the community citations,and for mental or emotional distress.bertero national general cal d,bertero.
having established the liability of computerxpress and the remaining defendants other than bb k,the jackson parties were entitled to recover as part of their compensatory damage award the costs of defending the riverside action including their reasonable attorney fees.bertero,supra,cal d at,sycamore ridge apartments llc naumann th,d plaintiff who successfully asserts a malicious prosecution claim can obtain reasonable attorney fees incurred defending against the prior action.the special damage to the plaintiff therefore is the amount which he has been compelled to expend or incur in his defense,but he can only recover such part thereof as constitutes a necessary and reasonable charge,the latter question being one to be determined from the evidence.stevens chisholm cal.
notwithstanding a successful malicious prosecution plaintiff right to recover for reasonable attorney fees incurred in the underlying litigation,the trial court ultimately ruled the judgment in favor of the jackson parties should not include any such award.that conclusion rested on four intermediate steps 
the determination in the riverside action that was the reasonable value of legal services provided by renfrew in connection with the successful portion of the jackson parties motion is binding in their subsequent malicious prosecution action under the doctrine of collateral estoppel.
because the trial court in the riverside action awarded the jackson parties the reasonable value of those legal services,no portion of the fees incurred for those services is recoverable in the malicious prosecution action.
it was the jackson parties burden to prove they incurred attorney fees for legal services not covered by the earlier fee award.
because the jackson parties testified only that they incurred a total of in attorney fees in defending the riverside action and presented no evidence allocating any portion of those fees to services not included in the earlier fee award,they were not entitled to any fees as damages.
most of the parties briefing and argument,both in the trial court and on appeal,has concentrated on the first collateral estoppel effect of the earlier fee award.we agree in substantial part with the trial court conclusion the jackson parties may not relitigate their entitlement to additional fees for services included within that award.however,each of the other elements of the court analysis of the jackson parties right to recover attorney fees is flawed and requires reversal of the judgment.in addition,the court errors created confusion as to the proper procedure to try the attorney fee issue accordingly,remand for a limited retrial is necessary.
a.the fee award following a successful special motion to strike will generally preclude further litigation concerning the reasonable value of the legal services covered by that award 
under section,subdivision b,a defendant may move to strike the entire complaint or one or more causes of action arising from any act in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue if the plaintiff can not demonstrate a probability of prevailing,the trial court must strike the challenged causes of action and award the defendant attorney fees and costs,subd.c varian medical systems,delfino cal th,d,see doe luster th,d.a ny slapp defendant who brings a successful motion to strike is entitled to mandatory attorney fees.ketchum moses cal th,d.
as the court of appeal held in computerxpress,supra,th at page,d,even if the special motion to strike is granted only as to some claims,the partially successful defendant is entitled to attorney fees.the lack of success on other claims is relevant to the amount of,but not the right to,fees.mann quality old time service,th,d.however,only those attorney fees and costs related to the special motion to strike,not the entire action,may be recovered under section,subdivision c.see,beach properties berti cal th,d,the fee provision under applies only to the motion to strike,and not to the entire action lafayette morehouse chronicle publishing th,d legislative history of clearly show s the legislature intended that a prevailing defendant on a motion to strike be allowed to recover attorney fees and costs only on the motion to strike,not the entire suit.
in awarding fees the trial court is not constrained by the amount sought by the successful moving parties robertson rodriguez th,d,but is obligated to award reasonable attorney fees under section that adequately compensate them for the expense of responding to a baseless lawsuit.id.at,d accord,dove audio,rosenfeld,meyer susman th,d.the fees awarded should include services for all proceedings,including discovery initiated by the opposing party pursuant to section,subdivision g,directly related to the special motion to strike.tuchscher development enterprises,san diego unified port dist.th,d affirming award of attorney fees including fees incurred in opposing discovery request and motion for reconsideration american humane los angeles times communications th,d documentation for attorney fee motion should include the total cost of the special motion to strike and any related discovery permitted by the court see wilkerson sullivan th,d statute is broadly construed so as to effectuate the legislative purpose of reimbursing the prevailing defendant for expenses incurred in extricating herself from a baseless lawsuit.
in determining the fee award pursuant to section,the court may utilize the lodestar method addressed in serrano priest cal d,and in appropriate cases may include a fee enhancement for the purpose of compensating the attorney for contingent risk,exceptional skill or other factors.ketchum moses,supra,cal th at,d.
once the court has decided the amount of attorney fees that adequately compensates the defendants in the underlying lawsuit for their efforts in moving to strike the complaint under section,relitigation of that specific is,the reasonable value of that portion of the total attorney fees incurred in the underlying action that relate to the successful special motion to a subsequent malicious prosecution action will usually be precluded by the doctrine of collateral estoppel or issue preclusion for,as to that narrow issue,all five threshold requirements for application of the doctrine are satisfied first,the issue sought to be precluded from relitigation must be identical to that decided in a former proceeding.second,this issue must have been actually litigated in the former proceeding.third,it must have been necessarily decided in the former proceeding.fourth,the decision in the former proceeding must be final and on the merits.finally,the party against whom preclusion is sought must be the same as,or in privity with,the party to the former proceeding.lucido superior court cal d,accord,pacific lumber state water resources control bd.cal th,d,see also branson growers th,d a lthough a second action between the parties on a different cause of action is not barred by res judicata,nevertheless the first judgment operates as an estoppel or conclusive adjudication as to such issues in the second action as were actually litigated and determined in the first action.
the jackson parties advance several arguments to avoid any collateral estoppel effect from the earlier fee award.first,they insist the issue of attorney fees as damages in a malicious prosecution action is not the same as the question of reasonable attorney fees following a successful special motion to strike and thus was not actually litigated or necessarily decided in the prior action.if their point is simply that the attorney fees incurred in the riverside action included fees for services unrelated to the successful portions of the motion for example,the motion for summary adjudication following remand from the court of appeal,they are correct and nothing in the earlier award forecloses their recovery of those additional fees.but to the extent they seek recovery in the malicious prosecution action for fees incurred in successfully pursing the special motion to strike,the issue of the reasonable value of those fees has been finally determined rejecting a multiplier requested by renfrew and apparently reducing by approximately the total number of hours claimed at her normal hourly rate.
if,on the other hand,the jackson parties are asserting the fee determination pursuant to section,subdivision c,is different from assessing the fees recoverable as special damages in a malicious prosecution action because the former is limited by a reasonableness standard while the latter is not,they are simply wrong.as discussed,the awards in both situations are measured by the reasonable attorney fees the reasonable attorney fees incurred to obtain a dismissal by filing an motion see,robertson rodriguez,supra,th at,d or the reasonable attorney fees incurred to defend against a meritless lawsuit see,bertero,supra,cal d at,stevens chisholm,supra,cal.at.
second,the jackson parties contend the fee award in the riverside action was not actually litigated because it was decided on declarations primarily the declaration of their counsel,renfrew,who described her legal services on behalf of her clients at some length following submission of a memorandum of costs claiming the fees and a motion to tax costs filed by computerxpress.according to the jackson parties,it is well settled the outcome of a motion decided without oral testimony can not give rise to collateral estoppel precluding relitigation of the same issue in an ensuing suit.the single case cited for this proposition in the jackson parties opening brief,groves peterson th,d,however,involved efforts to set aside a default and default judgment for lack of proper service of process.the court expressly limited its holding to that particular limitation nowhere acknowledged by the jackson parties in the specific context of the present case,where the issue is whether the prior denial of a motion in the underlying case to set aside a default and default judgment should be given collateral estoppel effect so as to bar a subsequent independent action in equity to set aside the prior judgment,a long line of cases has established a rule that such prior order does not collaterally estop the subsequent action.id.at,d.
the reason for limiting collateral estoppel in this context,as explained by the groves court,is that information needed to decide the merits of the request to set aside the default may well require compelled testimony from the opposing party regarding its efforts to serve the summons and complaint.see groves peterson,supra,th at,d.in marked contrast,the question of the reasonable amount of attorney fees incurred by a prevailing party in litigation is typically determined based on declarations submitted by the parties and their counsel,as it was here.absent exceptional circumstances indicating there was no opportunity for a full presentation of the issue in the context of the motion for fees,such a determination meets the actually litigated requirement for application of collateral estoppel.see barker hull d.while the party urging the estoppel must prove that the issue was actually litigated and that evidence was not restricted,he need not establish that any particular type of evidence,such as oral testimony,was presented see also benasra mitchell th,d collateral estoppel should not be applied if there was no opportunity for a full presentation of the issue in the first proceeding.
finally,the jackson parties dispute the existence of any legally cognizable order from the riverside action awarding them fees.without such an order,they insist,there can be no collateral estoppel.we disagree.the reporter transcript of the hearing on the fee request,together with the notice of ruling from the riverside action,is sufficient to confirm the existence of an order awarding in fees.as we discuss below,any difficulty in proving what services were intended to be covered by that fee award that may result from the absence of a written order will be borne in the first instance by the defendants,not the jackson parties.
b.it is the defendant burden in a malicious prosecution action to challenge the plaintiff evidence of attorney fees by demonstrating those fees are unreasonable or apportioning the fees to unrecoverable legal services 
testimony or properly admitted documentary evidence of the attorney fees incurred to defend a maliciously prosecuted action constitutes a prima facie case of that element of special damages.absent contrary evidence,it must be assumed those fees were reasonable.see stevens chisholm,supra,cal.at.
as reflected in the trial court may,statement of decision,the jackson parties introduced competent,credible evidence they had incurred a total of in attorney fees in defending against the maliciously prosecuted riverside action.computerxpress and the other defendants were entitled to challenge the reasonableness of the attorney fees claimed by demonstrating that a specific portion of those fees was for legal services covered by the fee award in the riverside action and thus,by virtue of the collateral estoppel effect of that prior fee award,limited to a total recoverable value of it was the defendants burden,however,not the jackson parties,to prove such an allocation,just as it generally is the burden of the defendant in a malicious prosecution action to prove certain attorney fees incurred in the underlying action are not recoverable because they are attributable to claims that had been properly pursued.see crowley katleman cal th,d,any difficulty in apportionment of damages between theories of liability that are and are not supported by probable cause is chargeable to the tortfeasor bertero,supra,cal d at,burden of apportionment of harm that flowed from proceedings on maliciously prosecuted based on the same theories as a protected affirmative defe
