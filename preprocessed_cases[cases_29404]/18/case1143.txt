badger et,some of the shareholders of plaintiffs shareholders corporation psc,brought this shareholders derivative suit on behalf of psc against southern farm bureau life insurance company southern farm.the charges involve federal securities fraud,in violation of b of the securities exchange act of,and securities exchange commission sec rule,and florida fraud.the charges stem from southern farm purchase of a debenture held by psc,which was psc primary asset.in the course of negotiations,southern farm gave to psc an actuarial valuation it had commissioned of the debenture and stated that the valuation represented a fair price.after psc and southern farm settled on a price higher than southern farm valuation,psc issued a meeting notice and proxy statement to its shareholders,who subsequently voted for the sale.
plaintiffs were psc shareholders who were opposed to the sale.they brought a shareholders derivative suit against southern farm for federal securities fraud and florida fraud,alleging that southern farm valuation was misleading because it did not take into account certain leverage that psc had in the deal,and that southern farm was liable for failing to disclose the facts giving rise to psc leverage to psc shareholders.the jury found southern farm liable in the amount of million.southern farm now appeals,claiming,inter alia,that jury instruction contained incorrect statements of law and that the proof underlying one basis of liability was legally insufficient.for the reasons set out below,the judgment of the district court must be reversed with regard to both the federal securities law claim and the florida fraud claim,and the verdict of the jury can not stand.
facts and procedural history 
southern farm is a life insurance company owned by ten investment corporations located in ten states,including florida.the common stock of each investment corporation is held by the farm bureau federation in each of those respective states.the corporate relations between these various entities are governed by a charter treaty that restricts the dividends that each investment corporation can retain in excess of limits the transfer of southern farm and investment corporation stock and requires unanimous approval of any amendment,including any extension of the treaty beyond its expected expiration date.
psc acquired the debenture at the center of this case as a result of prior litigation,the full details of which are not relevant here.the debenture was issued by florida farm bureau holding corporation florida holding.pursuant to the terms of the debenture,its owner,psc,was entitled to of any dividends that florida holding received from southern farm,and upon termination of the charter treaty psc would be entitled to receive of florida holding stock.
in,southern farm began to explore extending the charter treaty,an action that would require unanimous approval of the ten state farm bureau federations.in,southern farm sought florida holding consent to extend the treaty.psc attorney,bruce brashear,formally objected to the extension of the charter treaty without the approval of psc shareholders.psc shareholders right to approve the charter treaty extension arose in connection with its ownership of the debenture.florida holding board resolved that it would consent to the charter treaty extension only if southern farm first purchased the debenture from psc.in turn,southern farm management decided to recommend purchasing psc debenture.
brashear represented psc in negotiations with southern farm general counsel regarding the sale of the debenture.in the course of negotiations,southern farm offered million for the debenture based on a valuation performed by the actuarial firm towers perrin tillinghast the valuation.the valuation was calculated by applying a discount rate of to the likely value of the payout of the debenture in,when the charter treaty was set to expire.southern farm counsel told brashear that the valuation reflected a fair price.psc made a counteroffer of million,and the companies agreed to the sale at that price.
because florida law requires a corporation to obtain shareholder approval in order to sell a principal asset,fla stat,brashear prepared and mailed to psc shareholders a meeting notice and proxy statement detailing the proposed debenture sale.the proxy statement did not include the facts that southern farm wanted to extend the charter treaty or that florida holding had conditioned its consent to the extension on southern farm purchase of the debenture.psc shareholders met on october,and approved the sale by a margin.plaintiff badger and several other psc shareholders voiced their opposition both before and at the meeting.
following the sale,badger and other dissenters sued southern farm in this shareholders derivative action,claiming that southern farm failed to disclose certain material facts about the debenture sale to the shareholders and that,as a result,psc received too little consideration in exchange for the debenture.specifically,the plaintiffs alleged 
the defendant represented to the plaintiffs that the tillinghast valuation of the convertible debenture represented a fair price for the purchase of the debenture,but the defendant omitted the following information 
a that southern farm was attempting to extend the charter treaty and that it could not do so without the consent of the debenture holder 
b that florida holding and the florida federation would only consent to the extension of the charter treaty if southern farm first purchased the debenture 
c that the tillinghast valuation did not consider i the defendant attempts to extend the charter treaty,ii plaintiffs control of any such extension,and iii southern farm need to purchase the debenture because florida holding and florida federation would only consent to the extension of the charter treaty if southern farm first purchased the debenture 
d that contemporaneous with southern farm purchase of the debenture,it purchased a future income interest held by the alabama farm bureau federation using a discount rate of and 
e that in order to obtain the consent of the texas farm bureau to extend the charter treaty,southern farm agreed to increase payouts to all ten farm bureau federations by million.

iii.discussion 
jury instruction 
jury instruction,the accuracy of which is the central issue in this appeal,provides as follows 
ordinarily in an arms length transaction,a third party buyer or seller is free to rely on the board of a corporation to disclose information to the corporation,including to the corporation shareholders.in this regard,any disclosures by the third party to a director or an agent of the corporation or other knowledge obtained by the director or agent,where that director or agent is acting in his or her capacity as a board member or agent,is imputed to the board and,thus,discharges the third party duty of disclosure if the disclosure is of all material information and is not materially misleading.
in this case,shareholder approval was required to approve this transaction.therefore,if the plaintiffs prove that the defendant knew or was severely reckless as to whether material information had not been fully disclosed to the shareholders or that the disclosures made by the defendant to the corporation were materially misleading,then the defendant had a duty to disclose the material information directly to the shareholders,to insure that the shareholders got proper disclosure or to decline to enter the transaction.
jury instructions,dkt.at.
southern farm argues that jury instruction is erroneous in two respects.first,southern farm maintains that instruction incorrectly assigned liability if southern farm merely knew or was severely reckless as to whether material information had not been fully disclosed to psc shareholders,without also requiring the jury find that southern farm had a legal duty to disclose that information.second,southern farm argues that,even if southern farm had a duty to disclose certain material information in the course of its transaction with psc,instruction erred in instructing the jury that the duty ran directly to psc shareholders,rather than to psc officers or board of directors.we will address each objection in turn.
southern farm duty to disclose 
southern farm argues that instruction erroneously omitted a requirement that the jury find that southern farm had a legal duty to disclose material facts to psc.sec rule,promulgated under the securities exchange act of,states 
it shall be unlawful for any person,directly or indirectly,by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce,or of the mails or of any facility of any national securities exchange,
to employ any device,scheme,or artifice to defraud,
to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading,or 
to engage in any act,practice,or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person,
in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.
although rule could be read broadly to require disclosure of any nonpublic information about a security that is the subject of a transaction,the supreme court has held that a duty to disclose under b does not arise from the mere possession of nonpublic market information.chiarella united states.rather,the chiarella court clarified the scope of,holding that in order to be liable under that section for failing to disclose a material fact,an entity must have a prior duty to disclose that fact.id.as under the common law,such a duty arises when one party has information that the other party is entitled to know because of a fiduciary or other similar relation of trust and confidence between them.id.at.at quoting restatement second of torts a.the court noted,for instance,that a purchaser of stock who has no duty to a prospective seller because he is neither an insider nor a fiduciary has been held to have no obligation to reveal material facts in connection with the stock purchase.id.at.at citing time talley,cir,cert.denied.see also roder alpha.cir recognizing the logical corollary of chiarella that e ven if information is material,there is no liability under rule unless there was a duty to disclose it.thus,there can be no liability for a failure to disclose under rule or the common law in the absence of a duty to disclose.
following chiarella,this court has also recognized that a defendant omission to state a material fact is proscribed only when the defendant has a duty to disclose.ziemba cascade int l,cir quoting rudolph arthur andersen,cir alteration omitted.see also williams dressler,cir recognizing in dicta that a duty to disclose does not exist absent a fiduciary relationship or some other similar relationship of trust and confidence.in ziemba,we noted that this duty arises both where the law imposes special obligations,as for accountants,brokers,or other experts and w here a defendant failure to speak would render the defendant own prior speech misleading or deceptive.at quoting rudolph,at.
in this case,the parties agree that southern farm and psc were engaged in an arm length transaction psc has not asserted the existence of a fiduciary relationship or other similar relationship of trust and confidence between psc shareholders and southern farm.rather,at trial,psc proceeded on the theory that both the valuation and statement that the valuation represented a fair price constituted prior speech by southern farm that was misleading or deceptive without the omitted information.psc argued that the legal duty to disclose arose because the omissions made the valuation and the fair price statement materially misleading.we are doubtful that a buyer assessment of the value of a seller debt instrument,or a buyer accompanying statement that the assessment is fair,could ever constitute misleading or deceptive prior speech giving rise to a duty to disclose.see kidwell ex rel.penfold meikle,cir purchaser of corporate assets owed no duty to disclose material facts to members of selling corporation,because selling corporation should be presumed to have known as much about its own assets and affairs as purchaser in an arm length deal see also restatement second of torts cmt.d if the subject matter of the transaction is one upon which both parties have an approximately equal competence to form a reliable opinion,each must trust to his own judgment and neither is justified in relying upon the opinion of the other.indeed,we are aware of no case suggesting that,in an arm length transaction,the buyer opinion of the value of the seller asset,unaccompanied by a misstatement of fact on which the value is based,could constitute an affirmative statement which could be rendered misleading by an omission.we need not decide,however,whether the valuation or accompanying statement could have given rise to such a duty to disclose in this case because errors in jury instruction require reversal.
instruction imposed on southern farm a duty to disclose certain material information to psc shareholders if southern farm knew or was severely reckless as to whether material information had not been fully disclosed to the shareholders or that the disclosures made by southern farm to psc were materially misleading.thus,instruction allowed the jury to hold southern farm liable for failing to disclose material information to psc shareholders either if southern farm knew or was severely reckless as to whether material information had not been fully disclosed to the shareholders or southern farm had made disclosures to psc that were materially misleading.the first condition of this disjunction permitted the jury to find southern farm liable for merely knowing that material information had not been disclosed to psc shareholders,even if southern farm itself had no legal duty to disclose that information,even if southern farm had no duty as described in chiarella and its progeny.because instruction omitted the requirement that southern farm must have had a legal duty to disclose material information to psc shareholders in order to be held liable under rule for withholding that information,the instruction contains an incorrect statement of the law under chiarella and our own subsequent cases.
although the foregoing error in instruction is clear,at oral argument plaintiffs argued that southern farm never objected in the district court to the instruction on this specific ground.we have carefully reviewed those portions of the record cited by southern farm as evidence that it preserved its objection to instruction and think the objection probably was not properly preserved.in general,a party must object to a jury instruction prior to deliberations in order to preserve the issue on appeal,and the failure to make a timely objection waives the right to raise the issue on appeal.landsman packing cont l can,cir.thus,if southern farm did not make this objection in the district court,it could not prevail on this particular challenge on appeal unless it could show that the error affects substantial rights.d a court may consider a plain error in the instruction that has not been preserved if the error affects substantial rights.although this error may well have been responsible for an incorrect verdict,leading to substantial injustice,farley nationwide mut.ins,cir internal quotation omitted,we need not decide whether the stringent standard for plain error is satisfied in this case,because southern farm other challenge to instruction was clearly preserved,and is clearly meritorious.
thus,we now turn to southern farm argument that instruction erroneously imposed upon it a duty to disclose material information directly to psc shareholders.
southern farm duty to disclose directly to psc shareholders 
southern farm further argues that,even if it had a duty to disclose certain material facts to psc in the course of negotiations regarding the debenture purchase jury instruction erred by imposing on southern farm a duty to disclose those facts directly to psc shareholders.any duty to disclose,southern farm argues,would have been satisfied by disclosure to psc officers or directors.this objection was clearly preserved before the district court.we agree that instruction was erroneous for this reason,and accordingly reverse the judgment on this ground.
instruction states,in relevant part 
i f the plaintiffs prove that the defendant knew or was severely reckless as to whether material information had not been fully disclosed to the shareholders or that the disclosures made by the defendant to the corporation were materially misleading,then the defendant had a duty to disclose the material information directly to the shareholders,to insure that the shareholders got proper disclosure or to decline to enter the transaction.
the district court formulated instruction upon determining that t he law imposes a duty to make full disclosure to whomever the investor or decision maker is in this case.trial,dkt.at.the court therefore reasoned that,because the shareholders had the right to vote on the debenture sale,southern farm duty to disclose material information in relation to the sale ran directly to the shareholders.
this is an incorrect statement of the law.in fact,courts have uniformly declined to find a duty to disclose running from one party in an arm length securities transaction to the shareholders of the counterparty to the transaction,absent some fiduciary or other special relationship between them.see regents of of ca.credit suisse first boston,cir stating that general duty of banks not to engage in a fraudulent scheme did not create on behalf of banks a duty to disclose to a company investors a series of transactions between banks and the company,because banks were not fiduciaries and were not otherwise obligated to the investors arent distrib,cir holding that party to a potential merger had no duty to disclose to counterparty shareholders fact that merger would fall through because unrelated parties to a merger agreement normally deal at arms length until the merger is consummated,unless a different relationship is defined in the agreement to merge kidwell,at noting that purchaser of corporate assets owed no duty to disclose material facts to members of selling corporation,in part because selling corporation should be presumed to have known as much about its own assets and affairs as purchaser in an arm length deal wright heizer,cir holding that corporate lender and shareholder who did not control nor serve on the board of the corporation was entitled to act solely in its own interest in dealing with the corporation management,whose responsibility it was to advise the corporation shareholders in re digital island sec,d,citing sheehan,infra,to hold that an acquiring company owes no duty to the target shareholders,absent a special relationship sheehan little switzerland,d,holding that,although the defendants committed an omission giving rise to a duty to disclose,only the shareholders own board of directors,not the acquiring corporation,were liable under for failure to disclose because the acquiring corporation owed no duty to the shareholders or the plaintiffs in this case lerner fnb rochester,stating that an acquiring corporation owes no duty of disclosure to target company shareholders gordon diagnostek,holding that an acquiring corporation owed no special fiduciary responsibility to the shareholders of a separate corporation whose stock it was planning to acquire as part of an transaction see also chiarella,at.at a purchaser of stock who has no duty to a prospective seller because he is neither an insider nor fiduciary has been held to have no obligation to reveal material facts.in addition to this great weight of authority,we also note that plaintiffs cite no precedent for the proposition that,in the absence of some fiduciary or special relationship,a duty to disclose directly to shareholders could arise in a situation such as this.
the district court,and plaintiffs on appeal,relied primarily on wright heizer for the proposition that southern farm duty to disclose the allegedly omitted material facts ran directly to psc shareholders.the argument is grounded in wright assertion that w hen shareholder approval is required by state corporation law it is the shareholders who represent the corporation and it is they who are entitled to disclosure of all material facts.at.it appears the district court reasoned from this statement that if southern farm had a duty to disclose material facts related to the debenture sale,that duty ran directly to psc shareholders because the shareholders were entitled to vote on that transaction.the plaintiffs now urge us to accept the same reasoning.the flaw in the district court reasoning is that wright applied that principle,and imposed that duty,only when determining the obligations of a defendant who owed a fiduciary duty to the shareholders.the plaintiffs argument elides important facts about the relationships between the wright parties giving rise to the duty to disclose in that case,and in doing so misstates wright holding.
