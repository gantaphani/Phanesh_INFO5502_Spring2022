in this case we hold when an insurance company seeks to provide a defense in pending litigation for a corporation that has been suspended for nonpayment of its taxes,the insurance company must intervene in the action to protect its own interests and those of its insured.the insurance company may not answer and litigate the lawsuit in the name of the suspended corporation without intervening in the case.here,because its insured is barred from exercising corporate powers,rights,and privileges and the insurance company is not a party,the insurance company failure to intervene barred any application for fees and costs,even though the insurance company and insured were successful in persuading kaufman broad communities,to dismiss its lawsuit.we shall dismiss this appeal.
factual and procedural background 
after it was sued by homeowners in a construction defect case,kaufman broad communities,kaufman,filed a against performance plastering,performance plastering.in its,kaufman sued performance plastering for contractual and equitable indemnity,breach of contract,and declaratory relief.the franchise tax board had previously suspended performance plastering because it failed to pay its taxes.
performance plastering insurance company,calfarm insurance company calfarm,employed a law firm,read aliotti read,to file an answer to the.the answer to the read filed designated the responding party as performance plastering,a suspended corporation,by and through its general liability insurance carrier,calfarm insurance company.calfarm,however,did not move to intervene in the case.during the course of the litigation,read discovered the contract under which performance plastering agreed to provide services to kaufman had been canceled prior to any of the work at issue in the underlying lawsuit.on october,read served a code of civil procedure section offer,offering to accept in exchange for a mutual release of claims between the parties.rather than accept the offer,kaufman dismissed its on october.
read then filed a memorandum of costs and brought a motion for attorney fees.kaufman moved to strike the memorandum of costs and opposed the motion arguing calfarm was not a party because it had not intervened in the action and performance plastering,as a suspended corporation,was not entitled to recover fees or costs because of its suspension.
the trial court denied the motion for attorney fees and granted the motion to strike the memorandum of costs.in its tentative ruling,the court concluded,calfarm is not a party to this action and has no standing to claim attorney fees and costs.performance plastering is a suspended corporation and has no standing to claim attorney fees or costs.in its final ruling,the court was not persuaded that a non party to an action can assert a right to attorney fees.

discussion 
icalfarm was not entitled to defend this action in the name of performance plasteringastatutory analysis 
calfarm argues that under section,performance plastering was entitled to have calfarm provide it counsel and defend this action in performance plastering name without calfarm intervening in the lawsuit.this argument requires us to examine the interplay between sections and.these statutes do not allow the suspended corporation to exercise the powers and privileges of a corporation in good standing.thus,an insurance company must intervene in the lawsuit to protect the rights of its insured suspended corporation.
section provides,in relevant part,the corporate powers,rights and privileges of a domestic taxpayer may be suspended if it does not pay its taxes.the suspension of the corporate powers,rights,and privileges means a suspended corporation can not sue or defend a lawsuit while its taxes remain unpaid,prudential sav.loan d.once a suspended corporation pays its taxes and obtains a certificate of revivor,however,the corporation may be allowed to carry on the litigation.ibid.its revivor will validate most otherwise invalid prior proceedings in the case.ibid.the underlying purpose of this statute is to induce the corporation to pay its taxes.ibid.
prior to,section provided,any person who attempts or purports to exercise the powers,rights,and privileges of a corporation which has been suspended pursuant to section is punishable by a fine of not less than two hundred fifty dollars and not exceeding one thousand dollars,or by imprisonment not exceeding one year,or both fine and imprisonment.stats,ch.
thus,under the law as it existed in,an insurance company could intervene in an action against its insured to protect the insurance company own rights,but could not assert the rights of the corporation in that action.for example,in truck ins.exchange superior court th,d,the appellate court held an insurance company was entitled to intervene on its own behalf to protect its own rights,but also concluded the insurance company could not assert the subrogation rights of its insured.in that case,truck insurance exchange truck insurance insured a roofing contractor named rcs equities,rcs.id.at,d.the franchise tax board had suspended rcs corporate status for nonpayment of taxes.ibid.several actions were filed against rcs for personal injuries allegedly caused by defective roofing installed by rcs.id.at,d.transco syndicate transco,alpine insurance company alpine,and truck insurance each separately provided insurance coverage to rcs.id.at,d.truck insurance,on the one hand,accepted rcs tender of defense for the personal injury claims.id.at,d.transco and alpine,on the other hand,sued rcs seeking to rescind their insurance policies on the grounds of fraud.ibid.as rcs was about to have its default judgment entered,truck insurance sought to intervene in that action and the trial court denied its motion.ibid.
the appellate court reversed.truck ins.exchange superior court,supra,th at,d.under code of civil procedure section,upon timely application,any person,who has an interest in the matter in litigation,or in the success of either of the parties,or an interest against both,may intervene in the action or proceeding.under this section,i f proper procedures are followed citation,the court has discretion to permit a nonparty to intervene in litigation pending between others,provided the nonparty has a direct and immediate interest in the litigation and the intervention will not enlarge the issues in the case and the reasons for intervention outweigh any opposition by the existing parties.citations.citation.truck ins.exchange superior court,supra,th at,d.the appellate court concluded truck insurance had a direct interest in the litigation because the other insurers might be able to void their insurance policies with rcs by way of a default judgment in the underlying action.id.at,d.on the one hand,denying truck insurance the right to intervene would result in the voiding of those policies eliminating a potential source of additional insurance for truck insurance to draw on to recoup payments truck insurance may have to make on behalf of rcs.ibid.thus,the pending litigation had a direct and substantial affect on truck insurance.ibid.on the other hand,allowing truck insurance to intervene merely put the other insurance companies to the task of proving the grounds for rescission of the policies.id.at,d.
the court concluded,however,that truck insurance could not intervene and assert any rights held by rcs,such as the right of subrogation.truck ins.exchange superior court,supra,th at,d.in asserting a subrogation claim,the insurer stands in the shoes of its insured,and has no greater rights than its insured.id.at,d because the insured can not pursue its rights in litigation,the insurer can not do what its insured can not do and is similarly barred.ibid.
noting an ambiguity in the statute which purported to prohibit insurance companies from defending actions brought against a suspended corporation assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess,the legislature amended section,effective january,to specifically exclude insurers or counsel retained by an insurer from coming within the scope of the statute.the legislature added subdivision b to section,which provides,b this section shall not apply to any insurer,or to counsel retained by an insurer on behalf of the suspended corporation,who provides a defense for a suspended corporation in a civil action based upon a claim for personal injury,property damage,or economic losses against the suspended corporation,and,in conjunction with this defense,prosecutes subrogation,contribution,or indemnity rights against persons or entities in the name of the suspended corporation.stats,ch.
calfarm argues this section allows it to file documents and defend the existing case in the name of the suspended plastering.we disagree.
while the enactment of the section exempted insurance companies from penal sanctions for participating in such litigation,it did not remove the disability applicable to suspended corporations under section nor did it authorize a new form of participation in a as a party nor intervener.
our role in construing a statute is to ascertain the legislature intent so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citation.in determining intent,we look first to the words of the statute,giving the language its usual,ordinary meaning.if there is no ambiguity in the language,we presume the legislature meant what it said,and the plain meaning of the statute governs.citation.hunt superior court cal th,d.thus,o nly when the language of a statute is susceptible to more than one reasonable construction is it appropriate to turn to extrinsic aids,including the legislative history of the measure,to ascertain its meaning.diamond multimedia systems,superior court cal th,d.here,the language of the statute and the cognizable legislative history of this new subdivision support the conclusion that the insurance company must intervene in the action to provide a defense for a suspended corporation 
the language of section,subdivision b,does not sanction calfarm argument it may use the name of its insured suspended corporation to continue the litigation.under section,a corporation suspended for the failure to pay its taxes is unable to exercise its corporate powers,rights and privileges which,as we have already stated,includes the right to defend a lawsuit.section,subdivision a,makes it a crime for any person to exercise the powers,rights,and privileges of a corporation that has been suspended pursuant to section.subdivision b of section only exempts the insurer,or counsel retained by an insurer on behalf of the suspended corporation,from these criminal penalties.thus,section does not generally authorize the insurer to exercise the rights and powers of its corporate insured.this obviously includes the right to sue or defend a lawsuit or even to appear in the lawsuit.this statute does not authorize the insurance company to exercise those rights and powers in the corporation name in a lawsuit.instead,the only manner in which the insurer may exercise those powers is by intervening in the lawsuit under code of civil procedure section and asserting any defenses on behalf of its insured.there is nothing within section that authorizes the insurance company to defend the litigation in the name of the suspended corporation.
subdivision b of section allows an insurance company to provide a defense for a suspended corporation in certain actions and,in connection with this defense,prosecute subrogation,contribution or indemnity rights in the name of the suspended corporation.the statute,however,is silent as to the proper mechanism the insurance company may use to exercise this right.as such,there is some facial ambiguity or tension between section,subdivision b and section that is sufficient to permit an examination of the legislative history of the enactment of subdivision b.
in our prior opinion in this case,we detailed the cognizable legislative history of section,subdivision b.kaufman broad communities,performance plastering,th,d.
we have examined that legislative history and conclude nothing there contradicts the conclusion we have reached.in fact,a single statement contained within that history supports our conclusion.the enrolled bill report prepared by the franchise tax board states in pertinent part,although this bill exempts the insurer from a misdemeanor prosecution,it does not provide the insurer the express opportunity to defend the suspended corporation without actually reviving the corporation from suspended status.if the company is revived,there is no need for section,subdivision b,as the corporation can then exercise its corporate powers.if,on the other hand,the corporation is not revived,the absence of any mechanism in the statute for the insurance company to assert the suspended corporation claims supports the conclusion that the insurance company must intervene in the lawsuit to protect the rights of its insured.in that instance,the insurance company is exempt from criminal prosecution.
no case subsequent to the enactment of section,subdivision b,has expressly addressed the question of whether the insurance company can defend the action in the name of the suspended insured corporation,or whether it must intervene.some cases,however,have sanctioned intervention as an appropriate approach.for example,in reliance ins.superior court th,d,the appellate court concluded the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to allow the insurance company reliance insurance company to intervene in a lawsuit against the insured suspended corporation.in that case,the wellses filed an action against campbell moving storage campbell for the loss of personal property.id.at,d.during the litigation,the wellses filed a motion to strike campbell answer because it had been suspended and could not defend the action.id.at,d.reliance responded to that motion by moving to intervene and the trial court denied that application.id.at,d.the sixth district court of appeal concluded the insurance company had a direct interest in the litigation.id.at,d under insurance code section,a judgment creditor can sue the insurance carrier for the defendant against whom a judgment is obtained.id.at,d.as a result,where there is a danger that a judgment will be entered by default,the insurance carrier is entitled to intervene in the underlying case to contest its insured fault or the available damages.id.at,d.hillcrest gym fitness center,th,footnote,d,comes to this same conclusion.
applying this rule here,the notice of appeal in this matter purports to be brought by performance plastering,a suspended corporation,by and through its general liability insurance carrier,calfarm insurance company.only a prevailing party is entitled to fees or costs.code civ,subd.b,subd.a.because calfarm never filed a motion to intervene in this case,it is not a party to this action and thus lacked standing to request any relief in the trial court.lohnes astron computer products th,d.moreover,as a nonparty,an insurance company can not pursue an appeal on behalf of its insured.bates john deere d.thus,to the extent that this notice of appeal was filed by calfarm on its own behalf,we dismiss it.moreover,because performance plastering continues to be a suspended corporation,lacking the power to pursue or defend litigation,we shall dismiss its appeal as well.
this result furthers the purpose of the statute 
calfarm argues allowing it to defend the action without intervening furthers section goal of making it easier for claimants to recover on judgments against suspended corporations as we have explained,the language of the statute does not provide calfarm with this procedural mechanism.further,we question the premise of calfarm legislative intent requiring the insurer to intervene in the action will discourage it from defending its insured in the underlying action because the intervention might result in the waiver of coverage defenses the insurer may be entitled to assert in a direct action against it under insurance code section.
insurance code section,subdivision b section b provides insurance policies issued in california shall either contain the following provision or shall be construed as if this provision is in the policy a provisio
