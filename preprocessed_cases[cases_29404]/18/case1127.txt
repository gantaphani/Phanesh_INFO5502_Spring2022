this case deals with the legal and constitutional sufficiency of the class action notice program under.and the due process clause.appellants are unnamed class plaintiffs in an action against appellee sprint corporation.the class action concerns alleged instances of securities fraud surrounding sprint failed merger attempt with worldcom.appellants received notice of a class settlement two weeks after the deadline for filing objections to the settlement and on the same day as the final fairness hearing on the settlement.after the district court approved the settlement between sprint and its shareholders,appellants moved to intervene,arguing that the attorneys fees to be paid to class counsel pursuant to the settlement were excessive and that the notice afforded to class members of the settlement was insufficient under the due process clause and.appellants claim that since they held their shares in street name meaning that they held only beneficial title to the shares while legal title was vested in their broker name,the period between the initial mailing of the settlement notice and the deadline for objections did not sufficiently account for the delays involved in forwarding notice packets to beneficial stock owners.
the district court held that the notice program was sufficient under rule and due process and denied the motion to intervene.for the reasons outlined below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
i.the parties 
sprint corporation sprint is in the telecommunications business,offering hardline and wireless service at the relevant time,sprint was the third largest carrier in the united states and had annual revenues in excess of billion.sprint common stock fon and its wireless tracking stock pcs are publicly held.
lead new england health care employees pension fund new england is a large institutional investor that purchased sprint securities.pursuant to section b of the private securities litigation reform act of the district court appointed new england to be the lead plaintiff in a consolidated class action against sprint seeking damages suffered by investors as a result of sprint failed merger attempt with worldcom.see in re sprint.sec,d,sprint i.sprint and new england eventually reached a million settlement,which the district court approved.
franklin and susan dejulius are members of the class who filed a motion to intervene,claiming that the notice of settlement to class members was inadequate and that the fee requested by class counsel was excessive.
ii.factual background 
on october,after several months of intense negotiations,sprint and worldcom,agreed to the terms of a merger whereby worldcom would acquire sprint for billion.see in re sprint.sec,d,sprint ii.at the time,both companies had massive market shares in the domestic and international telecommunications markets sprint was the nation third largest provider of long distance telephone services while worldcom was the second largest provider of international long distance lines to american customers and the largest provider of international private voice and data lines.id.the combination of the two companies was to be the largest corporate merger in history.id.
sprint and worldcom shareholders approved the merger proposal on april.id.however,on june,the justice department filed an antitrust suit to block the merger the european commission followed suit the next day.id.by july,sprint and worldcom officially terminated the merger agreement.id.at.
although the announcement of the merger initially had a positive impact on the value of pcs and fon shares,once the deal fell apart,stock values significantly decreased,causing investors to lose billions of dollars.id.at.some investors felt that the proposed merger was simply a ruse designed to allow certain sprint executives prematurely to exercise stock options.id.at.under sprint compensation plan,certain executives were given stock options to buy millions of shares of sprint common stock at prices well below market value.id.in,however,most of these options had not yet vested,which meant that sprint executives could not yet exercise them.id.according to plaintiffs,sprint executives were worried that sprint stock prices would continue to fall,further decreasing the potential value of their unvested options.id.
the incentive plan did,however,provide that should sprint undergo a,the options would immediately vest and become exercisable.id.thus,the plaintiff class alleges that sprint executives pushed for the worldcom merger with full knowledge that it would never ultimately stand up to an antitrust challenge.id.once the shareholders approved the merger,stock prices would rise,the options would vest,and the executives could cash in their stock options at a substantial profit.id.in fact,this is exactly what happened.william esrey,the chairman and ceo of sprint and a named individual defendant in this suit,made over million alone from his stock options.id.the plaintiff class alleges that the total windfall for all stock option participants was in excess of billion.id.the downside was that once the merger failed,sprint share prices tumbled.id.at.pcs shares dropped to,a percent decrease from its high point of after the merger agreement was announced.id.similarly,fon shares fell to,a percent decrease from its high point of after the merger agreement was announced.id.
iii.procedural history 
consolidated complaint and dismissal of some claims 
these events gave rise to three separate shareholder class actions,which were later consolidated into one complaint over which new england was the lead plaintiff.the consolidated complaint alleged that sprint made false and misleading statements in connection with the worldcom merger,in violation of section b of the securities and exchange act of the act,b,and sec rule,promulgated thereunder.the complaint also alleged sprint and worldcom violated section a of the act codified at a,a provision which provides for joint and several liability for any person who controls another that has violated the act or any regulation promulgated thereunder.
prior to class certification,sprint filed a motion to dismiss the suit.sprint ii,d at.in a lengthy opinion,the district court agreed to dismiss nearly all of the plaintiff class allegations,except for three paragraphs in the complaint dealing with misstatements and omissions made to the department of justice and the european commission.id.at.
settlement agreement 
after the district court dismissed the bulk of the claims against sprint,the parties entered into negotiations and,on april,agreed to settle the claims for million.under the terms of the agreement,the million would be placed in a common settlement fund for class members and would be distributed to class members after attorneys fees and other expenses were deducted.on october,the district court preliminarily approved the agreement,conditionally certifying a settlement class and scheduling the final settlement hearing for december.
notice dismissal 
the district court preliminary approval mandated a number of procedures aimed at notifying absent class members of the settlement agreement and their rights to,object,or intervene in the proceedings before the settlement became final.
along with their settlement agreement,the parties submitted several draft documents that would notify class members of the settlement and enable them to obtain their share of compensation from the settlement fund a notice of pendency and proposed settlement of class action the notice a proof of claim and release and a summary notice.the notice and proof of claim and release the notice packet were to be mailed directly to class members,while the summary notice would be published in newspapers and on the internet.those documents specifically stated that any class member wishing to or raise an objection to the settlement must do so before december,two weeks before the final settlement hearing.
the district court approved the proposed materials and ordered certain notice procedures that it found to be the best notice practicable under the circumstances.specifically,the court ordered that notice packets should be mailed to all sprint shareholders in the class within ten days,to the extent those persons were identifiable by sprint records.in addition,the district court ordered that the summary notice be published on two separate occasions within twenty days of its order in the national edition of investor business daily and the kansas city star.to facilitate class notice and claim processing,the court appointed gilardi,llc gilardi as the settlement administrator and ordered it to place all of the notice materials on its web site.
with regard to the individual notice to class members,the district court recognized a potential problem since it appeared that many of the shareholders reflected in sprint records were brokerage houses and it was thus likely that these entities held the shares only as nominees while the entities clients held the beneficial title to the shares,also known as holding shares in street name.the following background is useful 
the practice of registering securities in the records of issuers in other than the name of the beneficial owner is commonly referred to as nominee and street name registration.nominee name registration refers to arrangements used by institutional investors insurance companies and investment companies among others and financial intermediaries brokers,banks and trust companies for the registration of securities held by them for their own account or for the account of their customers who are the beneficial owners of the securities.street name registration,a specialized type of nominee name registration,refers to the practice of a broker registering in its name,or in the name of its nominee,securities left with it by customers or held by it for its own account.
securities and exchange commission,the street name study,reprinted in robert hamilton jonathan macey,cases and materials on corporations including partnerships and limited liability companies ed footnote omitted.the primary benefit of this practice is to permit beneficial owners easily and quickly to transfer ownership of their shares without meeting the issuer often cumbersome requirements,such as endorsing the back of the stock certificate.id.at.the downside,of course,is that the issuer records would not always reflect the true owners of the shares.see id.
in order to address this problem,the district court in the instant case issued special procedures for nominees who held shares on behalf of their clients during the class period.if a particular shareholder reflected in sprint records was a nominee,that entity had two options.the nominee could provide gilardi with a list of names and addresses of its clients who were the beneficial owners of the sprint shares.gilardi would then forward individual notice packets to each investor.alternatively,the nominee could simply request the appropriate number of notice packets from gilardi and then forward the notices itself to the actual owners.any costs associated with the mailing would be reimbursed from the settlement fund.in any event,the nominee was required to complete this process within ten days of receiving the initial notice package from gilardi.
on october,just two days after the district court gave preliminary approval for the settlement,gilardi obtained a list of shareholders from sprint and mailed notice packets to various individuals and entities.as predicted,many of these packets were sent to nominees following the procedures set forth above,an additional notice packages were sent out sometime before december,one day after the deadline for deadline and nearly two weeks prior to the settlement hearing of these packages,packages were mailed by gilardi directly to potential class members presumably from lists provided by nominees,and packages were sent in bulk to nominees for the nominees to forward on to their clients 
no objections to the settlement were filed prior to the december,deadline,and as scheduled,the district court held a final settlement hearing two weeks later on december.at the conclusion of the hearing,the district court approved the settlement and dismissed the suit against sprint.
d.the motion to intervene 
on december,appellants filed a motion to intervene for the limited purpose of filing a motion for leave to file late objections to the settlement approved by the district court just two days earlier.appellants sought their intervention both permissively and as of right.see.a b.in a document attached to their motion,appellants maintained that they did not receive notice of the class settlement until december,the very day of the fairness hearing and a full two weeks after the deadline for filing objections had passed.appellants sought to object to the settlement on two grounds that the attorneys fees requested by class counsel were unreasonable and excessive and that the notice to the class was inadequate and constitutionally defective.
the district court held that the notice scheme,on the whole,was constitutionally adequate even though appellants themselves did not receive timely notice of the settlement.it also noted that the issue regarding the fairness of the attorneys fees had already been taken up and ruled upon at the final settlement hearing.accordingly,the district court denied the motion to intervene.this appeal followed.
as to the attorneys fees,appellants have not raised this issue in their opening brief and it is therefore waived.see state farm fire cas.mhoon,cir.thus,the only remaining basis for intervention that appellants assert on appeal is the notice issue 
discussion 
jurisdiction 
on december,the district court approved the settlement order and dismissed the suit.two days later,appellants filed a motion to intervene permissively and as of right.the district court denied that motion on february.our appellate jurisdiction arises under.see coalition of counties for stable economic growth dep t of the interior,cir holding that a n order denying intervention is final and subject to immediate review if it prevents the applicant from becoming a party to the action and taking jurisdiction under 
ii.standard of review 
our review of rulings on motions to intervene as of right is de novo,and we review a denial of permissive intervention for abuse of discretion.city of stilwell ozarks rural coop,cir.the underlying question of whether a particular class action notice program satisfies the requirements of.and the due process clause is a legal determination we review de novo.see rutter wilbanks shell oil,cir stating that due process issues,which call for legal conclusions,are subject to de novo review torrisi tucson power,cir applying de novo review to due process and rule issues regarding class action notice program.however,the district court findings of fact regarding notice are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard.see.a.
iii.intervention 
although this case arose in the context of appellants motion to intervene,the district court,in its order denying the motion,never specifically mentioned the legal standards for intervention,which are laid out in.instead,the district court proceeded directly to the merits of the two objections appellant sought to raise if granted intervenor status sufficiency of the notice and appropriateness of the attorneys fees.finding both of these objections to be without merit,the district court simply denied the motion to intervene.
although our analysis ultimately turns on the merits of appellants putative objection to the notice procedures,we must first determine if the threshold requirements of rule have been met.provides,in relevant part 
a intervention of right.upon timely application anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action when the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action and the applicant is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the applicant ability to protect that interest,unless the applicant interest is adequately represented by existing parties.
b permissive intervention.upon timely application anyone may be permitted to intervene in an action when an applicant claim or defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in common in exercising its discretion the court shall consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties.
here,appellants do not challenge the adequacy of the named class representatives to protect their interests.the only asserted basis for intervention is the adequacy of class notice procedures,an entirely separate issue from adequacy of representation compare.a adequacy of representation,with.c b requiring notice in actions certified under rule b.thus,intervention as of right is not available to appellants.see charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice procedure,at ed.if the court determines that the absent class members are adequately represented,intervention as of right under rule a should be unavailable.intervention in this situation should be a matter that is left to the court discretion under the standards for permissive intervention in rule b.
as for the standards for permissive intervention,it is clear that appellants meet the requirement that their claim have a question of law or fact in common with the main action.b.where,as here,a class action is certified under.b,it is required that questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members however,in deciding whether to permit intervention,the court is also required to consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of existing litigants.b.the district court conclusion that the notice procedures in this case were adequate and therefore that appellants putative objection was meritless can be read as a conclusion that the intervention appellants sought would cause undue delay to the final disposition of the class settlement.
while our overall review of a motion to intervene permissively is for an abuse of discretion,here the district court rested its ruling on a legal conclusion that the notice procedures were adequate under the due process clause and rule.an abuse of discretion occurs when a district court bases its ruling on an erroneous conclusion of law.kiowa indian tribe hoover,cir.thus,if we a de novo standard of the district court incorrectly held the notice procedures to be adequate,we must reverse the district court ruling on appellants motion to intervene.
iv.adequacy of the class notice procedures 
applicable law 
under.e b,a district court approving a class action settlement must direct notice in a reasonable manner to all class members who would be bound by a proposed settlement,voluntary dismissal,or compromise.according to the advisory committee note,r easonable settlement notice may require individual notice in the manner required by rule c b,the rule governing notice,particularly when,as here,individual class members are required to file claims to collect from the settlement fund.advisory committee note,amendments,reprinted in federal civil judicial procedure and rules west ed.rule c b provides,in relevant part 
for any class certified under rule b,the court must direct to class members the best notice practicable under the circumstances,including individual notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort.
in addition to the requirements of rule,the constitution due process clause also guarantees unnamed class members the right to notice of certification or settlement.see const.amend.v mullane cent.hanover bank trust.eisen carlisle jacquelin,d.
many controversies have raged about the cryptic and abstract words of the due process clause but there can be no doubt that at a minimum they require that deprivation of life,liberty or property by adjudication be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the case.
mullane,at.
in mullane,the court addressed whether publication notice rather than mailed individual notice to known beneficiaries of a common trust fund as part of a judicial settlement of accounts was constitutionally sufficient.id.at.observing that notice and an opportunity to be heard were fundamental requisites of procedural due process,the court held that notice must be reasonably calculated,under all the circumstances,to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.id.at.see also eisen,at.concluding that some form of individualized notice is mandatory under rule and the due process clause.the court continued 
but when notice is a person due,process which is a mere gesture is not due process.the means employed must be such as one desirous of actually informing the absentee might reasonably adopt to accomplish it.the reasonableness and hence the constitutional validity of any chosen method may be defended on the ground that it is in itself reasonably certain to inform those affected 
mullane,at.the court held that publication notice could not satisfy due process where the names and addresses of the beneficiaries were known.id.at.
nevertheless,this due process right does not require actual notice to each party intended to be bound by the adjudication of a representative action.see id.at.a construction of the due process clause which would place impossible or impracticable obstacles in the way could not be justified.accord in re integra realty,cir integra i holding rule and due process requisites satisfied where the record indicated that only percent of class members actually received notice of the settlement.
for due process purposes,rather than looking at actual notice rates,our precedent focuses upon whether the district court gave the best notice practicable under the circumstances including individual notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort.integra i,at citing eisen,at.quotation omitted.the legal standards for satisfying rule c b and the constitutional guarantee of procedural due process are coextensive and substantially similar.compare integra i,at with.c b see also advisory committee note,amendments,reprinted in federal civil judicial procedure and rules west ed.this mandatory notice pursuant to subdivision c is designed to fulfill requirements of due process to which the class action procedure is of course subject.
although the tenth circuit has not yet dealt with the appropriate method of sending settlement notices in a shareholder class action to class members who hold their shares in street name only,two decisions from the ninth circuit offer helpful guidance.in torrisi,the ninth circuit held that notice provided to shareholders days before the deadline for written objections and days before the fairness hearing was adequate under the due process clause and rule,despite the fact that nearly of the class members held their shares in street name.at.in so doing,the court noted that 
the question before us today is not whether some individual shareholders got adequate notice,but whether the class as a whole had notice adequate to flush out whatever objections might reasonably be raised to the settlement.if an individual shareholder later claims he did not receive adequate notice and therefore should not be bound by the settlement,he can litigate that issue on an individual basis when the settlement is raised as a bar to a lawsuit he has brought 
torrisi,at.as further support,the torrisi court pointed out that a number of street name shareholders actively participated in the litigation,filing objections and participating in the settlement hearing,tending to indicate that street name shareholders received fair notice despite the fact that only days elapsed between the initial mailing and the objection deadline.id.at.
similarly,the ninth circuit has also concluded that due process and rule were satisfied even when it was undisputed that a nominee forwarded nearly of the settlement notices to beneficial owners after the deadline.see silber mabon,cir.in silber,the initial round of settlement notices were sent out to approximately individual shareholders identifiable in the company records forty days prior to the deadline.id.based on information from nominees,the settlement admin
