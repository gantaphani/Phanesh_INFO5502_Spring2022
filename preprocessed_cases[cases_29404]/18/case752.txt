this continuing litigation has spawned a preliminary injunction hearing,two trials and now this appeal of several rulings in cingular favor.we affirm all the rulings except that we find that judgment as a matter of law should have been entered in cingular favor on kempner tortious interference with prospective economic advantage claim because the evidence in this case reveals that cingular did nothing more to interfere with kempner than compete for business in the cellular phone market.we,therefore,reverse the district court denial of cingular motion for judgment as a matter of law on this claim.we affirm all the remaining rulings of the district court.
background 
this diversity lawsuit arises out of disputes between kempner mobile electronics,kempner,an illinois corporation with its principal place of business in illinois,and southwestern bell mobile systems,as cingular wireless cingular,a delaware limited liability corporation with its principal place of business in georgia.kempner engaged in the marketing and sale of,among other things,cellular telephone products and services.cingular was involved in the development,establishment and sale of cellular telephones and services in various parts of the united states,including the chicago metropolitan area.in late,kempner and cingular entered into an authorized agency agreement agreement,which was the last of several written agreements entered into by the parties dating back to the beginning of their relationship in.
the agreement expressly states that the relationship between the parties was not a general agency,joint venture,partnership,employment relationship or franchise.the agreement defines authorized services as the services offered by cingular that kempner was allowed to sell under the agreement.under the agreement,kempner was to sell only cellular radio service crs,not commercial radio services cmrs.in addition,kempner could also sell paging services or other customer premises equipment cpe offered by companies other than cingular.and kempner was authorized to sell or lease cpe,the cellular telephones or other related hardware necessary for the customer to use the cingular cellular services marketed by kempner.the agreement authorized kempner to sell these products and services in a specific area,the chicago metropolitan area,defining subscribers as customers of the authorized services provided by cingular each telephone number assigned to a customer of authorized services was counted as a separate subscriber.
under the agreement,kempner was a authorized agent for cingular,in that cingular reserved the right to market its own cellular services and cpe in the same geographical areas served by kempner,whether through cingular own representatives or through others including,but not limited to,other authorized agents,retailers,resellers and distributors.however,the agreement prohibited kempner from acting as a representative or agent of any other reseller or provider of cellular services in the chicago metropolitan area,or to attempt to persuade subscribers of cingular services to obtain cellular service from another provider.
cingular retained sole authority to establish the rates,terms and conditions of the sale by kempner of authorized services.the agreement contains no provision that specifies how the rates,terms and conditions for the sale of services offered by kempner would compare to that offered by other outside agencies,or to company stores or sales outlets.the persons to whom kempner sold cellular service on behalf of cingular became customers of cingular.on the other hand,individuals who bought from kempner cpe,but not cingular cellular services became customers of kempner,and kempner had the authority to set the price at which it would sell cpe.
under the agreement,kempner was compensated for sales on a commission basis.kempner received a commission on both and contracts based on a percentage of the initial payments.with respect to contracts,kempner also received a residual commission,based on the payments made by the customer on their cellular contract going forward.the agreement also provided that cingular could withhold an offset against this commission stream for amounts past due and owing from kempner to cingular.
in addition to requiring that cingular pay kempner commissions for sales made,the agreement required cingular to provide kempner with promotional literature,sales brochures and information for preparation of catalogs,advertising and other promotional activities,and a reasonable amount of sales training.the agreement also allowed kempner to use certain cingular marks in marketing cingular services.
the agreement provided that for a period of one year after its termination or expiration,kempner could not engage in any of the following acts 
directly or indirectly,induce,influence or suggest to any subscriber of crs to purchase crs or any other cmrs from another reseller or provider of crs or cmrs in the area 
directly or indirectly,induce,influence or suggest to any subscriber of any other authorized service to purchase a competing service from any provider or reseller of such competing service in the area,whether or not the competing service is technologically the same as the authorized service in question 
under any circumstances or conditions whatsoever,directly or indirectly,as an individual,partner,stockholder,director,officer,employee,manager or in any other relation or capacity whatsoever engage in the sale or promotion of crs,cmrs,or any other authorized service on behalf of any competing reseller or provider of such service in the area 
directly or indirectly,allow any other person,firm or other entity to use the name,trade name,goodwill or any other assets or property of kempner or cingular in any manner in connection with such other entities sale of crs,cmrs or any other authorized service on behalf of a competing reseller or provider in the area,and kempner specifically agrees not to transfer,assign,authorize or consent to the transfer of a kempner telephone number to any other person,firm or other entity upon expiration or termination of this agreement.
the agreement states that the consideration provided by cingular for these provisions was cingular grant to kempner of the right to use the marks,the right to advertise affiliation with cingular as an authorized agent of cingular and great value of the goodwill associated with kempner ability to use the marks and the value of specialized,technical knowledge of the cellular industry and other services to be imparted by cingular to kempner from time to time.
on may,kempner filed an complaint against cingular seeking damages relating to the agreement.kempner asserted various claims for breach of contract,common law tort and statutory tort,arguing that it should prevail in its suit because the restrictive provisions in the agreement were unenforceable as cingular had allegedly breached the agreement,cingular made misrepresentations to kempner and cingular wrongfully contacted kempner customers.in addition,kempner sought a declaration that kempner was not bound by any of the terms of the agreement,including its exclusivity and provisions,which,among other things,prohibited kempner from selling competitive services.kempner also sought an injunction to prevent enforcement of the exclusivity and provisions of the agreement and to require cingular to maintain kempner as an authorized agent but excusing kempner from remaining exclusive.
on august,after removing the action to federal court,cingular filed a for preliminary injunction to enforce the exclusivity and provisions of the agreement and preclude kempner from selling wireless services on behalf of competing carriers.the court held a preliminary injunction hearing on the issues and held that a the exclusivity provision of the agreement was enforceable and that cingular had properly terminated kempner agency for violation of the exclusive agency provision b the,provision was enforceable with respect to kempner sales to existing cingular customers activated by kempner and c the provision was not enforceable to preclude kempner from selling to noncingular customers on behalf of carriers competing with cingular.
as a result of voluntarily withdrawing some claims and the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of cingular on other claims,for trial kempner was left with two claims of breach contract,as well as a claims for fraud and tortious interference with economic advantage.in addition,cingular two counterclaims for breach of contract remained.on november,the first day of trial,cingular presented a motion to bar kempner expert,which the district court denied without prejudice.with the consent of the parties,the trial was bifurcated on issues of liability and damages.
at the close of kempner case in chief on liability,cingular moved for judgment as a matter of law under federal rule of civil procedure a on all kempner claims.the court denied the motion in its entirety.cingular did not renew its rule a motion at the close of its case in chief,or at any other time before submission of the case to the jury.on november,the case was submitted to the jury,and the jury returned verdicts in favor of kempner and against cingular on all four of kempner claims and on both of cingular counterclaims.after trial,cingular filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law,or in the alternative,for a new trial on all claims.following briefs and oral argument,the district court granted cingular a new trial on kempner tortious interference claim and on cingular equipment receivable counterclaim.
in preparation for the damages phase of the first trial,cingular renewed its motion to bar kempner evidence concerning fraud damages,and kempner filed a memorandum in support of its request for punitive damages.the district court granted cingular motion to bar expert testimony on the fraud claim and granted kempner motion to submit evidence for award on punitive damages.
on july,at the conference before the second liability trial,the district court precluded kempner from offering evidence or argument that kempner was not liable for paying amounts due on cingular equipment receivables counterclaim because of a claimed offset from the agreement.as a consequence,the parties stipulated to liability and damages on the equipment receivables claim.
the second trial on liability regarding kempner claims of tortious interference began on august,and at the close of kempner presentation of evidence,the court denied cingular motion for judgment as a matter of law on the tortious interference claim and on kempner claim for punitive damages.at the close of all evidence,cingular renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law.this time the court granted the motion as to punitive damages but again denied the motion as to tortious interference.the jury returned a verdict in favor of kempner.thereafter,the parties stipulated to the actual damages to be awarded on each of the remaining claims,eliminating the need for any further damages proceedings.on august,the court entered judgment on all the parties respective claims.
ii.analysis 
a.the trial court properly excluded kempner evidence of fraud damages.
in its fraud claim,kempner claimed that in may,cingular represented to kempner that kempner would receive the same equipment and service pricing as was available to cingular internal distribution channels.kempner argues that these representations were false,and that kempner decided not to terminate its relationship with cingular and accept an attractive offer to become a master agent for nextel in justifiable reliance on cingular representations.kempner claims that by the time it fully recognized that cingular representations were indeed false,the offer with nextel was no longer available.a jury returned a verdict in favor of kempner and against cingular on this fraud claim.
following the jury verdict,but before proceeding on damages,the court granted cingular motion to bar kempner expert testimony on fraud damages.in granting cingular motion,the court held that kempner evidence of damages failed to match the theory of fraud upon which kempner had prevailed at trial.the court found that kempner expert assumed that kempner would have been able to sell for both nextel and cingular simultaneously,while the theory that kempner presented at trial was that kempner would have sold for nextel,and not for cingular,but for misrepresentations made by cingular.furthermore,the court noted that the damages calculation also included several months of profit that preceded the alleged fraud,which would be unrecoverable under any set of facts.
we review de novo whether the district court applied the appropriate legal standard in making its decision to admit or exclude expert testimony,and we review for abuse of discretion the district court choice of factors to include within that framework as well as its ultimate conclusions regarding the admissibility of expert testimony.parra,cir.expert testimony is admissible i f scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue fed.evid.daubert merrell dow,d laid the foundation for this rule,which was designed to ensure that any and all scientific testimony or evidence admitted is not only relevant,but reliable.parra,at quoting smith ford motor,cir.a court abuses its discretion when it commits a serious error of judgment,such as reliance on a forbidden factor or failure to consider an essential factor in admitting or excluding expert testimony.smith,at quoting powell v.at t,cir.
on appeal,kempner never addresses the disconnect between its damages evidence and the theory of liability it prevailed upon at trial.instead,kempner concedes that its damages evidence assumed that the exclusivity provision of the agreement was unenforceable such that kempner would have been able to sell both nextel and cingular services.appellant opening br.at.even if evidence regarding whether the restrictive covenant was enforceable had been allowed to go trial,kempner damages evidence could not be offered as a basis for its theory of fraud because kempner damages evidence failed to separate profits kempner would have gained from sales of nextel products and services from profits gained from sales of cingular products and services.kempner admits that the d amages evidence was not individually calculated on each theory of fraud presented at trial,as the damages model reflect ed overall profitability levels.appellant opening br.at.we agree with the decision of the district court that the expert testimony submitted by kempner would not assist the trier of fact to determine the issue of fraud damages in this case.we find,therefore,that the district court properly applied federal rule of evidence to exclude the damages evidence submitted by kempner expert as irrelevant and inapplicable to its theory of liability.
in the alternative,kempner argues that it should have been allowed to amend its damage disclosures.in excluding kempner theory of damages,the court found that kempner failure to disclose relevant expert testimony was neither justified nor harmless.the court explained,on the record,that after its ruling on summary judgment only a single fraud claim remained for kempner to pursue at trial,and that kempner had ample opportunity to submit damages calculations that matched the remaining theory,but kempner failed to do so.instead,kempner submitted a modified damages report that did not match the remaining fraud theory of the case.in explaining that kempner time to amend included the time between the court ruling on summary judgment and trial,the court reasoned that not only did kempner not take advantage of the time available and allotted to amend its disclosure,but kempner never requested to amend the expert report or to continue the trial to prepare a new expert report.
in addition,the district court found kempner failure to amend was not harmless as cingular would be prejudiced if the court allowed kempner,after trial and after a jury verdict,to submit a new damages report.the court determined that if it would have allowed kempner to amend,then its allowance would have a prolonged delay in the already protracted proceedings requiring
