this is an action against a mutual automobile insurance company incorporated and headquartered in illinois,where the board of directors holds its meetings.a group of policyholders contends that the insurance company board of directors did not pay the dividends it promised.the trial court certified the case as a nationwide class action and ruled that california law,not illinois law,governs the policyholders causes of action.
the insurance company has filed a petition for a writ of mandate,challenging the trial court ruling that california law applies.we conclude that,because the declaration of dividends concerns the internal affairs of the insurance company,illinois law applies in this case.we therefore grant the petition.
background 
defendant state farm mutual automobile insurance company state farm was created in under the laws of the state of illinois.it is incorporated there and is headquartered in bloomington,illinois.the board of directors meets in bloomington when making decisions about whether to declare dividends.state farm primary financial records are maintained there.
during the early to,state farm automobile insurance policies provided that the first insured named in the declarations is entitled to share in the earnings and savings of the company in accordance with the dividends declared by the board of directors on this and like policies.at some point in the late,the policy language was changed to read t he first insured named in the declarations is entitled to receive dividends the board of directors in its discretion may declare in accordance with reasonable classifications and groupings of policyholders established by such board.
in a newsletter sent to california policyholders in,state farm described dividends as a return of part of your premium because claim costs were less than anticipated.the newsletter also stated that o ur goal as a mutual company is to put your interests first 
the bylaws of state farm provide subject to the provisions of law regarding return of excess premiums,the board of directors may authorize from time to time such refunds or credits to policyholders from the savings and gains of the corporation and upon such terms and conditions and in such amounts or percentage as may,in their judgment,be proper,just and equitable.
on june,state farm policyholders filed this action,alleging causes of action for breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,among others.in general,the complaint alleges that the policyholders were entitled to dividends under their state farm policies and that state farm improperly withheld dividends in order to increase its surplus.the nationwide class certified by the trial court consists of million former and current state farm automobile insurance policyholders,million of whom live in california.
the policyholders allege in the complaint that state farm breached its duty to them by amassing surpluses far in excess of what state farm reasonably needed to meet its present and future insurance obligations,thereby reducing dividends.according to the policyholders,state farm board of directors improperly withheld dividends by overstating underwriting losses,understating investment income,excluding from operating return the investment income derived from its surplus,and falsely claiming that state farm surplus had to cover the obligations of its affiliated insurance companies 
after the pleading stage,state farm filed a motion to determine the substantive law applicable to the policyholders causes of action and to dismiss the case.state farm argued that,under the internal affairs doctrine,illinois law applied and required that the case be dismissed in favor of an illinois forum.the policyholders filed opposition papers,claiming that california law governed.in a statement of decision filed on may,the trial court denied the motion to dismiss and ruled that california law controlled.
state farm filed a petition for a writ of mandate with this court,challenging the trial court decision.we issued an order to show cause why the trial court decision should not be vacated.we also established a briefing schedule and calendared the matter for oral argument.having considered the parties written and oral presentations,as well as the amici curiae briefs,we now consider the merits of the petition.
discussion 
because this appeal involves the application of legal principles to undisputed facts,we review the trial court decision de novo.see in re marriage of armato th,d state farm mut.auto.ins.department of motor vehicles th,d.
we first discuss how surplus funds are used by an insurance company.we then address the conflict of laws issue,namely,whether california or illinois law applies to the policyholders causes of action.finally,we discern the pertinent legal principles from the applicable substantive law 
a.the importance of surplus 
state farm is a mutual insurance corporation.as such,it issues no capital stock and is cooperatively owned by its policyholders,who are both the insurers and the insureds fletcher,cyclopedia of the law of private corporations.mutual insurers issue about of property and liability insurance in the united states.see ainslie et,business insurance law and practice guide.
mutual insurance companies are organized,maintained,and operated solely for the benefit of their policyholders such companies do not generate traditional entrepreneurial profits,but rather seek to meet their obligations at the lowest possible cost to the policyholders who,by paying premiums,provide the companies exclusive source of capital.allegaert,derivative actions by policyholders on behalf of mutual insurance companies chi.
policyholders in mutual companies are denominated members of the company their ownership rights in the company are their membership interests.members of mutual insurance companies have many of the same rights as stockholders in corporations,including the right to vote and the right to residual surplus upon liquidation.unum cir,fn.
state farm does not offer insurance policies as investment opportunities but instead provides policyholders with protection against loss.in contrast,a stock insurance company seeks to earn a profit for the benefit of its stockholders,who may or may not be policyholders.see fletcher,cyclopedia of the law of private corporations,supra,couch on insurance ed,to.
m utual insurers have greater difficulty than stock insurers in raising capital to fund growth,and hence,must rely to greater extent on accumulated surplus and income from new members to support growth m anagers of mutual insurers tend to exercise more discretion which tends to favor stability over greater risk.klein,a regulator introduction to the insurance industry nat.of ins.comrs.
as a practical matter,a mutual insurance corporation operates much like a stock insurance corporation.see ainslie et,business insurance law and practice guide,supra,to couch on insurance,supra.given that similarity,we rely on case law concerning stock companies where appropriate.
an insurer surplus is the excess of assets over liabilities.unum,supra,at,fn.see id.at,fn.accord,lubin equitable life assur.soc.s urplus provides a safety cushion to absorb adverse results and protects the policyholder and the company by helping maintain the company solvency during periods of unfavorable operating results.troxel et,insurance accounting and finance ed.as the amount of surplus increases,the risk of insolvency decreases.see united state congress,congressional budget office,the economic impact of a solvency crisis in the insurance industry april.the payment of dividends reduces the surplus.see breslin troxel,insurance accounting and finance.
state farm invests its surplus,and the return on that investment is an essential part of the company overall financial position.an insurer must have an adequate surplus at all times,especially in light of potential catastrophes that may result in substantial damage to numerous policyholders.see united states congress,congressional budget office,the economic impact of a solvency crisis in the insurance industry,supra,at.state farm refers to its surplus as policyholder protection funds.
the financial soundness of an insurance company depends on numerous factors that are difficult to quantify,and the insurance market is characterized by substantial diversity across insurers in types of business written,characteristics of customers,and methods of operation.it is impossible to specify the right amount of surplus for most insurers through a formula.cummins et,an economic overview of capital requirements for the insurance industry ins.reg.each insurance company has its own method for determining the amount of surplus it considers to be adequate.
conflict of laws 
in this case,the policyholders contend that california substantive law governs the outcome of the litigation.state farm contends that illinois law applies.we conclude that illinois law applies because the parties dispute involves the internal affairs of the company.
a corporation is an artificial being,invisible,intangible,and existing only in contemplation of law.being the mere creature of law,it possesses only those properties which the charter of its creation confers upon it,either expressly,or as incidental to its very existence 
every state in this country has enacted laws regulating corporate governance.by prohibiting certain transactions,and regulating others,such laws necessarily affect certain aspects of interstate commerce the markets that facilitate national and international participation in ownership of corporations are essential for providing capital not only for new enterprises but also for established companies that need to expand their businesses.this beneficial free market system depends at its core upon the fact that a in the rarest organized under,and governed by,the law of a single jurisdiction,traditionally the corporate law of the state of its incorporation.cts dynamics of america,d.
the internal affairs doctrine is a conflict of laws principle which recognizes that only one state should have the authority to regulate a corporation internal peculiar to the relationships among or between the corporation and its current officers,directors,and otherwise a corporation could be faced with conflicting demands.edgar mite,d,quoted with approval in havlicek analytical services,th,d.states normally look to the state of a business incorporation for the law that provides the relevant corporate governance general standard of care.atherton fdic,d.
internal affairs include steps taken in the course of the original incorporation,the adoption of,the issuance of corporate shares,the holding of directors and shareholders meetings,the declaration and payment of dividends and other distributions,charter amendments,mergers,consolidations,and reorganizations,the reclassification of shares and the purchase and redemption by the corporation of outstanding shares of its own stock.in re harnischfeger industries,italics added accord,in re sagent technology,derivative lit.d.
as stated in the restatement second of conflict of laws it would be impractical to have matters which involve a corporation organic structure or internal administration governed by different laws.it would be impractical,for example,if an issuance of shares,a payment of dividends,a charter amendment,or a consolidation or reorganization were to be held valid in one state and invalid in another in the absence of an explicitly applicable local statute to the contrary,the local law of the state of incorporation has been applied to determine issues involving corporate acts of the sort mentioned.rest d conf.of laws,com.e,italics added accord,maher zapata cir.

the internal affairs doctrine was best explained by the delaware supreme court in mcdermott,lewis mcdermott the traditional conflicts rule developed by courts has been that internal corporate relationships are governed by the laws of the state of incorporation the umbilical tie of the foreign corporation to the state of its charter is usually still religiously regarded as conclusive in determining the law to be applied in intracorporate disputes mcdermott,supra,at,italics added.
the court in mcdermott continued the policy underlying the internal affairs doctrine is an important one under the prevailing conflicts practice,neither courts nor legislatures have maximized the imposition of local corporate policy on foreign corporations but have consistently applied the law of the state of incorporation to the entire gamut of internal corporate affairs.in many cases,this is a wise,practical,and equitable choice.it serves the vital need for a single,constant and equal law to avoid the fragmentation of continuing,interdependent internal relationships it facilitates planning and enhances predictability a pplying local internal affairs law to a foreign corporation just because it is amenable to process in the forum or because it has some local shareholders or some other local contact is apt to produce inequalities,intolerable confusion,and uncertainty,and intrude into the domain of other states that have a superior claim to regulate the same subject matter 
t he law of one state governs the relationships of a corporation to its stockholders,directors and officers in matters of internal corporate governance.the alternatives present almost intolerable consequences to the corporate enterprise and its managers.with the existence of multistate and multinational organizations,directors and officers have a significant right to know what law will be applied to their actions.stockholders also have a right to know by what standards of accountability they may hold those managing the corporations business and affairs.mcdermott,supra,at accord,newell petersen d,app.dism.
in nedlloyd lines superior court cal th,d,nedlloyd,our supreme court cited mcdermott with approval.there,several corporations and individuals located in various parts of the world,including california,entered into a contract to purchase stock in a company incorporated in hong kong.the contract contained a provision stating that the agreement would be governed and construed in accordance with hong kong law.a dispute arose under the contract,and the hong kong corporation filed suit in california.the parties disagreed as to the applicable law.the trial court and the court of appeal concluded that california law governed.the supreme court,relying on the restatement second of conflict of laws,held that the provision was valid,and hong kong law applied.
in reaching that conclusion,the high court stated the plaintiff identifies no fundamental public policy of this state that would be offended by application of hong kong law to a claim by a hong kong corporation against its allegedly controlling shareholder.we are directed to no california statute or constitutional provision designed to preclude freedom of contract in this context.indeed,even in the absence of a clause,hong kong overriding interest in the internal affairs of corporations domiciled there would in most cases require application of its law.see rest.conf.of laws,obligations owed by majority shareholder to corporation determined by the law of the state of incorporation except in unusual circumstances not present here mcdermott lewis,corporate voting rights dispute governed by law of state of incorporation matter of reading cir,minority shareholder fiduciary duty claim governed by law of state of incorporation.nedlloyd,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.
as noted,in nedlloyd,supra,cal th,d,the high court also cited matter of reading,supra,with approval.in that case,a minority shareholder filed suit against a corporation,seeking to compel the declaration of a dividend.the corporation had always used its earnings to support continued operation and growth.it did not attempt to maximize profits or accumulate a surplus but instead tried to minimize the price charged to customers who were also shareholders.the corporation had never paid a dividend.in rejecting the plaintiff demand for dividends,the third circuit,citing the restatement second conflict of laws,stated 
the minority shareholder claim must be judged under the law of delaware,where the corporation is incorporated under delaware law,corporate directors stand in a fiduciary relationship to their corporation and its stockholders similarly,a majority shareholder,or a group of shareholders who combine to form a majority,has a fiduciary duty to the corporation and to its minority shareholders if the majority shareholder dominates the board of directors and controls the corporation the scope and extent of the fiduciary duty depend upon the circumstances of the challenged action or inaction the delaware courts will ordinarily apply the business judgment rule,under which a court will not disturb the judgments of a board of directors if they can be attributed to any rational business purpose.
we must now apply the business judgment rule to the corporation refusal to pay dividends and its continued reinvestment of earnings in new equipment.each of the challenged policies can be attributed to a rational business purpose the corporation,by setting the lowest possible rates,presumably keeps demand for its services high.the refusal to pay dividends could help achieve that goal by eliminating the need to raise rates to earn a surplus.the reinvestment of earnings in new equipment assumedly helps the corporation meet the needs of its customers u nder the challenged policies the corporation has undergone remarkable growth we conclude,therefore,that neither the directors nor the majority shareholders of the corporation have breached their fiduciary duty to the minority shareholder.matter of reading,supra,at,citations omitted.
the corporate internal affairs rule is deeply ingrained in the culture.it has survived the conflicts revolution largely unscathed.in all but a handful of cases,the law of the state of incorporation is applied to disputes involving internal corporate affairs in spite of the various theories adopted from by the individual courts.johnson,risky business and the unincorporated entity small emerging bus,fns.omitted.
in the present case,state farm policyholders challenge the board of directors decision whether to declare dividends.the policyholders rely on the language in their policies,a newsletter,and the bylaws,contending they have a contractual right to dividends that must be honored in accordance with their reasonable expectations.the policies state that policyholders are entitled to dividends as declared by the board of directors.a newsletter in referred to dividends as a return of part of the policyholders premiums.the bylaws provide that the board of directors may authorize dividends from time to time.
according to the policyholders,their right to dividends should be adjudicated under contract law,the business judgment rule notwithstanding.and the trial court commented,state farm is not going to be able to use the corporation law as a trump over that contractual obligation.but the business judgment rule,which accords deference to the decisions of the board of directors,is reflected in the language of state farm policies,newsletter,and bylaws.the rule is,in essence,written into the contract.
simply put,the policyholders challenge a decision of the board of directors that falls within state farm internal affairs.the causes of action in the complaint,though labeled in common of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair matters peculiar to the relationships among or between the corporation and its current officers,directors,and shareholders edgar mite,supra,at,italics added.as to those matters,the law of state farm place of incorporation,illinois,applies see atherton fdic,supra,at,not california law on contracts see.

this is not to say that,in determining the liability of a foreign corporation,courts must always apply the law of the state of incorporation.in fields like torts,where the typical dispute involves two persons and a single or simple issue and where the common substantive policy is to spread the loss through compensation and insurance,the preference for forum law and the emphasis on the state interest in forum residents presents an acceptable application of forum law.mcdermott,supra,at.i n the management and method of its business affairs in california with the citizens and residents thereof,in the sale or disposition or transfer of the shares of stock,a foreign corporation must conform to the securities regulations of california western air lines,sobieski d,italics omitted.
corporations and individuals alike enter into contracts,commit torts,and deal in personal and real property.choice of law decisions relating to such corporate activities are usually determined after consideration of the facts of each transaction.in such cases,the choice of law determination often turns on whether the corporation had sufficient contacts with the forum state,in relation to the act or transaction in question,to satisfy the constitutional requirements of due process.the internal affairs doctrine has no applicability in these situations.rather,this doctrine governs the choice of law determinations involving the relationships among the corporation,its directors,officers and shareholders.draper gardner defined plan trust,accord,western air lines,sobieski,supra,d at.rest d conf.of laws,coms,com.e.
similarly,t he validity of a contract of fire,surety or casualty insurance and the rights created thereby are determined by the local law of the state which the parties understood was to be the principal location of the insured risk during the term of the policy weitz,llc.travelers cas.sur.d,italics added accord,westchester fire heileman brewing d.

further,a california court can apply local law to a foreign corporation that has sufficient contacts with the state,such as conducting business or having an office here.see,valtz penta investment d.delaware corporation doing business in california with sole executive office in california must comply with california law allowing shareholders to inspect shareholder list western air lines,sobieski,supra,d.delaware corporation with principal place of business in california must comply with california law requiring cumulative voting for directors.
and,as codified in the corporations code,california law governs certain internal affairs of a foreign corporation if more than half of the corporation voting stock is held by california residents,and the corporation conducts a majority of its business in the state as measured by assets,payroll,and sales.see,subds.a,b.in those circumstances,california law even regulates the dividends of a foreign corporation to some extent.see.but the state farm policyholders do not contend that the regulations apply to state farm.

in sum,the policyholders seek to hold state farm liable for not declaring dividends.as recognized by a consistent line of authority,the internal affairs doctrine mandates that such liability be determined under the law of state farm place of incorporation,illinois.
illinois law 
having decided that illinois law governs this case,we first discuss current illinois law with respect to civil actions seeking to impose liability on a corporation for not declaring dividends.we then focus on the application of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing under illinois law.finally,we address state farm contention that the internal affairs doctrine requires that the present action be dismissed and refiled in illinois.
liability for not declaring dividends 
more than years ago,the illinois supreme court addressed the issue before us,stating there is a difference of opinion among the stockholders as to the reason or desirability of maintaining so large a cash surplus,one side believing that it is wise business management to keep a large surplus in reserve,and the other side believing that good business judgment and wise economy require the distribution of a large part of the surplus these are questions of business judgment to be determined by the directors of the corporation in their discretion,which will not be controlled by the court so long as it is exercised in good faith and in honesty of purpose each party has sought to avail itself of such advantages as the law gave it,but the record does not show fraud,oppression,or dishonest conduct.hall woods,italics added.
less than years later,the appellate court of illinois explained that c ourts will not compel the declaration of a dividend on the part of a corporation unless the withholding of the dividend is oppressive and entirely without merit.courts of chancery will not concern themselves with the operations of a private corporation except on the ground of fraud or an impairment of the capital structure which would result in complete or very substantial loss 
w e can see no reason for compelling a dividend,particularly in view of the present economic downturn and the present attitude of all corporations to conserve as far as possible its working capital for future contingencies.the question of a dividend at this time is one which rests wholly in the business judgment of the board of directors and a court of chancery should not substitute its judgment for that of the directors actively engaged in business in the community.hofeller general candy,wl.lexis,italics added,citation omitted.
the decision concerning the declaration of a dividend where a legal dividend fund is available rests within the sole discretion of the board of directors.courts are reluctant to interfere with the exercise of the directors business judgment unless the withholding is fraudulent,oppressive or totally without merit.romanik lurie home supply center,d,italics added.
as stated more recently the business judgment rule is a presumption that directors of a corporation make business decisions on an informed basis,in good faith,and with the honest belief that the course taken was in the best interests of the corporation like most rebuttable presumptions,it arises by operation of law however,the plaintiff may rebut the presumption by presenting evidence that the director s acted fraudulently,illegally,or without becoming sufficiently informed to make an independent business decision.the burden is on the party challenging the decision to present facts rebutting the presumption.ferris elevator,neffco,d.
illinois law is in accord with a leading treatise on corporate the business judgment rule protects a board decision regarding payment of a dividend or the making of a distribution.a court will not compel a distribution unless withholding the distribution is explicable only on the theory of an oppressive or fraudulent abuse of discretion.fletcher,cyclopedia of the law of private corporations,italics added,fn.omitted.
the fact that a corporation has earned profits out of which directors might lawfully declare a dividend is insufficient alone to justify judicial intervention compelling a declaration and payment.because the decision of the board of directors to declare and pay dividends is protected by the business judgment rule,the burden of proof on the shareholder seeking to compel the declaration and payment is particularly stringent.fletcher,cyclopedia of the law of private corporations,pp,fns.omitted.
thus,absent one of the exceptions to the business judgment,oppression,dishonesty,total lack of merit,illegality,or a failure of the board of directors to become sufficiently informed to make an independent corporation is not liable for a lack of dividends.
covenant of good faith and fair dealing 
the parties disagree as to whether california and illinois courts apply the covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the same way.for guidance,we set forth the principles under current illinois law.
the illinois supreme court has recognized a cause of action for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,sounding in tort,where an insurer breaches its duty to settle a third party claim brought against the insured.see cramer insurance exchange agency,cramer.the covenant does not provide a tort remedy in first party cases.id.at,at voyles sandia mortg.
in cramer,supra,the court refused to recognize an independent action in tort for breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,stating that the claim would be proper only in the narrow context of cases involving an insurer obligation to settle with a third party who has sued the policyholder.voyles sandia mortg.supra,at,at,italics added.
here,the policyholders rely on national sur.fast motor serv.d,national sur.corp.in that case,the insured sued its insurer under a workers compensation policy,alleging that the insurer had improperly adjusted claims,resulting in increased premiums.the appellate court of illinois held that an insured should be able to state a viable cause of action for breach of an insurer duty of good faith based on the insurer failure to act reasonably when adjusting claims under a policy of insurance which contains a retrospective premium feature when an insurance policy contains a retrospective premium feature,an insurer failure to act reasonably when adjusting claims automatically subjects the insured to greater financial obligations in the form of increased premium rates.a cause of action is stated when an insured sues his insurer for a breach of duty for settling claims in an unreasonable manner when the policy of insurance contains a retrospective premium feature.national sur,supra,d at,at.
