appellants pan pacific retail properties,pan pacific and western properties trust western challenge their insurers denial of coverage for an underlying shareholder class action.pan pacific and western were each insured under a directors and officers liability and company indemnification policy d o policy.pan pacific was insured by appellee gulf insurance company gulf.western was insured by appellee twin city fire insurance company twin city.gulf and twin city assert that all costs and expenses arising out of the underlying shareholder lawsuit were uninsurable as a matter of public policy because,according to the insurers,the suit only sought and recovered the disgorgement of additional consideration that the shareholders allege should have been paid by pan pacific to western shareholders in the merger of pan pacific and western.twin city additionally contends that western,its insured under the twin city policy,may not recover any insurance proceeds because pan pacific had fully indemnified western from any claims resulting from the merger.
we conclude that summary judgment was incorrect on the issue of whether the settlement paid by pan pacific to western shareholders to settle the remaining claims was entirely restitutionary relief,in light of the conflicting evidence as to the nature of these claims,and we reverse summary judgment on this ground.we affirm the grant of summary judgment to twin city on the ground that western was fully compensated from any loss by pan pacific payment of the settlement and any other costs or expenses.
in october,pan pacific and western proposed a merger transaction in a joint proxy statement and prospectus,whereby all shares of western would be acquired by pan pacific with consideration paid in pan pacific stock.a class action brought by shareholder bryant bennett on behalf of all western shareholders challenged many aspects of the merger.the bennett complaint,which was filed in the superior court of california,alameda county,alleged that pan pacific,western and their directors and officers were liable for breaches of fiduciary duty,abuse of control,fraud and deceit,negligent misrepresentation,constructive fraud,unjust enrichment,and for four statutory violations under state law the complaint alleged,inter alia,that the bennett defendants breached their fiduciary obligations to the shareholders by failing to negotiate the highest possible price for the western shares,by engaging in related transactions between pan pacific and western that created a conflict of interest,and by failing to disclose all material information to the shareholders before they voted overwhelmingly to approve the merger.
on november,western tendered notice of the bennett lawsuit to twin city which had issued a d o policy to western the day after the merger closed on november,pan pacific tendered notice of the bennett lawsuit to gulf which had issued a d o policy to pan pacific.both insurers denied coverage.gulf reasons,as set forth in its counsel letter of december,included that loss would not include any award against or settlement by pan pacific representing increased consideration for its acquisition of western.twin city stated in its letter of april,that if additional consideration were paid in connection with this matter,it would not constitute loss.
on october,the state superior court issued an order partially granting the bennett defendants motion for summary adjudication.because bennett had not made a prior demand upon western board of directors,the superior court dismissed all derivative claims and allowed only direct claims to go forward.all claims in the bennett action were dismissed except for the four claims based on violations of the california corporations code.the superior court stated that these statutory duties run to the plaintiffs and not to the corporation.the claim for breach of fiduciary duty relating to the duty of disclosure was also permitted to go forward because the superior court held that shareholders had an individual right to accurate information from their corporation.the bennett action settled on february,for plus for administrative and notice costs.
on march,pan pacific and western filed a complaint against gulf and twin city in the superior court of california,san diego county.this complaint asserted claims of breach of contract,declaratory relief,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and unfair business practices,alleging that gulf and twin city unjustifiably refused to recognize any insurance coverage for the bennett litigation.gulf and twin city removed the lawsuit to the united states district court for the southern district of california under diversity jurisdiction.on july,the district court granted summary judgment to gulf and twin city,concluding that the bennett settlement was,as a factual matter,restitutionary relief that was uninsurable under california law.the district court also concluded that gulf and twin city did not breach their obligation to advance defense costs and expenses and were not required to reimburse expenses for the dismissed claims because these claims were also uninsurable as only seeking restitutionary relief.finally,the district court held that twin city was not obligated to pay any indemnification or reimbursement because its insureds,western and its directors and officers,did not pay any damages,fees or costs as part of the bennett litigation based on an indemnification agreement whereunder pan pacific agreed to pay all claims arising from the merger.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see cornwell electra cent.credit union,cir see also chevron usa,cayetano,cir reversing grant of summary judgment because genuine issues of material fact remain n otwithstanding the fact that both sides moved for summary judgment and agreed that summary judgment was appropriate one way or the other.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,we must determine whether there are genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.cornwell,at quoting oliver keller,cir.if a reasonable jury viewing the summary judgment record could find by a preponderance of the evidence that appellants are entitled to a verdict in their favor,then summary judgment was inappropriate.id.
in granting summary judgment for the insurers,the district court decided that the settlement paid by pan pacific in the bennett action was uninsurable because the payment as a factual matter only reflected additional consideration that was wrongfully withheld in the merger.
it is well established that one may not insure against the risk of being ordered to return money or property that has been wrongfully acquired.bank of the west superior court,cal th,d.in aiu insurance superior court,cal d,the california supreme court provided guidance as to the types of remedies that are considered uninsurable restitutionary relief.the supreme court first interpreted the term damages in comprehensive general liability policies as requiring compensation,in money,recovered by a party for loss or detriment it has suffered through the acts of another.id.at,footnote and internal quotation marks omitted.based on this interpretation,the supreme court held that the agencies expenditure of federal funds to investigate and initiate cleanup of hazardous waste constitutes loss or detriment and that reimbursement by responsible parties is monetary compensation for such loss.id.at.the court further held that although the reimbursement of response costs is restitutive in that it attempts to restore to the agencies the value of a benefit constructively conferred on the insured,it is not restitutive in the narrow sense identified by jaffe as inappropriate for insurance coverage.id.at,citing jaffe cranford ins,d.
the insurance companies here were required to cover claims that sought compensation for a loss,even if the loss to the victim could also be construed as an benefit to the insured.see jaffe,d at.although the concept of restitution may have a broader meaning in other contexts,we limit our reference to it here to situations in which the defendant is required to restore to the plaintiff that which was wrongfully acquired.in deciding whether a certain remedy is insurable,we must look beyond the labels of the asserted claims or remedies.see bank of the west,cal th at,d.an insurer is not required to provide coverage for claims seeking the return of something wrongfully received,but must still indemnify for claims that seek compensation for injury suffered as a result of the insured conduct.id.at.
in level communications,federal insurance,cir,the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit held that the settlement of a claim alleging the purchase of stock under false pretenses was restitutionary relief even though the plaintiffs did not recover the actual shares allegedly acquired wrongfully,but only the difference in value between the price of the shares at the time of trial and the price the plaintiffs received for the stock from the defendant.see id.at.the appellate court held that the plaintiffs sought by this measure of damages to deprive the defendant of the net benefit of the unlawful act,the value of the unlawfully obtained stock minus the cost to the defendant of obtaining the stock.id.at.
the district court here relied on level in holding that the amount paid in the bennett settlement reflected restitutionary damages because the bennett plaintiffs sought only the payment of additional consideration that was allegedly underpaid to the shareholders in the merger.we must examine whether any genuine issues of material fact remain as to the nature of the claims reflected in the settlement and whether any of these claims may have sought compensation for injuries suffered by the shareholders,which would be covered under the insurers policies.
before the settlement of the underlying bennett class action was approved,the state superior court had dismissed all derivative claims that sought relief on behalf of the corporation.the superior court held that only certain claims alleging violations of the appellants disclosure duties could proceed as direct claims because each shareholder has an individual right to accurate information from the corporation.the superior court did not attempt to determine how a remedy or damages could be determined from this breach,but only that these claims alleged a direct injury to the shareholders.see bennett western properties trust,no.for summ.grant,county of alameda,the inquiry is not about the nature of the remedy,but determining whether a the corporation has been injured and the shareholders have consequently suffered loss in the value of their holdings derivative claim or b the shareholders have suffered a direct injury.
although the settlement occurred after the superior court had dismissed all claims except the direct claims,which removed all derivative claims from the pending state court lawsuit,it can not necessarily be said that the settlement payment was solely in consideration of the direct claims.it is possible that a portion of the settlement,or even most or all of the settlement,was motivated by concerns of appellants and their officers and directors about potential exposure on appeal of the dismissed claims.it is conceivable that the state court dismissal of the derivative claims could have been reversed on appeal,and appellants may have wanted to eliminate any lingering exposure from the dismissed derivative claims.
the derivative claims sought relief based on injuries to the corporation and only indirectly to the shareholders,in particular the decreased consideration paid for the shareholders shares.see jones ahmanson,cal d.a shareholder derivative suit seeks to recover for the benefit of the corporation and its whole body of shareholders when injury is caused to the corporation that may not otherwise be redressed because of failure of the corporation to act.such derivative claims would necessarily seek to divest money that was improperly obtained or withheld by appellants any payments intended to settle these claims would be uninsurable as seeking to recover the net benefit of the alleged wrongful acts committed by the appellants.see level,at.
however,appellants may have been motivated by an additional reason to obtain a settlement and a release of all claims by the bennett plaintiffs.appellants produced declarations by the attorneys who participated on both sides of the underlying settlement negotiations stating the opinion that the derivative claims seeking additional consideration were no longer a viable claim for relief after the superior court order.conceivably,appellants may have settled the bennett action to avoid liability from the remaining direct claims in the class action.
the insurers argue that the entire payment must be treated as additional consideration regardless of the nature of the claims reflected in the settlement,because there was no alternative source of damages offered by appellants.however,appellants have argued that the remaining direct claims did not reflect restitutionary relief based on the procedural history of the underlying bennett litigation and have offered an alternative theory of damages for the remaining direct claims.
california law provides that a shareholder can not bring a direct action for damages against management on the theory their alleged wrongdoing decreased the value of his or her stock,by reducing corporate assets and net worth.schuster gardner,th,d internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted.we have held that vague allegations about misrepresentations that caused the plaintiff shareholder to support the unsuccessful merger attempt and initiation of a were still derivative claims because his only injury from those misrepresentations was the devaluation of his stock when barbary coast was taken over by the fdic.pareto,cir.a claim based on the devaluation of stock was clearly derivative because that is an injury that fell on every stockholder,majority and minority alike,and fell on each on a per share basis.id.applying this precedent to the case before us,the settlement payments for the remaining direct claims could not have been based on a decreased value given for the western stock,such as for a low share exchange ratio in a merger paid for by pan pacific stock,because such a valuation would be an injury that fell on every stockholder alike.
perhaps recognizing that the remaining direct claims of could not provide damages based on the amount underpaid for the shares of western stock,appellants have provided an alternative theory of damages for the remaining direct claims that would provide compensation for the individualized harm of the shareholders and not for the return of money wrongfully withheld by appellants.after the dismissal of the derivative claims,but before the settlement of the bennett action,appellants advanced a damages theory for the remaining claims based on the value of the information allegedly withheld in the failure to disclose material facts.as described by opposing counsel in the underlying bennett action 
appellants value of information theory essentially argued that the damages awarded were required to reflect the intrinsic value of specific information withheld,as opposed to the impact of such information on the marketplace.for example,appellants argued that the bennett plaintiffs would only be able to recover for the suppression of an analyst report which cost to produce.they would not be entitled to collect even if expert evidence established that a swing in the company stock price would have resulted from the timely and proper release of such information withheld.
decl.of robert retana in supp.of opp to mot.for summ.
if the trier of fact accepted appellants characterization of the damages reflected in the settlement payments,then the bennett plaintiffs would have recovered compensation in the settlement for the intrinsic value of the information withheld from the shareholders.although appellants may have benefitted from their failure to disclose material information,this value of information theory resembles the type of insurable damages allowed in aiu that sought compensation for a detriment suffered by the shareholders see aiu,cal d at.appellants value of information theory provides an alternative source of damages based on the cost that it would take the shareholders as a class to obtain the same amount of information which was allegedly withheld by appellants.although it is possible that this damages theory might only result in a minimal economic recovery,see retana decl,and possible also that it might not account for the entire amount paid in settlement,the submission of evidence supporting the value of information theory does raise a genuine issue of fact as to whether the settlement contained amounts 
claims asserted by shareholders challenging the actions of corporate participants in a merger need not only seek additional merger consideration.we conclude here that the record contained material issues of fact,and thus the district court erred in concluding that the entire settlement reached was for uninsurable relief.there was no trial in the district court regarding what was settled in the prior california state court action.there was no expert testimony provided concerning the exposures for defendants in the california state court case,on both dismissed claims that might be reversed on appeal or the pending claims that remained for state court trial.based on the current record,we conclude that summary judgment was inappropriate factual findings relating to the nature of the settlement and whether it settled in any part,direct claims of the shareholders are required here.giving all reasonable inferences to the party,it can not be said as a matter of law that the settlement related entirely to restitutionary relief sought in derivative or direct claims.
we are not persuaded that the claims and exposures settled were entirely of the narrow type identified by these cases as not a proper subject of coverage by insurance.aiu,cal d at.accordingly,the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the defendants,resolving that issue in light of the disputed and conflicting evidence before it.
appellants also seek reimbursement of about million spent on defense costs the insurers argue that defense costs are only entitled to reimbursement if incurred while defending covered claims and that the claims alleged in the bennett action were not covered claims because they sought only restitutionary remedies.d o policies generally do not obligate the carrier to provide the insured with a defense.helfand union fire ins,th,d.more likely,they require the carrier to reimburse the insured for defense costs as an ingredient of loss,a defined term under the policy.id.
the contractual language of the policies issued by gulf and twin city defines loss as sums incurred as a result of claims that were covered or insured by the policies this contractual language limits reimbursement to costs incurred in the defense of claims that would be insurable under the policies.appellants point to circuit precedent requiring the advancement of defense costs for potentially covered claims.see gon first state ins,cir okada mgic indem,cir.those cases,which involved an insurer duty to provide contemporaneous advancement of defense costs,gon,at okada,at,are not controlling where the insureds only seek reimbursement of costs after the underlying litigation has ended.in an insurance coverage action,the insured has the burden to prove that the claim falls within the basic scope of coverage.see collin am.empire ins,th,d.because appellants seek reimbursement after the underlying litigation has settled and no longer need to worry about the assertion of new types of claims or damages,appellants must show that the expenses at issue were related to claims that actually fell within the basic scope of coverage.see okada,at if an action against the directors incorporates both covered and uncovered claims,the parties must apportion the costs so that mgic need only pay for amounts generated in defense of covered claims.
if a lawsuit only sought damages that were uninsurable under the policy,then the insurer would not be liable to reimburse any defense costs spent defending these claims,even if the claims were eventually determined to be meritless.in state farm fire casualty drasin,d,the state appellate court held that an insurer lacked any duty to defend or indemnify a malicious prosecution claim because any recovery would necessarily require proof of uninsurable willful conduct 
the malicious prosecution complaint filed against the drasins does not potentially seek damages that come within the coverage of the subject policy.if the drasins original action against covell is held to be without malice and therefore not wilful,then there is no liability under the policy.similarly,if the drasins original action against covell is held to be wilful and with malice,again there is no liability under the policy.
id.at.if the claims in the bennett action only sought restitutionary relief that was uninsurable under california law,then the insurers would have no obligation to reimburse appellants defense costs regardless of whether the bennett plaintiffs actually recovered on their claims or not.
as discussed above,the district court grant of summary judgment was incorrect on the issue whether the bennett settlement was in any part intended to settle direct claims that fell within the scope of the policies.if the trier of fact determines that the settlement should not be characterized in full as reflecting uninsurable restitutionary relief and finds that the insurers must reimburse appellants for any part of the settlement,then the defense costs reasonably related to these covered claims must also be reimbursed.see safeway stores,union fire ins,cir holding that safeway defense costs are reasonably related to the defense of its officers and directors in the suits and are therefore fully covered by the d o policy.
because a genuine issue of material fact remains as to the nature of the claims reflected in the settlement and the extent that these settled claims sought restitutionary relief,we can not say that the district court denial of all reimbursement for defense costs was appropriate.we reverse the district court denial of reimbursement for defense costs and remand for further consideration by the trier of fact on this issue.
twin city offered an alternative defense for its refusal to indemnify or reimburse any amounts incurred as a result of the bennett action,and the district court gave relief to it on this alternative theory.twin city argued that neither western nor its officers and directors were required to pay any of the expenses,defense costs or settlement payment at issue in this coverage action and therefore no insured had suffered loss as defined by its policy.pan pacific paid all amounts that western or its directors and officers were legally obligated to pay as a result of the bennett action based on an indemnification provision included in the merger agreement.
western seeks coverage based on two different types of coverage provided in the twin city policy.insuring agreement b provides company reimbursement coverage where the insurer agreed to pay on behalf of the company loss for which the company has,to the extent permitted or required by law,indemnified the directors and officers,and which the directors and officers have become legally obligated to pay as a result of a claim where such claim is first made during the policy period against the directors and officers for a wrongful act which takes place during or prior to the policy period.in insuring agreement c,under the caption company securities claim liability,twin city agreed to pay on behalf of the company loss which the company shall become legally obligated to pay as a result of a securities claim first made during the policy period against the company for a wrongful act which takes place during or prior to the policy period.
an insurance policy may be either for liability or for indemnity.in a liability contract,the insurer agrees to cover liability for damages.if the insured is liable,the insurance company must pay the damages.in an indemnity contract,by contrast,the insurer agrees to reimburse expenses to the insured that th
