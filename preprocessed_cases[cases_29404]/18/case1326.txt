mongols denied its complaint arose out of a public issue rather,there was no public issue until defendants broadcast their intention to violate mongols rights.further,even if the complaint arose out of protected activity by the city,so as to implicate the statute,mongols easily could meet its minimal burden in opposing the special motion to strike.
