an automatic pivoting locking mechanism for a dumpster container having a hinged lid,said locking mechanism comprising 
at least one lockover arm mounted for pivotal rotation about a pivot axis on a front side of said container 
a locking bar supporting said lockover arm for pivotal rotation about said pivot axis on said front side of said container and 
a locking bar rotation arresting means for securing said locking bar in a locking position,said arresting means comprising a swing lever extending from said locking bar which is engageable by a wedge assembly for wedging said swing lever against movement when said container is in an upright position,said wedge assembly releasing said locking bar to enable rotation about said pivot axis when said container is substantially forwardly pivoted.
in may,sued prt for infringement of the and patents and unfair competition under the lanham act.in june,the trial court denied request for a preliminary injunction,plastic recovery,d.though the trial court found that would likely succeed on the merits,it did not find irreparable harm because prt accused device was not yet being manufactured.id.at.in october,the trial court received briefing on claim construction from both parties before trial,but held no hearing on the subject.instead,the trial court issued its constructions of various claims of the and patents in the jury instructions.the jury trial began on october and lasted until october.the jury rendered a verdict of on both patents.
however,does not appeal the judgment entered by the court.instead complains of the trial court alleged errors in improperly admitting evidence during the jury trial and the trial court alleged errors in claim construction that appear in the jury instructions.claims that the jury instructions contain claim construction errors.yet,even though submitted proposed jury instructions on the second day of trial,the record does not show that objected to the trial court jury instructions.also did not move for a jmol or a new trial.
nevertheless,argues that the trial court erred by interpreting claim of the patent as a claim.also argues that the district court erred in its construction of on a front side of said container front side limitation and locking bar rotation arresting means.even so,with regard to the patent,does not complain of any specific claim construction.instead,it broadly complains that the trial court improperly permitted experts to testify about the interpretation of the and patent claims and to opine on the ultimate issue of infringement.thus,complaints about the trial court construction of the patent claim are procedural.
nonetheless,because made no federal rule of civil procedure or motions jmols or motions for new trial on the ultimate question of infringement,this court affirms because it finds no prejudicial legal error.furthermore,because did not object to the jury instructions,which contained the court claim interpretations,this court affirms the trial court entry of the judgment because it finds no plain error.
the infringement analysis proceeds as a process.step one,claim construction,is a question of law,that this court reviews de novo.step two,comparison of the claims to the accused device,is a question of fact,and requires a determination that every claim limitation or its equivalent be found in the accused device.am.container,plastipak packaging,internal citations omitted.thus,while claim construction is a question of law,see cybor fas techs,en banc,infringement,whether literal or under the doctrine of equivalents,is a question of fact which this court reviews for substantial evidence,see optical disc.del mar avionics,bai l l wings.to reach the claim construction in this case,however,requires a review of the jury instructions.accordingly,this court first concern involves rule of the federal rules of civil procedure rule and the procedural law governing the preservation of objections to those instructions.see lummus,applying fourth circuit law to determine the timeliness of an objection to a jury instruction.
