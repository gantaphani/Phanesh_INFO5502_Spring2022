this writ proceeding challenges the trial court acceptance of a motion to disqualify the trial judge under code of civil procedure section,which permits a peremptory challenge to the judge the plaintiff filed two successive lawsuits,some two and months apart,against different defendants,alleging some identical and some different causes of action,but both arising from substantially the same underlying events.the two lawsuits were deemed related.when the second lawsuit was assigned to the same judge as the first,the plaintiff moved to disqualify the judge,who by then had made a ruling unfavorable to the plaintiff granting a petition to compel arbitration in the first lawsuit.the question is whether the second lawsuit against a different defendant constituted a continuation of the first lawsuit rather than a separate and independent action,thus rendering plaintiff peremptory challenge untimely.
because the second lawsuit involves a different defendant and different causes of action asserted against that defendant,and does not arise from conduct in,or involve enforcement or modification of an order in,the first lawsuit,we conclude that the second action can not be considered a continuation of the first within the meaning of governing supreme court precedent.accordingly,the trial court properly found the peremptory challenge to be timely,and we deny the writ petition.
factual and procedural background 
on february,robert cavenah sued dave brubaker,andrew myers and louis ignarro collectively,the brubaker defendants,claiming they defrauded him of more than one million dollars,consisting of in cash and more than two years of his time.cavenah alleged brubaker and myers solicited him to invest in,and work full time for,nutragenetics,a company the brubaker defendants and others had organized in.they formed nutragenetics to develop and market nutritional supplements containing nitric oxide,utilizing the expertise of defendant ignarro,who had won a nobel prize in for his work related to that chemical.cavenah alleged the brubaker defendants induced him to purchase an interest in nutragenetics for,and he later purchased an additional interest from defendant brubaker for another.brubaker and myers also promised him in writing that nutragenetics could and would pay him a annual salary beginning no later than january.cavenah alleged he invested in and worked for the company in reliance on several misrepresentations and failures to disclose material facts,including a failure to disclose that ignarro was prohibited from developing or promoting products for nutragenetics by virtue of an earlier agreement with another company,and misrepresentations that nutragenetics had been assured revenues from long term agreements with two other companies,when in fact those deals were actually contingent,doubtful,or terminable.
in the first lawsuit,which we refer to as cavenah i or the first action,cavenah alleged four causes of action against the brubaker defendants fraud and deceit,negligent misrepresentation,constructive fraud,and unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business practices under business and professions code section.cavenah sought economic damages estimated at,consisting of the loss of his investment and more than two years of working without compensation.he also asked for and punitive damages.
cavenah i was assigned for all purposes to judge holly kendig.thereafter 
during the first half of march,cavenah served numerous discovery requests in cavenah 
on march,the brubaker defendants filed a petition to compel arbitration.the petition was based on nutragenetics operating agreement,to which cavenah and the brubaker defendants were parties.the agreement provided that a ny action to enforce or interpret this agreement,or to resolve disputes with respect to this agreement as between nutragenetics and a member,or between or among the members,shall be settled by arbitration at the same time,the brubaker defendants filed an ex parte application to stay cavenah i,including cavenah discovery requests.
on april,judge kendig stayed cavenah i,inclusive of discovery,pending a further hearing set for april,on the application to stay the litigation.the court order also vacated the april,hearing date for the motion to compel arbitration and indicated a date for that motion would be set after the hearing on the stay request.
two weeks later,on april,before any hearings on the stay application or the motion to compel arbitration,cavenah filed a second lawsuit,this time against nutragenetics cavenah ii.cavenah alleged causes of action for breach of written contract,violation of labor code section governing an employer failure to pay wages of an employee who is discharged or who quits,quantum meruit,fraud,and violations of business and professions code section.cavenah alleged the same underlying conduct as in cavenah i,but additionally alleged that in september,he had signed a letter agreement with nutragenetics in which he agreed to work with the company full time for an annual wage of at least.he claimed that according to the letter agreement,he was to begin receiving this wage as a cash salary no later than january,and was to receive stock for his earlier work.he sought unpaid wages of more than,interest,late penalties and attorney fees and costs under the labor code,in labor code penalties for failure to pay wages earned for days after his termination date may,and punitive damages on his fraud claim.cavenah ii was assigned for all purposes to judge james dunn.
on the same day that he filed cavenah ii,cavenah filed a notice of related case,indicating that cavenah ii and cavenah i arose from the same or substantially identical transactions,incidents,or events requiring the determination of the same or substantially identical questions of law or fact,and were likely for other reasons to require substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges.
then the following events occurred 
on april,the brubaker defendants and nutragenetics filed statements of to cavenah notice of related cases.
on april,the trial court granted the brubaker defendants motion to stay cavenah i,pending a may,hearing date for their motion to compel arbitration.the court observed that it was continuing the stay it had already put in effect,formalizing it under section which requires a stay,upon motion of a party,when a petition to compel arbitration is pending.
on may,the court granted the petition of the brubaker defendants to compel arbitration in cavenah 
on may,judge kendig ruled that cavenah i was not related to cavenah ii.she observed that cavenah i had been stayed,so there would be no duplication of judicial resources if the cases remained as they were then assigned.
on june,cavenah sent discovery requests to nutragenetics in cavenah ii.these requests were substantially the same requests he had made to the brubaker defendants in cavenah 
on june,nutragenetics and the brubaker defendants moved for reconsideration and applied to deem the two actions related cavenah filed an opposition to the motion for reconsideration on june,arguing inter alia that judge kendig ruling that the cases were not related was a practical and substantively proper decision because cavenah i was arguably governed by the operating agreement pursuant to which that case was ordered to arbitration,while cavenah ii was an employee suit against his employer arising under a separate employment agreement and the labor code,invoking numerous employee rights,and not subject to arbitration.
meanwhile,on june,nutragenetics filed a petition to compel arbitration in cavenah ii.nutragenetics argued that cavenah was attempting to redo the proceedings in cavenah i by filing the same action as cavenah ii,but limiting it to his employment claims cavenah was bound by the final determination of judge kendig in the first action and the issue of arbitrability is foreclosed by the doctrine of res judicata.
on june,cavenah filed his opposition to nutragenetics petition to compel arbitration,again arguing that the arbitration clause in the operating agreement which applied to disputes with respect to this agreement as between nutragenetics and a member by its terms did not apply to his claim against nutragenetics for breach of an employment agreement entered into long before and separate from nutragenetics operating agreement.
on june,the trial court judge elihu berle in department found the two actions were related and transferred cavenah ii to judge kendig the court found that while cavenah ii included an additional claim for breach of cavenah employment agreement,both cases involve substantially the same acts of misconduct and will require determination of substantially the same issues.further,w hile cavenah argues that his employment was governed by an entirely different letter agreement,the petition in cavenah ii to compel arbitration will still require the interpretation and application of the same document the operating agreement between the same parties,and it appeared likely that a substantial duplication of labor would be required if the cases were heard by different judges.
on july,cavenah filed his peremptory challenge against judge kendig under section.
nutragenetics opposed the disqualification motion,arguing that a judge can not be disqualified after he or she has heard an issue that involves a ruling on contested factual issues related to the merits of the case,which judge kendig had done when she enforced the operating agreement arbitration clause in cavenah cavenah ii,nutragenetics claimed,was a continuation of cavenah i because it involves substantially the same issues as cavenah i,citing mcclenny superior court cal d,mcclenny.
on july,judge kendig found that cavenah peremptory challenge was timely filed,accepted it,and transferred both cavenah i and cavenah ii to department one for reassignment.
nutragenetics filed this petition for writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate its order and to deny cavenah motion to disqualify judge kendig.it also requested a stay of the related actions,including all pending discovery in cavenah ii.this court issued a temporary stay order and directed cavenah to file a preliminary response to the petition.following the preliminary response and a reply from nutragenetics,we issued an alternative writ,ordering the trial court to vacate its order and enter a new order denying the disqualification motion as untimely,or to show cause why a peremptory writ requiring it to do so should not issue.cavenah filed a written return to the petition and nutragenetics filed a reply.
we now deny the writ petition.
discussion 
nutragenetics asserts that cavenah peremptory challenge to judge kendig was a flagrant example of judge shopping under section,and an attempt by cavenah,through a sham pleading to use section as a weapon of offense and thereby obstruct the efficient administration of justice.in substance and in form,nutragenetics says,cavenah ii is identical to cavenah i,and cavenah challenge to judge kendig was not timely because cavenah ii is a mere continuation of cavenah 
in order to place this case in its proper context,we review the principles that have been established with respect to the interpretation of section and then apply those principles to this case.
section and the continuation rule.
i n enacting code of civil procedure section the legislature guaranteed to litigants an extraordinary right to disqualify a judge.solberg superior court cal d,solberg.section permits a party to disqualify a judge for prejudice based only upon a sworn affidavit.bravo superior court th,d bravo.as solberg explained,the right is automatic in the sense that a good faith belief in prejudice is alone sufficient,proof of facts showing actual prejudice not being required.solberg,supra,at.if the motion is timely and filed in proper form,the trial court must accept it without further inquiry,and the disqualification is effective immediately.bravo,supra,at,d.a peremptory challenge must be made within days after notice of an assignment,subd.a.as a remedial statute,section is to be liberally construed in favor of allowing a peremptory challenge,and a challenge should be denied only if the statute absolutely forbids it.bravo,supra,at,d.
at the same time,as solberg tells us,the courts have been vigilant to enforce the statutory restrictions on the number and timing of motions permitted.solberg,supra,cal d at.thus,solberg explains,the supreme court has construed the statutory limitation of one motion in any one action,subd.a to bar a second motion made on retrial.pappa superior court cal d.in addition the supreme court has construed the statutory requirement that the motion be filed before trial of the cause has commenced,subd.a to prohibit making a motion for the first time in matters which are essentially a continuation of the main proceeding,such as hearings on orders to modify citation or enforce citation the original judgment.solberg,supra,at.
it is this continuation rule,first enunciated in jacobs superior court cal d,jacobs,that we address in this case.nutragenetics contends that cavenah ii is a part or a continuation of the original proceedings id.at,of cavenah i,within the meaning of jacobs and its progeny,so that cavenah disqualification motion was untimely.our review of jacobs and its progeny,however,leads us to conclude otherwise.we turn now to an examination of those cases,bearing in mind that the second action in the case before us arises from substantially the same acts of misconduct and requires determination of substantially the same issues,but is brought against a different defendant and asserts several additional bases of liability as to that defendant.
we begin with jacobs,which presented the question whether,in an action to modify the custody provisions of an earlier judgment,a disqualification motion was timely.jacobs,supra,cal d at.the court held that it was not,first observing that,although section does not expressly so provide,it follows that,since the motion must be made before the trial has commenced,it can not be entertained as to subsequent hearings which are a part or a continuation of the original proceedings.jacobs,at.the court stated that in situations involving guardianship and custody orders,subsequent proceedings to obtain changes in custody are continuations of the original proceeding to determine custody.ibid.in jacobs,except for an alleged change in circumstances,the issues presented by the motion to modify the judgment and the supplemental petition for appointment of guardians are the same as those heard by judge rhodes in the prior proceedings.id.at.if a disqualification were permitted in matters which are continuations of a prior proceeding,the court continued,
it would mean that the judge who tried the case,and who is ordinarily in the best position to pass upon the questions involved,could be disqualified from hearing such matters as motions for modification of a support order or an injunction,as well as motions for change of custody of children.such procedure would make it possible for litigants to gamble on obtaining a favorable decision from one judge,and then,if confronted with an adverse judgment,allow them to disqualify him without presenting facts showing prejudice,in the hope of securing a different ruling from another judge in supplementary proceedings involving substantially the same issues.jacobs,supra,cal d at.
in reaching its conclusion,jacobs reasoned the parties are the same,and the paramount questions to be decided by the court,the competency of the father and the best interests of the children,are the same.id.at,emphasis added.
as solberg characterized the decisions that follow jacobs,the continuation rule is generally applied in matters which are essentially a continuation of the main proceeding solberg,supra,cal d at.we look now to the cases nutragenetics cites to support its contention that the continuation rule applies to this case,which is not a matter.
first comes mcclenny,supra,cal d,which held that a disqualification motion was not timely when filed prior to a proceeding on an indirect contempt which is supplementary to a domestic relations action.id.at.in mcclenny,the trial court had entered an interlocutory divorce decree and awarded the wife custody of the child.several months later,the husband filed a motion for modification of the custody order,and the wife sought a contempt proceeding for the husband refusal to return the child after a recent visitation period.the husband sought to disqualify the trial judge from the hearing on the contempt matters.after examining numerous cases in which the jacobs holding had been applied,restated,and amplified,the court concluded that the gravamen of jacobs established that a proceeding is a continuation of the original action out of which it arises if it involves substantially the same issues as the original action.mcclenny,at,emphasis added.mcclenny also cited with approval oak grove school dist.city title ins.d.oak grove,stating that oak grove cogently restated the rule when it held that the presentation in the supplementary proceeding of matters necessarily relevant and material to the issues involved in the original action stamped the supplementary proceeding as a continuation of the original action.mcclenny,at,quoting oak grove,at.
applying to the facts before it the principles it gleaned from jacobs,oak grove and other progeny of jacobs,mcclenny note d the substantial degree of similarity and even identity between the issues to be raised in the pending contempt proceeding and the issues previously presented to judge mccarthy.mcclenny,supra,cal d at.the court concluded that the questions involving the interpretation of the orders allegedly contemned,and indeed,the issue of whether defendant in fact violated judge mccarthy order,are matters necessarily relevant and material to the issues involved in the original action.mcclenny,at,quoting oak grove,supra,d at.the court further observed that in domestic relations actions,the courts must exercise a continuing jurisdiction over the parties and over the subject matter,and must perform continuing supervisory and enforcing functions,and the contempt proceeding is one of the court two principal means of performing these functions.it would unduly impede the administration of justice to hold that the contempt proceeding constituted a separate and independent action.mcclenny,at.to do so would permit litigants to obtain,by repeated cycles of a contemptuous act and a motion based upon section,a perpetually fresh forum for testing disadvantageous decisions.id.at.it was in this context that the court said,we can not permit a device intended for spare and protective use to be converted into a weapon of offense and thereby to become an obstruction to efficient judicial administration.ibid.
both jacobs and mcclenny involved the same parties and arose out of the original action,involving either the enforcement or modification of orders made in the original action.in oak grove,likewise,the second action involved the same parties and arose out of the original action.in oak grove,the court held that a motion to tax costs in an abandoned eminent domain proceeding was a part and a continuation of the original eminent domain proceedings,within the meaning of the rule laid down in jacobs oak grove,supra,d at.as oak grove observed 
the essence of the rule stated in jacobs is that in a supplemental or continued hearing on matters involved in the original proceeding an application under section for disqualification of the same judge who heard the original proceeding is not proper or timely oak grove,supra,d at.
thus,t hese costs and disbursements arise out of and are necessarily relevant and material to the issues involved in the eminent domain action,precluding a disqualification under section.oak grove,at,italics added.
in addition to jacobs and mcclenny,nutragenetics places its reliance on three court of appeal cases applying the jacobs and mcclenny principles.but,as we shall see,none of them helps nutragenetics,because none of them varies from the underlying principle of the continuation rule the second proceeding involves the same parties on both sides of the case as the first proceeding,and the second proceeding arises out of the first proceeding,not just out of the same set of facts that gave rise to the first proceeding.
in andrews joint clerks port labor relations committee d.andrews,the objective of the second action was to obtain a modification of the order still in effect in the first action,so the second action was demonstrably a continuation of,and ancillary to,the proceedings previously had id.at,and the plaintiffs motion for disqualification of the trial judge was therefore not timely.id.at.the facts in andrews are complex,but the context in which the continuation rule is applied is precisely the same as in the other cases the parties in both actions were the same,and the second action,as in jacobs,involved an attempt to modify an order made in the original action.in andrews,the plaintiffs brought an action alleging breach of a collective bargaining agreement,claiming they had suffered arbitrary discrimination in various respects in connection with their employment as ship clerks.id.at.after extended proceedings,the trial judge stayed the action pending submission of the issues to a grievance arbitration procedure before one professor kagel.id.at fn.the parties tendered two sets of issues to the arbitrator and agreed he had jurisdiction to determine both.id.at.after professor kagel decided the first set of issues adversely to the plaintiffs,the plaintiffs moved in the trial court for an order vacating the court stay order,or alternatively for the naming of an impartial and neutral arbitrator,and filed a second action seeking to name an impartial and neutral arbitrator to decide the second set of issues.id.at.the complaint in the second action alleged a dispute arising since and arising from the first action pending in the trial court and claimed professor kagel was not impartial.ibid.the plaintiffs sought unsuccessfully to disqualify the trial judge in the second action.the court of appeal found 
the clear purpose of the second action was to secure the removal of professor kagel as arbitrator and proceed before a new arbitrator thus,simply stated,the objective of the second action was to obtain a modification of the order still in effect in the first action.indeed,by seeking a continuance of the arbitration,albeit under a new arbitrator,the second action was demonstrably a continuation of,and ancillary to,the first action.andrews,at.
the question presented by the proceedings in the second action as to whether a new arbitrator should be named was inextricably bound up with the previous determination of the court in the first action that arbitration should proceed before professor kagel hence,the question raised by the second action was necessarily relevant and material to the previous directions for arbitration made by the court as part of its stay order.as such,it establishes that the later proceeding is in fact a continuation of the original one.andrews,at.
additional telling evidence that the second action was a continuation of the first was the fact that the plaintiffs simultaneously filed the second action and moved to vacate the trial judge previous stay order or alternatively to name a new arbitrator in the first action.andrews,at.it is obvious to us,as it was to the trial judge,that these plaintiffs and their counsel,split their motion to modify the previous order of the court and by a device attempted to fashion a new and independent action in which to assert a peremptory challenge against the judge.id.at.if this were countenanced,a party could circumvent the statute by the simple expedient of having a supplementary or ancillary proceeding filed under a new number.ibid.
nutragenetics next cites le louis superior court d.le louis.in le louis,the defendant in a criminal action contended that his filing of a section challenge at a preliminary hearing before a municipal court judge did not preclude the filing of a similar challenge to the superior court judge assigned for trial.id.at.the court of appeal disagreed,concluding that the defendant was not authorized to exercise one peremptory challenge at the municipal court level and another at the superior court level in the same criminal action.id.at.the court als
