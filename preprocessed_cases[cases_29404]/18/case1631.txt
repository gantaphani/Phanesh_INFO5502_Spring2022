this is an interlocutory appeal from the denial of a foreign corporation special appearance.a divided court of appeals affirmed the trial court ruling.we conclude that the foreign corporation contacts with texas are insufficient to create either specific or general jurisdiction.we also conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the plaintiff motion to continue the special appearance hearing.we therefore reverse the court of appeals judgment and render judgment dismissing the plaintiff claims against the foreign corporation for want of jurisdiction.
background 
michel marchand,a belgian citizen,was employed by platinum technologies in belgium.in march,marchand began negotiating with gerd ordelheide and adri kok for employment with bmc software belgium,bmcb.ordelheide and kok were directors of bmcb,a subsidiary of bmc software,bmcs,a delaware corporation headquartered in houston.
on march,marchand and bmcb signed a letter agreement outlining the terms of marchand employment with bmcb,including the offer of options to purchase shares of bmcs stock.the agreement did not specify when the options would be granted or when marchand could exercise them.the letter agreement also referenced a management agreement that marchand had apparently presented to bmcb.on june,bmcb and marchand executed the management agreement between bmcb and a company called procurement,of which marchand was the sole officer and director.the record shows that marchand asked bmcb to hire procurement as a management company so that marchand could work for procurement as an independent contractor rather than directly for bmcb.apparently,this arrangement enabled marchand to reduce his belgian tax liability.the management agreement was in german,and it stated that belgian law applies and the court at brussels had exclusive jurisdiction.
when marchand actually began working for bmcb is unclear.but it is clear that in july,bmcb discharged procurement and marchand.marchand was never granted any options to purchase bmcs stock.he sued bmcb and bmcs for breach of contract,fraud,negligent misrepresentation,and declaratory relief.marchand alleged both specific and general jurisdiction over bmcb.bmcb filed a special appearance,which the trial court denied.bmcb appealed the trial court interlocutory order.see.civ.prac.a.the court of appeals affirmed,at,and bmcb petitioned this court for review.
ii.this court jurisdiction 
until,a trial court order denying a special appearance was reviewable only on appeal after trial.canadian helicopters wittig.but the legislature amended section of the civil practice and remedies code to permit an interlocutory appeal from a trial court ruling on a special appearance.
typically,a court of appeals judgment in an interlocutory appeal is conclusive and an appeal to this court is not allowed.see.gov t code b.however,because there is a dissent in the court of appeals,we may exercise jurisdiction in this case.see.gov t code c.
iii.applicable law 
special of review 
the plaintiff bears the initial burden of pleading sufficient allegations to bring a nonresident defendant within the provisions of the statute.see mckanna edgar.a defendant challenging a texas court personal jurisdiction over it must negate all jurisdictional bases.kawasaki steel middleton.this court has never clearly articulated the standard for reviewing a trial court order denying a special appearance.the fourth court of appeals has held that,because personal jurisdiction involves both legal and factual questions,appellate courts should review the trial court decision for an abuse of discretion.see,klenk bustamante,antonio,no pet.however,other courts of appeals review the trial court factual findings for legal and factual sufficiency and review the trial court legal conclusions de novo.see,leblanc kyle,pet.denied in re estate of judd,paso,no pet.retention,hendrix,dist,no pet.cadle graubart,no pet.ball bigham,no pet.garner furmanite australia pty,dist,pet.denied taher,pet.denied.
we agree with the latter view and disapprove of those cases applying an abuse of discretion standard only whether a court has personal jurisdiction over a defendant is a question of law.see hotel partners craig,writ denied stating that this court decision in guardian royal exch.assurance,english china clays,suggests that personal jurisdiction is a legal question.however,the trial court frequently must resolve questions of fact before deciding the jurisdiction question.see leblanc,at retention,at.if a trial court enters an order denying a special appearance,and the trial court issues findings of fact and conclusions of law,the appellant may challenge the fact findings on legal and factual sufficiency grounds.see hotel partners kpmg peat marwick,writ denied.our courts of appeals may review the fact findings for both legal and factual sufficiency.ortiz jones.this court review of the trial court fact findings is limited to legal sufficiency.ortiz,at.
appellate courts review a trial court conclusions of law as a legal question.hitzelberger samedan oil,pet.denied.the appellant may not challenge a trial court conclusions of law for factual insufficiency however,the reviewing court may review the trial court legal conclusions drawn from the facts to determine their correctness.templeton dreiss,antonio,pet.denied dallas county sweitzer,writ denied.if the reviewing court determines a conclusion of law is erroneous,but the trial court rendered the proper judgment,the erroneous conclusion of law does not require reversal.scholz heath,no writ.
when a trial court does not issue findings of fact and conclusions of law with its special appearance ruling,all facts necessary to support the judgment and supported by the evidence are implied.see worford stamper,zac smith otis elevator,in re.when the appellate record includes the reporter and clerk records,these implied findings are not conclusive and may be challenged for legal and factual sufficiency in the appropriate appellate court.roberson robinson,zac smith,at.for legal sufficiency points,if there is more than a scintilla of evidence to support the finding,the no evidence challenge fails.holt atherton,heine.
b.in personam jurisdiction 
the texas statute governs texas courts exercise of jurisdiction over nonresident defendants.see.civ.prac.that statute permits texas courts to exercise jurisdiction over nonresident defendants that does business in texas,and the statute lists some activities that constitute doing business.civ.prac.the list of activities,however,is not exclusive.we have held that section broad language extends texas courts personal jurisdiction as far as the federal constitutional requirements of due process will permit,burt.thus,we rely on precedent from the united states supreme court and other federal courts,as well as our own state decisions,in determining whether a nonresident defendant has met its burden to negate all bases of jurisdiction.see guardian royal,at,at.
personal jurisdiction over nonresident defendants is constitutional when two conditions are met the defendant has established minimum contacts with the forum state,and the exercise of jurisdiction comports with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.international shoe washington.a nonresident defendant that has purposefully availed itself of the privileges and benefits of conducting business in the foreign jurisdiction has sufficient contacts with the forum to confer personal jurisdiction.burger king rudzewicz,d discussing the constitutional boundaries of personal jurisdiction.although not determinative,foreseeability is an important consideration in deciding whether the nonresident defendant has purposefully established minimum contacts with the forum state.guardian royal,at.however,a defendant should not be subject to a foreign court jurisdiction based upon random,fortuitous,or attenuated contacts.burger king,at.because of the unique and onerous burden placed on a party called upon to defend a suit in a foreign legal system,the minimum contacts analysis is particularly important when the defendant is from a different country.csr link,citing asahi metal indus.superior court,d.
personal jurisdiction exists if the nonresident defendant minimum contacts give rise to either specific jurisdiction or general jurisdiction.helicopteros nacionales de colombia,hall,d guardian royal,at.specific jurisdiction is established if the defendant alleged liability arises from or is related to an activity conducted within the forum.guardian royal,at.in contrast,general jurisdiction is present when a defendant contacts in a forum are continuous and systematic so that the forum may exercise personal jurisdiction over the defendant even if the cause of action did not arise from or relate to activities conducted within the forum state.guardian royal,at schlobohm schapiro.
iv.analysis 
in his original petition in the trial court,marchand alleged the following to support jurisdiction over bmcb bmcb is operated by and is a wholly owned subsidiary of bmcs bmcs provides support to and uses its wholly owned subsidiaries such as bmcb to jointly market bmcs products worldwide bmcs and bmcb have the same officers bmcb has continuous and systematic contacts with bmcs bmcb uses stock in bmcs to entice employees to work for it and the stock allegedly offered to marchand is located in houston,texas.
the court of appeals determined that the trial court could have reasonably concluded that bmcb failed to negate all possible bases for establishing specific jurisdiction.in doing so,the court of appeals explained that the evidence shows that bmcb and bmcs officers discussed marchand and the stock option offer in texas.at.furthermore,the court of appeals concluded that the record showed that bmcb had sufficient continuous and systematic contacts with bmcs and thus texas to establish the trial court general jurisdiction.in so concluding,the court of appeals relied upon alleged conversations in texas about marchand between bmcb and bmcs officers,bmcb selling bmcs software and services,bmcs including its subsidiaries financial performance on annual reports,and bmcb providing its employees bmcs stock options as part of an employee incentive plan.at.because the court of appeals determined the trial court could have found specific and general jurisdiction over bmcb,it did not reach bmcb argument that the evidence is not legally sufficient to establish that bmcb was bmcs alter ego.at.
specific jurisdiction 
marchand asserts that the trial court had specific jurisdiction over bmcb because bmcb committed a tort in whole or in part in texas.see.civ.prac.specifically,marchand alleges that ordelheide and max watson,bmcs chairman and chief executive officer,discussed in texas the offer bmcb made to marchand and,in this conversation,they planned to defraud him.marchand argues that the discussion ordelheide and watson had in texas forms the basis of his fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims about the stock options.in response,bmcb argues that there is no evidence in the record to support the trial court implied fact findings to support specific jurisdiction.we agree with bmcb.
here,marchand alleges that his fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims arise from the alleged conversation in texas.see schlobohm,at where the activities of a defendant in a forum are isolated or disjointed jurisdiction is proper if the cause of action arises from a particular activity.but they do not.the nature of the claims demonstrate that they can only arise from bmcb contact with marchand,which all occurred outside of texas.even assuming watson and ordelheide talked in texas about marchand employment and the stock options,marchand was not a party to those conversations.bmcb negotiated with marchand about his employment,and offered the stock options to marchand,in europe.moreover,marchand accepted the employment offer in belgium and worked in belgium.consequently,bmcb made no representations to marchand in texas,and he did not rely to his detriment on the conversation in texas.see stanley boot bank of el paso,fraud requires showing that plaintiff acted in reliance on defendant material misrepresentation federal land bank ass of tyler sloane,negligent misrepresentation requires that the plaintiff justifiably rely on the defendant representation.therefore,marchand alleged damages arose outside of texas.see,primera vista de banca serfin,institucion de banca multiple grupo financiero serfin,paso,no pet.holding that specific jurisdiction did not exist where defendant deposited money in texas but misrepresentations to plaintiffs about that money occurred elsewhere.
there is no evidence to support the trial court conclusion that bmcb committed a tort in whole or in part in texas so that specific jurisdiction exists.see guardian royal,at.civ.prac.see also roberson,at.accordingly,we conclude that the trial court lacked specific jurisdiction over bmcb.
general jurisdiction 
marchand also contends that the trial court has general jurisdiction over bmcb.marchand relies on the alleged conversation and bmcb purchasing products from bmcs in texas.on the other hand,bmcb asserts that these events are not enough to establish general jurisdiction.we agree and conclude that neither of the events marchand relies upon are continuous or systematic so as to establish general jurisdiction in texas.
general jurisdiction may only be exercised when the nonresident defendant contacts in a forum are continuous and systematic.helicopteros,at.guardian royal,at schlobohm,at.though a single act may be enough to show general jurisdiction in some instances,the alleged conversation between ordelheide and watson in texas is not enough here.see guardian royal,at.we have recognized that g eneral jurisdiction requires a showing that the defendant conducted substantial activities within the forum,a more demanding minimum contacts analysis than for specific jurisdiction.csr,at citing guardian royal,at.for the reasons discussed above,the alleged conversation does not constitute substantial activities within the forum to meet the more onerous burden of proving general jurisdiction.see guardian royal,at.
furthermore,bmcb purchasing products from bmcs in texas to distribute in europe is not enough to establish general jurisdiction.in helicopteros,the united states supreme court examined a colombian corporation contacts with texas to decide if texas courts could exercise general jurisdiction.helicopteros,at.the nonresident defendant had purchased helicopters,equipment,and training services from a texas company,sent its employees to texas for training,and sent its chief executive officer to houston for contract negotiation.helicopteros,at.the supreme court held that these contacts were insufficient to warrant a texas court exercising general jurisdiction.helicopteros,at.reversing hall helicopteros.the court noted that mere purchases,even if occurring at regular intervals,are not enough to warrant a state assertion of in personam jurisdiction over a nonresident corporation in a cause of action not related to those purchase transactions.helicopteros,at.
this case is analogous to helicopteros.marchand claims against bmcb do not arise from the purchases bmcb made from bmcs.to the contrary,marchand claims arise from his employment with bmcb in belgium and the alleged misrepresentations bmcb made to marchand concerning his employment.bmcb unrelated purchases in texas from bmcs are not the type of contacts that justify a finding that bmcb could have reasonably anticipate d being haled into court here.volkswagen woodson,d see also helicopteros,at.
there is no evidence to support the trial court conclusion that bmcb contacts with texas were continuous and systematic so that they established general jurisdiction.see helicopteros,at.guardian royal,at schlobohm,at see also roberson,at.thus,we conclude that the trial court lacked general jurisdiction over bmcb.
marchand jurisdictional allegations in his original petition can be read to allege that the trial court has general jurisdiction over bmcb because it is bmcs alter ego.in response,bmcb contends that there is no evidence to support a determination that it is bmcs alter ego.
personal jurisdiction may exist over a nonresident defendant if the relationship between
