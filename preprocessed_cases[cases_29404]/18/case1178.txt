the united states appeals from a sentence of months probation imposed by the district court on malcolm mcvay,the former chief financial officer,senior,and treasurer of healthsouth corporation healthsouth.mcvay pled guilty to conspiracy to commit wire and securities fraud that resulted in losses of some million,and to false certification of financial information filed with the securities and exchange commission sec.on appeal,the government argues that the trial court erred by downwardly departing so drastically from the sentencing guidelines an offense level to an offense level on the government motion,filed pursuant to e and.this departure resulted in an adjustment from a guidelines sentencing range of to months imprisonment to a sentencing range of to months imprisonment.the government says that this extraordinary downward departure was unwarranted as a adjustment.
after careful review of the record and the parties briefs and oral arguments,we conclude the district court reversibly erred by downwardly departing so sharply,based on substantial assistance,virtually without explanation,and on a wholly improper basis.accordingly,we vacate mcvay sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion.
this is the fourth appeal by the united states challenging what we have called dramatic and extraordinary downward departures awarded by the district court,without sufficient record support.see united states livesay.cir reversing dramatic reduction in offense level based on record that provided scant basis to assess reasonableness of departure united states botts.cir reversing extraordinary reduction in offense level based on record that is incapable of meaningful appellate review united states martin.cir reversing extraordinary reduction in offense level based on record that is incapable of meaningful appellate review.all arise out of crimes,to which all four defendants,former executives of healthsouth,pled guilty,in connection with a massive,securities fraud.as in the other three cases,the instant offenses occurred in the course of a conspiracy by senior officers of healthsouth,one of the nation largest providers of outpatient surgery,diagnostic imaging,and rehabilitative healthcare services.healthsouth has approximately locations in all fifty states,puerto rico,the united kingdom,australia,and canada.healthsouth is an issuer of a class of securities registered under section of the securities and exchange act of.because its common stock was listed on the new york stock exchange,healthsouth was required to comply with federal securities laws and regulations to ensure that the company financial information was accurately reported and disclosed to the public.
beginning in,if not earlier,senior officers of healthsouth conspired to inflate sharply financial statements filed with the sec,including the company forms and for years through.publicly traded corporations must file the form quarterly and the form annually with the sec,pursuant to the securities exchange act of,and.the conspirators accomplished this earnings inflation in the financial statements by making false entries in healthsouth books and records and presenting false financial reports to banks and other lenders.some of healthsouth officers,including mcvay,took these actions after recognizing that the company financial results were not producing sufficient earnings to meet or exceed wall street earning expectations or analyst expectations and that these shortfalls would lead to a decline in the market price of healthsouth securities.
over the course of the conspiracy,the cumulative inflations amounted to about million.when the conspiracy was uncovered in march,the sec temporarily suspended trading and the total drop in value of the outstanding stock was approximately billion.while the investing public,healthsouth shareholders,and the company were the direct victims of the conspiracy,the scheme collaterally affected many others,including healthsouth employees,several of whom were fired when the conspiracy was discovered,and particularly those who had participated in the company stock ownership plan or pension fund and were employees close to retirement employees of contractors who were dependent on healthsouth contracts for income banks and other lenders who loaned money to healthsouth based on the false financial information and competitors who lost business or financing,again based on healthsouth false financial representations.
malcolm mcvay was employed at healthsouth from september to may.in september,he was promoted to senior and treasurer.from august,to january,mcvay was the chief financial officer cfo and treasurer of the company.finally,in april,he served solely as treasurer.shortly after he became cfo in august,mcvay learned that revenue had been materially overstated in prior quarters and that cash was materially overstated on the balance sheet.at the plea colloquy,mcvay informed the district court that the person who told him about the irregularities was emery harris,who was then serving as group and controller.mcvay also spoke to the ceo,richard scrushy,who informed mcvay that it was okay to sign the because irregularities in the numbers on the form were commonplace.despite this knowledge,on or about november,mcvay signed healthsouth form for the third quarter of,knowing that it did not fairly represent the financial condition at health south.
on april,in a information,mcvay was charged with conspiracy to commit wire and securities fraud,in violation of count,and falsification of financial information filed with the sec,in violation of and count.the information also included a forfeiture count,pursuant to and c.mcvay pled guilty to all three counts under a plea agreement in which the government agreed to recommend that mcvay be given a reduction to his offense level for his acceptance of responsibility,and also agreed to file a motion for a downward departure based on substantial assistance,pursuant to and e,if the government determined that mcvay cooperation and substantial assistance warranted such a motion.
at sentencing,the presentence investigation report psi recommended a base offense level of and the following adjustments a upward adjustment based on a loss representing the total drop in value of the outstanding stock when the conspiracy was uncovered in march and the sec temporarily suspended trading,pursuant to b n and a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,pursuant to.with an adjusted offense level of and a criminal history category i based on criminal history points,mcvay guidelines sentencing range was to months imprisonment.the psi recommended a sentence at the bottom of that range,months 
the government and mcvay filed objections to the psi the government also filed a motion for a downward departure from the guidelines,citing mcvay substantial assistance in the investigation and prosecution of others.the government noted that mcvay made himself available on a continuous and regular basis and provided information implicating several other culpable individuals.mcvay immediate cooperation has allowed the healthsouth case to be prosecuted at a pace which,on a relative basis,constitutes swift and efficient enforcement of the united states criminal laws.further,the details of the fraudulent scheme were exposed to the public shortly after discovery of the fraud due,in part,to the defendant cooperation.the government continued the united states expects the defendant to continue his substantial assistance in the investigation and prosecution of others after the sentencing hearing is complete.
in connection with the motion,based on mcvay adjusted offense level of,the government recommended that,despite mcvay cooperation,a substantial term of imprisonment is required given the seriousness of mcvay crimes.after noting that mcvay knowingly submit ted false and misleading financial statements to the markets,knowing that the document he submitted had between and million of phoney cash,the government urged that giving mcvay anything other than a substantial term of imprisonment in this case sends the message to the markets that this type of conduct can be committed and committed successfully without punishment.the government ultimately urged a term of not less than months imprisonment.
at the sentencing hearing,the government presented the testimony of neal seiden,a senior staff accountant in the sec division of enforcement,in support of the amount of loss.seiden opined that a conservative estimate of the amount of loss to the stockholders was approximately million.
in fact,the district court found that the amount of loss to the victims was approximately million.it adopted the psi recommendations as to offense level,criminal history and sentencing range.immediately after the government noted its motion and requested a sentence of not less than months,without further discussion or any explanation,the district court summarily stated all right.the court departs downward to a level which,when combined with a criminal history category of i,creates a guideline imprisonment range of to months,a fine range of to,and a supervised release term of to years.the court then imposed the following sentence 
first,you shall pay a fine of,with interest waived.i will not require restitution because the number of identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable.and determining complex issues of fact relating to the amount of the victims losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree that the need to provide restitution to any victim is substantially outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process.
and thirdly,in light of the pending civil litigation to which you are a party defendant,the court will not order restitution in this case on consideration of the other two findings i just made.
you shall pay to the united states a special assessment of.and that special assessment and fine are due immediately.you shall be placed on probation for a term of years as to counts one and two,separately,with the sentence on each count to run concurrently with the other.
you shall serve months home detention for the first part of that probationary period.the home detention may include electronic monitoring as directed by the probation officer.
you shall forfeit to the united states which will be made available to the victims of your crime.
the probationary sentence is influenced by the exemplary record you compiled before becoming involved in this most serious kind of criminal activity and by the circumstances surrounding your daughter.
emphasis added.the foregoing is the only record explanation given by the district court to support its downward departure,from an advisory guidelines range of to months imprisonment to a probationary term,and mcvay resulting sentence.
after the district court announced the terms of the sentence,the government stated that,in addition to its objection to the ultimate sentence imposed,it objected to the court failure to follow and the factors that are supposed to be considered in the imposition of sentence,to which the district court responded 
i have factored all of those considerations in imposing the sentence that i have.i do wish to point out that it only because of your motion that i allowed to exercise any discretion.otherwise,the discretion would be with the united states attorney.if you had made the motion for a downward departure,i would have had to sentence him to at least months.
in its final written judgment,entered on june,the district court checked a box stating that the downward departure was based on motion of the government based on the defendant substantial assistance.the court offered no other explanation or additional reasons.this appeal followed.
we review a district court interpretation of the sentencing guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error.see united states jordi,cir,cert.denied,d.although we review a defendant ultimate sentence for reasonableness,united states booker,d,n othing in booker suggests that a reasonableness standard should govern review of the interpretation and application as advisory of the guidelines by a district court.united states crawford,cir.this is so because booker did not affect section f,which mandates remand of any case in which the sentence was imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.thus,whether the district court misapplied the guidelines remains,according to our precedent,subject to de novo review.see united states luiz,cir engaging in de novo review of whether district court misapplied in refusing to grant downward departure.

the government concedes that a departure from the guidelines range was warranted here,but challenges the district court enumeration of grounds for downwardly departing,and the extent of the departure as being wholly unreasonable.the government adds that to the extent the district court provided two cursory explanations of its reasoning the motion,and mcvay exemplary record and the circumstances surrounding his daughter the enumerated reasons did not provide sufficient support for its dramatic departure.
