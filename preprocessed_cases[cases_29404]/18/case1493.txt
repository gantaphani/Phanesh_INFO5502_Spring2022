in this case we are presented with the issue of whether it is appropriate under the california state bar rules of professional conduct,rule for attorneys to contact directors for a represented corporation where the directors separate counsel consents to the contact,but counsel for the corporation does not.we conclude that under the facts of this case,such contact is not barred by rule.we further conclude that even if there were a violation of rule,the court was correct not to order the disqualification of the offending attorneys as there is no evidence that they obtained any confidential information that could give their clients an unfair advantage or impact upon the fairness of the trial or integrity of the judicial system.
this action involves a complaint for dissolution of a corporation,the petitioner la jolla cove motel and hotel apartments,la jolla cove,in which the real party in interest helen jackman jackman,as trustee for the helen jackman trust,owns a minority interest,and of which her son lawrence jackman,lawrence jackman was formerly the president collectively the jackmans.la jolla cove brought a motion to disqualify two members of the law firm representing the jackmans,steven micheli and michael fabiano,on the ground that they had had improper ex parte contact with two directors of la jolla cove who had been elected to the board by jackman.in support of the motion,la jolla cove pointed to two declarations from the directors that the jackmans had submitted in support of their application for appointment of a receiver for la jolla cove.la jolla cove asserted that the jackmans counsel contacts violated rule.
the court denied la jolla cove motion,finding that assuming counsel made the allegedly improper contacts,there was no evidence that they obtained confidential communications and disqualification was not warranted even if rule was violated where there was no showing of disclosure of confidential communications,an unfair advantage having been obtained,or impact upon the fairness of the trial or integrity of the judicial system.
la jolla cove filed this petition for writ of mandate,seeking to overturn the court ruling on the grounds that counsel violated rule absolute prohibition against ex parte contacts with active directors of a corporation and the court should have disqualified attorneys micheli and fabiano because of their violation of section.the petition is denied.
factual and procedural background 
nature of dispute 
la jolla cove is a family business,in which jackman owns a minority interest.the other interest is owned by one of jackman siblings and the two children of another sibling.jackman and the other family members are each entitled to vote their interest to appoint two persons to la jolla cove board of directors.lawrence jackman was formerly the president of la jolla cove and general manager of two hotels owned by la jolla cove.several disputes have arisen among the family members,resulting in three civil actions being filed.in one action,la jolla cove sought to recover monies that lawrence jackman allegedly improperly took from la jolla cove.in another,lawrence jackman filed a derivative action against the majority of la jolla cove for their allegedly improper actions in running the corporation.in this action,the jackmans seek a dissolution of la jolla cove,appointment of a receiver and an accounting.in their complaint,the jackmans alleged that the family members with a controlling interest in la jolla cove have improperly excluded them and the two directors they appointed to represent their interests,behram baxter and tom durisoe,from any role in the company.the jackmans also alleged that under control of the other family members,the hotel properties la jolla cove owns had been mismanaged and deteriorated to such an extent that la jolla cove was in danger of financial collapse.
alleged improper attorney contacts 
after attorney micheli began his representation of the jackmans,he sent a letter to la jolla cove attorney,richard annen,discussing the parties disputes concerning the running of that entity and a related partnership.in that letter,micheli stated,in light of the fact that you have indicated in your letter that you represent the corporation and the partnership,you have not indicated that you represent the individuals,and it would be clearly a conflict of interest for you to represent the entities as well as one side of the disputing factions of the entities,i am forwarding a copy of this letter to some of the other family members.if the other family members are represented by counsel,i would appreciate it if they could contact me so that i could talk to their counsel.micheli sent a copy of the letter to the controlling family members and directors of la jolla cove.annen objected to micheli sending the letter to la jolla cove directors,calling that action ethically questionable,and told micheli that the directors had advised him to tell micheli not to contact them directly.micheli responded in a letter that he believed it was proper to contact the directors because annen only represented the corporation,not the individual directors.annen in turn sent a letter to micheli advising him that any further attempt to contact any officers or directors of la jolla cove would be considered a violation of rule.
thereafter,lawrence jackman sent a letter to krista baroudi,president and chief executive officer of la jolla cove,concerning possible settlement offers.annen accused micheli of directing lawrence jackman to send the letter.micheli responded by denying that he had directed lawrence jackman to send the letter and questioned annen ability to represent individual officers and directors given the dispute among the parties concerning the operation of la jolla cove.
after they filed their complaint,the jackmans brought an ex parte application for appointment of a receiver.in support of the application,counsel for the jackmans submitted declarations from the jackmans representatives on the board of directors of la jolla cove,durisoe and baxter.in both declarations,they explained that they were elected as board members by a vote of shares owned by the jackmans.their declarations discussed the alleged mismanagement of the hotel properties owned by la jolla cove,and shareholder and directors meetings.they asserted that improper agreements were made by the majority board members to relieve family members of liability for using corporate assets and that the majority on the board refused to allow them to participate in the running of la jolla cove.
motion to disqualify 
la jolla cove brought a motion to disqualify the jackmans attorneys micheli and fabiano,asserting that they had engaged in improper contacts with la jolla cove directors and officers without the consent of la jolla cove attorney,in violation of rule.la jolla cove asserted that the jackmans attorneys could not contact any board members of that entity,including ones they elected to the board,because the corporation was represented by counsel.as evidence of a violation of rule,la jolla cove pointed to the declarations of durisoe and baxter.while la jolla cove did not base its motion upon the earlier letters by micheli and lawrence jackman,they pointed to those as evidence that improper contacts would continue if micheli and fabiano were not disqualified.
the jackmans opposed the motion to disqualify,arguing that lawrence jackman obtained the declarations of durisoe and baxter on his own without direction of counsel durisoe and baxter were not represented by la jolla cove counsel within the meaning of rule durisoe and baxter were represented by separate counsel who did not object to the jackmans use of their declarations la jolla cove had not provided any evidence that any privileged communications were disclosed by durisoe and baxter to fabiano or micheli there was no continuing effect of any allegedly improper contact and disqualification would be inequitable.
micheli filed a declaration in support of the opposition,stating that lawrence jackman delivered the declarations of durisoe and baxter and micheli had his secretary prepare the caption pages.he also stated that he never had any contact with durisoe or baxter concerning their declarations,and he had only spoken with baxter once at a mediation,where they only introduced themselves.he had only spoken with durisoe briefly at that mediation and at a meeting where he discussed representation of durisoe wife.micheli also stated that he spoke with counsel for baxter and durisoe and counsel did not object to him using their declarations in support of the motion for appointment of a receiver.fabiano also filed a declaration,wherein he stated that that he did not have any contact with durisoe or baxter concerning their declarations.the only time he met either baxter or durisoe was at a mediation.lawrence jackman filed a declaration in opposition to the motion to disqualify,stating that he obtained the declarations of baxter and durisoe,he wrote them himself,he had no input from micheli or fabiano,and he obtained signatures on the declarations from durisoe and baxter.the jackmans also submitted deposition testimony from baxter,wherein he denied ever meeting or being contacted by micheli or fabiano,and where he stated he had only met micheli at a mediation.
la jolla cove filed reply papers wherein it asserted that it was not believable that durisoe and baxter declarations were obtained without direction from micheli fabiano.la jolla cove also claimed that as active directors,durisoe and baxter were deemed to be represented by la jolla cove attorneys and could not be contacted for any purpose.counsel for la jolla cove denied that durisoe or baxter was excluded from management of la jolla cove,stating in a declaration that since their election to the board,they had attended and participated in regularly scheduled board of director meetings and had voted on a variety of topics.attorney annen also stated in that declaration that durisoe and baxter,as directors of la jolla cove,had received privileged case status reports relating to litigation concerning la jolla cove and lawrence jackman.
court ruling 
in february the court issued its order denying la jolla cove motion to disqualify attorneys micheli and fabiano.in doing so,the court found that r ule establishes the rule that opposing counsel may not contact presently employed officers,directors or managing agents without the permission of corporate counsel,or the permission of separate counsel in cases where the officer,director or managing agent is represented by personal counsel.the court further found that a ssuming,for the sake of argument,that plaintiff counsel contacted directors durisoe and baxter as opposed to contact by jackman which is not prohibited by rule without the permission of their personal counsel,there is no evidence that plaintiffs obtained confidential attorney client communications during these meetings it is questionable whether the drastic measure of disqualification is ever warranted by showing only a violation of rule,without an additional showing that the violation led to the disclosure of confidential communications protected by the attorney client privilege,or created an unfair advantage,or impacted the fairness of the trial or the integrity of the judicial system.
la jolla cove filed a petition seeking to overturn the court ruling.we issued an order to show cause why the petition should not be granted.
motion to dismiss writ 
after we issued an order to show cause in this matter,the jackmans filed a motion to dismiss the petition as moot.they asserted that because attorneys micheli and fabiano had substituted out as their counsel of record in this matter,the appeal was moot as the relief requested by la jolla cove,disqualification of micheli and fabiano,could no longer be granted.la jolla cove opposed the motion to dismiss,arguing that the matter was not moot as micheli and fabiano might still work on the case behind the scenes and because they represented the jackmans in two other actions involving the same parties.they also asserted that even if the appeal was technically moot,this court should nevertheless exercise its discretion to hear it on the merits because the issues were likely to recur among the parties and the appeal posed an issue of public interest that was likely to recur.
discussion 
an appeal will be dismissed if,by reason of events,it has become moot and impossible for the court to render effective judgment for a party.eye dog foundation state board of guide dogs for the blind cal d.as the court of appeal stated in wilson county civil service com.d,although a case may originally present an existing controversy,if before decision it has,through act of the parties or other cause,occurring after the commencement of the action,lost that essential character,it becomes a moot case or question which will not be considered by the court.however,notwithstanding the fact that a case has been rendered moot by intervening events,we retain the discretion to review such an appeal on the merits where the appeal poses an issue of broad public interest that is likely to recur.in re william cal d.
here,this case has been rendered technically moot because,as attorneys micheli and fabiano no longer represent the jackmans in this action,we can not order their disqualification.however,we will nevertheless exercise our discretion to resolve the matter on the merits because the appeal raises an issue of public interest that is likely to recur whether counsel may contact a director for an opposing corporation upon permission of the director counsel or only upon consent of the corporation counsel.

we review the court decision to disqualify the jackmans counsel under the abuse of discretion standard.nalian truck lines,nakano warehouse transport th,d.this discretion is subject to the limitations of the legal principles governing the subject of its action,and subject to reversal on appeal where no reasonable basis for the action is shown.citation.citation.ibid.
was the consent of corporate counsel required to contact the directors 
recently,in snider superior court th,d snider,we explained that it was important to have a test to determine the ethical boundaries of an attorney contact with opposing parties.o therwise,an attorney would be uncertain whether the rules had been violated until he or she is disqualified.unclear rules risk blunting an advocate zealous representation of a client.id.at,d,quoting nalian truck lines,nakano warehouse transport,supra,th at,d.in snider,we examined whether a former employee counsel violated rule,which prohibits an attorney from communicating with an officer,director,or managing agent of a corporation represented by counsel about the subject of the representation without the consent of the other lawyer.snider,supra,th at,d.in that case,we were presented with the issue of whether counsel for an employee sued by his former employer violated rule b by conducting an ex parte interview with a sales manager and a production department supervisor who worked for the employer.snider,supra,at,d.we held in snider that because there was no evidence that the two interviewed employees were managing agents of their corporate employer,there was no violation of rule and the lower court erred in disqualifying counsel.
here,we are presented with a related issue.the issue we are presented with is whether an attorney may contact a director for an opposing corporation when that director separate counsel gives the attorney permission,but the corporation counsel has not.resolution of this issue requires an examination of the relevant ethical rules and cases interpreting their terms.
rule provides in part 
a while representing a client,a member shall not communicate directly or indirectly about the subject of the representation with a party the member knows to be represented by another lawyer in the matter,unless the member has the consent of the other lawyer.b for purposes of this rule,a party includes an officer,director,or managing agent of a corporation or association,and a partner or managing agent of a partnership or an association member or an employee of an association,corporation,or partnership,if the subject of the communication is any act or omission of such person in connection with the matter which may be binding upon or imputed to the organization for purposes of civil or criminal liability or whose statement may constitute an admission on the part of the organization.italics added.
american bar association aba model rules of professional conduct,rule model rule contains a similar proscription against unauthorized contacts with represented persons or entities,unless counsel consents 
in representing a client,a lawyer shall not communicate about the subject matter of the representation with a person the lawyer knows to be represented by another lawyer in the matter,unless the lawyer has the consent of the other lawyer or is authorized to do so by law or a court order.italics added.
further,comment to aba model rule provides that,in the case of a represented corporation,if a constituent of the organization is represented in the matter by his or her own counsel,the consent by that counsel to a communication will be sufficient for purposes of this r ule.
thus,although directors such as durisoe and baxter ordinarily would be deemed represented members of the corporation that may not be contacted,rule carves out an exception where the represented party separate counsel consents to the contact.comment to model rule is even more specific,providing that if members of a corporation such as durisoe and baxter are represented by separate counsel,the permission of that counsel,as opposed to corporate counsel,is sufficient to comply with the rule.from the texts of rule and model rule,as further explained by comment to model rule,the answer to the issue posed by this petition would appear clear because counsel for the jackmans obtained the permission of durisoe and baxter separate counsel to use their declarations,there was no improper contact with a represented party.
however,la jolla cove asserts that notwithstanding durisoe and baxter representation by separate counsel in this litigation and separate counsels consent to the alleged contacts,as active directors of the corporation,who are potentially privy to confidential communications,the jackmans counsel was absolutely prohibited from contacting them without permission from corporate counsel.we conclude that given that this litigation is brought by minority shareholders seeking a dissolution of their corporation,durisoe and baxter role as directors is to represent those minority shareholders interests in the corporation,and as durisoe and baxter are adverse to the corporation with regard to the subject of this litigation,rule does not prohibit the alleged contact as durisoe and baxter separate counsel consented.
in representing a corporation,an attorney client is the corporate entity,not individual shareholders or directors,and the individual shareholders or directors can not presume that corporate counsel is protecting their interests.meehan hopps d,skarbrevik cohen,england whitfield d.corporate attorney owed no duty to minority shareholder in arranging elimination of preemptive rights to allow majority shareholders to increase their ownership friedman,cal.practice guide corporations the rutter group.in this regard,rule provides in part 
a in representing an organization,a member shall conform his or her representation to the concept that the client is the organization itself,acting through its highest authorized officer,employee,body,or constituent overseeing the particular engagement.d in dealing with an organization directors,officers,employees,members,shareholders,or other constituents,a member shall explain the identity of the client for whom the member acts,whenever it is or becomes apparent that the organization interests are or may become adverse to those of the constituent s with whom the member is dealing.the member shall not mislead such a constituent into believing that the constituent may communicate confidential information to the member in a way that will not be used in the organization interest if that is or becomes adverse to the constituent.e a member representing an organization may also represent any of its directors,officers,employees,members,shareholders,or other constituents,subject to the provisions of rule.if the organization consent to the dual representation is required by rule,the consent shall be given by an appropriate constituent of the organization other than the individual or constituent who is to be represented,or by the shareholder s or organization members.italics added.
conflicts of interest between a corporation and its officers,directors and shareholders are particularly problematic for corporate counsel where,as here,the corporation is a closely held one,with few shareholders.friedman,cal.practice guide corporations,supra,to.corporate counsel may develop a fiduciary relationship with individual shareholders or directors.however,even in that situation,the attorney ultimate loyalty is to the corporation,not individual shareholders,officers or directors.ibid.thus,where an adversarial setting presents itself,pitting the corporation against one or more of its officers,directors or shareholders,corporate counsel may still represent the corporation against those individuals,even though he or she may have received confidential information about them in the course of representing the corporation.meehan hopps,supra,d at.
further,once a conflict has arisen between a corporation and one or more of its officers,directors or shareholders,corporate counsel may not simultaneously represent the corporation and the adverse officer,director or shareholder.in this regard,rule c provides as follows 
a member shall not,without the informed written consent of each client accept representation of more than one client in a matter in which the interests of the clients potentially conflict or accept or continue representation of more than one client in a matter in which the interests of the clients actually conflict or represent a client in a matter and at the same time in a separate matter accept as a client a person or entity whose interest in the first matter is adverse to the client in the first matter.
thus,where a shareholder has filed an action questioning its management or the actions of individual officers or directors,such as in a shareholder derivative or the instant dissolution action,corporate counsel can not represent both the corporation and the officers,directors or shareholders with which the corporation has a conflict of interest.forrest baeza th,d friedman,cal.practice guide corporations,supra,witkin,cal procedure,supra,attorneys.
likewise,in this case it is undisputed that an actual conflict has arisen between the jackmans and la jolla cove,its majority shareholders,and their representative on the board of directors.la jolla cove has sued lawrence jackman,alleging he improperly took monies from the corporation.the jackmans in turn have sued la jolla cove twice,once in a shareholder derivative action,and in this action seeking dissolution of the corporation.in these actions the jackmans allege various improprieties by the majority,including excluding them and their representatives on the board of directors from any role in managing the corporation.
likewise durisoe and baxter are adverse to la jolla cove.they were elected by the jackmans to represent their interests as minority shareholders.they both allege that the majority has engaged in improper actions,negligently maintained the hotel properties la jolla cove owns,and that they have been frozen out of the management of the corporation.they have both retained separate counsel to represent them in these disputes.
la jolla cove attempts to argue that durisoe and baxter are not really adverse as their only role is as directors,not shareholders,and thus their only loyalty is to the corporation.however,this ignores the fact that they were elected to the board by the jackmans and that they allege that the representatives of the majority shareholders have engaged in improper transactions and have excluded them from any role in overseeing the corporation.in fact,la jolla cove submitted no declaration from the majority shareh
