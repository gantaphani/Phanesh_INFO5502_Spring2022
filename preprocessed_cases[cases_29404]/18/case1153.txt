this case involves a business that the defendant,charles edwards,claimed was legitimate.a northern district of georgia jury,however,found that edwards was operating a ponzi scheme and convicted him of wire fraud and related crimes edwards now appeals his convictions and the prison sentence he received.we affirm his convictions but vacate his prison term and remand the case for a new sentencing hearing.
from its founding on june,through september,charles edwards was the chairman of the board and sole owner of ets payphones,ets,a privately owned georgia corporation that provided management services to payphone owners.edwards also controlled payphone systems acquisitions,psa,a delaware corporation that was a wholly owned subsidiary of ets.edwards and others often referred to these two others edwards formed to support ets payphone as ets,and we do likewise.
edwards organized ets to implement his idea of selling payphones to investors who would then lease the phones back to edwards for a guaranteed rate of return.edwards discussed his idea with an acquaintance,beverly slater,who suggested that he use insurance agents,those selling life insurance,including annuities,to market the payphones.edwards liked her suggestion and persuaded her to establish a network of independent insurance agents to sell the phones.she would serve as the distributor of the phones,purchasing them from ets and selling them to the investors solicited by the insurance agents.slater formed bee communications,bee to perform the distributorship functions.tom murray was one of bee insurance agents.he was so successful selling payphones that edwards made him a distributor.like slater,murray formed a corporation to operate his distributorship,national communications marketing,ncmi.
shortly after edwards sale and plan was up and running,edwards formed psa to deal with the distributors.the sale and of the payphones were handled as follows.the insurance agent,having found an investor,contacted the distributor,and the distributor sent the agent a lease already executed by ets,as lessee,for the investor to sign,as lessor.the lease identified the location for the payphone the investor was purchasing,specified the rent ets would be paying the investor each month spelled out ets responsibility for installing and servicing the phones,and contained a provision.the provision required ets to purchase the payphone from the investor at the end of the lease for the same price the investor had paid for the phone.the provision also gave the investor the right to sell the payphone to ets for that price at any time during the term of the lease on days notice to ets.
if the investor agreed to this arrangement,the investor gave the insurance agent a check made out to the distributor for the price of the payphone.the agent then forwarded the check to the distributor,which deposited the check into its bank account.once the investor check cleared,the distributor deducted the sales commission,which was divided between it and the insurance agent and wire transferred the net sale proceeds to psa bank account.on a regular basis,psa wired funds from its account to ets for operating expenses,lease payments,and.psa also wired funds to some accounts designated by edwards.some of these accounts related to ets business,some were held by other business entities edwards owned,and some accounts were held by edwards for his and his wife personal expenditures.
the price the investor paid for a payphone and the rent ets remitted to the investor varied as edwards plan unfolded.in,the payphones were sold for,and the monthly rental payment was.this gave the investor an return on his investment.by,the payphones were sold for,and the monthly rental payment was,for a return on investment of 
the insurance agents touted the ets payphone program as a highly profitable alternative to investing in annuities or other forms of life insurance ets provided the agents with promotional materials for distribution to prospective investors,primarily seniors,claiming that the payphone industry was virtually,that it was primed for a successful and profitable future,and that pay phone profits have grown dramatically and are expected to continue to escalate.ets slogan was,opportunity does always knock sometimes it rings.
the revenues the payphones generated were insufficient to cover ets operating expenses,lease payments,and obligations.in short,edwards payphone business was never profitable.because psa paid its distributors and insurance agents commissions of up to of the retail price of each phone sold and ets was contractually obligated to buy back every phone for the full price paid by the investor,ets immediately owed each investor more money than it collected on the sale of the deficit that could only be overcome by operating the phones at a substantial profit.the revenues the payphones provided,however,were extremely inadequate by,ets was operating its phones at a loss of million a month.nearly of the installed payphones were unprofitable.this problem was compounded by the fact that ets leased more payphones from investors than it actually placed into service,a gap that increased from in october to by september,ets,therefore,always depended on the influx of money from new investors to sustain its payphone business.moreover,if ets suffered a run on the bank a sudden invocation of the lease provision by a significant number of company would have collapsed.whenever ets board of directors met ets mounting financial losses and the optimistic outlook ets was portraying to the investors were discussed.according to charles bynum,ets chief operating officer,edwards attitude was that we ca possibly let investors see what is really going on because if this money coming in from new investors ever stopped,the whole thing would crash.edwards attitude prevailed the investors were kept in the dark 
ets financial outlook appeared shaky from the outset.by,the company had leased payphones,but only were in operation.of the,at least of the phones were not making enough money to cover the monthly payment due the telephone company,let alone the additional operating expenses attributable to those phones,such as repairs,maintenance,and the cost of collecting the coin revenue.after conducting a comprehensive analysis of ets operational structure in october,bynum wrote in a memorandum to edwards that ets was not yet a viable company and that they were currently in command of a near certain disaster.edwards recognized this dire situation and acknowledged that ets was hemorrhaging money.bynum recommended shutting down the unprofitable phones.edwards rejected the recommendation.he told bynum that if the investors found out that ets was not operating a payphone for every lease,they would panic and demand their money back.bynum also recommended that edwards shut down the leasing side of the business and not bring on any more investors.edwards rejected this recommendation as well and continued to recruit investors.he held weekly seminars for prospective identified by the distributors insurance ets offices,where he would pitch ets sale and program as extremely profitable bynum left ets in january.he was concerned about ets financial condition and the legality of what edwards was doing,concerns he conveyed to the fbi after leaving the company.
in the spring of,ets hired the gross collins accounting firm to perform an audit.in july,auditors steve gross and derek starnes met with edwards and presented him with a report of their preliminary findings.they told edwards that the revenue generated by the payphone operation was not sufficient to cover the required monthly lease payments to the investors,that ets had leased far more payphones than it had placed in service,and that ets did not have the financial resources to fund its obligations.the auditors also told edwards that ets characterization of the monies generated through the payphone sales as revenue painted an inaccurate picture of the company financial health when the auditors finished their presentation,edwards threw their report in the trash can and discharged their firm.
on march,edwards sent a memo to all ets employees stating that profits were below expectations in and that the company had entered into a period of drastic times for the payphone industry.edwards kept this information from ets distributors and their insurance agents.the agents,having no reason to question ets financial viability,therefore kept touting ets program as a sound investment.edwards also continued to paint a rosy picture of ets profitability for investors.in may,he gave a group of prospective investors a tour of ets offices.at the completion of the tour,he told them that ets had sales of million the previous year,netted million in profit and planned to expand its business into mexico and the carribean.
by,investors were cancelling their leases and triggering the provision at an increasing rate,causing significant cash flow problems for the company.nevertheless,edwards continued to woo investors with representations of ets prosperity.on july,he wrote his existing investors a letter stating that ets was financially stable,made a profit of nearly last year and that its profit potential looks even brighter for this year.additionally,when edwards learned that some of the insurance agents were advising their investor clients to cancel their leases,he took steps to dissuade them.for instance,on july,he sent the following letter to ron bryant,one of bee agents,who had recommended that his clients request an early termination of their lease agreements 
the ets corporate family made a profit of over eight million dollars last year and this year looks even better if you are telling a different story to our lessors,you may be assured that ets will not hesitate to take legal action against you to set the record straight in a public forum 
edwards echoed similar sentiments in a july,speech to dozens of bee agents in cartersville,georgia,reassuring them that ets was financially solid and that they should focus on selling more payphones.
at some point in the spring of,edwards hired a consultant,ken baker,to conduct a financial analysis of ets and twin leaf company edwards had formed to sell advertising spots on the payphone kiosks edwards thought that the income twin leaf produced might alleviate ets financial problem.in july,baker informed edwards that even if highly successful,twin leaf would not be able to solve the problem ets sale and program was not sustainable.while continuing to sell more payphones would prolong the company existence,eventually the number of new sales would not be sufficient to service the mounting debt,which baker projected to reach billion by.in short,baker told edwards that it was only a matter of time until ets would have to file for bankruptcy,and he recommended that ets seek bankruptcy protection in october.
despite ken baker grim projections,edwards continued aggressively to market his company as financially sound.on july,he sent a letter to ets investors,stating that ets continued to prosper and that he personally believe d that this was without a doubt the best time to be in the payphone industry shortly thereafter,on august,he wrote a letter to ron bryant,stating that t here is no legitimate reason to advise any lessor to liquidate his or her payphones.three weeks later,edwards hired two of his investors,bob and alice worsham,to contact other investors who had notified ets that they were cancelling their leases and try to convince them to withdraw their notices he offered to pay the worshams for every phone that they convinced the investors to keep.as it turned out,they were able to persuade at least investors to stay with ets.in a final effort to generate additional revenue,edwards sent a memorandum to bee and ncmi on september,announcing a rebate for anyone who purchased a payphone within thirty days.
on september,ets and psa filed petitions for chapter bankruptcy relief in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware during the two months prior to filing these petitions,psa,at edwards direction,continued to sell payphones,taking in million from investors the sales ceased after the petitions were filed.as of september,ets had payphones under lease and was contractually obligated to buy back those phones at a total cost of.edwards investors lost millions,but edwards faired quite well.he received more than million from ets and its subsidiaries in the form of salary,consulting fees,and interest free loans that he never repaid.he used this money to purchase e verything from expensive cowboy boots to homes.
on june,a northern district of georgia grand jury indicted edwards on counts of wire fraud,and counts of money laundering,a superceding indictment returned on august,added an additional count for conspiracy to commit money laundering,h and a forfeiture provision in total,edwards was charged with criminal offenses.
edwards pled not guilty to all counts and elected to stand trial before a jury.prior to trial,he filed two motions in limine that are at issue in this appeal.the first sought the exclusion of documents the government obtained from the securities and exchange commission sec investigation on the theory that the sec and the united states attorney office had conducted a joint and collusive investigation into edwards business operations the second motion asked the court to invoke the sequestration rule and exclude several government witnesses from the courtroom prior to their taking the witness stand.the district court denied both motions.
edwards trial began on september.after the government presented its case in chief,edwards moved the district court to enter a judgement of acquittal on all counts pursuant to rule a of the federal rules of criminal procedure the court denied the motion,and edwards proceeded to put on a defense.after resting his case,edwards renewed his rule a motion.the court denied it.the government then presented its rebuttal,after which both sides rested and the presentation of evidence closed.at this point,edwards did not renew his motion for acquittal,and the court submitted the case to the jury.the jury received the case in the afternoon of september and returned its verdicts the next morning,finding edwards guilty on all counts.
on february,the district court sentenced edwards to one prison sentence of months and ordered him to pay restitution to investors in the amount of and forfeit several properties that were involved in the offenses to the united states.this appeal followed.
edwards presents six arguments four relate to his convictions,two to his sentence.regarding his convictions,he first seeks a judgment of acquittal on all counts on the ground that the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal made after he rested his defense.next,and alternatively,edwards seeks a new trial on three grounds the district court denied him a fair trial and the ability to confront several prosecution witnesses,in violation of his fifth and sixth amendment rights,when it refused to invoke the federal rule of evidence sequestration provision and permitted the witnesses to remain in the courtroom and listen to the testimony before they took the stand to testify the court erred in denying his motion to suppress certain documents he submitted to the sec during its investigation of the ets sale and the united states attorney office later obtained for use in the prosecution of this case and the court jury instructions constructively amended the indictment 
edwards challenges his sentence on the grounds that the court erred in calculating the amount of funds involved in the money laundering counts,and the court restitution order was entered in violation of his sixth amendment right to a jury determination of the elements of his offenses.
we consider first edwards arguments concerning his convictions.
edwards contends that the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal made after he rested his defense.as we note above,edwards failed to renew his motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of all of the evidence as required by rule he therefore failed to preserve his right to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence edwards argues that he properly preserved his objection by moving for a judgment of acquittal after resting his case.that is,he contends that this preserved his objection to the sufficiency of the evidence and that rule a did not require him to renew his motion at the close of all the evidence.we disagree.the drafters of the rule plainly contemplated that in the event,as here,the defendant put on a case and the prosecution presented rebuttal evidence,the district court would only be required to consider the sufficiency of the evidence if the defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of all the evidence.see united states rigsby,cir.
although edwards failed to preserve his objection to the court rule a ruling,he is not foreclosed from having this court review the evidence that led to the jury verdicts.if we find a manifest miscarriage of the evidence on a key element of the offense is so tenuous that a conviction would be shocking we will set aside a conviction.united states bichsel,cir quotation omitted.we turn,then,to the question of whether the arguments edwards presents establish that a manifest miscarriage of justice would occur if we affirm the district court judgment.
edwards first argument addresses the wire fraud convictions.he questions whether the evidence established that he intended to defraud his investors absent such intent,the wire fraud convictions fail we are satisfied that the jury had ample evidence of intent to defraud before it,and hence,edwards wire fraud convictions stand.
the jury learned that edwards,with full knowledge that ets was hemorrhaging money and unable to sustain its operations without a constant influx of investment capital,aggressively courted both new and existing investors with assurances that ets was financially sound and profitable.indeed,less than seven weeks before seeking the bankruptcy court protection under chapter,edwards sent a letter to investors proclaiming that ets continued to prosper.moreover,he never disclosed to his investors that ets would be unable to buy back the payphones,as required by its leases,if a substantial number of investors triggered the provision.from this evidence alone,a rational jury could determine that edwards intended to defraud his investors.given the other facts recited in part,supra,we find that the government presented more than sufficient evidence to make out the wire fraud offenses thus,affirming edwards convictions for those offenses would not result in a miscarriage of justice.
next,according to edwards,his conviction for conspiracy to commit money laundering can not stand because the government failed to establish that he conspired with another person to launder money the government position at trial was that edwards conspired with his wife,evelyn sue edwards,and joan shepler,his assistant.after examining the trial transcript,however,we are left with an abiding impression that although edwards assisted her husband launder some of the proceeds of payphone sales,frequently for her own benefit,the evidence failed to establish that she actually conspired with her husband to launder those she was aware that what he was doing was illegal.whether edwards was guilty of the conspiracy offense therefore turns on whether shepler was implicated.
criminal conspiracies,because they are inevitably secret,are rarely established by direct evidence.the cases accordingly turn on whether there is circumstantial evidence that two or more persons conspired to commit the criminal offense.see united states mercer,cir.the indictment alleged that edwards and others conspired to use the proceeds from the sale of the payphones the fraud proceeds to conduct financial transactions with the intent to promote the scheme to defraud to conduct financial transactions with the intent to conceal and disguise the source,location,ownership,nature,and control of the proceeds and to engage in monetary transactions in amounts greater than.
after careful examination of the record,we conclude that the government proved that joan shepler knowingly acted as a coconspirator in the money laundering scheme.the evidence indicated that shepler was an integral part of the senior management of ets and psa,regularly attending board meetings where the financial woes of the company were discussed and performing such high level tasks as interviewing potential chief financial officer candidates.shepler served as the point person for all monies wired to ets and psa by its distributors,money that was then used to support the operations side of the business and maintain the appearance of viability that allowed the fraud to continue.additionally,shepler coordinated a series of complex wire transactions many of which in excess of that routed fraud proceeds from ets and psa through the various bank accounts controlled by edwards.because an agreement may be proven by inferences from the conduct of the alleged participants or from circumstantial evidence of a scheme,united states silvestri,cir quotation omitted,the jury had sufficient evidence before it to find that shepler conspired with edwards to launder the fraud proceeds.
rule of the federal rules of evidence provides that witnesses may be excluded from the courtroom while a trial is ongoing so that they can not hear the testimony of other witnesses the reason for the rule is prevent witnesses from tailoring their testimony to that of earlier witnesses and to aid in detecting testimony that is less than candid.geders united states,d.rule recognizes an exception,however,for a person authorized by statute to be present.the crime victims rights act cvra,provides such an exception the victim of a crime has t he right not to be excluded from any public court proceeding.a.the act,though,authorizes the court to exclude a if it finds by clear and convincing evidence that the witness testimony would be materially altered if the victim heard other testimony at that proceeding.id.
prior to the commencement of his trial,edwards moved the district court to sequester all potential prosecution witnesses,including those witnesses who purported to be the victims in the case.citing the cvra,the court denied the motion as to the.in his brief on appeal,edwards argues that rule is constitutionally based and that the district court invocation of the cvra to deny his motion denied him his fifth amendment due process right to a fair trial and his sixth amendment right of confrontation this argument fails for one simple reason a criminal defendant has no constitutional right to exclude witnesses from the courtroom.mathis wainwright,cir bell duckworth,cir.we accordingly hold that the district court committed no abuse of discretion in denying edwards motion.
on september,eighteen days after ets and psa sought relief in the bankruptcy court,the sec brought suit against ets and edwards in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia,alleging that ets sale and of payphones constituted the fraudulent sale of unregistered securities in violation of federal securities laws and seeking injunctive relief during the course of the litigation,the court ordered edwards to produce certain personal income tax returns for through,an appraisal of certain investment property,and consolidated financial statements and accounting papers prepared by gross collins for file them with the court under seal edwards promptly complied with the court order.the docket sheet for the case indicates that they are still under seal.
edwards anticipated that the government might attempt to use copies of these documents in prosecuting the instant case and moved to suppress such duplicates edwards represented that the sec filed suit against him for the purpose of acquiring evidence for the united states attorney use in the instant prosecution,and had the sec informed him that it had filed suit for that purpose,he would not have produced the documents.such a tactic,he argued,smacked of collusion and infringed his right under the fifth amendment due process clause and the amendment protection against the court denied his motion in an order entered on march.
edwards argues that the documents should have been suppressed because the sec provided these documents in bad faith to the united states attorney to facilitate his criminal prosecution after the sec,ets and edwards reached an impasse with respect to the settlement of the sec case.the court found no merit in edwards motion to suppress because edwards had presented 
no evidence of bad faith by the government with respect to the documents at issue.the tax returns were readily accessible by the government from the beginning of this case,without regard to the sealing order in the sec case.the other documents were produced pursuant to a grand jury subpoena.edwards has not contested the fact that all the documents would have been obtainable or were obtained by the government independent of the sealing order in the sec case.there is simply no evidence here of any bad faith or improper exploitation of the sec case by the united states attorney for the purpose of developing its criminal prosecution.
we find no error in the district court ruling.the sec is authorized by statute,b,d to provide evidence of misconduct to the department of justice.moreover,there is nothing in this record that suggests,much less establishes,that the sec and the united states attorney somehow colluded to deny edwards his constitutional rights 
as his final challenge to his convictions,edwards contends that the district court constructively amended the indictment in its instruction to the jury as to the definition of a ponzi scheme.the amendment,he submits,allowed the jury to convict him of wire fraud without finding that he acted with the intent to defraud.
a jury instruction that constructively amends a grand jury indictment constitutes per se reversible error because such an instruction violates a defendant fifth amendment right to be tried on only those charges presented in a grand jury indictment.united states cancelliere,cir.a constructive amendment occurs when the essential elements of the offense are altered to broaden the possible bases for conviction beyond what is contained in the indictment.united states keller,cir.to determine whether error has occurred,we consider the court instructions as a whole,reading them in light of the trial transcript.see united states deleveaux,cir united states artrip,cir.
conviction under the wire fraud statute requires that the defendant intentionally participated in a scheme or artifice to defraud another person of money or property and used or caused the use of interstate wires to execute the scheme or artifice.united states ward,cir.the first essential element of the offense,mens rea,was spelled out in the indictment thusly 
edwards did knowingly and willfully devise and intend to devise a scheme and artifice to defraud investors through the sale of payphones and to obtain money from those investors by means of false and fraudulent pretenses and representations,and by omissions of material facts,well knowing and having reason to know that such pretenses and representations were and would be false and fraudulent when made and caused to be made and that said omissions were and would be material.
we now turn to the jury instruction at issue to determine whether it amended the indictment by effectively eliminating the mens rea element from the wire fraud offense.referring to counts one through,the court informed the jury as follows 
title,united states code,section makes it a federal crime or offense for anyone to use interstate wire communications facilities in carrying out a scheme to defraud.the defendant can be found guilty of that offense only if all of the following facts are proved beyond a reasonable doubt.first,that the defendant knowingly devised or participated in a scheme to defraud or for obtaining money or property by means of false pretenses,representations,or promises.second,that the false pretenses,representations,or promises related to a material fact.third,that the defendant did so willfully and with the intent to defraud and,fourth,that the defendant transmitted or caused to be transmitted by wire in interstate commerce some communication for the purpose of executing the scheme to defraud.
the court then went on to expound upon the meaning of several key terms to help the jury better understand the elements of the wire fraud offense,beginning with scheme to defraud 
the term scheme to defraud includes any plan or course of action intended to deceive or cheat someone out of money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises.
now,in this case the government alleges that the defendant operated a ponzi scheme which defrauded investors.a ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment scheme in which profits to investors are not created by the success of the underlying business venture,but instead are derived fraudulently from capital contributions of other investors.in a typical ponzi scheme a corporation operates and continue s to operate at a loss.the corporation gives the appearance of being profitable by obtaining new investors and using those investors to pay for the high returns promised to earlier investors.
the effect of such a scheme is to put the corporation further and further into debt by incurring more and more liability,but to give the false appearance of profitability in order to obtain new investors.
edwards argues that by defining a ponzi scheme,the court constructively expanded the indictment by removing the element of criminal intent and allowing the jury to infer intent if it found that the ets sale and program was a ponzi scheme.we disagree.to begin,the opening paragraph of the jury instruction clearly states that edwards could only be found guilty if he possessed the intent to defraud.what edwards cites as offending language did not speak to the element of intent at all.rather,the discussion of a ponzi scheme merely served to define the particular type of scheme to defraud that edwards was alleged to have perpetrated.moreover,the court went on to reemphasize the mens rea requirement in defining what it meant to act with an intent to defraud 
now,to act with intent to defraud means to act knowingly and with the specific intent to deceive or cheat someone,ordinarily for the purpose of causing some financial loss to another or bringing about financial gain to one self what must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt is that the defendant,with the intent to defraud,knowingly and willfully devised,intended to devise,or participated in a scheme to defraud substantially the same as the one alleged in the indictment 
as the jury instructions did not alter the mens rea element of the wire fraud offense,a constructive amendment did not occur.
we do not reach edwards challenges to his sentence because,with the exception of the district court restitution order we must vacate his sentence and remand the case for a new sentencing hearing.although edwards was convicted on counts of wire fraud,counts of money laundering,and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering,he received only one prison term of months.the only single offense for which he could have received a prison term of that length is the conspiracy to launder money offense the maximum incarceration penalty for that offense is twenty years imprisonment.the maximum incarceration penalty for money laundering is ten years,and for wire fraud five years.on remand,the court must impose a sentence for each count of conviction 
edwards challenges the restitution order on the ground that united states booker,d,requires that the factual predicate for restitution be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt unless trial by jury is waived or the defendant admits to the predicate.edwards acknowledges in his brief,however,that his challenge is foreclosed by a prior decision of this court,united states williams,cir,abrogated on other grounds by united states lewis,cir.
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm edwards convictions,vacate edwards sentence,with the exception of the restitution and forfeiture orders,and remand the case for a new sentencing hearing.
so ordered.
generically,a ponzi scheme is a phony investment plan in which monies paid by later investors are used to pay artificially high returns to t
