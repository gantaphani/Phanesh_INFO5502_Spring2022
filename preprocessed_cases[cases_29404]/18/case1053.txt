background 
emma mary ellen holley is african american,her husband,david holley,is caucasian and their son,michael holley,is african american.the holleys allege that in october,they visited triad realty office in palms,california where they met with triad agent grove crank and inquired about listings for new houses in the range of to.the holleys allege that crank showed them four houses in the area,all priced above.in,the holleys located a home on their own that happened to be listed by triad.in response to the holleys inquiry about the home,triad agent terry stump informed them that the asking price for the house was.the holleys expressed interest in purchasing the home and offered to pay the asking price and to put in escrow for the builder to hold the house until april or may when they closed escrow on the sale of their existing home.
stump told the holleys that their offer seemed fair,as did the builder,brooks bauer,when holley called him with the same offer.bauer did express,however,that the offer would have to go through triad.later,stump called holley to tell her that more experienced agents in the office,one of whom was later identified as grove crank,felt that was insufficient to get the builder to hold the house for six months.the holleys decided not to raise their offer,and triad never presented the original offer to bauer.one week later,bauer inquired at triad about the status of the holleys offer.crank then allegedly used racial invectives in referring to the holleys,telling bauer that he did not want to deal with those n and calling them a salt and pepper team.the holleys eventually hired a builder to construct a house for them,and bauer later sold his house for approximately less than the holleys had offered.
bauer and the holleys filed a complaint on november,alleging that crank and triad violated federal and state fair housing laws.they later filed a separate action against david meyer as,president and owner of triad,making the same allegations and adding several new claims.the district court consolidated the two cases.the district judge,ruling on a federal rule of civil procedure b motion,dismissed all of the claims except the fair housing act fha claim,on the grounds that they were barred by the applicable statutes of limitation.plaintiffs have not appealed this ruling.with regard to the fha claim,the district court granted the motion to dismiss meyer in his capacity as an officer of triad.the district court thereafter granted summary judgment in favor of meyer on the claim that meyer was vicariously liable as the designated officer broker of triad.it then entered a final order that judgment be granted for david meyer on all remaining claims in this action.plaintiffs appealed from the final judgment.
we reversed the judgment of the district court,applying a vicarious liability analysis provided in hud regulation b since repealed.further,we followed our own prior precedent and that of three other circuits holding that the duty to obey the laws relating to racial discrimination under the fha is.see phiffer proud parrot motor hotel,cir,walker crigler,cir,city of chicago matchmaker real estate sales,cir,marr rife,cir.
the supreme court disagreed,holding that the fha is governed by traditional vicarious liability rules and tort principles and that the fha did not create a duty not to discriminate based on race.thus,the supreme court held that we erred in holding that meyer could be held liable as the sole owner and president of triad based upon an duty.the supreme court also held that we erred in holding that meyer could be held liable as the designated of triad based solely upon his right to control crank.
although the supreme court found the right to control by the designated insufficient by itself under traditional agency principles to establish a relationship,it left the application of traditional vicarious liability rules to this court,stating 
the ninth circuit did not decide whether other aspects of the california broker relationship,when added to the right to control,would,under traditional legal principles and consistent with the general common law of agency,establish the necessary relationship.but in the absence of consideration of that matter by the court of appeals,we shall not consider it.
meyer,at.citation omitted emphasis in original.the supreme court also declined to consider whether traditional piercing principles should apply in this case,stating 
w hen traditional vicarious liability principles impose liability upon a corporation,the corporation liability may be imputed to the corporation owner in an appropriate case through a piercing of the corporate veil.the court of appeals,however,did not decide the application of veil piercing in this matter either.it falls outside the scope of the question presented on certiorari.and we shall not here consider it.
id.at.citations omitted.the court vacated our judgment and remanded for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.
ii.vicarious liability 
preservation of the vicarious liability claims 
defendants argue that the holleys failed to preserve their claim that meyer may be liable under traditional principles of vicarious liability.however,we find that the holleys raised the issue in their opening brief when they argued that meyer liability turned on hud regulation b.at the outset,we note that we read opening briefs liberally.see people of guam reyes,cir citing fed.sav.and loan ins.haralson,cir.because the supreme court held that the hud regulations mean that traditional rules of vicarious liability apply,see meyer,at,we construe the opening brief discussion of the hud regulations as adequately raising,and thereby preserving,the traditional vicarious liability claims.
designated 
under general principles of corporate liability,a corporate employee acts on behalf of the corporation,not its owner or officer as a result,liability in the typical employment relationship runs between the corporation and the salesperson and between the corporation and the supervisor,but not between the salesperson and the supervisor.see meyer,at.here,however,the real estate corporation and employment relationship at issue are atypical because california law makes the designated real estate broker of a real estate corporation personally responsible for the supervision of the corporation salespersons.because meyer remained triad designated real estate broker,he remained personally responsible for the supervision of the corporations salespersons.when meyer delegated this responsibility to crank,he created an agency relationship between himself and crank,which made meyer vicariously liable as the principal for the discriminatory actions of crank as his agent.
meyer has been the sole owner and of triad,a small real estate agency since.in california,as in most states,the real estate profession is highly regulated.
it is unlawful for any person to engage in the business,act in the capacity of,advertise or assume to act as a real estate broker or a real estate salesman within this state without first obtaining a real estate license from the department.
