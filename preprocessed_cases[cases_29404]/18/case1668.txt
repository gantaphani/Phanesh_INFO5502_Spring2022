the,william lapoint and john nehra,in their capacity as representatives of the former stockholders of bridge medical,bridge stockholder representatives,filed this appeal from the superior court final judgment in favor of the,amerisourcebergen corporation abc bridge medical,developed software for hospitals related to patient safety.abc is a wholesale pharmaceutical distribution company that distributes and generic drugs to hospitals,retail pharmacies,nursing homes and assisted living centers.on november,bridge medical and abc entered into an agreement and plan of reorganization the merger agreement pursuant to which bridge medical became a subsidiary of abc.
on march,former stockholders of bridge medical the bridge stockholders filed an action in the court of chancery and claimed that abc breached the merger agreement the chancery action.after the court of chancery entered its final judgment,the bridge stockholder representatives commenced an action in the superior court that is the subject of this appeal the superior court action.in the superior court action,the bridge stockholder representatives requested indemnification for attorneys fees and other litigation costs incurred in connection with the chancery action.
abc moved for summary judgment in the superior court action on two grounds first,that the bridge stockholder representatives claim was barred by the doctrine of res judicata and second,that the bridge stockholder representatives claim was barred separately by the statute of limitations the superior court granted summary judgment in favor of abc on both grounds.
the bridge stockholder representatives have raised two contentions in this appeal.first,they assert that res judicata can not bar their claim for indemnification because that claim was never litigated or adjudicated in a prior proceeding.in addition,they argue that neither the principles of res judicata nor the rule against claim splitting bars their indemnification claim because that claim is a new claim based on new rights and based entirely on facts that were not known,and could not have been known,at the time the first contract disputes between the parties were adjudicated.second,they assert that the statute of limitations can not bar a claim for indemnification that was brought within three months of the court of chancery decision that abc had breached the merger agreement because the indemnification claim did not accrue until there was a final determination that abc had breached that agreement.
we have concluded that both of those contentions are correct.therefore,the judgments of the superior court must be reversed.
procedural background 
on november,the bridge stockholder representatives commenced the superior court action,which is captioned lapoint amerisourcebergen corporation,superior court of delaware,and is the subject of this appeal.the superior court action arose from the chancery action,which is captioned lapoint amerisourcebergen corporation,delaware court of chancery.the chancery action was filed on march,and concerned claims by the bridge stockholders that abc breached the merger agreement under which abc acquired bridge medical from the bridge stockholders.the court of chancery final judgment was entered on september,
chancery action 
on march,the bridge stockholder representatives filed the chancery action on behalf of all the bridge stockholders.in the chancery action,the bridge stockholder representatives alleged that abc had breached the terms of the merger agreement by,among other things,failing to adequately promote bridge medical products and to properly calculate contractually defined payments.
in the chancery action,the bridge stockholder representatives specifically raised and sought to litigate the issue of their equitable claim for attorneys fees and costs incurred in that action.at the beginning of the suit,the bridge stockholder representatives alleged in both their complaint and their amended complaint that they were entitled to be reimbursed for attorneys fees and costs.at the time of trial,the bridge stockholder representatives again indicated that they were pursuing a claim for attorneys fees,asserting in their pretrial brief that 
t he evidence presented at trial will show that plaintiffs are entitled to damages of not less than million,plus attorneys fees and costs,and such other relief as the court may deem just and proper.
in the joint pretrial order,the bridge stockholder representatives stated their intent to pursue an equitable claim for attorneys fees based on abc alleged breaches of the merger agreement 
plaintiffs have incurred substantial litigation costs,including attorneys fees and expenses,in prosecuting these claims.if abc had not breached the merger agreement,plaintiffs would not have incurred these fees and expenses.it is fair and equitable to include,as part of plaintiffs damages,the present and future fees and expenses incurred by plaintiffs.emphasis added.
nevertheless,at trial the bridge stockholder representatives chose not to present any evidence on the equitable attorneys fees issue.after trial,the court of chancery awarded the bridge stockholder representatives million in damages.the bridge stockholders did not ask the court of chancery to award them attorneys fees and costs following the award of damages.the final order and judgment,the form of which the bridge stockholder representatives proposed and agreed to,did not award attorneys fees or costs.
indemnification request rejected 
on september,about a week after the court of chancery issued its final judgment on the breach of contract claims,the bridge stockholder representatives sent a letter to abc requesting indemnification for in attorneys fees incurred in the chancery action.on september,counsel for abc responded that the claim for attorneys fees was barred under the doctrines of waiver,because the bridge stockholder representatives had raised the attorneys fees issue in the chancery action but had not pursued it effectively,and res judicata,because the bridge stockholder representatives could have brought their attorneys fees claim under the merger agreement as part of the chancery action.the bridge stockholder representatives assert that abc admitted in that letter the following facts 
bridge medical september,letter was the first time that the stockholder representatives raised the issue of entitlement to attorneys fees under the merger agreement.
the first amended complaint contained a general demand for attorneys fees in the prayer for relief,but did not contain a claim for indemnification under the merger agreement.
the stockholder representatives did not raise the issue of contractual indemnification at trial.nor did they raise that issue in their or briefing.
chancery action judgment affirmed 
on september,abc appealed the court of chancery award of million of damages under the provision of the merger agreement the bridge stockholder representatives did not from any part of the court of chancery decision.on april,this court affirmed the court of chancery final judgment on april,abc satisfied the full amount of the judgment,paying the judgment amount,plus in interest,as well as interest at the legal rate.
superior court action 
on november,the bridge stockholder representatives filed the superior court action requesting attorneys fees.in that action,the bridge stockholder representatives argued,based on the indemnification provisions of the merger agreement,that they are entitled to the attorneys fees and costs incurred in connection with the chancery action.the bridge stockholder representatives made this claim under section b of the merger agreement,which states 
b by parent.subject to section f below,parent and merger sub shall,jointly and severally,indemnify,defend and hold harmless the company stockholders and their respective officers,directors,employees,affiliates,agents,successors,subsidiaries and assigns collectively the stockholder group from and against any and all damages incurred in connection with,arising out of,resulting from or incident to any breach of any covenant,representation,warranty or agreement made by abc in this merger agreement.
section a of the merger agreement defines damages to include 
any and all costs,losses,liabilities,damages,lawsuits,deficiencies,claims and expenses,including without limitation,reasonable attorneys fees and amounts paid in investigation,defense or settlement of any of the foregoing.
on january,abc answered the superior court complaint and moved for summary judgment on the grounds that the indemnification claim for attorneys fees under the merger agreement was barred by the doctrine of res judicata and by the applicable statute of limitations because the claim accrued in february,when the merger agreement was allegedly breached.
on july,the superior court held that the bridge stockholders claim for attorneys fees under the merger agreement was barred by both the doctrine of res judicata and the statute of limitations.applying the transactional theory of res judicata,the superior court found that res judicata barred the attorneys fees claim for two reasons.first,because i n their complaint,amended complaint,and pretrial order,plaintiffs demanded reimbursement for attorneys fees and costs,the attorneys fees indemnification issue had actually been litigated in the chancery action.the superior court found that c learly,plaintiffs are seeking in this court,as they did in the court of chancery,the same relief,based upon the same events,simply under a different substantive theory.second,even if the bridge stockholders had not raised their indemnification claim for attorneys fees under the merger agreement in the chancery action,the bridge stockholders could have raised that issue in the chancery action.the superior court concluded that,because the doctrine of res judicata precludes the bridge stockholder representatives from litigating issues not previously raised but which could have been raised in the prior chancery action,res judicata would still bar the claim.
the superior court also held that the indemnification claim for attorneys fees was barred by delaware statute of limitations for breach of contract claims the superior court found that the breach of the merger agreement occurred in february,when the plaintiffs allege the breach of the merger agreement first occurred.the superior court examined the language of the indemnification provision in the merger agreement and determined that the contract language provided that the attorneys fees claim accrued at the time of the breach.the superior court rejected the bridge stockholder representatives contention that the indemnification claim for attorneys fees under the merger agreement did not accrue until the court of chancery resolved the underlying breach of contract action.
standard of review 
the entry of summary judgment is appropriate only when the record shows that there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law in an appeal from a trial court decision to grant summary judgment,this court scope of review is de novo,not deferential,as to both the facts and the law on a summary judgment record,which is a paper record not involving credibility assessments,we are free to draw our own inferences in making factual determinations and in evaluating the legal significance of the evidence.of course,the facts of record,including any reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom,must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party 
res judicata inapplicable 
the doctrine of res judicata is venerable and in our legal history,having been traced back to roman law and implemented in english law in the twelfth century the bridge stockholder representatives first argument on appeal is that a superior court claim based on facts that had not accrued at the time the original chancery action was filed can not be barred by res judicata.the bridge stockholder representatives submit that until the court of chancery had determined that amerisourcebergen breached the merger agreement and amerisourcebergen subsequently refused to indemnify the plaintiffs,any claim for indemnification was not yet ripe.
res judicata exists to provide a definite end to litigation prevent vexatious litigation and promote judicial economy the procedural bar of res judicata extends to all issues which might have been raised and decided in the first suit as well as to all issues that actually were decided.in essence,the doctrine of res judicata serves to prevent a multiplicity of needless litigation of issues by limiting parties to one fair trial of an issue or cause of action which has been raised or should have been raised in a court of competent jurisdiction.
this court recently reiterated the elements of res judicata in dover historical society,city of dover planning commission 
res judicata operates to bar a claim where the following test is satisfied the original court had jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties the parties to the original action were the same as those parties,or in privity,in the case at bar the original cause of action or the issues decided was the same as the case at bar the issues in the prior action must have been decided adversely to the appellants in the case at bar and the decree in the prior action was a final decree 
applying that test,this court reversed a decision of the superior court to bar an application for attorneys fees under the doctrine of res judicata this court held that the superior court ruling was legally erroneous because the res judicata doctrine was misapplied to bar a claim for relief that was never adjudicated in the earlier fee proceeding.
the bridge stockholder representatives argue that the same conclusion must be reached in this case because the superior court committed legal error by misapplying res judicata to bar a claim for relief that was never adjudicated in an earlier proceeding.in support of that assertion,the bridge stockholder representatives rely upon abc admissions in its september,letter refusing the request for indemnification.in that letter,abc said 
the stockholder representatives did not raise the issue of contractual indemnification at trial.
bridge medical september,letter was the first time that the stockholder representatives raised the issue of entitlement to attorneys fees under the merger agreement.
the bridge stockholder representatives contend that,with those concessions,there is no factual basis on which the superior court could properly find that all plaintiffs claims against abc for breach of the merger agreement were adjudicated in the prior action.the record supports that argument.the record reflects that the bridge stockholder representatives did not raise the indemnification claim in the court of chancery.since the indemnification claim was not adjudicated in the prior chancery action,we hold the indemnification claim in the superior court was not barred by that element of res judicata.
transactional approach 
abc argues that under the transactional approach to res judicata,whether the attorneys fee indemnification claim was actually litigated does not matter.the bridge stockholder representatives contend the superior court erred in ruling that,even if the indemnification claim was not adjudicated in the prior proceeding,a ll claims incident to the breach of the merger agreement could have been decided in the court of chancery action.the bridge stockholders submit that the superior court reached that incorrect result,in part,by relying upon only the first portion of the second circuit summary of delaware law on claim preclusion in ambase city investing.liquidating trust 
in ambase,the united states court of appeals for the second circuit recognized that under the court of chancery holding in maldonado flynn delaware has adopted the transactional approach to claim preclusion the ambase opinion noted,however,that the broader view of res judicata does not operate to bar claims based on facts that were not,and could not have been,known to the plaintiff in the second action at the time of the first action the court explained that 
if the pleadings framing the issues in the first action would have permitted the raising of the issue sought to be raised in the second action,and if the facts were known,or could have been known to the plaintiff in the second action at the time of the first action,then the claims in the second action are precluded 
delaware,like the federal courts follows a transactional approach to res judicata determining whether two claims arise from the same transaction requires pragmatic consideration,with the fact finder giving weight to such considerations as whether the facts are related in time,space,origin,or motivation,whether they form a convenient trial unit,and whether their treatment as a unit conforms to the parties expectations or business understanding or usage.two claims derive d from a common nucleus of operative fact s arise from the same transaction as we explained in kossol ashton condominium association,to assert res judicata as a bar to a plaintiff claim,in addition to showing that the same transaction formed the basis for both the present and former suits,the defendant must show that the plaintiff neglected or failed to assert claims which in fairness should have been asserted in the first action.
the bridge stockholder representatives submit that the facts that form the basis of the indemnification claim were not,and could not have been,known to the parties at the time that the plaintiffs brought their claim against abc for breaching the provision of the merger agreement.prior to the court of chancery determination that abc breached the merger agreement,neither the bridge stockholder representatives nor abc knew whether abc would be found to have breached any of its obligations under the merger agreement.therefore,the bridge stockholder representatives argue that their right to indemnification did not ripen until abc was judged to be in breach of the merger agreement and abc refused to honor its indemnification obligation.
generally,a contract is considered to be a single transaction for the purpose of claim preclusion contractual rights that are triggered and pursued after the initial action is filed,however,are not barred by res judicata because a prior judgment can not be given the effect of extinguishing claims which did not even then exist.abc refusal to indemnify the bridge stockholder representatives after the condition precedent to that right had been satisfied the court of chancery determination that abc had breached the agreement gave rise to a second independent cause of action under the merger agreement.
in dover historical society,this court held that the superior court had improperly applied the bar of res judicata to a second application for attorneys fees because 
t he second fee application rested entirely upon facts that did not arise until after the first application had been denied,zimmerman destruction of the two historic buildings.because those new facts give rise to a quite different legal theory of fee entitlement that was neither presented nor decided in the first fee application,res judicata could not operate to bar the appellants second application.the res judicata ruling was,therefore,legally erroneous,because the doctrine was misapplied to bar a claim for relief that was never adjudicated in the earlier fee proceeding 
the same is true here.the bridge stockholder representatives indemnification claim was based on events that had not yet occurred at the time they brought their first breach of contract claim.the record does not support the superior court conclusion that there has been no additional conduct by the opposing party and no new,substantive basis upon which plaintiffs claim to be entitled to relief.
the opposing party additional conduct after the litigation of the bridge stockholder representatives chancery action against abc for breaching the provision was abc subsequent refusal to honor its indemnification obligation.that obligation did not ripen until a final adjudication of its breach of the provision in the merger agreement.the final adjudication provided the new substantive basis upon which plaintiffs claim ed to be entitled to relief.abc refusal happened after the bridge stockholder representatives initiated the previous breach of contract claims and provided the necessary predicate for the new substantive basis upon which the plaintiffs brought their indemnification claim.
the record reflects that the events necessary to support an indemnification claim had not occurred before the conclusion of the proceedings in the chancery action.those facts were not,and could not have been,known to the plaintiffs in the second action at the time of the first action under section b of the merger agreement,until abc was adjudicated to have breach ed any covenant,representation,warranty or agreement,abc was not required to indemnify the bridge stockholder representatives for their attorneys fees.
the bridge stockholders indemnification claim was not ripe until the court of chancery adjudicated abc breach.the superior court erred in finding that a ll claims incident to the breach of the merger agreement could have been decided in the chancery court action,and therefore improperly barred the indemnification claim by res judicata.under the holdings in ezzes ackerman and maldonado,the indemnification claim that arose after a finding that abc breached the merger agreement was not part of the same transaction.therefore,the indemnification claim is not barred under delaware transactional approach to res judicata.
kossol distinguished 
the superior court reliance on the kossol case does not support its conclusion to the contrary.in kossol,the plaintiff pled a claim for attorneys fees in his original action,withdrew that claim,then attempted to plead the same claim a year later in a second proceeding this court applied the res judicata test set forth in maldonado and ezzes to bar the kossol plaintiff claim for attorneys fees because it was the same claim that the plaintiff had brought,then abandoned,in the original proceeding 
in this case,however,the first time that the bridge stockholder representatives pled their indemnification claim was after the court of chancery decided abc breached the merger agreement and abc wrongfully refused the demand for indemnification.the indemnification claim was not brought,then dropped,from an earlier action.moreover,in kossol,the claim for legal fees was part of the same transaction underlying the first action because it was ripe when the first claim was brought 
in kossol,the contract provided that i n the event that the council shall effectuate the collection of said common charges by resort to counsel,the council may add to the aforementioned charge or charges reasonable attorney s fees.in kossol,the fee provision was not an indemnification right that was conditioned on the finding of a breach.instead,the right to attorneys fees at issue in kossol ripened upon the condominium council resort to the use of legal counsel to collect the condo fees.
in this case,the superior court correctly noted that res judicata precludes a plaintiff from splitting its claim and seeking the same relief in subsequent litigation under a different substantive theory.this is not such a case,however.the bridge stockholder representatives did not seek to an issue that had been decided in an earlier proceeding.the bridge stockholder representatives claim for abc breach of its indemnification obligation was not ripe at the time that the breach of contract claim was brought in the court of chancery,and the indemnification claim was not raised or decided in the prior chancery action.the indemnification claim was not split from the first proceeding because it did not exist at the time that the lawsuit for the earlier breaches to the merger agreement was brought and litigated.
