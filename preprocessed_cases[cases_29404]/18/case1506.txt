deducting cash and inventory shortages from the sales commissions otherwise earned by the driver of a sandwich truck is unlawful.kerr catering service department of industrial relations cal d,kerr see,tit,subd,subd.does the same legal principle prohibit a large corporate retailer from implementing an incentive compensation plan for managerial employees in which the amount of the incentive bonus is based on the achievement of store sales and profitability goals the trial court held it did.we agree,but only in part.
to the extent the bonus calculation includes expense items the legislature or the industrial welfare commission has declared may not be charged to an employee deductions for any part of the cost of workers compensation claims or cash shortages for nonexempt employees,such a bonus plan is unlawful.however,other expense items,even those beyond the individual manager direct control,may lawfully be considered in bonus programs,which can serve as an effective economic incentive to managerial level employees to maximize company profit by increasing revenue and minimizing expenses.because the complaint in this case alleges the bonus plan adopted by ralphs grocery company includes deductions for expenses within the first prohibited category,it states causes of action for unlawful deductions from wages and unlawful business practices.accordingly,the trial court properly overruled ralphs demurrer.
factual and procedural background 
david swanson,a former store manager at a ralphs grocery store,filed a lawsuit individually and as a putative class representative alleging ralphs is violating the labor code and an industrial welfare commission commission wage order for nonexempt employees and committing unlawful business practices by basing its incentive compensation,or bonus,program for store managers and other employees on the net earnings of a store according to the complaint,ralphs is wrongfully deduct ing expenses from the wages of their employees,including swanson,which expenses the law requires to be borne by employers.in other words,swanson and the class he proposes to represent are forced to carry the burden of losses from their respective stores in violation of california law.
swanson alleges causes of action for unlawful deductions from earnings in violation of labor code sections,to and and california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision unlawful and unfair business practices pursuant to business and professions code section and failure to pay wages upon discharge in violation of section.swanson seeks damages,injunctive relief,disgorgement of profits,penalties,attorney fees and costs.
ralphs demurred to the complaint on the ground swanson could not state a cause of action because its bonus plan is not unlawful and a good faith dispute exists as to whether ralphs failed to pay swanson all wages due upon discharge.according to ralphs,its method of calculation with deductions for business losses and expenses is lawful because the bonus is paid in addition to the employees regular wages and the deductions are simply part of the formula to calculate the bonus,not impermissible deductions from amounts already paid or due to the employees.
the trial court overruled the demurrer,relying on quillian lion oil company d.quillian,in which the court of appeal had applied kerr to hold an employer could not lawfully calculate a bonus for its employees by using a formula that deducted business losses from a percentage commission on products sold.because ralphs bonus constituted wages as defined by the labor code,under quillian swanson allegation that ralphs calculation method required its employees to bear the burden of business losses and expenses including cash shortages,merchandise shortages and shrinkage and workers compensation costs was sufficient to withstand demurrer.as to the fourth cause of action for failure to pay wages upon discharge,the court ruled swanson had sufficiently pleaded a willful failure to pay wages to former employees in violation of section.
after ralphs petitioned this court for a writ of mandate compelling the trial court to vacate its order,we issued an order to show cause why the requested relief should not be granted

b.the cases 
kerr catering service department of industrial relations 
in kerr,supra,cal d,a catering business employed saleswomen to drive lunch trucks to business and industrial establishments and sell food and beverage items.id.at.these employees were unionized and paid under a collective bargaining agreement through which they received a base salary plus a percent monthly commission on sales exceeding a week.ibid.the sales not the base subject to reduction for any cash and inventory shortages attributable to the sales during the month.ibid.the department of industrial relations challenged the deductions under the applicable wage order,issued by the commission,similar to the wage order at issue here,providing,no employer shall make any deduction from the wage of an employee for any cash shortage,breakage,or loss of equipment,notwithstanding any contract or arrangement to the contrary,unless it can be shown that the shortage,breakage,or loss is caused by a dishonest or willful act,or by the culpable negligence of the employee.ibid.
the trial court held the wage order was in excess of the commission statutory authority and unconstitutional.reversing the trial court and directing that judgment be entered for the state defendants,the supreme court held deductions for cash shortages not due to the employee dishonest or willful act or culpable negligence could properly be characterized as standard conditions of labor,even if such deductions did not reduce the employee earnings below the minimum wage and,therefore,the wage order prohibiting such deductions was a proper exercise of the commission statutory powers.although the court holding was limited to the narrow question of the commission authority to adopt the challenged wage order,the court in its analysis emphasized the public policy supporting the broad range of legislation that protects employee wages wages of workers in california have long been accorded a special status generally beyond the reach of claims by creditors including those of an employer.this public policy has been expressed in the numerous statutes regulating the payment,assignment,exemption and priority of wages.kerr,supra,cal d at.in this regard,the court found the deductions from wages due in contravention of the spirit,if not the letter,of the employee bond law in sections through.kerr,at.the court also held t he use of the device of deductions creates the danger that the employer,because of his superior position,may defraud or coerce the employee by deducting improper amounts in violation of section,which was enacted to prevent employers from implementing devices to reduce the wage scale.id.at.
the court further explained,legislative disapproval of deductions exists in the reliance of the employee on receiving his expected wage,whether it be computed upon the basis of a set minimum,a piece rate,or a commission.to subject that compensation to unanticipated or undetermined deductions is to impose a special hardship on the employee.kerr,supra,cal d at.thus,rather than requiring employees to bear the burden of business losses,the court held s ome cash shortages,breakage and loss of equipment are inevitable in almost any business operation.it does not seem unjust to require the employer to bear such losses as expenses of management furthermore,the employer may,and usually does,either pass these costs on to the consumer in the form of higher prices or lower his employees wages proportionately,thus distributing the losses among a wide group.in addition,the employer is free to discharge any employee whose carelessness causes the losses,and he is not prohibited from deducting for cash shortages caused by the dishonest or willful act,or by the culpable negligence of the employee.ibid.
ii.quillian lion oil.
in quillian,supra,d,the employee,a manager of two stations that marketed fuel,oil and sundry items,was paid a base salary and a monthly bonus as an incentive to increase sales and reduce cash and merchandise shortage at the stations.id.at.consistent with such dual objective,the bonus amount paid was measured on the basis of sales volumes,less merchandise or cash shortages at the stations during the month.ibid.relying on kerr,the court of appeal affirmed the judgment in the employee favor,finding the bonus was in contravention of the public policy expressed in sections to of the labor code pertaining to cash bonds that may be required of employees because it required the employee to carry the burden of losses from the station.quillian,at.
although the employer had acknowledged section prohibits deductions from wages due or earned,it maintained,similar to ralphs argument here,the bonus was legal because no deductions were made from the actual bonus paid but merely factored into the calculation to compute the bonus amount.quillian,supra,d at.the court rejected this argument the bonus herein described is,in fact,a scheduled payment based on the number of gallons of motor fuel sold plus a percent commission on other sales.rather than call this incentive payment a commission and then deduct for shortages in contravention to kerr s,the employer deducts shortages from the payment and calls the final result a bonus.the employer then proclaims that no deductions were made from the bonus.unfortunately,the result is the same.the manager carries the burden of losses from the station,at.thus,that the employer labeled the wage a bonus,as opposed to a commission as in kerr,did not merit a different result because both are wages within the meaning of section and,therefore,a lthough factored in as one component of the manager bonus,the deductions herein are as much a hardship as deductions made from final wages.quillian,at see defining wages as all amounts for labor performed italics added.
iii.hudgins neiman marcus group.
in hudgins neiman marcus group,th,d hudgins,the court of appeal held neiman marcus commission program violated section and constituted an unfair business practice under business and professions code section because it unlawfully deducted a pro rata share of commissions previously paid for unidentified returns from the wages of all sales associates in the section of the store where the merchandise is returned id.at,d.
according to the hudgins court,the california courts have long held that,because of the special consideration accorded to wages,sections and through prohibit deductions from wages for business losses unless the employer can establish that the loss was caused by a dishonest or willful act,or by the culpable negligence of the employee.hudgins,supra,th at,d.citing kerr and quillian,the court explained that section has long been held to prohibit deductions from an employee wages for cash shortages,breakage,loss of equipment,and other business losses that may result from the employee simple negligence.id.at,d.even where fraud is not involved,the legislature has recognized the employee dependence on wages for the necessities of life and has,consequently,disapproved of unanticipated or unpredictable deductions because they impose a special hardship on employees.citations.id.at,d.
applying these principles to the commission deductions for unidentified returns,the court found,by its terms,the unidentified returns policy calls for deductions from earned commission wages of all sales associates a sum of money representing what would otherwise be business losses occasioned by the misconduct or negligence of some of its employees and customers.the deduction is unpredictable,and is taken without regard to whether the losses were due to factors beyond the employee control.neiman marcus can not avoid a finding that its unidentified returns policy is unlawful simply by asserting that the deduction is just a step in its calculation of commission income.hudgins,supra,th at,d,citing quillian,supra,d at.
the trial court properly overruled the demurrer 
ralphs and the amici curiae that have filed briefs on its behalf present persuasive arguments,supported by substantial academic literature,that compensation plans benefit both employers and employees.notwithstanding the contrary holding in quillian,supra,d,ralphs also forcefully demonstrates that,as a matter of economics,calculation of an incentive bonus based on profitability by taking into account not only revenues but also store expenses in accordance with standard accounting principles differs markedly from reducing or recapturing wages through prohibited deductions.nonetheless,to the extent the legislature or,as applied to nonexempt employees,the commission in its authorized wage orders has prohibited the use of certain expenses in determining wages due an employee,economic reality must yield to regulatory imperative.
accordingly,based on the allegation that ralphs includes in its calculation of bonuses a charge for workers compensation costs,swanson has stated causes of action,as to both exempt and employees,for violation of section,which prohibits employers from directly or indirectly holding its employees accountable for workers compensation costs.as to nonexempt employees,the alleged calculation based on cash and merchandise shortages is sufficient to withstand demurrer based on the supreme court interpretation in kerr of a wage order identical in all relevant respects to the order governing nonexempt employees working at ralphs.however,to the extent further proceedings in this litigation reveal swanson and members of the class he proposes to represent are exempt employees,the calculation accounting for cash and merchandise shortages is lawful.nothing in the labor code itself prevents ralphs from making the reasonable and economically sound choice to reward exempt employees with a bonus that acts as an incentive to maximize company profit by increasing revenue and minimizing expenses.
swanson has stated claims for unlawful deductions from wages and unlawful business practices by alleging ralphs allocates workers compensation costs to its employees 
section prohibits employers from mak ing or tak ing any deduction from the earnings of any employee,either directly or indirectly,to cover the whole or any part of the cost of workers compensation.interpreting this statute according to its plain language lennane franchise tax bd.cal th,d,ralphs bonus plainly constitutes employee earnings within the meaning of the statute and the alleged deduction for workers compensation costs in the bonus calculation is,at the very least,an indirect means of holding employees responsible for such costs.
swanson correctly observes that,by shifting at least partial responsibility for workers compensation costs to managerial employees,ralphs may create an atmosphere that discourages the reporting of such claims in contravention of the policy behind section.on the other hand,creating an incentive to improve workplace safety and thus reduce injuries and the need for damage awards is consistent with the overall goal of the workers compensation system it is not our role to resolve this policy dispute.in light of the plain language and clear meaning of the statute,swanson can pursue his claims for violation of section and unlawful business practices based on the allegation that ralphs factors workers compensation costs into the calculation of profit for its bonus program 
swanson has stated causes of action for unlawful deductions from wages and unlawful business practices as to nonexempt employees,but not exempt employees,by alleging ralphs factors cash and merchandise shortages in to its bonus calculation 
nonexempt employees 
nonexempt employees of ralphs are subject to wage order mercantile industry,which prohibits deductions from wages for any cash shortage,breakage,or loss of equipment,unless it can be shown that the shortage,breakage,or loss is caused by a dishonest or willful act,or by the gross negligence of the employee,tit,subd.the parties agree the challenged bonus constitutes wages within the meaning of the labor code.wages constitutes all amounts for labor performed by employees of every description regardless of the method of calculation italics added.they also agree that expense deductions included in the calculation of the bonus are made without regard to whether the loss is caused by a dishonest or willful act or by the gross negligence of the employee.ralphs argues,however,that,because the bonus is paid in addition to regular wages and the deductions are made during the bonus calculation itself,as opposed to after the amount due the employee is determined,its employees are not suffering a reduction in earnings,which the wage order is designed to prevent under the reasoning in kerr,we are compelled to disagree.
whatever the economic sense of ralphs position,as to employees the legislative and administrative policies protecting employee wages and the supreme court implementation of those policies preclude bonus plan deductions for cash and inventory shortages.first,neither the wage order nor the labor code itself makes the distinction between regular wages and a bonus that ralphs attempts to write into them.instead,both refer simply to wages and even ralphs agrees its bonus falls within the statutory definition of wages.second,ralphs effort to distinguish its bonus program on the basis that the deductions are taken as a percentage,not on a basis as was true in kerr and quillian,is unpersuasive.again,neither the wage order nor the legislative scheme allows for any such distinction.indeed,the definition of wages in section specifically includes any amount paid to an employee regardless of the method of calculation.in addition,if for some reason an item of expense may not properly be included in a calculation of profit,from a purely economic standpoint it is equally improper to include all or only a portion of the item although the impact on the result will obviously differ.
most significantly,ralphs argument as it applies to nonexempt employees is simply irreconcilable with the supreme court decision in kerr.as previously noted,the wage order prohibiting deductions for cash and inventory shortages at issue in kerr is identical for all practical purposes to the order now governing ralphs nonexempt employees.kerr catering service employees,like ralphs employees,received their regular wages and a supplemental payment called a commission in kerr measured by revenues reduced by certain expenses.the supreme court held the employer use of cash shortages to reduce the amount of supplemental payment otherwise due the employee violated the wage is,including the amount of cash shortages in the calculation of the supplemental payment constituted a prohibited deduction from wages of an employee.kerr,supra,cal d at,accord,quillian,supra,d at.as previously discussed,ralphs bonus or incentive compensation plan can not be distinguished on any meaningful basis from the supplemental payment commission found unlawful in kerr.
in kerr the supreme court found some cash shortages,breakage and loss of equipment are inevitable in almost any business operation and required the employer to bear such losses as expenses of management.kerr,supra,cal d at.that finding is equally applicable here whatever cash and merchandise shortages are inevitable in ralphs business operations are to be borne as expenses of management.ibid.ralphs is not permitted to require its nonexempt employees to be the insurers of its business losses and expenses.based on the legislative and administrative policies that protect nonexempt employee wages and prevent deductions from their wages for business losses and expenses not caused by the employee dishonest or willful acts or gross negligence,as to employees,swanson can pursue his claims for unlawful deductions from wages and unlawful business practices
