philip rosemann is a minority shareholder of,a closely held corporation.he filed this diversity action to enforce a stock redemption agreement,alleging that is obligated to purchase his shares of stock at their current fair market value.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of,concluding i that rosemann prior state court action under a missouri statute that protects shareholders who object to mergers created a res judicata bar to this action,and ii that the stock redemption agreement unambiguously established a purchase price of per share,the stock declared fair market value in when the agreement was signed.rosemann appeals these rulings.we conclude that res judicata does not bar claims under the stock redemption agreement,and that the price term in the agreement is ambiguous.accordingly,we reverse and remand.
i.the res judicata issue.
is a successful business that manufactures rotary dies.before the stock redemption agreement was signed in march,rosemann father gave shares of stock to rosemann and to each of his three siblings,leaving the parents owning of the outstanding shares.by the,after additional gifts,the father and each sibling owned shares.beginning in,family harmony evaporated.rosemann sister and one brother left the business and sold their shares to rosemann alleges they received far more than per share.after a falling out with his father and the remaining brother,rosemann gave up his position as chief operating officer and became an inactive,disaffected minority shareholder.in late,merged with micrometrics systems,a transaction that brought melvin stanley into management and shareholder group.after the merger,rosemann,his father,and his brother each owned shares,or of the stock.stanley owned the remaining.rosemann father has died his shares are now owned by a trust.since the micrometrics merger,rosemann has filed four lawsuits as a minority shareholder,seeking to force the controlling shareholders to purchase his shares for their current fair market value,which he alleges to be in excess of per share.the issue is whether any of the first three suits,which were filed in missouri state courts,raises a res judicata bar to this suit.
the first state court lawsuit sought to enforce rosemann statutory right,as a shareholder objecting to the micrometrics merger,to sell his shares to for their appraised fair value.see.stat.the state court rejected the claim because rosemann initially voted in favor of the merger.see rosemann.the district court concluded this suit created a res judicata bar to his claim under the stock redemption agreement.
the second state court lawsuit asserted various claims to remedy the alleged oppression of rosemann as a minority shareholder.the first nine counts sought relief consistent with his continuing role as minority shareholder such as involuntary liquidation.count x sought a declaratory judgment construing the stock redemption agreement.however,count x was dismissed without prejudice for lack of a justiciable controversy because rosemann had made no demand under the agreement that redeem his stock.some time later,the remaining claims were dismissed without prejudice for failure to prosecute.the third state court lawsuit was a pro se of most of the second suit,other than count x.when rosemann voluntarily dismissed this case,the court ordered that the dismissal be with prejudice,no doubt because he had dismissed these claims without prejudice in a prior lawsuit.see britton hamilton.
in february,following dismissal of the third state court action,rosemann made a written demand that redeem twenty shares of his stock under the stock redemption agreement.replied that the agreement does not permit a shareholder to redeem less than all his shares.rosemann then commenced this action,seeking damages for refusal to redeem twenty shares at their current fair market value.the district court concluded this suit is barred by res judicata because rosemann claim under the stock redemption agreement is merely a variant theory for the relief he sought in the first state court of his shares for their fair market value.we disagree.
we apply missouri res judicata principles in determining whether this action is barred by any of rosemann prior state court lawsuits.see harmon,browner,cir.rosemann did not assert a claim under the stock redemption agreement in those lawsuits except in count x of the second lawsuit,which was dismissed without prejudice.but the absence of such a claim is not dispositive because missouri courts apply res judicata to bar a claimant from splitting a single cause of action.see bethel missionary baptist church,louis builders.thus,we must determine whether the claim asserted under the stock redemption agreement in this lawsuit is part of the same cause of action that was asserted in any claim litigated in the first or the third state court lawsuits.it is not always easy to define the boundaries of a single cause of action for this purpose 
in general,the test for determining whether a cause of action is single and can not be split is whether separate actions brought arise out of the same act,contract or transaction or whether the parties,subject matter and evidence necessary to sustain the claim are the same in both actions.the word transaction has a broad meaning.it has been defined as the aggregate of all the circumstances which constitute the foundation for a claim.it also includes all of the facts and circumstances out of which an injury arose.

the district court concluded that the first state court lawsuit bars this action.in that lawsuit,rosemann attempted to invoke his statutory rights as a dissenting shareholder following the micrometrics merger.a shareholder who timely objects to a merger has a statutory right to be paid fair value for all his shares as of the day prior to the date on which the vote was taken approving the merger or consolidation.stat.if the dissenting shareholder and the surviving corporation do not agree on a purchase price,the shareholder may bring an action to recover his shares fair value as determined by the court.see.this cause of action requires proof of the shareholder timely objection to a specific merger transaction,and proof of fair value on a specific date.
by contrast,a claim under the stock redemption agreement is not triggered by or limited to a specific corporate transaction or time period.as this dispute illustrates,depending on how the agreement is interpreted,such a claim may or may not require sale of all the shareholder stock,and may or may not require proof of current fair market value.rosemann could have asserted his statutory rights as a dissenting shareholder and his contractual rights under the stock redemption agreement as alternative bases to redeem his shares for their fair market value after the micrometrics merger.but we can not agree that a contract claim under the agreement was merely a variant theory to his statutory cause of action under.stat.
one obvious reason why these claims are not part of a single cause of action is that rosemann made no demand under the stock redemption agreement prior to filing the first lawsuit.in general,res judicata does not bar claims that did not arise until after the first suit was filed.see wea crestwood plaza,flamers charburgers,baker group,burlington and santa fe ry,cir.responds that rosemann could easily have made a demand under the stock redemption agreement before filing the first lawsuit and then joined his claim under the agreement with his dissenting shareholder statutory claim.but res judicata does not extend as far as the rules of permissive joinder.the question is whether the two claims are a single cause of action.we think not.one arose out of a contract the other out of a merger.one requires proof of rosemann rights under a private contract the other proof of his rights under a missouri statute.
moreover,we think the district court application of res judicata is contrary to the purpose underlying.the statute is intended to protect dissenting shareholders from being injured by transac
