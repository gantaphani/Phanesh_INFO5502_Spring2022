the falconwood corporation falconwood appeals the ruling of the united states court of federal claims on for summary judgment that an affiliated group of corporations to which falconwood belonged did not survive the downstream merger of a common parent corporation into its subsidiary corporation,falconwood predecessor,because there did not remain after the merger one or more chains of includible corporations connected through stock ownership with a common parent that was a member of the group prior to the date the former parent ceased to exist.see falconwood united states.the court of federal claims determined that because the group did not survive the downstream merger under then existing law the group could not include in a final consolidated tax return losses incurred by falconwood predecessor subsequent to the merger.id.at.because we find to the contrary that the affiliated group survived the downstream merger of the former common parent corporation into falconwood predecessor,we reverse the court of federal claims ruling and remand for a determination of the tax refund due falconwood.
prior to the events of december,as described hereinafter,the mocatta group of affiliated corporations consisted of tmc holdings corporation,owned by henry jarecki and various trusts established for the jarecki children,and five subsidiaries.the group was organized as follows 
because the group was an affiliated group of corporations under a,it had filed consolidated tax returns since,based on an april fiscal year.in,the jarecki family decided to restructure the group ownership so that the surviving corporations could elect to be taxable under subchapter s of the internal revenue code code and thus have untaxed profits pass through to individual shareholders.see cameron comm r,wl when a corporation elects treatment under subchapter s,its net income earned as an s corporation is taxed currently to the shareholders and thereafter is generally distributed.
during the same year,however,congress passed the tax reform act of tra or act,stat,which among other things imposed a tax at the corporate level on gains when a corporation taxable under subchapter c of the code elects to be taxed under subchapter s and recognizes those gains within ten years of the election.see.gas compression,comm r,cir discussing the relevant section of the act and the purpose behind its passage.the tra applied to all subchapter s elections made after december.as a practical matter,the act placed the jarecki family on the clock,so to speak,by forcing them to elect to be taxed under subchapter s prior to december,if they were to avoid the tax consequences of the newly enacted tra.
on december,the jarecki family restructured the mocatta group.the diagram below depicts the three primary configurations of the a,b and c,respectively.
from the initial organization labeled configuration a,tmch merged downstream into falconwood.see harry henn john alexander,laws of corporations ed noting that a downstream merger describes the merger of a parent corporation into a subsidiary.at the time,falconwood held seats on various commodities exchanges,and the downstream merger of tmch into falconwood avoided the risk and delay incident to obtaining approval of a transfer of those seats from falconwood to tmch.rc also merged into falconwood,and wci was liquidated into mfc.a certificate of merger was filed in delaware at showing falconwood as the surviving parent corporation.the combination of these initial mergers and the liquidation gave rise to the structure of configuration 
fsc next paid a cash dividend of to falconwood at and also transferred to falconwood a note issued by jarecki in the amount of.mfc a dividend of million to falconwood at falconwood then sold the stock of mfc and fsc to the jarecki family.all that remained at the end of the day from the original mocatta group was falconwood,mfc and fsc,as shown in configuration c,each independently owned by the jarecki children and set up in such a way as to allow subchapter s elections effective january.
under the name the mocatta corporation subsidiaries formerly tmc holdings subsidiaries,falconwood ultimately filed a consolidated tax return as the common parent of the mocatta group for the period ending on march.the return covered falconwood operations for the entire period from april,to march,and those operations of mfc and fsc only from april,to december,the latter date being the date the mocatta group terminated.mfc and fsc covered the remainder of their from december,to march,separate individual tax returns.
some time after december,falconwood sustained a million loss.because falconwood operations through march,were covered on the mocatta group final consolidated return,falconwood offset the group income for the,and taxable years against its own loss,which led to a credit retroactive to and.in,falconwood filed amended returns,seeking refunds for those years.the internal revenue service subsequently determined that the mocatta group terminated on december,with the downstream merger of tmch into falconwood.it further determined that the group must file a final consolidated return for the short taxable year from april,to december,and that the three remaining,mfc and need to file individual returns for the period from december,to march.the decision thus precluded falconwood from offsetting mocatta group income with falconwood loss,resulting in increased tax liability for the group.
on july,falconwood brought suit in the court of federal claims for the refund of income taxes and interest erroneously and illegally assessed against and collected from it for the tax years to.joint app.at.on january,falconwood filed a second complaint covering the tax year.it argued in a motion for summary judgment of april,that the mocatta group survived the termination of tmch,the group former common parent,because the mocatta group succeeded to the assets of tmch,and both fsc and mfc remained connected as subsidiaries to the new common parent,falconwood,until the sale of fsc and mfc stock approximately three hours later.the government argued in its own motion for summary judgment of may,that the mocatta group compliance with the regulatory requirement that one or more chains of includible corporations connected with a common parent remain after the downstream merger must be judged at the conclusion of the reorganization,after the remaining corporations reached configuration 
ruling on the for summary judgment,the court of federal claims determined that the mocatta group did not survive the downstream merger because d,the regulation governing whether a group remains in existence for purposes of filing a consolidated tax return despite termination of the common parent,implied a temporal requirement not satisfied by the group short stay at configuration falconwood.at.in the alternative,the court applied the step transaction doctrine to the mocatta group reorganization and determined that the appropriate point in time to assess the nature of the transaction and to apply the tests conditioning the exception upon which plaintiff relies is at the conclusion of the restructuring transaction,id.at,thus effectively erasing configuration b from the reorganization.as explained below,without the court recognition of configuration b,falconwood did not satisfy the provisions of section and could not prevail.the court thus granted summary judgment in favor of the government.id.at.falconwood appeals.we have jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to a.
we review the summary judgment by the court of federal claims de novo.ammex,united states.summary judgment is appropriate where,examined in a light most favorable to the,the record indicates that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.fed.cl.c see also.c same.
an affiliated group of,one that includes or more chains of includible corporations connected through stock ownership with a common parent corporation which is an includible corporation,a,provided that certain other stock ownership requirements set forth in section a are advantage itself of the privilege of filing a consolidated return in lieu of separate returns for a taxable year if each corporation that has been a member of the group during any part of the taxable year covered by the consolidated return consents,a.at the time of the mocatta group reorganization,the consolidated return must have included the income of the common parent for that corporation entire taxable year and the income of each subsidiary for the portion of such taxable year during which it was a member of the group.b if the group so chose,however,and until it elected to discontinue filing consolidated returns pursuant to c,the group was required to file a consolidated return covering each successive year for which it remained in existence.see a a group which filed or was required to file a consolidated return for the immediately preceding taxable year is required to file a consolidated return for the taxable year unless it has an election to discontinue filing consolidated returns under paragraph c of this section.
at the time of the reorganization,a group shall be considered as remaining in existence if the common parent corporation remains as the common parent and at least one subsidiary remains affiliated with it,whether or not such subsidiary was a member of the group in a prior year and whether or not one or more corporations have ceased to be subsidiaries at any time after the group was formed.d section d ii provided an exception to this general rule where the common parent is no longer in existence but transfers all of its assets downstream to a subsidiary 
the group shall be considered as remaining in existence notwithstanding that the common parent is no longer in existence if the members of the affiliated group succeed to and become the owners of substantially all of the assets of such former parent and there remains one or more chains of includible corporations connected through stock ownership with a common parent corporation which is an includible corporation and which was a member of the group prior to the date such former parent ceases to exist.
d ii.this exception is squarely at issue in the present case.
because the mocatta group did in fact file a consolidated tax return for the taxable year immediately preceding the one at issue and did not elect to discontinue filing consolidated returns under c,the group was required by law to file a final consolidated return for the short taxable year from april,to december,that included the income of the common parent for that corporation entire taxable year and the income of each subsidiary for the portion of such taxable year during which it was a member of the group.prior to the december reorganization,mfc and fsc were subsidiaries.at the conclusion of the reorganization,however,the mocatta group no longer existed,and mfc and fsc were each s corporations.the operations of mfc and fsc from april,to december,were thus properly included in the final consolidated return,and their operations subsequent to december were included in separate individual tax returns.the more burdensome task before the court of federal claims was to identify the income of the common parent for that corporation entire taxable year,which pursuant to b was to be included in the mocatta group final consolidated tax return.
the question dispositive to that task is whether the mocatta group december,reorganization from configuration a to configuration b satisfied the exception of section d ii.if the mocatta group satisfied the requirements of section d ii and thus remained in existence through configuration b,then for purposes of the section b requirement that the final consolidated return include the income of the common parent for that corporation entire taxable year,the former common parent shall be deemed to continue in existence and shall be regarded as the common parent for the entire taxable year in which the acquisition occurs.b.the taxable year of the common product of the downstream would not end until march,and any loss sustained by that entity properly would be included in the consolidated tax return for the shortened tax year ending on december.if instead the mocatta group did not satisfy the exception in section d ii and thus did not remain in existence through configuration b,then tmch,the common parent,and its taxable year would terminate on december,when tmch itself merged downstream into falconwood and out of existence.in that case,any losses sustained by falconwood could not have been included in the group final consolidated tax return.
as discussed,the court of federal claims ruled that the mocatta group did not satisfy the section d ii exception.the court based its decision both on its interpretation of the terms there remains in the section and on an application of the step transaction doctrine to combine the several steps of the reorganization into a single transaction for purposes of determining tax liability.we address each in turn.
relying heavily on the decision of our predecessor court in union electric of missouri united states,the court of federal claims first determined that the existence of the subsidiaries mfc and fsc for approximately three hours after the downstream merger of tmch into falconwood did not satisfy the requirement of continuity,which the court of federal claims found to be rooted in the terms there remains in section d ii.falconwood.at opining that it is clear that the existence of subsidiaries for only three hours following the downstream merger does not satisfy the requirement of continuity from one year to the subsequent year,or continued existence,set forth in union electric.the court of federal claims thus determined that there remains requires the continued existence of at least one subsidiary in the status of a subsidiary from one year to the subsequent year.id.at quoting union,at.the court of federal claims reliance upon union electric was misplaced.
in union electric,the north american company north american was the common parent of a corporate group consisting of approximately eighty corporations engaged in a number of various business activities.at.beginning in,north american filed consolidated tax returns with its subsidiaries.id.during the years through,however,four subsidiary corporations in the north american chain were eligible,as regulated public utility that derive at least percent of their gross income excluding dividends and capital from certain utilities elect a special excess profits tax credit,provided in the excess profits tax act of epta.id.at.pursuant to the epta,north american was also eligible to and did join the subsidiaries in filing a consolidated tax return for the years through.id.at.the remaining corporations in the north american chain were not eligible for the tax credit and thus filed separate,individual tax returns covering those years.id.
in and,north american had no income from regulated public utility sources and was consequently precluded by the epta from joining the four public utility subsidiaries in filing a consolidated tax return for those years.id.north american ultimately joined with an entirely different group of subsidiaries to file consolidated tax returns.id.
the successor to north american later brought an action for the refund of overpayments of income tax,claiming that it was entitled to deduct from the consolidated net income of the north american utilities group in losses attributable to north american for the miscellaneous group of corporations that joined in filing consolidated tax returns in and.id.at.the question presented in union electric was thus whether a parent corporation was part of one affiliated group which remained continuously in operation during the years through or two separate affiliated groups,where no subsidiary corporation included on the consolidated tax return remained affiliated with the parent corporation during and.id.in other words,the court considered whether the group remained in existence through and solely by virtue of the fact that the common parent remained consistent throughout.
in determining that it did not,the court examined treasury regulations c and d,as promulgated in under the code 
consolidated returns for subsequent years 
c when affiliated group remains in existence.
for the purpose of these regulations,an affiliated group shall be considered as remaining in existence if the common parent corporation remains as a common parent and at least one subsidiary remains affiliated with it,whether or not such subsidiary was a member of the group at the time the group was formed and whether or not one or more corporations have become subsidiaries or have ceased to be subsidiaries at any time after the group was formed.
d when affiliated group terminates.
for the purpose of these regulations,an affiliated group shall be considered as terminated if the common parent corporation ceases to be the common parent or there is no subsidiary affiliated with it.
the court first noted that the prescriptions of subsections c and d are provided only to determine whether an affiliated group of corporations that files a consolidated return in one year continues in existence to the subsequent year for purposes of determining whether the group is required to file a consolidated return covering operations during the subsequent year.at they do not purport to define the composition of the group or the existence of the group generally.the court next determined that the word remains in the regulations required that at least one of the affiliated corporations constituting subsidiaries in remained affiliated with the parent corporation in and in order for the group in to continue in existence through the subsequent two years.id.at.because none did,the court held that the carrybacks claimed by the successor to north american were not allowable.id.at.
the question posed to the court in union electric is therefore quite distinct from that now before this court.the union electric court interpretation of remains to require the continued existence of at least one subsidiary from one year to the next was very much appropriate in light of the context of the regulation from which the term came,a regulation promulgated to define whether or not an affiliated group on whole continues in existence from one year to the next.that regulation necessarily contemplates a comparison only of the physical of a group of corporations from one year to the next and was part of a regulatory scheme that contained no downstream merger exception to the rules then governing whether an affiliated group remained in existence.the regulation at issue here contemplates an altogether different comparison of the of a group as it exists both prior to and subsequent to a downstream merger of the former common parent corporation into its subsidiaries.we therefore can not impute so easily the union electric court from one year to the subsequent year interpretation to there remains in section d ii.
without dispositive benefit from union electric,the government is left to argue that the three hours in which the group remained after the downstream merger of tmch into falconwood simply does not suffice under the regulation.indeed,in its brief,the government recognizes that some passage of time would be enough to save the consolidated group,and that a close case may one day arise which calls for a more precise line between where enough time succeeds and not enough time fails.appellee br.at.but the government concludes that this is not such a case.id.we can not agree that there is any principled difference between the time period in this case and the passage of days or weeks or months in some other case where there could be no reasonable doubt about the satisfaction of the there remains test.
because the government chose not to define in section d ii more expressly the temporal span of there remains,we think it inappropriate to accord the terms anything more than their plain meaning.see gould gould.in the interpretation of statutes levying taxes it is the established rule not to enlarge their operations so as to embrace matters not specifically pointed out.in case of doubt they are construed most strongly against the government,and in favor of the citizen.int l.united states,consolidated return regulations are legislative in character and have the force and effect of law.to remain is to continue unchanged in form,condition,status,or quantity continue to be.webster third new international dictionary ed see also the american heritage dictionary of the english language ed.to continue in the same state or condition to be left after the removal,loss,passage,or destruction of others.
though the ordinary meaning of the word remain when considered in the context of section d ii clearly forecloses the sufficiency of a simultaneous transaction to maintain a group existence,it also presupposes no particular passage of time,no requirement that something continues to be for three hours.rather,the plain meaning of the regulation requires only that there continues to be after the downstream merger one or more chains of includible corporations connected through stock ownership with a common parent corporation that was a member of the group prior to the date the former parent corporation ceased to exist.in keeping with that meaning,we hold on the facts of this case that because falconwood was a member of the mocatta group prior to the date tmch ceased to exist and became the owner of substantially all of the assets of tmch,and because both mfc and fsc remained connected through stock ownership to falconwood after tmch downstream merger,albeit only for several hours,the downstream merger here sufficed to preserve the group existence through configuration 
we next turn our attention to the application by the court of federal claims of the step transaction doctrine to collapse the mocatta group reorganization into a single step from configuration a to configuration 
the step transaction doctrine is a judicial manifestation of the more general tax law ideal that effect should be given to the substance,rather than the form,of a transaction,by ignoring for tax purposes,steps of an integrated transaction that separately are without substance.dietzsch united states,see also king,united states,c ourts have enunciated a variety of doctrines,such as step transaction,business purpose,and substance over form.although the various doctrines overlap and it is not always clear in a particular case which one is most appropriate,their common premise is that the substantive realities of a transaction determine its tax consequences.the supreme court has expressly sanctioned the step transaction doctrine,noting that interrelated yet formally distinct steps in an integrated transaction may not be considered independently of the overall transaction.comm r clark,d see also comm r court holding.to permit the true nature of a transaction to be disguised by mere formalisms,which exist solely to alter tax liabilities,would seriously impair the effective administration of the tax policies of congress.griffiths helvering.taxes can not be escaped by anticipatory arrangements and contracts however skillfully devised by which the fruits are attributed to a different tree from that on which they grew.quoting lucas earl.tea helvering.a given result at the end of a straight path is not made a different result because reached by following a devious path.gregory helvering.we too have noted that the objective of the doctrine is to give tax effect to the substance,as opposed to the form of a transaction,by ignoring for tax purposes,steps of an integrated transaction that separately are without substance.dietzsch,at.
though there is no universal test applicable to step transaction situations,king,at,courts generally have enunciated three basic tests that define the criteria upon which application of the step transaction doctrine interdependence test,the end result test,and the binding commitment test.the interdependence test requires an inquiry as to whether the steps were so interdependent that the legal relations created by one transaction would have been fruitless without a completion of the series.id.quotation marks omitted.the end result test examines whether it appears that separate transactions were really component parts of a single transaction
