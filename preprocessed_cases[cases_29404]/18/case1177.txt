confronting the verisimilitude of american life,death and taxes,this appeal asks us to decide a recurring issue of asset valuation for estate tax purposes and whether a agreement meets the requirements of a tax code exception to the general rule.the estate of blount was required to sell bount shares when he died,and blount family business owned an insurance policy to ensure that it would have sufficient liquidity to accomplish the contractual buyout.we affirm the tax court determination that the agreement does not fall within the statutory exception,which would allow the parties to conclusively establish the value of the corporation for taxation purposes at an agreed upon purchase price.because the tax court should not have added the insurance proceeds to the value of the corporation when calculating its fair market value,we reverse the court computation of that value.
background 
blount construction company bcc is a closely held georgia corporation that constructs roads and similar projects for private entities and georgia municipalities.in,the corporation only shareholders,william blount and james jennings,and bcc entered into a agreement that required shareholder consent to transfer stock and established that bcc would purchase the stock on the death of the holder at a price agreed upon by the parties or,in the event that there is no agreement,for a purchase price based on the book value of the corporation.
in the early,bcc purchased insurance policies solely for the purpose of ensuring that the business could continue operations,while fulfilling its commitments to purchase stock under the agreement.these policies would provide roughly million,respectively,for the repurchasing of jennings and blount stock.in,bcc also began an employee stock ownership program esop to which the company made annual contributions,either by purchasing stock from blount and jennings or by new issuances.annual valuations were completed by a third party to facilitate the esop purchases.for example,as of january,bcc was valued at roughly million 
in january,jennings died owning of bcc outstanding shares.bcc received about million from the insurance proceeds,and paid a little less than million to jennings estate.bcc used the previous year book value to determine the amount to be paid to jennings estate.
in october,blount was diagnosed with cancer,and his doctor predicted only a few months to live.concerned that the buyout requirement of the agreement would deprive bcc of the liquidity it needed to function,he commissioned several studies regarding the amount of money his estate could receive for his shares and still leave the company in a healthy financial condition.apparently,blount was not concerned about his family,because they were wealthy independent of the proceeds from the sale of his bcc stock.
in november,blount executed an amendment to the agreement that bound himself and bcc to exchange million for the shares that blount owned at his death the agreement was substantially similar to the subsection in the agreement regarding the purchase of shares upon the death of the holder.unlike the agreement,however,the agreement did not provide for future price adjustments in accordance with book value,which functionally locked the price at the january value of bcc.the agreement also differed from the agreement by removing the ability of bcc to pay its obligation in installments.
when blount died in september,he owned shares,or roughly of bcc.bcc paid million to the estate of blount taxpayer in november of that year in accordance with the november,shareholders agreement.
in,the taxpayer filed a return declaring million as the value of the shares,and the irs filed a notice of deficiency claiming that the stock was worth.implicit in this valuation of blount shares is a claim that bcc fair market value exceeded million.the tax court held that the agreement,as modified by the amendment,was to be disregarded for the purpose of determining the value of the shares.estate of blount comm r,wl.the court also held that the amount of tax should have been calculated by adding the insurance proceeds to the other assets of bcc in order to arrive at the fair market value of the corporation.id.at.
three experts testified concerning the value of the stock.first,john grizzle was offered by the taxpayer solely on the issue of comparability,that is,whether the method and result of valuing bcc in the amendment was comparable to the method and results within the industry.he concluded it was,because construction companies that engaged in arm length negotiations had recently been valued in the industry at four times their adjusted cash flow.averaging five years of bcc cash flows,grizzle determined that bcc was worth roughly million.because blount owned of the company,grizzle determined that bcc should have paid million for blount stock.the tax court found that no weight could be given to grizzle valuation estimate because he only used a cash flow approach and failed to account for bcc large nonoperating assets.id.at.
on the issue of the fair market value of bcc,each party offered one expert.the irs expert,james hitchner,concluded that the company was worth million,and the taxpayer expert,gerald fodor,computed the value at million.both experts used a blend of and approaches to determine fair market value,as opposed to grizzle cash approach,which also focused only on the issue of comparability.
fodor determined that the value of the company was million and that the value was million,which he blended at a ratio of.this resulted in fodor million estimate.the tax court noted in passing that fodor did not account for the insurance proceeds,nor did he account for the premium usually associated with a controlling interest in a company id.at.the tax court,nonetheless,adopted fodor estimate as a starting point.
hitchner determined that the value of bcc was in the range of to million and that the value ranged from to million over two years.hitchner then weighted the value over the value in an undisclosed ratio to establish his value for bcc at million.hitchner,unlike fodor,determined that the million in proceeds of the life insurance policy should then be added to the base value.hitchner set the value of bcc at million.
the tax court began with fodor estimate but concluded that the expert should not have offset the value by the esop buyout which fodor made a downward that bcc,therefore,was worth million.the court found that hitchner overvalued bcc cash reserves and that,when this overvaluation was corrected,hitchner analysis also would value the company near million.thus,the tax court concluded that both experts essentially reached the same base value for the corporation.
taking this base value of million,the tax court found that the proper value of the stock was million,adding the insurance proceeds of million to compute the fair market value of the company.id.at.this meant that the value of blount stock for estate tax purposes was million,but the tax court limited the amount assessed to the value determined by the irs in its original notice of deficiency,that is,just less than million.id.as a result of the tax court valuation of the bcc stock,additional taxes of approximately million were paid by the taxpayer to cover the deficiency.
