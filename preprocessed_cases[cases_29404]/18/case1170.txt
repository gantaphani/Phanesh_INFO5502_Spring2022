procedural history 
on september,willard filed suit under the fela,against his employer,fairfield,and its parent company,bsrr,for injuries that he allegedly incurred at work.willard filed a motion for partial summary judgment,and fairfield and bsrr filed motions for summary judgment.several months later,willard filed a rule f motion to reopen discovery because he learned that the federal railroad administration fra was investigating whether fairfield was within its jurisdiction.the district court reopened discovery at willard request,and thereafter twice extended the time for reopened discovery because the fra did not rule on the fairfield matter in a timely fashion.by march,when the fra had still not ruled on the matter,the district court took the motions for summary judgment under submission with the evidentiary material available as of that date.
in their motion for summary judgment,fairfield and bsrr argued that fairfield is an railroad not subject to the fela that fairfield is not the alter ego of bsrr and in any event,willard was judicially estopped from pursuing any claims under the fela because he already had accepted full medical benefits under the alabama workers compensation act plus indemnity payments for his alleged injuries.willard countered in his motion for summary judgment that fairfield is subject to the fela because it,like bsrr,is a common carrier by rail engaged in interstate commerce.willard also claimed that his suit against bsrr was appropriate because fairfield was bsrr alter ego.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of fairfield and bsrr,finding that fairfield is a private carrier,not a common carrier subject to the fela.the district court also found that fairfield is not the alter ego of bsrr.in light of its findings and conclusions,the district court declined to consider fairfield and bsrr estoppel argument.willard filed a timely appeal.
while willard appeal from the district court order on summary judgment was pending,he filed a rule b motion to set aside final summary judgment,asserting that a letter from the fra was newly discovered evidence which entitled him to relief from the court prior summary judgment order.the district court requested briefing on the motion,then conducted oral argument on the matter.following argument,the district court denied willard rule b motion,finding that the fra letter did not change its prior finding that fairfield is a private carrier not subject to the fela.willard also appeals this order.
whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment to fairfield and bsrr because it found that fairfield is a private carrier not subject to the fela and that fairfield is not the alter ego of bsrr.
whether the district court abused its discretion in denying willard rule b motion.
