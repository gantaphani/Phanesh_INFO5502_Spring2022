introduction 
defendants richard gold,emily gold mears,and jean gold friedman,appeal from a july,order appointing a limited purpose receiver to market and sell real property which was the subject of a september,judgment entered by now retired judge richard harris.we affirm the july,order because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in appointing a limited purpose receiver to enforce the terms of the september,judgment ordering the marketing and the sale of the property.
ii.background 
the parties in this action are relatives who own shares in three closely held real estate corporations gold realty company gold incorporated and essex corporation.the corporations were formed by the family patriarch,morris gold,who was the husband of julia and the father of richard and ruth.ruth married charles gold.prior to his marriage to ruth,charles was not a member of the gold family.ruth and charles had two sons robert and david.richard and his wife harriet had two daughters,jean gold friedman and emily gold mears.julia died on november.morris died on april.
morris was a highly successful businessperson,who started out in the furniture business in the.he subsequently acquired considerable real estate which composed the assets of the three corporations.beginning in the,richard and charles participated in the management of the corporations.in,richard decided to return to graduate school.richard then stopped assisting morris in running the corporations.in,charles stopped working for the family business and richard returned.the family members were not allowed to draw salaries from the corporations.the profits were reinvested in the corporations.after morris died,richard ran the corporations with the assistance of an outside management company.
the family members owned all the shares of stock.prior to morris death,richard family and charles family owned equal shares of stock in the corporations.morris died on april,and left a will.in the will,morris left a larger portion of the estate to richard family.as a result,charles family owned percent of the shares of the corporations.richard family owned percent of the shares.this uneven split was the result of morris displeasure with some members of charles family.morris apparently felt that charles did not work hard enough.morris also did not approve of the woman a grandson,robert,had chosen to marry.morris also felt that robert was an unconcerned and unloving grandchild.morris disinherited charles and ruth.robert was initially disinherited by morris.but later,in,robert was reinstated as a beneficiary in morris will.
in,prior to morris death,the stockholders morris,richard,harriet,charles,ruth,jean,emily,david and robert of gold incorporated executed voting trust agreements for the three corporations.as part of the agreements,the shareholders agreed that richard had the exclusive right to vote all corporate shares for up to years.in,two of the corporations,essex corporation and gold realty company,were converted from subchapter c corporations to subchapter s corporations.the conversions avoided double taxation of corporate earnings.in addition,the change resulted in the family shareholders receiving dividends for the first time.
after morris died in,charles family refused to convert the third corporation,gold incorporated,to subchapter s corporation status.richard family and charles family become embroiled in litigation over the operation of the corporations.as noted previously,when morris died in,the corporations were being managed by richard.on february,plaintiffs,charles gold,ruth gold,charles gold,the ruth gold family trust,robert gold,and david gold,filed suit action against defendants for involuntary dissolution of the corporations and for damages based on numerous tort theories.it is this lawsuit which nearly one decade later that is the subject of this appeal.named as plaintiffs in the february,complaint were charles,his spouse ruth,and their sons robert and david.plaintiffs prevailed only on the cause of action for involuntary dissolution of the corporations.former judge harris found that the corporations had been adequately run and that richard had not been guilty of fraud or mismanagement.however,former judge harris concluded that richard had been operating a show which had resulted in persistent unfairness to plaintiffs.in order to protect the rights and interests of plaintiffs,former judge harris ordered dissolution of the three corporations pursuant to corporations code section,subdivision b and.former judge harris ordered that gold incorporated be dissolved within one year.however,to avoid adverse tax consequences,former judge harris ordered that dissolution of the two subchapter s corporations,essex corporation and gold realty company,be delayed until january,and july,respectively.former judge harris retained jurisdiction until the dissolutions and liquidations contemplated herein have been fully consummated.
richard was allowed to remain as president of the corporations but each entity board of directors would include one director to represent both plaintiffs and defendants.under the terms of the september,judgment,an independent third director could be chosen by agreement or appointment of the trial court.the september,judgment provided in part during the period prior to the liquidation of defendants gold realty company,gold incorporated and essex corporation,the corporations shall be operated in the following manner c the board of directors of each corporation shall be comprised of three directors richard gold,or one member from his family charles gold,or one member from his family and an individual who shall be agreed upon by both the richard gold family and the charles gold family.this individual shall serve as a director until the next annual certificate holder meeting.if the richard gold family and the charles gold family at any time can not agree upon the third director,such director shall be appointed by the court upon application duly made and noticed the above described procedure for the election of three directors for each of the corporations shall be repeated annually until the board of directors of that corporation is disbanded upon the conclusion of corporate dissolution and distribution of the proceeds to all certificate holders 
at issue in this case is whether a subsequent appointment of a receiver to accomplish the dissolution of two of the corporations was appropriate.in that respect,the september,judgment itself does not appoint a receiver.however,in rendering the september,dissolution judgment,former judge harris adopted his findings and conclusions contained in a tentative decision dated may,which were adopted by him in his statement of decision on may.in the may,tentative statement of decision,former judge harris stated,the court expressly rejects the idea of appointing a receiver for the s corporations,or either of them,at this time.italics added.however,the september,judgment provides,jurisdiction is expressly retained in this court until the dissolutions and liquidations contemplated herein have been fully consummated.notices of appeal and were filed on october and,respectively from the september,judgment.in an unpublished opinion,we affirmed the judgment in all respects.gold gold realty company,nonpub.opn.
both sides subsequently agreed that fred nicholas,a nonpracticing lawyer with real estate experience would become the third director.while nicholas was a director,two pieces of three real estate properties owned by gold incorporated were sold.however,after serving two years,at the request of members of plaintiffs family,nicholas resigned amid acrimony over the sale of the remaining parcel owned by gold incorporated.
plaintiffs then filed a motion for appointment of one of five retired jurists as the third director of the corporations.retired associate justice john zebrowski was appointed as the third director.however,retired associate justice zebrowski would only agree to the appointment subject to stipulations by the parties including that his appointment was as a reference pursuant to code of civil procedure section with judicial immunity.the parties also had to agree not to sue retired associate justice zebrowski.
the acrimony between the two families,however,did not cease with retired associate justice zebrowski appointment.rather,richard,the director aligned with defendants,disagreed on a number of issues,including whether retired associate justice zebrowski was actually reelected as a director at the annual stockholders meetings in may.in april,the matter had deteriorated to the point that defense counsel wrote a letter to retired associate justice zebrowski objecting to his continued service as the third director.the letter stated in part richard and his family will not agree to your retired associate justice zebrowski continued service as the third director at the annual meeting this year.if the charles gold family disagrees,that opposition may well result in litigation.you would necessarily be personally involved in such future litigation.as you are aware,the two families have already experienced lengthy and costly litigation 
on may,defendants filed a motion for an order appointing a third director for gold realty company and essex corporation.defendants argued that the third director should be an experienced real estate professional who was equipped to make timely business decisions on the merits of proposed sales rather than someone like retired associate justice zebrowski.defendants nominated eight real estate executives.on june,plaintiffs sought clarification of the duration of the order appointing retired associate justice zebrowski as director and an order providing that he would continue to carry out his duties until completion of the corporate liquidations.
on july,judge linda lefkowitz found that the september,judgment required the annual election of directors and that the parties were unable to agree on a third director.judge lefkowitz further found that the september,judgment empowered the court to appoint a director in the event that the parties could not agree on the third director.judge lefkowitz then exercised her discretion to reappoint retired associate justice zebrowski to act as the third director.after having been threatened with a legal action against his personal assets,retired associate justice zebrowski subsequently declined to serve when defendants would not agree to a stipulation giving him judicial or immunity.
on september,defendants filed an additional motion requesting a real estate professional be appointed as the corporations third director.in november,judge lefkowitz denied the motion and ordered that a nominee submitted by plaintiffs,retired associate justice richard neal,be appointed as the third director.in so doing,judge lefkowitz indicated she had reviewed the pleadings and heard extensive arguments on the disadvantages and advantages of a real estate executive versus a retired judicial officer to serve as the third director.after weighing the merits of each position,judge lefkowitz exercised her discretion to appoint retired associate justice neal to be the third director.the parties were also ordered to obtain directors liability insurance to protect retired associate justice neal.
as of january,no directors liability insurance could be found.in addition,defendants renewed their claim that a real estate professional rather than a retired court of appeal justice serve as the third director.this was based on the delay in retired associate justice neal appointment due to negotiations between the parties over the liability protections that should be afforded him for acting as the third director.plaintiffs indicated that they were willing to agree to retired associate justice neal request for immunity.at a february,hearing,judge lefkowitz indicated that,contrary to defendants request,she was unwilling to reconsider the ruling appointing retired associate justice neal rather than a more experienced real estate professional.in addition,judge lefkowitz refused to address plaintiffs request to comply with retired associate justice neal requirement that he be provided immunity.instead,judge lefkowitz urged the parties to reach an amicable settlement and set the matter for a status conference on april.
at the april,status conference,judge lefkowitz requested briefing on the issue of whether retired associate justice neal should be appointed as a receiver.judge lefkowitz indicated that she had read the status reports from both plaintiffs and defendants.judge lefkowitz then stated while i be more than happy to hear from both sides,i must tell you,having wrestled with this issue all weekend after looking at the status conference statements,i am,somewhat intent this morning is to set this some point in june for time for both parties to argue at some length whether,given everything that has occurred in this i will not put forth on the record today at this point out it is appropriate for this court to appoint a receiver.
after defense counsel suggested that the statutory issue should be addressed,judge lefkowitz continued i know you have done that in great part but i certainly do want to undertake the kind of action noted you used the term drastic.that term has been used by the courts.it is something that the court does not reach easily but it is,of course,an option where,when the court has not had any success in utilizing a provisional,of course,i think speaks for itself at this point.i do know any way else to effect former judge harris order.my recollection of his order was that he declined to impose a receivership upon these corporations,and he used the term yet.i think the yet may well have arrived.there are parties here who,despite urgings of this court,as well as the california court of appeal,appear absolutely disposed not to cooperate in any meaningful way with each other on issues that i think,as have other courts,pertain to the ultimate peace of these families.and i see no way to impose the sale of the least,at this former judge harris ordered be sold,while providing a protection that the person charged with assisting in that is entitled to,without imposing something greater than a provisional directorship.i just do see any mechanism for effecting voluntary agreement between these two families.judge lefkowitz continued the matter to june,to allow the parties to brief the issue of whether a receiver should be appointed.
defendants opposed the appointment of retired associate justice neal as the receiver of the corporations.the opposition was based on the grounds the september,judgment did not authorize the appointment of a receiver the superior court lacked the authority to appoint a receiver except as expressly set forth by section and no circumstances justifying appointment of a receiver under section existed.richard stated in a declaration the appointment of a receiver would have a substantial,deleterious effect on the selling price on the remaining properties left to be sold.this opinion was based on his experience in operating,purchasing,and selling real properties because a receivership connotes a distress situation.defendants also argued retired associate justice neal should not be appointed as a receiver.defendants reasoned retired associate justice neal had never been a receiver of commercial and industrial realty,which would require assistance,causing additional delay and expenses.according to defendants,the corporations were not deadlocked and the properties were regularly being sold at prices in excess of their appraised values.richard declared that the remaining corporations owned different properties,of which were effectively disposed of as follows sales closed and the proceeds had been distributed properties were in escrow sales contract was out for signature and since retired associate justice zebrowski resigned,richard and david had jointly approved sales without the assistance of a third director.according to richard,there were particular problems related to the sale of three of the remaining properties.the first property involved a parking space issue.the second parcel involved a problem with the city of lynwood issuing a request for proposal for the development of the property.the third property was a shopping center in panorama city which was only leased.
plaintiffs requested retired associate justice neal be appointed as a receiver.plaintiffs argued that the trial court had the authority to exercise discretion to appoint a receiver under section,subdivisions b,and.david declared that only percent of the entire value of property had been sold it was a strong seller market that accounted for the high selling prices and not richard efforts and richard refused to present a meaningful marketing plan for listing properties in the panorama city shopping center that comprise half the corporations value.david reiterated the long history of contentiousness between the parties over whether he was improperly denied access to the properties,information,and documents.
plaintiffs attached a number of documents from the former director,retired associate justice zebrowski,outlining specific disputes between the parties.one such dispute is outlined in a july,letter from retired associate justice zebrowski to richard which states in part at the last board meeting,the board voted with richard dissenting to contract for restricted appraisals of the three essex properties.it was my understanding that dennis ellman would hire and interface with the appraiser.i considered this advisable in view of richard opposition to having appraisals done,and david continuing reports of lack of information.it has since been suggested to me that richard has taken charge of hiring and interfacing with the appraiser.i am concerned that this may create further delay.david declared that the special problems created with respect to the three properties had been created by richard.according to david,richard refused to investigate concerns raised by david about the parking spaces with the respect to the first property failed to list and begin marketing the lynwood property in september as suggested by retired associate justice zebrowski,which issued the request for proposal in november and refused to present a plan to increase occupancy of the shopping center or to obtain appraisals.
the parties provided widely conflicting explanations as to the causes for the delays.richard claimed to have met informally with david in an effort to address various questions and concerns.richard declared that he had not refused to schedule board meetings david had prevented a meeting from commencing by leaving the conference room before the session could be called to order the board had acted to resolve numerous issues david had regularly approved richard proposals for sales of the properties richard had not unreasonably limited david access to records and information because of past unpleasantries,richard would not permit david to be alone while reviewing files and thousands of documents had been copied for david.the parties also disputed a number of other issues,including whether richard refused to allow the board to determine the amount of reserves and distributions to shareholders.according to richard,he only determined cash distributions in accordance with a formula adopted by a board resolution in.david attended a meeting to determine reserves in december,and approved the recommendation.david pointed out in his declaration that the november resolution had been adopted by richard and a daughter before the judgment was final.david denied approving richard recommendation but had requested more information to support the recommendation to the board of directors.
as an additional example of how much animosity existed between the parties,in their papers,they each reiterated a conflict surrounding the circumstances of the sale of building.richard declared that,in april,he presented a highly favorable proposed sale of building to the other directors.the property had been appraised at but a buyer,a tenant of the building had offered.david declared that richard had entered into this agreement without considering potentially valuable signage rights.richard called the signage right argument overblown.as of april,the property was in escrow at a more than the original offer.
on june,in the face of the ever widening conflict between the parties,judge lefkowitz heard arguments on whether it was necessary to appoint a receiver in order to effect the dissolution of the corporations as ordered by former judge harris in the september,judgment,which had been affirmed by us on april.on june,judge lefkowitz issued her ruling appointing retired associate justice neal as a limited receiver.judge lefkowitz ruled the court has power to modify a judgment to effect its ends and carry the judgment into effect.the appointment of a receiver is undertaken only in circumstances where other available remedies are or have been shown to be inadequate.see city and county of san francisco daley th,d.a court has inherent equitable power to appoint a receiver on its own motion where essential to accomplish a judicial objective.code of civil procedure section,subdivision b corporations code,sections,mccarthy poulsen d.mccarthy is particularly appropriate when applied to the circumstances in the instant case the resignation of a trustee who could not be replaced since,despite efforts by the parties and the court,no one would consent to become a successor trustee for fear of incurring personal liability.a court may appoint a limited purpose receiver,leaving the parties to operate remaining aspects of a business.see,raff raff cal d.moreover,it is noted,albeit without citation,in weil and brown,civil procedure before trial,section that a limited purpose receiver,may even be given a different title so as not to upset business relationships.this court has been presented with a tentative decision issued in may,and judgment dated september,requiring,inter alia,that three corporations liquidate their assets and dissolve.recognizing tax implications involving the liquidation and dissolution,the court set forth a schedule for completion of the provisions of the judgment richard gold has submitted through counsel the minutes of the shareholder and board of director meetings of the involved corporations which appear to reflect that only essex and gold realty company,have remaining properties.gold incorporated,has,in fact,dissolved.gold realty company owns the majority of remaining properties.in relevant portion,the judgment required that liquidation and dissolution of essex corporation be completed by january essex target date that liquidation and dissolution of gold realty company,be completed by july gold realty target date these deadlines have not been met.the minutes reflect various reasons presented by defendant richard gold why the involved property sales have not occurred.plaintiffs disagree with the explanation for delay in sales as to those sales most recently completed,a review of the record reflects that retired associate justice zebrowski,who served as the most recent provisional director,was the moving force in the majority of the sales.the record equally reflects that,as has been the case for over a decade,the parties appear unable to reconcile their differences to accomplish the liquidation and dissolution process without court intervention.two appointed provisional directors have declined to continue their appointed positions.the second,honorable john zebrowski,retired,did so amid concerns imposed by memoranda and letters from the richard gold family that he might be the subject of a tort action.faced with the families inability to agree upon a new provisional director,the court appointed the honorable richard neal,retired.the parties have been unable to agree upon any contractual protection for retired associate justice neal against suit there is no insurer willing to provide errors and omissions protection.defendants response is that two of their past nominees for director have expressed a willingness to serve without contractual protection.there are no declarations to that effect not surprisingly,in the context of this litigation,plaintiffs are equally opposed to defendants nominees.in sum,under circumstances analogous to the mccarthy case,the court has been unable to appoint a provisional director.the parties seem unable to do other than obstruct each other at every turn.the liquidation process is well beyond its completion date and negotiations for the sale of the remaining properties are not progressing.for these reasons,and in aid of and enforcement of the already untimely liquidation and dissolution of essex corporation and gold realty company,the court modifies the judgment and appoints retired associate justice neal as receiver for the property currently held by the two corporate entities.only in this manner can the court afford the requisite personal liability protection which is necessary to fulfill a neutral role in the court enforcement of the prior orders,rulings and judgment issued.jun myers th,f d.
on july,judge lefkowitz issued an order appointing retired associate justice neal as the receiver to market and sell the remaining corporate properties.on august,defendants filed a notice of appeal from the order appointing retired associate justice neal as a receiver.on august,we denied defendants request for an immediate stay of enforcement of judge lefkowitz july,order appointing a receiver.on august,we denied defendants motions for stay and to reduce the undertaking required by section pending disposition on appeal.because of the delays to date,this case was granted a california rules of court,rule calendar preference.with the parties consent,no extensions of time to file briefs were granted.
iii.discussion 
introduction 
the issue in this case is whether judge lefkowitz properly appointed a limited receiver to market and sell the properties remaining in the two corporations which are subject to a september,dissolution judgment.defendants argue we must reverse the order appointing the receiver to market and sell the corporate property on the grounds judge lefkowitz lacked authority to appoint a receiver authority to substantively modify the judgment and jurisdiction to appoint a receiver when a legal remedy of appointing a third director of the corporations was adequate.we respectfully disagree with defendants contentions.
jurisdiction to appoint a receiver 
there is statutory authority for appointing a receiver to enforce the terms of the september,dissolution judgment.section provides in part a a receiver may be appointed,in the manner provided in this chapter,by the court in which an action or proceeding is pending in any case in which the court is empowered by law to appoint a receiver.b a receiver may be appointed by the court in which an action or proceeding is pending,or by a judge thereof,in the following cases after judgment,to carry the judgment into effect.after judgment,to dispose of the property according to the judgment,or to preserve it during the pendency of an appeal,or pursuant to the enforcement of judgments of law title commencing with section,or after sale of real property pursuant to a decree of foreclosure,during the redemption period,to collect,expend,and disburse rents as directed by the court or otherwise provided by law.the plain language of the code of civil procedure gives the superior court power to appoint a receiver after judgment for two purposes.first,a receiver can be appointed to carry the judgment into effect,subd.b.second,a receiver may be appointed to depose of property according to the previously entered judgment,subd.b.in essence,a receiver may be appointed to enforce a judgment.weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group,ii.in order to carry the september,dissolution judgment into effect,judge lefkowitz clearly had the authority under section,subdivision b and to appoint a receiver to dispose of the properties.see city and county of san francisco,supra,th at,d.
more specifically,the corporations code section gives the superior court jurisdiction over an action for the involuntary dissolution of a corporation.the powers granted to the superior court include the appointment of a receiver upon the filing of a complaint for dissolution of the corporation,chapin gritton d.and,once a decree of dissolution has been made,the court has broad powers to make such orders and decrees in the case as justice and equity require.
whether judge lefkowitz had the jurisdiction to appoint a receiver when the september,judgment did not do so 
defendants contend that judge lefkowitz only authority was to appoint a third director.defendants reason judge lefkowitz lacked the authority to appoint retired associate justice neal because former judge harris september,judgment does not authorize the appointment of a receiver.as noted above,the september,judgment ordered the dissolution of the three corporations owned by the parties.however,in order to avoid adverse tax consequences,the september,judgment also delayed dissolution of the two s corporations.as previously noted,with respect to the issue of a receivership over the dissolution process,the statement of decision provides the court expressly rejects the idea of appointing a receiver for the s corporations,or either of them,at this time.italics added.however,as previously explained,the september,judgment also states,jurisdiction is expressly retained in this court until the dissolutions and liquidations contemplated herein have been fully consummated.in an analogous situation,the california supreme court has noted t he court may change the mode or procedure in executing its decrees although the decree specifies a particular method.the time for performance specified in the decree may be extended.gibson river farms d.there is a clear distinction between material adjudicated portions of a judgment or decree,and mere procedural matters incident to the determined issues,which are incorporated as the proposed means of fulfilling the judgment.it has been held in california that when a decree or judgment reserves jurisdiction to change or modify mere procedural provisions,as distinguished from material adjudications of substantial issues,it is not an abuse of discretion for the court to extend the time limit.citations in los angeles superior court,the time for making a designated payment was extended five successive times.it was held that these orders did not constitute a material change in substantial adjudicated portions of the judgment,but that they merely applied to procedural matters intended to accomplish the enforcement of the judgment and constituted a valid exercise of jurisdiction retained by the court.lesser son seymour cal d,see dennis overholtzer d.los angeles superior court,supra.at.by contrast,jurisdiction may not be retained to materially change the adjudication of substantial issues.bernardi city council th,fn,d palo alto menlo park yellow cab santa clara county transit dist.d.orban lumber fearrien d.
it has been held that a superior court order directing a receiver to sell property that is subject to a decree of dissolution or liquidation is merely procedural and does not affect the substantive rights of the parties.lesser son seymour,supra,cal d at,marsch williams th,d.as the california supreme court explained in lesser son seymour,supra,cal d at page,we are satisfied that a court in an equity proceeding has the power to change the manner of sale of property in its custody by a receiver appointed by it from that previously prescribed by it in the order directing the sale,and in that connection may make the sale itself although the prior order called for it to be made by the receiver.in effect,the directions in the order of sale with regard to the manner in which it should be made,are merely instructions to the procedural directions.they do not go to the substantive rights of the parties.the reasoning behind this rule is that the primary function of the court is to manage or dispose of the property in the best manner possible and for the best interests of the parties concerned.people riverside university d.steinberg goldstein d.the receiver is an agent and officer of the court and the property in her or his hands remains under the control and continuous supervision of the court.lesser son seymour,supra,cal d at,marsch williams,supra,th at,d turner superior court d.people riverside university,supra,d at.the court of appeal has held,a receiver merely holds the c
