declarations 
charney declaration 
to support his position that the motion should be denied on the ground that there was sufficient merit to his claims,charney submitted a declaration providing his version of the events leading up to the press release.the declaration detailed a long history of the relationship charney had with american apparel and standard general.because most of the facts asserted in charney declaration are not necessary to resolve the current appeal,we provide a brief overview of its relevant contents.
charney,the founder of american apparel,declared he was improperly terminated as ceo.on or about june,the board of directors the board presented charney with two options resign and sign over his voting rights to the board in exchange for a severance package,an opportunity to remain with the company as a consultant,and a positive press release or be terminated for cause with his termination notice,a document providing the reasons for his termination,being leaked to the press.he was provided with a copy of this notice which indicated he was being terminated for breaching his fiduciary duty,violating company policy,and misusing corporate assets.charney was told the board would take over american apparel with or without his acquiescence.
charney ultimately settled with the board,in such a way that standard general effectively took over american apparel by and through its control of the company stock and the board standard general promised charney that there would be a fair investigation into the allegations about him and that he would be reinstated as ceo unless something profoundly egregious was uncovered.
standard general and charney entered a standstill agreement,which documented the nature of the impending investigation.the agreement provided that fti consulting,fti would conduct the investigation under the oversight of a specially elected suitability committee within american apparel.despite the agreement,charney learned the law firm that represented american apparel jones day was overseeing and conducting the investigation.charney was concerned about the impartiality of the investigation,in part,because jones day was defense counsel in an ongoing arbitration with charney.
in early december,the board offered to terminate the investigation,provide him with a severance package,and hire him as a consultant as long as he relinquished his fight for control of american apparel.the board indicated the suitability committee would terminate his employment within days if he did not accept the offer.
charney rejected the offer.he was terminated on december,but remained the majority shareholder.the statements to the press that are the subject of this appeal followed on or about december,
board member declaration 
among the declarations submitted by standard general was that of david danziger,a member of the board we summarize its pertinent contents below.
while danziger was a board member he also served as a member of the audit committee and the suitability committee.in the spring of,the audit committee conducted an investigation of charney.during the investigation,information was uncovered that led a majority of the board to consider suspending charney pending completion of the investigation.in,the board gave charney the option of remaining with american apparel as a paid consultant without supervisory or financial authority,or be suspended pending completion of the investigation.when no agreement was reached,the board unanimously voted to suspend charney.
charney was sent a suspension letter documenting the reasons for the suspension.among the reasons stated for suspension were the failure to take steps to prevent a supervisee from creating and maintaining false and defamatory blog posts about former employees authorizing the payment of significant severance packages to employees to ensure his misconduct directed toward them would not subject him to personal liability repeated violations of the company sexual harassment and policies directing derogatory and disparaging comments to others and using corporate assets for personal reasons without approval of the board.
in december,following an investigation of over six months,the suitability committee unanimously concluded that charney was not suitable to return to american apparel as an officer or employee.the board then voted to terminate charney for cause.
