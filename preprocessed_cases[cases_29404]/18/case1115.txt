orhan yavuz,a turkish citizen,has been involved in various international business transactions with kamal adi,a dual syrian and swiss citizen,since the early.frustrated with the treatment of what he considers an investment in certain real property in tulsa,oklahoma the tulsa property,yavuz has brought suit against adi and others,seeking relief under the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,c,and a variety of other causes of action based on allegations of misrepresentations and breach of contract.title to the tulsa property is held by a limited partnership,mm,whose general partner is mm,an oklahoma corporation.the partnership and the corporation are both parties to this dispute and will be referred to collectively as the mm defendants.the remaining defendant who is a party to this appeal is fpm finastate projects management fpm,a swiss corporation whose principal place of business is fribourg,switzerland.two other defendants,euroeast and sigofine,both of which are panamanian corporations,have not been served.
the district court dismissed the suit for improper venue on the basis of a clause in a written agreement the fiduciary agreement between yavuz and finastate sa.fsm is the successor in interest to finastate sa,and the latter will be referred to as fsm in this opinion.on appeal yavuz argues that the district court erred by dismissing the case under the clause dismissing the case under the doctrine of forum non conveniens to the extent that the court relied on that doctrine and dismissing the case against the mm defendants,who were not parties to the fiduciary agreement and who forfeited any objection to venue by not timely raising it.he also contends that the district court erred in ordering him to execute documents to remove any cloud on the title to the tulsa property.
we have jurisdiction under.we hold that when an international commercial agreement has both and provisions,the provision must ordinarily be interpreted under the law chosen by the parties.we reverse and remand for further proceedings regarding the meaning under swiss law of the clause and whether dismissal is appropriate under the doctrine of forum non conveniens.we need not address yavuz arguments directed specifically at the dismissal of the mm defendants.also,we vacate the order requiring yavuz to execute documents.
facts and procedural background 
proceedings 
yavuz filed suit in the district court of tulsa county,oklahoma,on june,against lee james bentley,an individual whom he believed to control the tulsa property.on september,he filed an amended petition adding the mm defendants,and dropping bentley.the mm defendants filed an answer,asserted a counterclaim against yavuz,and moved for summary judgment.the state court denied the motion on february.meanwhile,fpm had filed suit in switzerland against yavuz on december,to enforce his alleged promise to invest further funds in the tulsa property.
on july,yavuz filed a second amended and restated petition second amended petition,adding adi,fpm,euroeast,and sigofine as defendants.the second amended petition alleged the following course of conduct 
yavuz first gave gold,silver and foreign currencies to adi and euroeast in the early.at,for various investment purposes,including an interest in the tulsa property,id.at.according to the terms of the parties investment agreement,outlined in a letter dated february,yavuz was to have a ownership share in the tulsa property.
at some unspecified point in the,yavuz discovered that the defendants had misappropriated much of the gold and silver that he had placed with them.id.at.he confronted adi in about the missing commodities,and adi offered to settle the dispute by compensating yavuz in the form of a loan in addition to the interest in the tulsa property.the amount of the loan,about,was the value of the gold and silver that adi had misappropriated,plus accumulated interest.id.this new agreement was memorialized in the december,fiduciary agreement between yavuz and fpm which was controlled and directed by adi.the full text appears in the appendix to this opinion.
the fiduciary agreement describes yavuz investment as two assets held in trust by fpm 
an investment of in the share capital of madonna bv the predecessor of mm,curaçao at a market value of december.
a loan of to madonna bv,curaçao with additional accrued interest of at december.
id.at.article of the fiduciary agreement states 
yavuz undertakes to give all the documents,information and technical assistance,that are necessary for fpm to perform its mandate.
in particular it is agreed that yavuz will release fpm from all obligations which have been contracted as fulfilment of the mandate according to article hereinabove.
id.article contains the following and provisions 
this convention is governed by the swiss law,in particular article and following of the swiss code of obligation.place of courts is fribourg.
over the next several years,yavuz received very sporadic and sketchy reports regarding his investment in the tulsa property.id.at.in may,nearly years after execution of the fiduciary agreement,yavuz inquired about the status of the investment due to the lack of transparency in reporting to him.id.at some unspecified time after this inquiry,adi and fpm began corresponding via facsimile with representatives of mm and mm,for the purpose of devising a strategy to provide him with misleading financial information.id.part of this strategy was to send on behalf of mm a letter to yavuz on fpm letterhead containing unspecified false and misleading information to convince yavuz that he would need to pay several hundred thousand dollars to vest his interest in the tulsa property.id.
communications between yavuz and the defendants about the property continued,culminating in a letter dated november,from fpm to yavuz.this letter contained false and misleading accounting data that adi and fpm had prepared with the cooperation of the mm,id.at,and demanded that yavuz transfer to a bank in fribourg,switzerland,to vest his interest in the tulsa property.
also during this time,the defendants defrauded and misled yavuz by structuring the finances of mm by creating layers of affiliate corporations and entities,id.so that his equity interest in mm and his loan are essentially worthless,id.finally,the defendants have been selling portions of the tulsa property since,receiving over from sales without sharing any profits with him.
the second amended petition asserted claims based on the foregoing allegations 
constructive defendants denial that yavuz has an interest in the property,and their structuring the corporate ownership of the property in such a fashion as to deprive him of any value in his investment in the corporate general partner,has put them in a position of ownership of the tulsa property which they ought not to,in equity and in good conscience,hold and enjoy,entitling him to a constructive trust on the tulsa property.id.at.
defendants were unjustly enriched by having the use of yavuz invested funds for over twenty years without properly recognizing his investment in the remaining tulsa property,entitling him to restitution of plus interest from december.id.at.
common law defendants communications to yavuz,culminat ing in the letter from fpm of november,constituted fraud entitling him to compensatory damages of and punitive damages of at least.id.at.
constructive if the statements made to yavuz by the defendants were made without an actual fraudulent intent,they still gained an advantage to the foregoing defendants by misleading yavuz to his prejudice,entitling him to damages of at least.id.at.
breach of implied defendants a committed an implied breach of contract when they accepted his money,entitling him to an appropriate share in the profits,losses and assets of defendant corporations the remaining tulsa property,and b subsequently refus ed to acknowledge yavuz appropriate and proper share in the entities property,again entitling him to damages of at least.id.at.
civil defendants conspired to obtain from yavuz through false and fraudulent statements and their acts in structuring the investment transaction so that his investment would be worthless.he requests compensatory damages of,and punitive damages of not less than.id.at.
breach of fiduciary defendants breached their fiduciary duty to yavuz with respect to his investment based upon the facts set forth as aforesaid.id.at.on this claim he requests damages to the extent of the amount of his investment with them,and punitive damages of not less than.id.
yavuz deposited several hundred thousand dollars to be used for various purposes,including the investment in the tulsa property,and the defendants embezzled from him by appropriat ing the sum of of his funds for their own use.id.at.he seeks compensatory damages of,and punitive damages of at least.
defendants violated rico by furnishing false and misleading financial information and diverting to foreign entities controlled by adi and fpm certain funds that should have been used to repay yavuz investments.the racketeering enterprise consists of mm and the various foreign entities who are in an affiliate position or in a position of control of mm id.at.the predicate acts performed by the above named defendants which form the basis for the racketeering activity,are numerous communications between the rico defendants and the plaintiff denying his request for accurate accounting information,the furnishing to him of false and incomplete financial information and the requirement that he pay exorbitant sums of several hundred thousand dollars in order to vest his investment.id.at.he seeks in damages,to be trebled under rico.
yavuz requests an accounting as to all financial aspects of his investment in the tulsa property in the above named entities,including complete information regarding the investment of all other partners or shareholders of those entities since the inception of those entities.id.at.
the mm defendants filed their answer to the second amended petition on august,and asserted a counterclaim against yavuz for alleged abuse of process.they then removed the case to federal district court on august.
motion to dismiss 
on november,adi and fpm responded to the second amended petition by filing a motion to dismiss on the grounds of improper venue,forum non conveniens,and failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.yavuz filed his response on december.the mm defendants who had not previously raised improper venue in their answer or a motion filed a document on january,stating that they had no objection to the motion to dismiss.
on september,the district court granted the motion to dismiss on the basis of improper venue.the district court observed that all claims in the dispute arose from yavuz investment relationship with adi and fpm,which was governed by the fiduciary agreement.it stated that fribourg,switzerland,would be a more appropriate forum for the dispute than tulsa,oklahoma,because the only connection these parties have to tulsa,oklahoma is that one or more of the defendants own real estate here and yavuz is attempting to use this proceeding as a prejudgment attachment of the real estate.id.at.the court continued 
the agreement was negotiated and executed in switzerland and witnesses with knowledge of the agreement are going to be located in switzerland.at the time of the execution of the agreement,both adi and fpm were residents of switzerland.fpm is still located in switzerland and adi is a resident of syria,although he is still a citizen of switzerland and frequently travels to switzerland.yavuz is a citizen of turkey and litigation in switzerland is going to be much more convenient than litigation in tulsa,oklahoma.furthermore,there is litigation between these parties and regarding the agreement which is currently pending in fourth circuit sarine ward,fribourg,switzerland.the court finds that the forum selection clause in the agreement is valid and should be honored citing cases.the disputes between the parties to this action should be litigated in switzerland,not tulsa,oklahoma.
id.at.the district court order dismissed the case for improper venue as to all defendants,id.at,even though the mm defendants had not joined the motion or otherwise sought dismissal of the suit,and indeed had asserted a counterclaim against yavuz.in addition,the order stated 
this order shall also act as a dismissal of any lis pendens notices that have been filed with the records of the county clerk of tulsa county regarding this lawsuit.the plaintiff is hereby ordered to execute any documents reasonabl y necessary to remove this lawsuit as a cloud on the title to any tulsa county real estate owned by the defendants.
yavuz filed a motion under.a on september.the motion asked the district court to clarify whether it had dismissed the case as to all defendants and whether it had dismissed the case in its entirety,including the mm defendants counterclaim against him.id.at.also,it protested that the court had not described the documents he was to execute.yavuz then filed a timely notice of appeal on september.on october we issued an order abating the appeal pending resolution of the rule motion.the court entered an order on november,stating that it had indeed dismissed all claims and the counterclaim of the mm defendants.the order did not clarify what documents were to be executed.yavuz filed a motion to vacate this order on november,and filed a timely notice of appeal from the november order on december.we consolidated the two pending appeals.on august,the district court denied yavuz motion to vacate its order.yavuz then filed a notice of appeal from that denial on september.this opinion will dispose of all three appeals.
ii.discussion 
forum non conveniens 
the parties devote substantial portions of their briefs to debating whether the district court dismissal can be affirmed under the doctrine of forum non conveniens.we hold,however,that the court did not rule on that ground,and it would be inappropriate for us to address the matter in the first instance.
as the supreme court has stated 
under the federal doctrine of forum non conveniens,when an alternative forum has jurisdiction to hear a case,and when trial in the chosen forum would establish oppressiveness and vexation to a defendant out of all proportion to the plaintiff convenience,or when the chosen forum is inappropriate because of considerations affecting the court own administrative and legal problems,the court may,in the exercise of its sound discretion,dismiss the case,even if jurisdiction and proper venue are established.
am.dredging miller,d internal quotation marks,brackets,and ellipses omitted.in our circuit,gschwind cessna aircraft,cir,sets forth the manner in which this determination must be made.there are two threshold questions in the forum non conveniens determination first,whether there is an adequate alternative forum in which the defendant is amenable to process,and second,whether foreign law applies.id.at internal citation omitted.if both questions are answered affirmatively,the court goes on to weigh the private and public interests bearing on the forum non conveniens decision.id.at.the factors relating to private interests are 
the relative ease of access to sources of proof availability of compulsory process for compelling attendance of witnesses cost of obtaining attendance of willing witnesses possibility of a view of the premises,if appropriate and all other practical problems that make trial of the case easy,expeditious and inexpensive.
id.included in the factors are 
administrative difficulties of courts with congested dockets which can be caused by cases not being filed at their place of origin the burden of jury duty on members of a community with no connection to the litigation the local interest in having localized controversies decided at home and the appropriateness of having diversity cases tried in a forum that is familiar with the governing law.
id.although there is ordinarily a strong presumption in favor of hearing the case in the plaintiff chosen forum,a foreign plaintiff choice of forum warrants less deference.id.when the plaintiff is foreign,the private and public interest factors need not so heavily favor the alternate forum.id.
the district court dismissal order noted some of the factors relevant to application of the doctrine of forum non conveniens.it recited that switzerland had the most significant contacts with the parties and the transactions at issue that the fiduciary agreement was negotiated and signed in switzerland that witnesses with knowledge of the fiduciary agreement are going to be located in switzerland that some of the parties are swiss residents,and that yavuz resides in turkey,which is closer to switzerland than tulsa and that litigation between the parties has already commenced in fribourg.at.after reciting these factors,however,the district court ruling was the court finds that the forum selection clause in the agreement is valid and should be honored.the disputes between the parties to this action should be litigated in switzerland,not tulsa,oklahoma.the motion to dismiss of adi and fpm is granted as to all defendants and this case is hereby dismissed pursuant to rule b of the.id.internal citations omitted.
the order does not cite any caselaw regarding the doctrine of forum non conveniens,nor do the words forum non conveniens appear.several of the relevant factors are not mentioned in the order,and the district court did not engage in the requisite balancing of interests.although there may be some merit in resolving this issue on appeal,we believe the better practice is for the district court to make the initial ruling.see pac.frontier pleasant grove city,cir where an issue has been raised,but not ruled on,proper judicial administration generally favors remand for the district court to examine the issue initially.we therefore remand to the district court for resolution of this issue.
article of the fiduciary agreement states this convention is governed by the swiss law,in particular article and following of the swiss code of obligation.place of courts is fribourg.at.the district court interpreted the second require that yavuz bring all the claims in his complaint in a swiss court.in so ruling,the court had to resolve several subsidiary questions is the provision mandatory or permissive that is,does it require that the claims be brought in a swiss court,or does it simply permit the claims to be brought there are all of yavuz claims governed by the provision,or only some for example,perhaps the contract claims are so governed but the provision does not govern the tort or rico claims does the clause bind yavuz with respect to claims against all the defendants,or with respect to only his claims against fpm,or perhaps only those against fpm and adi 
to answer those questions,a court must first resolve a preliminary question what law does it apply to answer them this issue is one of first impression for this court,and,with the exception of a very recent decision by a district court in our circuit,th agriculture nutrition,ace european group,d,and one recent article,it has received virtually no attention from the federal courts,or even scholars,in the context of international contracts.as stated in that recent article in practice,and with rare exceptions,united states courts tend not to engage in explicit choice of law analysis when determining the validity and enforceability of a given international clause.those courts tend instead to reflexively apply lex fori,even when the contract contains an explicit choice of law clause selecting the laws of another jurisdiction to govern the contract as a whole.jacob webb yackee,choice of law considerations in the validity enforcement of international forum selection agreements whose law applies,ucla int l foreign aff,internal footnote omitted hereinafter yackee see also linda mullenix,another choice of forum,another choice of law consensual adjudicatory procedure in federal court,fordham,in large measure,the scope of clauses combined with clauses has not been examined in any meaningful fashion by federal courts.hereinafter mullenix.
nevertheless,we are not without significant guidance.to begin with,when a court interprets a contract,as a general matter it applies the law that the parties selected in their contract.see restatement second of conflict of laws hereinafter restatement id.cmt.e t he demands of certainty,predictability,and convenience dictate that,subject to some limitations,the parties shall have power to choose the applicable law.as we stated in boyd rosene associates.kansas municipal gas agency,cir 
because conflicts of law are inevitable in a federal system,parties to a contract are empowered to and frequently do choose a particular state law to apply to the execution and interpretation of the contract.absent special circumstances,courts usually honor the parties choice of law because two prime objectives of contract law are to protect the justified expectations of the parties and to make it possible for them to foretell with accuracy what will be their rights and liabilities under the contract.restatement cmt.
a clause is part of the contract.we see no particular reason,at least in the international context,why a clause,among the multitude of provisions in a contract,should be singled out as a provision not to be interpreted in accordance with the law chosen by the contracting parties.see restatement a meaning of ambiguous contractual terms should be determined in accordance with the local law of the state chosen by the parties.
on the contrary,as we are about to discuss,supreme court opinions in international disputes emphasize the primacy of the parties agreement regarding the proper forum.that agreement consists of more than just the bare words in the provision.the words may take on different meanings depending on the law used to interpret them.thus,when the contract contains a clause,a court can effectuate the parties agreement concerning the forum only if it interprets the forum clause under the chosen law.
turning now to the supreme court view of clauses,the court has recognized several considerations compelling deference to the contracting parties choice of a forum in international commercial transactions.we note at the outset that these considerations may not have equal force,or may be limited by compelling contrary considerations,in the context of domestic disputes.see generally mullenix,supra,at.in bremen,gmbh zapata,d,the court held enforceable absent evidence that enforcement would be unreasonable,unfair,or unjust a contractual requirement that the london high court of justice be the forum for disputes regarding an agreement by a german corporation to tow an american corporation drilling rig from louisiana to italy.reversing a closely divided en banc circuit court,the opinion explained 
for at least two decades we have witnessed an expansion of overseas commercial activities by business enterprises based in the united states.the barrier of distance that once tended to confine a business concern to a modest territory no longer does so.here we see an american company with special expertise contracting with a foreign company to tow a complex machine thousands of miles across seas and oceans.the expansion of american business and industry will hardly be encouraged if,notwithstanding solemn contracts,we insist on a parochial concept that all disputes must be resolved under our laws and in our courts.absent a contract forum,the considerations relied on by the court of appeals would be persuasive reasons for holding an american forum convenient in the traditional sense,but in an era of expanding world trade and commerce,the absolute aspects of the doctrine of a circuit precedent holding a clause unenforceable have little place and would be a heavy hand indeed on the future development of international commercial dealings by americans.we can not have trade and commerce in world markets and international waters exclusively on our terms,governed by our laws,and resolved in our courts.
id.at see also vimar seguros y reaseguros,sky reefer,d quoting portions of the above passage in speaking of contemporary principles of international comity and commercial practice.the court said that its approach accords with ancient concepts of freedom of contract and reflects an appreciation of the expanding horizons of american contractors who seek business in all parts of the world.bremen,at.the choice of forum was made in an arm length negotiation by experienced and sophisticated businessmen,and absent some compelling and countervailing reason it should be honored by the parties and enforced by the courts.id.at.the opinion continued there are compelling reasons why a freely negotiated private international agreement,unaffected by fraud,undue influence,or overweening bargaining power,such as that involved here,should be given full effect.id.at.internal footnote omitted.manifestly much uncertainty and possibly great inconvenience to both parties could arise if a suit could be maintained in any jurisdiction in which an accident might occur or if jurisdiction were left to any place where the bremen or the german corporation might happen to be found.id.at.therefore,
t he elimination of all such uncertainties by agreeing in advance on a forum acceptable to both parties is an indispensable element in international trade,commerce,and contracting.there is strong evidence that the forum clause was a vital part of the agreement,and it would be unrealistic to think that the parties did not conduct their negotiations,including fixing the monetary terms,with the consequences of the forum clause figuring prominently in their calculations.
id.at.internal footnote omitted.
the supreme court has not departed from this approach.in scherk,d,the court treated a n agreement to arbitrate before a specified tribunal as,in effect,a specialized kind of clause.the plaintiff claimed violations of united states securities laws,and the court had held in wilko swan,that an agreement to arbitrate could not preclude a buyer of a security from seeking a judicial remedy under the securities act of,scherk,at.nevertheless,the court enforced the agreement of the parties in this case to arbitrate any disputes arising out of their international commercial transaction.id.at.echoing bremen,the court wrote 
u ncertainty regarding the law applicable to disputes arising out of a contract will almost inevitably exist with respect to any contract touching two or more countries,each with its own substantive laws and rules.a contractual provision specifying in advance the forum in which disputes shall be litigated and the law to be applied is,therefore,an almost indispensable precondition to achievement of the orderliness and predictability essential to any international business transaction.furthermore,such a provision obviates the danger that a dispute under the agreement might be submitted to a forum hostile to the interests of one of the parties or unfamiliar with the problem area involved.
a parochial refusal by the courts of one country to enforce an international arbitration agreement would not only frustrate these purposes,but would invite unseemly and mutually destructive jockeying by the parties to secure tactical litigation advantages.
id.at.internal footnote omitted.the court provided a specific hypothetical instance of what could happen 
in the present case,for example,it is not inconceivable that if scherk had anticipated that would be able in this country to enjoin resort to arbitration he might have sought an order in france or some other country enjoining from proceeding with its litigation in the united states.whatever recognition the courts of this country might ultimately have granted to the order of the foreign court,the dicey atmosphere of such a legal land would surely damage the fabric of international commerce and trade,and imperil the willingness and ability of businessmen to enter into international commercial agreements.
similarly,a decade later in mitsubishi motors soler,d,the court held that the circuit court had erred in holding that an antitrust claim was not subject to arbitration in accordance with a provision in an international commercial agreement.the court explained 
w e conclude that concerns of international comity,respect for the capacities of foreign and transnational tribunals,and sensitivity to the need of the international commercial system for predictability in the resolution of disputes require that we enforce the parties agreement,even assuming that a contrary result would be forthcoming in a domestic context.
to be sure,the above supreme court opinions did not address the issue presented here.in those cases there was no question regarding the meaning of the contractual provision at issue,only its enforceability.but the same reasoning applies if the parties to an international contract agree on a clause that has a particular meaning under the law of a specific jurisdiction,and the parties agree that the contract is to be interpreted under the law of that jurisdiction,then respect for the parties autonomy and the demands of predictability in international transactions require courts to give effect to the meaning of the clause under the chosen law,at least absent special circumstances such as,perhaps,the chosen jurisdiction refusal to hear a case that has no ties to the jurisdiction.see yackee,supra,at.in other words,just as the supreme court has made clear that under federal law the courts should ordinarily honor an international commercial agreement provision,we now hold that under federal law the courts should ordinarily honor an international commercial agreement provision as construed under the law specified in the agreement provision.the practice,although apparently merely reflexive,of applying the law of the jurisdiction in which the suit is pending lex fori,is unsatisfactory.as one author has expressed the point 
lex fori is,in most circumstances and for a number of reasons,a poor choice of law to govern an international clause it risks subjecting the contract to multiple laws,it makes it difficult for parties to anticipate at the contract drafting stage which law will actually be applied to the clause,it may promote forum shopping,and it ignores the parties jurisdictional expectations by overlooking a contract explicit or implicit choice of law.
yackee,supra,at internal footnotes omitted.
turning to the fiduciary agreement,the clause states place of courts is fribourg.at.under american law this language appears rather ambiguous.we would be inclined to hold that the clause is permissive rather than mandatory,see k v scientific bayerische motoren werke aktiengesellschaft,cir,and it is hardly obvious what claims,against what parties,are governed by the clause.we might reach the same conclusions under swiss law,but perhaps not.see yackee,supra,at noting that european union law presumes clauses are exclusive.the parties have not addressed the issue.
what is not ambiguous is that the parties agreed that swiss law governs the fiduciary agreement.accordingly,we hold that the provision in that contract must be construed under swiss law.we recognize that we have some discretion to decide to determine ourselves what swiss law provides.see.swiss credit bank balink,cir applying swiss law on appeal.but the better practice is to remand to district court to permit the parties to present the applicable law and perhaps to develop further any facts that may be relevant under that law.see sec dunlap,cir remanding to district court with instructions to determine what costa rican law actually provides,and its significance,if any,in this matter banque paribas hamilton indus.int l,cir remanding with instructions to determine,in accordance with rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,whether there was any violation of the guarantee,when that guarantee is interpreted in according with saudi arabian law.we also note that the issue may be mooted by a determination that venue is inappropriate under the forum non conveniens doctrine.
executing documents 
finally,yavuz contends that the district court erred when,as part of its order granting the motion to dismiss,it ordered him to execute documents to remove any cloud on the title to the tulsa property.the district court order stated 
this order shall also act as a dismissal of any lis pendens notices that have been filed with the records of the county clerk of tulsa county regarding this lawsuit.the plaintiff
