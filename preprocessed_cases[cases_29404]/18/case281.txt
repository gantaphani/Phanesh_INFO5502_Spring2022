the controversy that triggered this litigation is whether easylink services corporation easylink must pay sandeep dalal,a former employee and sales broker,a commission on an aborted sale of,ici,an easylink subsidiary,to business india publications limited bi easylink and dalal a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york cote,which awarded dalal damages on the theory that he was a beneficiary of a stock purchase agreement between easylink and bi.because this conclusion was incorrect,we reverse.but because the district court did not reach the question of whether easylink breached the agreement by intentionally frustrating its consummation to avoid paying dalal commission,we remand for further proceedings.
background 
in,easylink,a global provider of electronic information exchange services,approached bi,a large magazine publisher in india,concerning the possible sale of an easylink subsidiary,ici.ici is an internet services company,with offices in india and the,that had experienced economic difficulties as a consequence of the collapse of the internet market bubble.dalal served as ici president of global alliances.following its significant cash losses through ici,easylink borrowed million from ici in february.the loan was never repaid and the obligation became an issue in this litigation.that same month,dalal learned that easylink,as a consequence of ici deteriorating economic condition,would be terminating his employment.at that point easylink also decided to sell ici and several other subsidiaries and offered dalal the opportunity to continue to work on a commission basis as a consultant to oversee the sale of ici.
these arrangements generated a series of contracts central to this appeal three brokerage agreements between dalal and easylink,and a stock purchase agreement between easylink and bi for the sale of ici.in the first agreement,signed in april,dalal agreed to locate and evaluate buyers for ici and to assist in negotiating sales terms.in the first agreement,dalal agreed to devote a substantial portion of his time to the sale,to forgo an retainer and to accept a variable commission for his services.additionally,the first agreement obligated easylink to accept any offer of or more for ici.the second agreement,signed three months later,extended the terms of the first by thirty days.
after signing the first agreement,dalal approached a number of prospective buyers including bi,which had previously expressed an interest in acquiring ici.by late may,he had negotiated a term sheet with,a subsidiary of bi,under which agreed to buy ici for cash and other consideration.
on october,easylink and bi signed a stock purchase agreement spa for the sale of ici,for a total consideration of roughly million.the spa contained a negating clause,section,entitled no third party beneficiaries.this appeal principally turns on whether this clause is enforceable.it provides 
neither this agreement or any provision hereof nor any schedule,exhibit,certificate or other instrument delivered pursuant hereto,nor any agreement to be entered into pursuant hereto or any provision hereof,is intended to create any right,claim or remedy in favor of any person or entity,other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and any other parties indemnified under article xi.
as a condition to closing,the spa also required bi to obtain approvals from various indian governmental agencies.the deadline for applying for the approvals was november.
the spa also contained two interrelated provisions pertaining to dalal compensation,which the district court found to be in tension with the negating clause.the first,section,identified dalal as the broker for the sale and indicated that he would be paid under a separate agreement in a disclosure schedule of the spa.that clause provided that,except as set forth in the disclosure schedules,no broker,investment banker,financial advisor or other person is entitled to any broker,finder,financial advisor or other similar fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this agreement.the second provision,disclosure schedule of the spa,further indicated that easylink had an agreement with sandeep dalal pursuant to which he is entitled to fees payable upon the terms and conditions set forth therein.as we discuss below,the district court incorrectly concluded that these provisions precluded enforcement of the negating clause.
on the same day that easylink and bi signed the spa,dalal and easylink signed the third agreement,which changed his compensation scale to provide for a commission of of the total consideration in the event that the transaction closed and,unlike the first agreement,did not require easylink to accept any offer over.
prior to the november deadline for obtaining the required regulatory approvals from the indian government,bi was prepared to apply,but the application depended,in part,on cooperation from easylink legal counsel.however,easylink lawyers suspended their services because of unpaid bills and as a result,the application could not be completed and the deadline was not met.nonetheless,after the deadline,the parties continued their joint efforts to obtain the necessary government approvals until easylink ultimately terminated the spa in december.
easylink sought to justify the termination on the ground that bi had failed to secure the approvals by the deadline specified in the spa.easylink informed bi,however,that it still wanted to pursue the transaction and,at that point,sought to renegotiate and offered new terms.dalal contends that easylink intentionally failed to close the transaction to avoid paying his commission,that it planned to consummate the transaction later without him and that the lack of governmental approvals rationale was pretextual.
litigation ensued and both easylink and dalal pursued a variety of contract claims.easylink asserted claims that included,among others,claims for breach of contract,for breach of fiduciary duty and for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and additionally sought a declaratory judgment that it had not breached its agreements with dalal.dalal counterclaimed for,inter alia,breach of contract and of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.he also sought recovery on the spa as a beneficiary.
in accordance with the district judge individual rules for civil bench trials,and in advance of trial,the parties simultaneously submitted the direct testimony of their trial witnesses by affidavit,as well as their documentary evidence,findings of fact,conclusions of law,and trial briefs in a conference on december,the court,in accordance with its individual practices,advised the parties that it would consider only those claims and defenses for which the parties had provided legal support in their submissions,and proceeded to lay out what it believed to be the claims and defenses.at the trial held on december,the parties made brief opening statements,offered objections to evidentiary submissions,presented oral summations and at the end of the day were provided with the court first opinion addressing various issues thought at the time to be dispositive.
these individual procedures,which normally can be conducive to efficiencies and considerable savings in cost and time,had the unintended the unusual circumstances presented generating a record that obscured which arguments had,or had not been,properly presented to the court.as a consequence,the procedural posture of the case is unusually complicated.the trial resulted in three successive opinions by the district on december,february,and september,reversing the one prior.
the district court unreported first opinion i concluded that easylink had breached the spa by itself causing the condition precedent upon which it relied to terminate the agreement.the court held that by failing to pay the fees of its legal counsel in india,easylink had prevented bi from applying for governmental approvals prior to the deadline in the spa.having caused bi to miss the government approval application deadline,easylink could not rely on this failure to terminate the contract.having concluded that easylink had breached the spa,the district court then held that dalal could recover as a beneficiary of the spa.
the district court reasoned that the specific identification of dalal in disclosure schedule as a broker entitled to payment overcame what it perceived as the general language of the negating clause,which explicitly precluded the existence of,or recovery by,beneficiaries.the court dismissed the negating clause as mere boilerplate language and reinforced its interpretation of the spa by reference to extrinsic evidence,noting that because easylink and dalal had specifically bargained for his inclusion in the spa as a named broker,easylink intended him to be a beneficiary.
while the district court focused most of its attention on the question of dalal beneficiary status,it also rejected dalal claim that he was entitled to relief as a consequence of easylink breach of the brokerage agreements.in particular,the district court found that the third agreement made any payment to dalal entirely dependent on the spa and the payment of consideration by bi.therefore,the district court concluded that dalal only direct contractual right that survived the expiration of the first agreement was his right under the third agreement to the commission if the transaction closed.the district court entered judgment for dalal and against easylink in the amount of.
easylink moved pursuant to rule to amend the judgment or,in the alternative,for a new trial.easylink argued that under new york law negating clauses,such as the one in the spa,are enforceable,dispositive,and preclude recovery by beneficiaries.in response,dalal argued that easylink had waived the argument by not highlighting it to the district court and that,in any event,the district court conclusion on that issue had been correct.
the district court agreed with easylink and issued its second opinion on february,reversing its december,opinion,dalal,wl,dist.lexis,ii.the district court now held that,because of the presence of the negating clause,its earlier opinion had incorrectly concluded that dalal was a beneficiary.this time it ordered the entry of judgment for easylink.id.
in a further twist,following the district court second decision,dalal moved under rule to amend the new judgment.dalal again argued,inter alia,that easylink had waived its right to rely on the negating clause because it had not raised the issue at trial.at this point,the district court reversed itself for the second time,and reinstated its first decision,dalal,wl,dist.lexis,iii.
in its third opinion,the district court concluded that easylink had not relied at trial on the theory that the negating clause prevented recovery under a beneficiary claim and that easylink trial submissions did not contain a defense specifically targeting the beneficiary claim.the district court concluded that dalal had been prejudiced by these omissions because he had been denied the opportunity to elicit further evidence and to respond with appropriate legal arguments,including an equitable estoppel argument.the district court found that easylink was not entitled to relief under rule for a defense it had not presented at trial.because it granted dalal recovery as a beneficiary,the court deemed it unnecessary to discuss at length dalal two alternative arguments supporting his right to recovery.iii at.the court ordered the reinstatement of its original judgment for dalal.this appeal ensued.
discussion 
i.the standard of review 
generally,we review questions of law de novo,questions of fact for clear error,and motions under rule for abuse of discretion.benjamin fraser,cir quotations omitted munafo metro.transp,cir.in light of the successive rule motions and decisions below,we note that a district court abuses its discretion when its decision is premised on errors of law.shain ellison,cir.new york law applies in this diversity action.
ii.the enforceability of the negating clause 
in its first opinion,the district court reasoned that the specific identification of dalal in the contract supersedes the general language in the negating clause,which explicitly excluded any beneficiaries from recovery under the spa.it found that the contractual provisions in question were not ambiguous,but,at the same time,concluded that to the extent that there is any ambiguity in this regard,dalal and easylink specifically bargained for dalal inclusion in the spa as an intended beneficiary of it.thus,the district court concluded that the identification of dalal in section of the spa and in disclosure schedule together established him as a beneficiary.
we disagree.the negating clause,entitled no third party beneficiaries,clearly provided that no schedule was intended to create any right,claim or remedy in favor of any person or entity other than the parties hereto for anyone other than the parties.in other words,since the parties intention to benefit the must be apparent from the contract,the text of the spa specifically foreclosed the theory of recovery on which dalal and the district court relied.see,in re gulf serv.tender offer,port chester constr.atlas,it is old law that a third party may sue as a beneficiary on a contract made for his benefit.however,an intent to benefit the third party must be shown,and,absent such intent,the third party is merely an incidental beneficiary with no right to enforce the particular contracts.internal citations omitted.
dalal and the district court were distracted by a line of new york cases addressing the issue of whether a broker commission is due after a sale has been consummated.the cases typically hold that where a broker is expressly identified in a contract which references an obligation to pay a broker its commission,the broker is entitled to recover as a beneficiary.see,cauff,lippman apogee fin.group,permitting recovery by a beneficiary because the broker was expressly identified in the contract and the contract referenced the brokerage obligation to pay his commission ambrose dinstein,dep t concerning the allocation of a commission once a sale had closed edward gordon blodnick,schultz abramowitz,dep t concerning a sublease transaction that had closed.these cases stand for the unremarkable proposition that,in the absence of negating language,the naming of a broker in a contract reflects an intention to benefit the broker,and thus confers beneficiary status.they do not examine the issue,which is dispositive here,of the relationship between commission clauses and negating clauses.
under new york law,the effectiveness of a negating clause to preclude beneficiary status is w here a provision exists in an agreement expressly negating an intent to permit enforcement by third parties,that provision is decisive.nepco forged,consolidated edison of,dep t see,trinity,cir under new york law,where a provision in a contract expressly negates enforcement by third parties,that provision is controlling.wager constr,dep t see also edward fitzpatrick.constr.county of suffolk,dep t finding that the construction company was merely an incidental beneficiary,not a beneficiary,to a contract between an architect and the county.
for these reasons,we conclude that the mention of dalal in the contract as a broker entitled to a commission is insufficient to confer status where the parties themselves are explicit that they did not intend to create beneficiaries.in we arrived at a similar conclusion.although there were various provisions in subcontracts that reflect ed and envision ed coordinated effort by the various subcontractors,we concluded that these tangential references did not overcome the explicit negation of beneficiary obligations found elsewhere in the subcontracts,at.we held that the contracts could not be construed to bestow benefits on other subcontractors.id.by the same token,dalal is not a beneficiary of the spa.
iii.waiver 
the district court found in its third opinion that by failing to raise explicitly the negating clause as a defense to dalal recovery as a beneficiary,easylink waived it and thus was not entitled to relief under rule.the district court observed that easylink
