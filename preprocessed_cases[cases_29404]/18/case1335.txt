hammer lane and mini storage is a limited partnership that owns and operates a storage facility in stockton,california.after disagreeing about whether to sell the facility,appellants panakosta partners,lp,and other limited sought to wrest control from respondents hammer lane management,llc,and other limited partners who collectively held a majority interest in the partnership management filed an action seeking judicial dissolution of the partnership as well as declaratory and injunctive relief.panakosta sought to avoid dissolution and petitioned to buy out management share of the business in a special proceeding pursuant to corporations code section management dismissed with prejudice its cause of action for judicial dissolution and filed an motion under code of civil procedure section.the trial court granted the motion and denied panakosta petition for buyout.
on appeal,panakosta contends the trial court erred by disallowing it to buy out management interest under section,and granting the motion and awarding fees and costs to management.management counters that panakosta can not appeal from the order denying the petition for buyout.
we conclude that panakosta has properly appealed from the denial of its petition for buyout under section.we affirm the order denying the petition for buyout,but conclude that the trial court erroneously granted the motion.accordingly,we reverse the award of attorney fees and costs to management under code of civil procedure section.
factual and procedural history 
complaint and cross complaint 
in september,management filed a complaint alleging that the partnership had operated the storage facility for years with a consistently negative cash flow.management eventually decided to sell the facility on the open market.panakosta disagreed with the decision to sell and attempted to assume control of the partnership from management.in an effort to remove management as general partner,panakosta held a meeting with other limited partners who collectively held only a minority interest in the partnership.panakosta then filed a purported amendment to the certificate of limited partnership with the california secretary of state.the amendment listed hlms,llc,as the new general partner.hlms,llc,began receiving funds from operations of the partnership in a new bank account.
based on these events,management concluded that it was not reasonably practicable for the partnership to continue and sought judicial dissolution under the terms of the partnership agreement and pursuant to former section,subdivision f a management also sought declaratory relief confirming that panakosta had acted wrongfully in attempting to usurp control over the partnership.additionally,management requested that panakosta be enjoined from exercising any further control over the partnership.
in june,panakosta filed a asserting that management had breached the partnership agreement and its fiduciary duties,and engaged in conversion and fraud.the also stated a cause of action for determination of partner buyout price under terms of the partnership agreement.in support,panakosta alleged that b y refusing to submit to the provisions of the section contained in section of the partnership agreement,management acted in breach of the partnership agreement,violated its fiduciary duty,and duty of loyalty.panakosta respectfully request s that this court stay the dissolution of the partnership and order the cross defendants to participate in the provisions of section of the partnership agreement.
special proceeding under section 
on april,panakosta filed a special proceeding to elect to purchase partnership interests under a new case number in order to buy out management partnership interests under section concurrently with the petition,panakosta filed a motion for appointment of appraisers to value the partnership and for a stay of the related dissolution proceeding.
on april,management dismissed with prejudice its cause of action for judicial dissolution.three days later,panakosta dismissed its.on april,management filed an opposition to the petition for buyout.in the opposition,management pointed out that no cause of action for judicial dissolution remained pending.
also on april,management filed an motion directed at the petition for buyout.panakosta opposed the motion.
in may,the trial court granted panakosta motion for appointment of appraisers and a stay of the related case.
ruling on petition for buyout 
in june,after initially granting panakosta petition for buyout,the trial court sua sponte issued an order denying the petition.in pertinent part,the court explained 
panakosta motion for an order appointing appraisers and stay of dissolution proceedings is denied 
no judicial dissolution proceeding is pending 
the basis for this petition was the pending cause of action in the related civil action for judicial decree of dissolution that cause of action has been dismissed by management.therefore no request for judicial dissolution of the limited partnership remains as the condition precedent for the buy out 
no voluntary dissolution is currently proceeding under the facts before the court.
the related civil action is the proper forum for any request to shares.this petition violates the one action rule or primary rights doctrine,which seeks to avoid splitting causes of action to enforce a single right.the cases have invoked the rule against splitting a cause of action in order to abate a later suit or bar it on res judicata grounds when that suit alleged a different theory of recovery for the same injury grisham philip morris cal th.
no legitimate reason exists to have filed this separate special proceeding,it should have been filed as part of the related civil action 
agreement of the parties 
as an alternate sufficient basis for the denial of this motion,sec a provides e xcept as otherwise provided in subdivision b,the partnership agreement governs relations among the partners and between the partners and the partnership to the extent the partnership agreement does not otherwise provide,this chapter governs relations among the partners and between the partners and the partnership 
the filed in the related civil action by panakosta,reflects an cause of action for determination of partner buyout price,attaching the agreement of limited partnership of hammer lane rv mini storage,lp agreement 
section,et seq of the agreement provides for the terms of the buy out of partners by each other,including a procedure for appointment of appraisers 
thus,since the written agreement between panakosta and management already sets forth provisions by its terms for the buy out of partnership shares,which procedure was initially pursued by panakosta,but then subsequently abandoned,the terms of the parties written agreement controls the manner of partnership,not the corp code statutory scheme,except where the agreement does not otherwise provide 
no showing has been made by panakosta that the procedure for a buy out in the agreement is absent or deficient,and therefore reliance on the statutory scheme in the corp c ode is not appropriate the court will not proceed under sec

on june,the trial court granted management motion.the court ruling explained in pertinent part 
management move s to strike the unverified petition to elect to purchase partnership interest in this action,under,which seeks to buy out management partnership interests,to avoid judicial dissolution of the partnership pled in the related civil action case no,currently scheduled for trial 
the petition was clearly filed in response to the cause of action for dissolution of partnership contained in the related civil action,and thus necessarily arises from the related civil action,within the meaning of the statute 
as the related civil action is clearly an act in furtherance of a person right to petition which includes all judicial proceedings,moving parties have met their initial burden on an motion 
the civil action contained a cause of action for judicial dissolution of the partnership,which has since been dismissed by management in the civil action 
to the extent that panakosta argues that its application to buy out the partners who pled a cause of action for judicial dissolution is not covered by the statute,the motion to strike here is not directed to the application but to the petition,itself,which is expressly covered by the statutory language and by the case of thomas quintero th.
the court finds that the petition is subject to a motion to strike strategic litigation against participation under c c p,sec and that management has met its initial burden of proof

in the second phase,panakosta must show both that the claim is legally sufficient and there is admissible evidence that,if credited,would be sufficient to sustain a favorable judgment mcgarry university of san diego sic,
to support the petition under c,panakosta has the burden of showing that it elect s to purchase the partnership interests owned by management,is unable to agree with management upon the fair market value of the partnership interests,and give bond with sufficient security to pay the estimated reasonable expenses,including attorneys fees 
absent that showing,the superior court need not act to stay the winding up and dissolution proceeding or proceed to ascertain and fix the fair market value of the partnership interests owned by the moving parties.section c

panakosta has failed to submit any admissible evidence to support its burden of showing facts to sustain a decision on the petition in its favor

in this motion,in the total absence of any evidentiary showing by panakosta that it is likely to prevail on any of the three required prongs in support of its petition,and with the conflict with sec a,the court finds that panakosta has failed to meet its burden,and the special motion to strike the petition is granted 
panakosta timely filed a notice of appeal from the order denying its petition for buyout and from the order granting the motion and awarding fees and costs to management as the prevailing party.
discussion 
iwhether a denial of buyout under section is appealable 
management contends the trial court denial of panakosta petition for buyout under section is nonappealable.we disagree.
subdivision d of section provides that a ny member aggrieved by the action of the court may appeal therefrom.even though it appears this language contains a drafting error in referring to member when limited partnerships only have partners,subdivision d nonetheless expressly confers a statutory right to appeal from an action of the court on a request for buyout of interests by partners who seek judicial dissolution of a partnership.
panakosta was aggrieved by the trial court denial of the motion to buy out the majority partners interests under section.a party who has an interest recognized by law and who is adversely affected by the judgment or order is an aggrieved party.cesar superior court th.panakosta interest in vindicating its statutory right to buy out management was immediate,pecuniary and substantial,and not merely a nominal or remote consequence of the trial court ruling.howard contracting,macdonald construction cal.app th.thus,subdivision d of section authorized an appeal from the court denial of panakosta petition.
management argues that denial of a petition for buyout is not an action of the court from which subdivision d of section allows an appeal.in so arguing,management relies on this court decision in dickson rehmke th dickson.dickson does not support management contention.
dickson involved a motion under section for buyout of another member interest in a limited liability company.th at.the trial court issued an alternative decree fixing the value of the interest in the company to be purchased and giving the purchasing member days to buy the other member interest,and providing that the company would be dissolved if the purchase price were not tendered in a timely manner.ibid.the purchasing member made prompt payment,and the trial court entered judgment accordingly.ibid.the moving member appealed from the judgment,contending that the trial court erred in valuing his interest in the company.ibid.
the purchasing member moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the notice of appeal was not timely filed after entry of the alternative decree.dickson,supra,th at.the moving member argued that appeal lay from the final judgment after the interest was purchased or the company dissolved.this court held that appeal should have been taken from the alternative decree and dismissed the appeal.ibid.dickson states,the riddle in this appeal arises from the imprecise use of language in section,subdivision b.it provides for any number of juristic activities the court appointment of appraisers,the order of reference to them for the purpose of ascertaining the dissenting share and setting the procedures for producing necessary evidence,the court confirmation of the unanimous or majority appraisal award or determination de novo of the matter,the alternative decree that directs the winding up and dissolution of the company unless the purchasing parties tender their payment in a timely manner,and a judgment on their bond for costs if they fail to act.yet the concluding provision for appellate review employs an entirely different term with a specific determinative any member aggrieved by the action of the court may appeal therefrom.citation.considering that all the other juristic activities in section,subdivision b are preliminary to the issuance of the alternative decree abrams abrams rubaloff associates,d,abrams parallel valuation process for corporations,it is logical to conclude that the issuance of the decree is the action to which the provision for appeal refers.id.at.
management appears to argue that the trial court denial of the petition for buyout under section did not constitute the sort of positive relief in the form of an alternative decree held to be appealable in dickson.not so.
dickson,supra,th,holds that a party aggrieved by a ruling on a request for buyout must appeal that ruling rather than a subsequent judgment.as dickson explained,that a judgment will follow the alternative decree upon a tender does not mean the party making or accepting the tender who is dissatisfied with the valuation may await its entry to appeal that issue.this judgment is on the underlying dissolution complaint for the purpose of terminating that proceeding through denying the requested relief.this judgment is not a vehicle for raising the issues of valuation on appeal,because the dissolution proceeding itself never embraced them.id.at.so too,a party aggrieved by a denial of a motion for buyout under the identical language of section,subdivision d,must appeal from the ruling on the motion rather than from the subsequent judgment in order to challenge the denial of the buyout request.
panakosta would have forfeited its challenge to the denial of its buyout petition if it had delayed until entry of judgment on the cause of action for judicial dissolution.see dickson,supra,th at.however,panakosta did timely file its notice of appeal from the denial of its petition under section.the denial of the petition is appealable,and we proceed to consider panakosta challenge to the trial court ruling 
buyout under section 
panakosta argues that it was entitled to buy out shares pursuant to section even after management dismissed its cause of action for judicial dissolution of the limited partnership.we disagree.
effect of dismissing a cause of action for judicial dissolution 
to resolve panakosta contention that it was wrongly denied its statutory right to buy out management interest,we must construe section.we apply the independent standard of review to questions of statutory interpretation.burden snowden cal th.in discerning the meaning of section,we proceed according to principles of statutory construction.
our fundamental task in interpreting a statute is to determine the legislature intent so as to effectuate the law purpose.we first examine the statutory language,giving it a plain and commonsense meaning.we do not examine that language in isolation,but in the context of the statutory framework as a whole in order to determine its scope and purpose and to harmonize the various parts of the enactment.if the language is clear,courts must generally follow its plain meaning unless a literal interpretation would result in absurd consequences the legislature did not intend.if the statutory language permits more than one reasonable interpretation,courts may consider other aids,such as the statute purpose,legislative history,and public policy.citations.coalition of concerned communities,city of los angeles cal th.if the meaning of the statute remains unclear after examination of both the statute plain language and its legislative history,then we proceed cautiously to apply reason,practicality,and common sense to the language at hand.citation.ailanto properties,city of half moon bay th.with the consequences that will flow from our interpretation in mind,we must give the words of the statute a workable and reasonable interpretation.citation.watkins county of alameda th.
subdivision a of section allows limited partners to seek judicial dissolution if it is not reasonably practicable to carry on the activities of the limited partnership in conformity with the partnership agreement.subdivision b provides that i n any suit for judicial dissolution the other partners may prevent dissolution of the business by purchasing for cash the partnership interests owned by the partners so initiating the proceeding at their fair market value.
apart from section or a provision for buyout rights in the partnership agreement,a limited partner can not compel the buyout of other partners.in cubalevic superior court d cubalevic,this court held that t here is no independent right on the part of one or more stockholders in a corporation to compel the sale to them of the shares of stock of another.id.at.
cubalevic involved a motion to buy out a shareholder who sought involuntary dissolution of a corporation under former sections and.cubalevic,supra,at.these former sections allowed holders of percent or more of the outstanding shares of the corporation to avoid dissolution by moving to buyout the shares belonging to partners seeking to wind up the business.id.at fn.in cubalevic,the cause of action for dissolution was dismissed with prejudice before the purchasing shareholder was able to file a motion for buyout.id.at.the trial court proceeded to ascertain the value of the corporation shares,and the shareholder who dismissed the dissolution cause of action sought a writ of prohibition to prevent the buyout from proceeding.id.at.
cubalevic resulted in the granting of a writ of prohibition.d at.in the absence of an independent right to buy out another shareholder,it must follow that there could be no cause of action stated to compel such a sale whether by way of a or counterclaim which would survive after dismissal of the action for involuntary dissolution of the corporation in which the remedy of purchase is given.it is apparent that the purchasing party here could not bring or maintain a separate action against petitioner the purpose of which would be to compel him to sell his stock to them.under these circumstances,the remedy provided the purchasing party under the provisions of section and section of the corporations code is ancillary to and is dependent upon the existence of the action to compel the involuntary dissolution of the corporation,and upon the dismissal of such action there is nothing left against which the ancillary remedy may be asserted or upon which it may be applied.id.at,italics added.thus,the trial court in cubalevic exceeded its jurisdiction by allowing the buyout to proceed without a pending legal action for dissolution.ibid.
the reasoning of cubalevic was reiterated in ovadia abdullah th ovadia.in ovadia,two brothers holding shares in a corporation sought to buy out the remaining shares held by two other brothers who sought voluntary dissolution.id.at.the trial court granted the purchasing shareholders petition for buyout under section,which provides that in any suit for involuntary dissolution,or in any proceeding for voluntary dissolution initiated by the vote of shareholders representing only percent of the voting power,the holders of percent or more of the voting power of the corporation may avoid the dissolution of the corporation by purchasing for cash the shares owned by the plaintiffs or by the shareholders so initiating the proceeding at their fair value see ovadia,supra,at,fn.
the ovadia court reversed the granting of the petition for buyout on grounds that the voluntary dissolution proceeding was procedurally defective and unsupported by substantial evidence.th at.for lack of a valid cause of action for dissolution,the petition for buyout also could not succeed.ovadia explains that there can be no action under section to avoid the voluntary dissolution of a corporation through purchase of the initiating shareholders stock unless they have,in fact,initiated a voluntary dissolution.id.at.thus,under cubalevic and ovadia,there is no right to buyout another business interest in the absence of an authorizing statute or contractual provision.cubalevic,supra,d at ovadia,supra,th at.
section specifies that a request for buyout of interests in a limited partnership may be made only i n any suit for judicial dissolution.id.at subd.b,italics added.the trial court lacks jurisdiction to grant buyout under section when no cause of action for judicial dissolution is pending.accordingly,the trial court in this case properly denied panakosta petition for buyout of management interest after the cause of action for judicial dissolution was dismissed.
panakosta contends the trial court retains power to grant a petition for buyout under section even after the underlying cause of action for judicial dissolution has been dismissed.specifically,panakosta reasons that t he option to buy out one business partners in the face of a judicial dissolution action is a right which can be invoked and which,once invoked,can not later be taken away by unilateral action of the party who originally sought dissolution.in so arguing,panakosta relies on go pacific health services,th go.
go involved a motion for buyout under section,which had been filed in response to an action for involuntary dissolution of a corporation.th at.the shareholder who was ordered to sell her shares appealed the trial court granting of the motion for buyout on grounds that she should have been allowed first to litigate the merits of her claim for dissolution.id.at the go court rejected the argument and described the inevitable outcome of a motion for buyout under section to be a stay of the dissolution proceedings,valuation of the corporation,and an alternative decree to either pay the designated amount for the shares subject to buyout or a judgment of dissolution entered id.at.with a motion for buyout under section,purchasing parties aspire to buy out the moving party,with minimal expenditure of time and money that would otherwise be spent in litigation,in order to preserve the corporation.if they or the corporation can not pay the purchase price,or decide not to do so,then both sides must walk away,receiving pro rata the proceeds resulting from dissolution of the corporation.id.at.thus,once invoked,the statutory buyout process supplants the action for involuntary dissolution.id.at.
the go court rejected an interpretation of section that would have allowed the purchasing parties to invoke the buyout procedure as a delay tactic by abandoning the buyout request if neither the share valuation nor the prospect of dissolution seemed acceptable.as go explained,if either buyout or dissolution were not the inevitable outcome,then all majority shareholders facing an action for involuntary dissolution would invoke section if only for the purpose of delay,with nothing to lose other than the expense of the appraisal and attorney fees,knowing they could eventually litigate the action for involuntary dissolution on its merits.the plain language of section,and the apparent legislative purpose inherent in the language of the statute,does not permit such an interpretation.id.at.
in go,the cause of action for dissolution of the business was not dismissed.th at.to the contrary,the appellant in go sought to have the dissolution cause of action adjudicated despite the pending motion for buyout.ibid.although go refers to either dissolution or buyout as the inevitable consequence of a motion for buyout,the decision does so in the context of rejecting the contention that a third option for litigating the underlying dissolution claim should be grafted onto the statutory requirement that the alternative decree either allow buyout or result in dissolution.ibid.
go does not contradict cubalevic and ovadia holdings that dismissal of a cause of action for dissolution leaves the trial court without jurisdiction to allow a buyout when the authorizing statute allows buyout as an alternative to dissolution.go,supra,th cubalevic,supra,d ovadia,supra,th.panakosta focus on the trial court obligation to issue an alternative decree when presented with a proper motion for buyout ignores the lack of a condition precedent in this case,namely,a pending cause of action for judicial dissolution.
panakosta argues that management lacked the prerogative to dismiss its cause of action for judicial dissolution once the petition for buyout had been filed under section.panakosta reasons that the right to dismiss a dissolution cause of action must be cut off when a motion for buyout is filed in order to avoid abuse by plaintiffs who,when led to suppose a decision would be adverse,would prevent such decision by dismissing without prejudice and refiling,thus subjecting defendant and the courts to wasteful proceedings and continuous litigation.in so arguing,panakosta acknowledges code of civil procedure section,subdivision c,which provides that a plaintiff may dismiss his or her complaint,or any cause of action asserted in it,in its entirety,or as to any defendant or defendants,with or without prejudice prior to the actual commencement of trial.
under code of civil procedure section,a plaintiff generally has an unfettered right to dismiss a cause of action before commencement of trial.see wells marina city properties,cal d,wells see also christensen dewor developments cal d,collecting authority that a plaintiff may dismiss a cause of action prior to a court ruling on demurrer to the complaint.panakosta does not assert that trial commenced before management dismissed its cause of action for judicial dissolution.instead,panakosta asserts that a plaintiff right to dismiss the action may be cut off where a dispositive motion is pending,before any ruling thereon,if the dismissal appears to be a tactical ploy.italics added.there is no evidence to support panakosta concern that the dismissal was a tactical ploy.management dismissed its cause of action for judicial dissolution with prejudice.thus,management can not refile its judicial dissolution action after the denial of the buyout petition.
management had a right to dismiss the cause of action for judicial dissolution because trial had not yet commenced.our supreme court has noted that prior to commencement of trial a plaintiff right to a voluntary dismissal appears to be absolute.wells,supra,cal d at.panakosta contends that the filing of a section buyout petition constitutes a dispositive motion that has the same effect as commencement of trial so that the court power to rule on a cause of action can not be cut off by a voluntary dismissal.
granted,i n the wake of wells,a substantial and fairly complex body of case law has grown up involving when and when not a plaintiff statutory right to dismiss pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision b is cut off by the presence of some impending dispositive procedure.franklin capital wilson th,franklin capital.franklin capital involved a question of whether a plaintiff may avoid dismissal of a case by voluntarily dismissing a complaint or individual cause of action in order to avoid a ruling.see id.at.by avoiding a dispositive ruling,a plaintiff may preserve the opportunity to refile an otherwise doomed complaint.to avoid this abusive practice,the franklin capital court surveyed the case law and distilled the rule that w hen the dismissal could be said to have been taken in the light of a public and formal indication by the trial court of the legal merits of the case,or in the light of some procedural dereliction by the dismissing plaintiff that made dismissal otherwise inevitable,then the voluntary dismissal is ineffective.id.at.
panakosta filing of a petition for buyout under section constituted neither an indication by the court of the legal merits of management cause of action for dissolution nor did it reveal any fatal procedural problem with management case.consequently,management had the right to dismiss its cause of action for judicial dissolution.
in sum,management dismissal of the dissolution cause of action deprived the trial court of jurisdiction to grant the petition for buyout under section.see cubalevic,supra,d at ovadia,supra,th at.
petition for buyout as a separate action 
panakosta contends the trial court lacked authority to deny its petition for buyout under section because the petition was filed as a new action separate from the judicial dissolution action.panakosta reasons that the filing of a separate action for buyout allowed the trial court to retain jurisdiction to order buyout even after management dismissed the cause of action for judicial dissolution in the related case.we disagree.
the trial court denied panakosta petition for buyout under section because no voluntary dissolution was currently pending before the court.in addition,the trial court ruled that under the rule or primary rights doctrine,t he related civil action for judicial dissolution was the proper forum for any request to shares.the trial court concluded that n o legitimate reason exists to have filed this separate special proceeding,it should have been filed as part of the related civil action.
the trial court ruling reflects the principle that a party can not by negligence or design withhold issues and litigate them in successive actions he may not split his demands or defenses he may not submit his case in piecemeal fashion.flickinger swedlow engineering cal d.thus,a single cause of action can not be split either as to relief demanded or grounds on which recovery is sought and two or more actions brought thereon,and to do so makes pleas in abatement or of res judicata available respectively against all actions other than the one first commenced or on which judgment is first rendered.this principle is fundamental and has been consistently applied by our courts.alston goodwin d.
as explained in part ii,ante,the right of buyout under section is dependent upon a cause of action for judicial dissolution.a request for buyout under section does not constitute a cause of action independent from a judicial dissolution action.instead,buyout represents an alternative to winding up a business when it is not reasonably practicable to carry on the activities of the limited partnership in conformity with the partnership agreement,subd.a.
thus,regardless of whether the buyout petition was properly filed as a separate action,the dismissal of the judicial dissolution action is dispositive and deprived the trial court of jurisdiction to decide the buyout petition under section.
panakosta asserts that subdivision c of section expressly authorizes a separate buyout action by providing that the court,upon application of the purchasing parties,either in the pending action or in a proceeding initiated in the superior court of the proper county by the purchasing parties,shall stay the winding up and dissolution proceeding and shall proceed to ascertain and fix the fair market value of the partnership interests owned by the moving parties.italics added.management disputes this reading of section and distinguishes between voluntary and involuntary dissolutions.in the case of an involuntary dissolution requiring judicial action,the statutory language requires a buyout action to be filed in the judicial dissolution action.in support of this argument,management takes us through the reiteration of buyout provisions originating with section and resulting in section.there is no doubt that the conversion of language from a statute governing buyout of shareholders in a corporation to a statute applying to members of a partnership was imperfect but given the lack of a pending judicial dissolution action,we do not need to decide whether the trial court was correct in concluding that panakosta was precluded from seeking buyout under section in an action separate from the judicial dissolution case.without a pending judicial dissolution action,the trial court was without jurisdiction to allow the buyout petition to proceed.
anti slapp motion 
panakosta contends the trial court erred in granting management motion because code of civil procedure section does not apply to special proceedings such as a petition for buyout under section.we disagree with panakosta reasoning but nonetheless conclude that the trial court erred in granting the motion.
protecting the right of petition 
the legislature enacted the law in response to a a disturbing increase in lawsuits brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances.code civ,subd.a.the statute facilitates the quick dismissal of meritless claims aimed at chilling the first amendment right of petition.as pertinent to this case,subdivision b of section provides that a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.
under the statute,an act in furtherance of a person right of petition under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue includes any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative,executive,or judicial proceeding,or any other official proceeding authorized by law.code civ,subd.e.the right of petition encompasses the filing of a legal action and the requesting of an injunction.briggs eden council for hope opportunity cal th,briggs thomas quintero th.the statute protects activity regardless of whether the action was filed to vindicate an issue of public interest.navellier sletten cal th,navellier briggs,supra,at.thus,the filing of an action for judicial dissolution of a limited partnership constitutes activity protected under code of civil procedure section.
even so,the mere fact an action was filed after protected activity took place does not mean it arose from that activity.the statute can not be read to mean that any claim asserted in an action which arguably was filed in retaliation for the exercise of speech or petition rights falls under code of civil procedure section,whether or not the claim is based on conduct in exercise of those rights.computerxpress,jackson th,see also briggs,supra,cal th at arise from means based upon.city of cotati cashman cal th,cotati.
in cotati,the city of cotati filed an action in state court for a declaration that its rent control ordinance passed constitutional muster.cal th at.the city filed the action even though owners of a mobile home park had already filed a challenge to the constitutionality of the ordinance in federal court.after bringing the state court action,the city asked the federal court to dismiss the owners action on abstention grounds.ibid.the owners in turn filed an motion in state court.id.at.the city opposed the motion,but conceded that its purpose in filing the state court action was to gain a more favorable forum in which to litigate the constitutionality of its mobilehome park rent stabilization ordinance.id.at.the trial court granted the motion,which the high court held was improperly granted.id.at.
the cotati court concluded that the mobile home park owners right of petition was not undermined even though the state court action focused on the same underlying dispute.as the high court explained,to construe arising from in code of civil procedure section,subdivision b as meaning in response to,would in effect render all potential slapp.we presume the legislature did not intend such an absurd result.see generally people mendoza cal th,fn.absurdity aside,to suggest that all arise from the causes of action in response to which they are pled would contravene the statutory scheme governing.see code civ,subd.c defining related cause of action,compulsory,permissive.the legislature expressly has provided that a may arise out of the same transaction,occurrence,or series of transactions or occurrences as the cause of action which the plaintiff alleges,subd.c see also,subd.b,rather than out of that cause of action itself.cotati,supra,cal th at.thus,cotati teaches that and related legal actions do not undermine the right of petition simply because they respond to complaints or seek alternative legal remedies.
whether buyout under section infringes on the moving parties right of petition 
a motion for buyout under section constitutes an alternative remedy allowing limited partners to avoid dissolution of a business they wish to continue.see part ii,ante.although a buyout proceeding under section stays the dissolution cause of action,it does not deprive plaintiffs of the opportunity to seek judicial relief for an unworkable partnership.instead,section provides the defendants in a judicial dissolution proceeding with an alternative remedy.nothing in the buyout procedure of section barred management from judicial redress of its grievance about the partnership.section provides for a buyout of other partners interests to avoid the dissolution of the limited partnership.id.at subd.b.consequently,the trial court erred in ruling that panakosta petition for buyout constituted an action infringing on management right of petition.
the trial court mistakenly concluded that the statute applied because panakosta p etition was clearly filed in response to the cause of action for dissolution of partnership contained in the related civil action italics added.if the trial court were correct,all motions to buy out under section would be subject to motions because all such buyout requests necessarily arise out of the activity of seeking judicial dissolution.the legislature did not intend to subject eve
