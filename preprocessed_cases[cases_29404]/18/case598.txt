jeff and lori miller,husband and wife jeff and lori or the millers,along with their operation jeff miller stables and its predecessor in interest miller brothers stables,appeal from the order of the district court requiring them to pay more than million in restitution to the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic in its role as receiver for the failed oakwood deposit bank company.the millers argue that the district court erred in granting summary judgment for the fdic because they raised multiple issues of material fact concerning the amount of recovery ohio law entitled the fdic to receive.we disagree and hold that jeff conclusory statements,without more,are not enough to raise a genuine issue of material fact.consequently,we affirm the judgment of the district court in its entirety.
the facts giving rise to the instant litigation began to materialize on february,when the oakwood deposit bank company odbc of oakwood,ohio,failed.the fdic took over odbc as its receiver and commenced an investigation to determine the cause of the bank failure.investigators quickly surmised that odbc had failed because its chief executive officer,mark steven miller steve,had engaged in a massive embezzlement scheme causing losses of more than million.steve pled guilty to charges of money laundering and embezzlement and is currently serving a sentence in federal prison.with the criminal investigation at an end,the fdic,in its role as odbc receiver,began to attempt to recover for the bank some of the funds steve had embezzled from the until the bank failure.the search for recoverable assets led the fdic to probe the business relationship between steve and his brother jeff.
jeff and steve were general partners in a operation known as miller brothers stables mbs.mbs trained and raced standardbred that race while pulling a sulky,as in harness racing.the brothers racing operation began in when jeff purchased a acre farm the farm in paulding county,ohio,from which the brothers bred and trained their horses.at its zenith,mbs consisted of more than forty standardbred racing horses,a number of foals and yearlings,and a stake in eternal camnation stables in his guilty plea and in an affidavit before the district court in this civil proceeding,steve admitted that he embezzled the jeff used to purchase the farm from odbc.jeff denied that he had any knowledge of the funds illicit origin and instead asserted that he believed that the money was a legitimate loan from odbc.he further claimed to have made regular payments on the loan however,according to jeff,he made these payments directly to steve rather than to odbc.
in,jeff and lori joined with steve,steve wife janet miller janet,and another relative seth miller seth to purchase acres of land adjacent to the farm the adjacent property.jeff and lori owned a share of the adjacent property.steve admitted to embezzling from odbc the purchase price for the property.the addition to the farm,which more than doubled its original size,enabled the millers to expand their and breeding operation.it also allowed their son to build a house on a portion of the adjacent property.jeff and lori assert that they did not know that steve had embezzled the funds they do,however,admit that they made no payments to odbc or anyone else to repay the money used to purchase the adjacent property.following the failure of odbc and steve indictment,jeff transferred all of mbs assets to a new sole proprietorship,jeff miller stables jms,in which steve had no interest.jeff made the transfer because the rules of the united states trotting association usta prevent any horse whose owner is under indictment from racing in a sanctioned event.the transfer of the assets from mbs to jms occurred without the payment of any consideration.
to aid its investigation,the fdic hired a team of forensic accountants to examine odbc books and to determine if any of the transactions were fraudulent.the accountants traced the money steve advanced from odbc to various ledger accounts of mbs.if the accountants saw that the offsetting entries contained even a very general description such as time deposit or note,they did not label the underlying transfer of funds as fraudulent.nor did the accountants label as fraudulent transactions between deposit accounts held by different entities steve controlled.the accountants instead identified several specific ledger accounts as the source of fraudulent funds and traced those funds from the bank to the entities.the forensic accountants labeled only these funds as fraudulent.the accountants may report concluded that mb s received in fraudulent transfers from odbc.mb s also benefitted from of fraudulent cashier checks drawn on odbc and paid to third parties on mb s behalf,making the total amount of embezzled funds used by steve to maintain mbs as a going concern.this sum was in addition to the funds steve embezzled to purchase the farm and the adjacent property.
armed with this information,the fdic filed suit against jeff,lori,mbs,and jms on september,seeking disgorgement of the sums of money by which jeff,lori,and jeff operations had been unjustly enriched importantly,the fdic did not allege that jeff and lori had actual knowledge of steve embezzlement scheme.on march,the district court entered summary judgment in favor of the fdic as to the used to purchase the farm and the used to purchase the adjacent property the district court,however,denied summary judgment as to the fdic claim for the more than million that jeff racing operation allegedly benefitted from the funds steve embezzled from odbc.the district court held that the fdic had failed to prove that steve had not committed fraud on the partnership.fraud on the partnership would prevent the imputation of knowledge of steve embezzlement to jeff and thereby prevent the fdic recovery.see ohio ann.following this partial denial of its summary judgment motion,the fdic unsuccessfully sought reconsideration of the district court order and permission to file an interlocutory appeal.
on august,the district court entered an order requiring the parties to brief the issue of who held the burden of proving fraud on the partnership under ohio law.after hearing arguments from counsel,the district court concluded that jeff,as the party asserting the exception,bore the burden of proving that steve had defrauded the partnership.the district court determined that in light of the evidence presented by both parties,jeff had not carried his burden to prove fraud.the district court also held that the nearly pages of purse receipts reflecting the earnings of mb s winning horses over the period from did not undermine the forensic accountants conclusions.consequently,the district court entered summary judgment on the fdic final claim in the amount of.the millers timely filed their appeal.
the millers argue that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on each of the three claims made by the fdic for restitution.jeff and lori contend that genuine issues of material fact exist thereby making summary judgment inappropriate.we review a district court grant of a summary judgment motion de novo.smith wholesale reynolds tobacco,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute,and one party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c emphasis added.the moving party may meet is burden by showing that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party case.celotex catrett,d.by its very terms,this standard provides that the existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment anderson liberty lobby,d.a trial is required only when there are any genuine factual issues that properly can only be resolved by a finder of fact because they may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party.id.at.thus,t he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff position will be insufficient to require a trial,id.at.but we must be careful to draw all justifiable inferences in the nonmovant favor.id.at.summary judgment is an integral part of the federal rules as a whole,which are designed to secure the just,speedy,and inexpensive determination of every action rather than a disfavored procedural shortcut.celotex,at.quoting.
the millers first assignment of error surrounds the district court granting summary judgment in favor of the fdic as to the used to purchase the farm in.they make two arguments on appeal.jeff and lori first claim that federal rule of evidence required the district court to draw the conclusion that steve,a convicted felon,lied in his affidavit when steve asserted that he embezzled the.additionally,they argue that a jury could reasonably find that they made payments on what they perceived to be a loan from odbc.the fdic responds by arguing that rule merely allows the impeachment of a party who stands convicted of a crime involving dishonesty rather than requires the district court to draw any negative inference.consequently,the fdic asserts that the district court properly granted summary judgment as to the funds employed to purchase the farm.
under ohio law,in order for the fdic to recover under a theory of unjust enrichment,it must prove that odbc conferred a benefit upon jeff,lori,and jeff operations that they had knowledge of this benefit and that it would be unjust for them to retain this benefit without payment.hambleton barry,ohio,see also johnson microsoft,ohio.unjust enrichment arises out of a contract implied in law.hummel hummel,ohio.contracts implied in law are not true contracts,id.at,but instead are implied by courts when a party retains money or benefits which in justice and equity belong to another.id.at.ohio law contains no requirement that a party have acted improperly for an action based upon to succeed.reisenfeld network group,cir applying ohio law.passive retention of a benefit where such retention is unconscionable is enough to trigger liability.cosby cosby,ohio app d,rev on other grounds,ohio,see also estate of woodruff istanich,at.noting that whether retention of the benefit would be unconscionable is one element to consider before granting a remedy in an unjust enrichment claim.
steve submitted an affidavit to the district court in which he admitted to embezzling the in.the report of the forensic accountants does not contain a finding with regard to the used to purchase the farm because the accountants did not go back that far in time in their efforts to reconstruct odbc books.the millers argue that the district court erred by refusing to draw the conclusion that steve,a convicted felon,lied in his affidavit.federal rule of evidence provides in pertinent part 
for the purpose of attacking the character for truthfulness of a witness evidence that any witness has been convicted of a crime shall be admitted regardless of the punishment,if it readily can be determined that establishing the elements of the crime required proof or admission of an act of dishonesty or false statement by the witness.
a emphasis added.embezzlement is a crime of dishonesty that is always admissible to attack the character of a witness.mchenry chadwick,cir.however,rule contains no language requiring the court to necessarily draw the inference that the witness testimony is untrue.see guerrero white,wl,at.lexis,at cir,noting that even after evidence of a past conviction is admitted under rule,the witness credibility remained a question for the trier of fact based on both his testimony and the inferences to be drawn from the record as a whole.it is also inappropriate for a court to make credibility determinations when considering a motion for summary judgment.reeves sanderson plumbing,d noting that credibility determinations are jury functions,not those of a judge quoting anderson,at.we therefore hold that it was not error for the district court to decline to draw an inference as to steve credibility.
jeff and lori second argument is that a rational trier of fact could find that they had made payments to jeff brother on what they perceived to be a loan.in his affidavit in response to the fdic motion for summary judgment,jeff stated that he and lori made payments by turning the checks over to steve that we in turn received from a tenant who was purchasing a parcel from us under land contract and from other sources.aff.of jeff miller at.despite this assertion,the millers failed to present the district court with a copy of even a single check that they turned over to steve as partial payment on their obligation to odbc.nor did they present a bank statement showing a series of transfers at standard intervals from their account to steve for similar amounts.the millers failed even to present or name one witness who could testify that they made a single payment to steve on the purported loan.as the supreme court has held,w hen the moving party has carried its burden under rule c,including via a properly sworn affidavit,its opponent must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d citation omitted.through their complete failure to provide any corroboration for their bare assertion that they made payments on the loan to steve,the millers have fallen far short of raising a genuine issue for trial.jeff and lori received from odbc and knew that they used the funds to purchase and enjoy the benefit of their acre farm.because steve embezzled the money and the millers have made no payments to odbc,it would be inequitable for the millers to keep the benefit of the farm without repaying the funds used to purchase it to odbc.cosby,at passive retention of a benefit where such retention is inequitable triggers liability.we therefore find that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to the fdic in regard to the used to purchase the farm in.
jeff and lori next assert that the district court erred by granting summary judgment on the fdic claim for reimbursement of the expended to purchase the adjacent property.the millers argue that it is inequitable to require them to pay for land they will never enjoy because the government has obtained a forfeiture order as to steve and janet miller undivided interest in the land.app.br.at.jeff and lori further argue that even if restitution is proper,the district court erred in calculating the amount due by basing the award upon the amount lost by odbc rather than the value gained by jeff and lori.the millers concede that they have failed to make any payments to odbc on the loan used to purchase the adjacent property and further admit that it would be unjust for them to keep the property without payment.app.br.at.the fdic wholeheartedly agrees with this assessment and urges us to reject the millers remaining arguments.
jeff and lori first they have not benefitted from ownership of the adjacent without merit.the millers used the property,located next to the farm,to aid in the expansion of jeff operation and even allowed their son to build a home on part of the property.under any definition of the term benefit,the millers realized significant advantages upon acquiring their share of the adjacent property.it is also undisputed that jeff and lori have retained the money that ultimately came from odbc and purchased the property without repayment.the fdic seeks repayment of the money the millers have improperly retained.see hummel,at u njust enrichment of a person occurs when he has and retains money or benefits which in justice and equity belong to another.emphasis added.because we find that jeff and lori have received significant benefits from their use of odbc money,we hold that the district court did not err in its finding that the millers knowingly received a benefit.
jeff and lori second argument that the district court erred in its calculation of the restitution owed is also incorrect.the total purchase price for the property was.dividing this purchase price by acres,yields a price of exactly.the district court then deducted the two acres of the adjacent property owned by seth.this left acres,which the district court divided evenly between jeff,lori,steve,and janet.simple math yields the result that jeff and lori unjustly retained the benefit of,as the district court found.the millers are correct that we have held that the proper measure of liability is the reasonable value of services provided.reisenfeld,at.ohio case law,however,further clarifies that t he reasonable value of the benefit conferred is the monetary amount expended for the services provided.city of girard leatherworks,at.emphasis added citing vincent med.ctr.sader,ohio app d.the service provided by odbc was the embezzled funds used for the purchase of the adjacent property.the millers do not contest the purchase price of the property or the propriety of the district court determination of their ownership share therein.further,the report of the forensic accountants specifically labeled the entire sum used to purchase the acre parcel as embezzled from obdc.we therefore hold that the district court did not err under ohio law in its calculation of the appropriate amount of damages owed to the fdic 
the final assignments of error involve the district court entry of summary judgment as to the the fdic alleged mbs,and by extension jms,benefitted from steve embezzlement scheme.jeff raises two primary arguments on appeal.first,jeff argues that the district court erred by requiring him to prove that there was fraud on the partnership to invoke the exemption provided by ohio revised code section,rather than requiring the fdic to prove that steve did not defraud the partnership.alternatively,jeff asserts that even if the district court did properly hold that jeff and the operations are liable to the fdic,the district court erred by declining to hold a trial on the proper amount of damages.we will consider each issue in turn.
jeff argues that the district court erred in construing the provisions of section of the ohio revised code,which allows a court to impute knowledge of an action taken by one partner to all partners in a partnership except in the case of fraud on the partnership committed by or with the consent of that partner.ohio ann.in its order granting summary judgment,the district court held that jeff had the burden to prove that the exception applied.because jeff provided no concrete evidence,other than his own assertions of fraud,that steve had defrauded the partnership,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the fdic.we review the district court statutory construction of ohio law under the same de novo standard that applies to summary judgment generally.see ble int l reform comm.sytsma,cir.
jeff is correct that there is a dearth of ohio case law interpreting section.we,along with the district court,have been unable to find any case law on point as to what party has the burden of persuasion on the issue of asserting the exception.as with any other instance in which we must interpret a state law,when there is no state case law construing a state statute,we must predict how the state highest court would interpret the statute.united states simpson,cir citing meridian mut.ins.kellman,cir.the ohio supreme court has provided clear guidance on the issue of who bears the burden of persuasion in proving exceptions to statutes in general the burden rests upon the party who,as the basis of his claim or defense,asserts that he is within an exception or an exemption in a contractual stipulation or a statute to prove all the facts necessary to bring himself within such exception or exemption.speidel schaller,ohio app,citation omitted see also state ex rel.broad.city of cleveland,ohio,under ohio law,a person asserting an exception is required to prove the facts warranting such an exception.carver twp.of deerfield,ohio app d,same.with the ohio courts having consistently followed this general principle of statutory construction,we have no difficulty in holding that the district court did not err by requiring jeff to bear the burden of proof in regard to the exception contained within section.
we next turn our attention to whether the fdic provided the district court with sufficient proof as to the amount of money steve embezzled to support mb s ongoing operations to allow the district court to grant summary judgment.jeff argues that he provided the district court with enough evidence to require a trial on the issue of whether,and in what amount,mbs benefitted from steve embezzlement scheme.specifically,jeff notes that he provided the district court with nearly two hundred pages of reports from the usta detailing the winnings that mbs horses,trainers,and jockeys earned in races from.these receipts reveal that mbs should have received in revenue from its racing operation during those four years.because the total amount deposited in mbs accounts during the years in question was,jeff argues that at most mbs was unjustly enriched by less than the judgment issued by the district court.
there are several flaws with jeff argument.jeff assumes that all of the funds mbs earned through its racing winnings actually made it into mbs bank accounts.the affidavit jeff provided in opposition to the fdic summary judgment motion does not support this contention.jeff stated,under oath,that a lmost without exception,i turned all checks over to steve miller for deposit in the mbs account.aff.of jeff miller at.viewed in the light most favorable to jeff,all jeff can demonstrate is that in checks made it into the hands of steve miller.jeff has not provided any bank records,copies of checks actually deposited,or his own accountants report to demonstrate how much,if any,of these funds steve actually deposited.by contrast,steve affidavit affirmatively states that he embezzled more than million to fund the ongoing operations of mbs.aff.of steve miller at.the report of the fdic forensic accountants only traced funds that originated at odbc and made their way into designated accounts of mbs that did not contain even the most general of offsetting entries.thus,the fdic can trace directly from odbc into mbs accounts and another from odbc to third parties in satisfaction of debts owed by mbs.
as the district court demonstrated in its order granting summary judgment,jeff own mathematical calculations do not withstand scrutiny.the figures cited by jeff as revenues inappropriately include the of obligations to third parties that mbs paid with embezzled funds.jeff revenue figures also include winnings from eternal camnation stables,an entirely separate partnership with separate accounts that the fdic did not allege any embezzled money reached.upon subtracting the payments to third parties and eternal camnation winnings,the difference between the revenues that jeff asserted mbs earned and the total deposits into mbs accounts equaled.as noted above,jeff can not demonstrate that any of these revenues actually made it into mbs accounts.jeff only can assert that he gave the checks to his brother steve.aff.of jeff miller at.the district court thus faced a set of figures whose authenticity a team of forensic accountants and numerous spreadsheets vouched for and a contrasting set of assertions by jeff that included extraneous revenues from other business ventures and a lack of any proof that the funds ever actually reached mbs.summary judgment is appropriate where reasonable minds could not disagree as to the conclusion to be drawn from the evidence.anderson,at.noting that summary judgment and a motion for a directed verdict under rule are governed by essentially the same standard.because the fdic could trace the funds directly from odbc to mbs,the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of the fdic and holding that mbs received in embezzled funds to support its ongoing operations.see id.at.noting that a court should grant summary judgment where the evidence is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.
our dissenting colleague takes issue with our analysis and argues that it is uncontested that steve handled all things financial,did all of the banking,and kept all of the records pertaining to the business.dis.op.at.the quoted conclusory statements are all contained in jeff affidavit and are presented without elaboration.yet,the fdic presented evidence that,far from being a fiscal neophyte,jeff maintained nearly complete control of mbs checkbook.out of checks written on the account from january,until december,jeff signature appears on of them.jeff has not countered this evidence in any way.jeff himself has provided us with nearly two hundred pages detailing the winnings of mbs steeds.thus,far from being in the dark because of steve monopolization of mbs financial information,dis.op.at,jeff had reason to know exactly how much mb s spent and what revenues it received.consequently,jeff also had reason to know of the benefit conferred by the embezzled money because the racing revenues did not support the expenditures that ohio law requires to find unjust enrichment.hambleton,at requiring solely knowledge of the benefit,not of the benefit origin,to find unjust enrichment.
it is jeff who bears the burden of proof as to the fraud on the partnership exception.see state ex rel.broad,at.nonetheless,it is the fdic that has come forth with the all of the hard evidence.jeff has failed to produce even one endorsed check to support his contention that steve made all mbs deposits and monopolized mbs finances.the fdic has provided checks that prove otherwise.no rational juror could find that jeff bare assertions of ignorance outweigh this profusion of paperwork.anderson,at.only when the factual issues may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party must a district court conduct a trial.despite the dissent protestations otherwise,this is hardly a case in which one partner managed the business without the other partner involvement.dis.op.at.
merchants advance,boukzam,wl,demonstrates that represents the proper measure of damages under ohio law.in merchants advance,the ohio court of appeals faced a similar circumstance where the plaintiff sought to recover from the new owner proceeds from a loan made to a prior owner of a chain of restaurants.the prior owner entered into an agreement with the plaintiff whereby the plaintiff would provide to fund the restaurants normal business operations in return for the right to receive from the restaurants future receipts.id.at.after the plaintiff made the final advance of the,the prior owner transferred the restaurants to the new owner,who promptly breached the agreement by refusing to turn over any of the receipts.id.at.the plaintiff sued,claiming that the new owner was unjustly enriched by the funds the prior owner had received.id.at.the ohio court of appeals held that even though the prior owner had already spent the monies advanced by the plaintiff,and thus not retained them,the new owner had to refund the money the plaintiff loaned.id.at.the benefit conferred by the plaintiff that the new owner retained was not the advanced money but rather the going concerns,the restaurants whose operations the money funded.id.at.
the facts here are quite similar.the funds steve embezzled allowed mbs to operate.after steve indictment,jeff transferred all of mbs assets to his new sole proprietorship,jms.the benefit jeff retained was a going concern he knew of this benefit,see ohio ann.and it would be unjust to allow jeff to retain the benefit.thus,the district court did not err in ordering jeff to pay restitution to the fdic as receiver for odbc in the amount of.id.at.
while we have resolved all the legal issues,the dissent says one issue is yet concern that our resolution of this case is somehow unfair.how can it be proper for jeff miller,whom we must and do assume was completely unknowledgeable of his brother embezzlement scheme,to find himself facing a judgment of more than million the dissent call for a jury to decide the issue highlights this quandary.
we could respond by noting that it is not the province of the jury to decide issues of equity the jury domain is only to decide those claims that are,or would have been,cognizable at common law.see city of monterey del monte dunes,d.however,the dissent concern stems from its assumption that jeff is also a victim in this case,along with the odbc depositors,whose money steve embezzled and in whose shoes the fdic stands.ohio elected legislature and courts have reasonably determined as a matter of public policy that where such a situation arises,absent fraud or some other affirmative defense,it is the original the is to be made whole.cosby,at noting that passive retention of a benefit where such retention is unconscionable is enough to trigger liability.as our job in this case is solely to apply ohio law,our role is to apply ohio resolution of this public policy question,not to second guess the determination or shift the question to a jury for further equitable deliberation.ohio has already deliberated the issue.commensurate with the our limited judicial role,we have enforced its decision about where the loss should lie.
because the defendants have failed to demonstrate that there is any genuine issue as to any material fact,the district court was correct to employ summary judgment to find in favor of the fdic as to its unjust enrichment claims under ohio law.c.we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court in its entirety and remand the case for further proceedings.
i concur with the lead opinion in this case.but i write separately to further explain why i believe that the district court did not err in holding jeff liable to the fdic for the approximately million benefit conferred on mbs by steve embezzlement from odbc.this discussion pays particular attention to the rationale underlying the exception in explaining why jeff was unable to successfully invoke the doctrine as a defense to the fdic claim.
steve of course knew that mbs was enriched to the tune of million that he had embezzled from odbc.the question before us,however,is whether this knowledge may be imputed to jeff under ohio.this statute allows a court to impute knowledge of an action taken by one partner to all the partners in a partnership,except in the case of a fraud on the partnership.id.the resolution of this case therefore depends on our construction of that provision of the ohio code.
section of the ohio revised code states that 
n otice to any partner of any matter relating to partnership affairs,and the knowledge of the partner acting in the particular matter,acquired while a partner or then present to his mind,and the knowledge of any other partner who reasonably could and should have communicated it to the acting partner,operate as notice to or knowledge of the partnership,except in the case of a fraud on the partnership committed by or with the consent of that partner.
in other words,the knowledge of one partner of any matter relating to partnership affairs will generally be imputed to the other partners.but the statute also creates the exception that knowledge will not be imputed to the other partners in the case of a fraud on the partnership committed by or with the consent of that partner.ohio.
the statutory text codifies,section of the uniform partnership act of upa.a treatise explains the rationale behind upa as follows upa anticipates that there is communication among partners,imputes knowledge where such communication should exist,and,by creating a cost for noncommunication,imposes a need for communication.william callison maureen sullivan,partnership law practice general and limited partnerships.
the treatise also explains that the main goal of the exception is to allow a partnership that has been defrauded by one of its partners to sue the defrauding partner.id.without this exception,knowledge of the fraud would be imputed to the innocent partners.this would mean that a partnership could not sue that partner for fraud because knowledge of the fraud defeats one of the elements of a fraud action.id.the exception therefore aims to avoid the absurd situation where an innocent partner is barred from suing another partner who defrauds the partnership.
but the exception is not intended to prevent third parties from pursuing claims against the entire partnership for unjust enrichment.as the district court explained in grassmueck american shorthorn association,d,the exception 
does not apply when the fraud is committed for the benefit of the partnership,with respect to the rights of third parties acting without knowledge of the fraud,or when the partner perpetrating the fraud acts as the sole representative or of the partnership.under such circumstances,the partnership is charged with the knowledge of that partner and can not use lack of knowledge as a defense.
id.at citations omitted,aff cir.
just to be clear,the language from grassmueck was construing the version of the uniform partnership act,not the version that has been codified in ohio.grassmueck,d at citing f of the upa of.but the version of the upa did not change the way the exception was expressed.compare upa of f imputing the knowledge of one partner to the entire partnership except in the case of a fraud on the partnership committed by or with the consent of that partner,with upa using identical language to state the exception.
jeff attempts to defend himself from the fdic action by invoking the exception,claiming that steve embezzlement from odbc constituted fraud on mbs.he also alleges that steve defrauded mbs by embezzling from mbs directly.
at first glance,jeff position seems plausible.there is no reason to doubt jeff claim that he knew nothing of steve embezzlement from odbc.nor is the assertion that steve embezzled from mbs entirely implausible although jeff provides no persuasive evidence of this allegation.jeff reasons that the fdic is not entitled to summary judgment because these are instances of fraud on the partnership that prevent steve knowledge of mbs million benefit from being imputed to jeff.
our dissenting colleague is apparently persuaded by this line of reasoning,concluding that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether jeff may invoke the exception.as a result,our dissenting colleague concludes that the fdic is not entitled to summary judgment for the million.
jeff argument,however,is without merit for several reasons.first,steve embezzlement from odbc was not a fraud on the partnership because mbs benefitted from the embezzlement.see ohio.jeff is therefore unable to invoke the exception because partners may not do so when the fraud is committed for the benefit of the partnership.see grassmueck,d at.
nor can jeff rely on allegations of steve embezzlement from mbs to protect himself from liability to the fdic.this is because the exception does not apply with respect to the rights of third parties acting without knowledge of the fraud.id.the relevant third party in this case is the fdic,which had no knowledge of steve purported embezzlement from mb indeed,the question of whether steve embezzled from mbs is entirely irrelevant to the nature of the fdic claim,which is based solely on recovering the money that steve embezzled from odbc including the million.see hambleton barry,ohio,stating the elements of unjust enrichment.
moreover,the main purpose of the exception,as previously noted,is to permit innocent partners to sue a fellow partner who has defrauded the partnership.without the exception,the rule would prevent the innocent partners from doing so.but this right of jeff to sue steve for any funds that the latter may have embezzled from mbs does not bar the fdic,as an innocent third party,from pursuing its action against jeff for the million that was embezzled from odbc.see grassmueck,d at explaining that the exception can not be used to undermine the rights of third parties who have no knowledge of the particular fraud at issue.
jeff main response to the fdic claim is that steve had complete control over mbs finances.but there are two problems with this response.first,as the lead opinion accurately notes,the claim that jeff had no such control is simply wrong jeff signed approximately checks on behalf of mbs.he was also able to produce reams of documentation detailing mbs winnings from horse racing.these facts all but eviscerate the notion that jeff had no control over mbs finances.
then there is the second problem.even assuming arguendo that jeff indeed ignored all financial matters relating to mbs,part iii above explains why he can not invoke the exception to avoid liability to the fdic,which is an innocent third party.i therefore conclude that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to the fdic with respect to the million.
for all the reasons set forth above,i concur with the lead opinion.
even accepting that jeff bears the burden of proof regarding the exception to personal liability,jeff proffered sufficient evidence such that a genuine issue of material fact existed on the issue of fraud on the partnership.maj op.at.i would reverse the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the fdic and remand for a trial with respect to the personal liability of jeff individually as a partner for the partnership liability.therefore,i respectfully dissent.
as a preliminary matter,i note that the failure of the district court to enter separate judgments in this case on the fdic different claims against the different plaintiffs has added to the confusion in this appeal.the fdic motion for summary judgment makes clear its four distinct claims mbs and jeff miller as a general partner of mbs,jointly and severally jeff miller amount to be determined representing the value of the mbs partnership at the time of the transfer of substantially all of its assets to jms jeff and lori miller,jointly and severally,on the acres of land in paulding county and jeff and lori miller,jointly and severally,for their share of the acres of land in paulding county.at.
the fdic claims against jeff and lori for unjust enrichment in the amounts of and and largely uncontested on appeal except to the extent that these properties were also subject to forfeiture as a result of steve criminal trial,and it is unclear whether that forfeiture is subordinate to these claims.the government is not entitled to claim either twice.with regard to claim,jeff and lori are held liable for unjust enrichment in proportion to their share of the price of acquiring the property i agree with the majority that we should affirm the judgment of the district court with respect to these claims.
i also agree that jeff and jms are liable for unjust enrichment on claim to the extent of the partnership assets transferred to jeff,to be valued by the district court.with the approval of the district court in steve criminal case,all mbs assets were transferred to jms,without consideration,to maintain the operational value of the business.at.united states trotting association rules prohibited mbs horses from racing if steve,under indictment,remained involved with the partnership.at.upon transfer of mbs assets to jeff,according to steve,t he value of mbs exceeded million.at.jeff does not contest that these jms assets must be forfeited to the government,either as part of steve criminal proceedings or here to the extent that the partnership is liable,and i agree that jeff has been unjustly enriched by the transfer of these assets and that the fdic is entitled to the value of the assets.at.i would remand to the district court to decide the appropriate valuation date.
i dissent only from the majority conclusion on the fdic first personal liability as a partner,derivative of mbs unjust enrichment,for the entire embezzled by steve and deposited in the partnership bank account.as the district court correctly pointed out,the critical question here is whether steve committed a fraud on the partnership under section of the ohio revised code if he did,personal liability should not flow from mb s to jeff as a partner for any unpaid portion of the partnership debt,assuming jeff had no actual knowledge of the fraud.the district court answered this question twice,initially concluding that the fdic was not entitled to summary judgment against jeff because it failed to rebut jeff testimony that he was ignorant as to the source of the funds deposited in the partnership bank account and thus failed to demonstrate that knowledge should be imputed to jeff.at on the fdic motion for reconsideration,the district court shifted the burden of proof from the fdic to jeff to prove fraud on the partnership.however,the court left in place its prior ruling that there was an issue of fact as to jeff actual knowledge of any embezzlement and his brother fraud.the fdic had raised an argument in its brief that jeff should have known the discrepancy existed,but,by its ruling,the district court rejected that argument.as to the issue,the district court then ruled that jeff had failed to raise enough evidence of to raise a genuine issue of material fact of fraud on the partnership to defeat the fdic summary judgment motion.however,even with the burden of proof on jeff as to the exception,i believe that the district court should have denied summary judgment for the following reasons.
a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether steve committed a fraud on the partnership.steve purported fraud on the partnership would defeat the imputation of the knowledge of mbs unjust enrichment from steve to jeff,and thus remove personal liability flowing from the partnership to jeff.
the following facts put forth by jeff are uncontested.in his affidavit in opposition to summary judgment,jeff stated that steve handled all things financial,did all of the banking,and kept all of the records pertaining to the business at his home.at.the affidavit continued t he statements from our checking account even went to steve home,not the farm.id.jeff turned over to steve all revenue received by mbs to pay the farm note and other obligations.id.he knew nothing of steve embezzlement.
it is undisputed that steve embezzled the from oakwood which he transferred into mbs bank account or used to purchase the two properties.jeff does not question this.appellant br.at.the parties differ on the amount earned by mbs over the relevant period.jeff asserts that mbs had income of from race winnings during this period which were turned over to steve to pay the operating expenses of the partnership,while the fdic asserts that mbs had income of jeff turned all winnings over to steve.the total amount of deposits in mbs bank account during its existence was.the total amount of checks written from the mbs account was.
this evidence reveals that steve used the mbs account as his own personal slush fund,stealing both from oakwood and the partnership,while he deceitfully portrayed the financial affairs of the partnership as if it were a profitable business.the difference between the sum of embezzled funds plus mbs revenue and mbs deposits reveals a persuasive measure of mbs revenue stolen by steve steve stole money from oakwood and mixed it together with that stolen from the partnership in the mbs account.neither party disputes that steve had charge of managing mbs funds.without steve deposit of funds stolen from oakwood and with financial transparency and honest accounting,the partnership budget shortfalls would have become apparent to jeff,and the partnership would have ended for lack of economic viability with minimal personal liability to jeff.instead,the evidence gives rise to the inference that steve artificially propped up mbs financially by making embezzled funds available to the partnership in mbs bank account.jeff has testified that he had no idea that this was going on.steve monopolization of mbs financial situation shielded that information from jeff to ensure the ongoing viability of his fraudulent scheme steve apparently made sure to keep enough money in the mbs account so that the checks jeff wrote did not bounce.
the district court should have found the above allegations and evidence sufficient to defeat summary judgment even under the standard it followed furthermore,the mere fact that jeff has provided evidence that steve misappropriated partnership funds without his actual knowledge is sufficient to show fraud on the partnership.see ventre datronic rental,c,wl,at,unpublished denying a motion to dismiss where is not imputed knowledge of partner who investigated the accounting of alleged fraudulent transactions because plaintiff alleged that other partners committed fraud on the partnership by misappropriating and diverting partnership funds batchelor fort scott,no,wl,at.may,unpublished no knowledge of fraud imputed to the partnership where partner arranged for partnership money to be paid out as a secret commission to a third partner and this along with other actions by the partner constituted a fraud on the partnership allied chemical dehaven,partnership not bound by partner knowledge that other partner deal with a chemical company benefitted the chemical company at the expense of the partnership where the misappropriation of funds from the partnership by this other partner through this deal constituted a fraud on the partnership mcintosh detroit sav.bank,partner committed fraud on the partnership by depositing partnership funds into his own account,therefore the court did not impute knowledge of that partner fraud to the partnership see also marine commissioner,wl embezzlement by a partner constitutes a fraud on the partnership such that knowledge of that embezzlement should not be imputed to the partnership.
courts have also held that a partner has committed fraud on the partnership where one partner maintained sole responsibility for a business function and managed that business of the partnership as if it were doing fine when in fact it was not.see invest almaz forest prods,cir holding that a reasonable jury could find fraud on the partnership for fraudulent concealment where a joint maintained sole responsibility over selecting,preparing,and purchasing a manufacturing plant for a construction materials manufacturer the innocent partner allegedly discovered violations of environmental regulations at the plant site,knew that the plant was overvalued,and appreciated the obsolescence of the plant equipment and carried through on the business deal as if everything was ok,when in fact that partner ought to have told the innocent party of those material facts.in oreto limbach,wl ohio app.dist,an unpublished ohio decision,the court dealt with the precise situation in which one partner managed the business without the other partner involvement.wl at.the partner managing the business never told the other partner that he had received notice of a tax assessment and left it unpaid.id.the court held that the innocent partner had alleged enough on the issue of fraud on the partnership to survive a motion to dismiss a request for a hearing on his personal liability.id.likewise here,jeff deserves a trial where a genuine issue of fact exists as to whether steve committed a fraud on the partnership by stealing mb s funds and taking sole control over partnership funds as part of a scheme to benefit from misrepresenting the state of the partnership finances.
the concurring opinion seems to agree that there is insufficient proof that jeff had actual knowledge of the embezzlement or,at least,he takes no issue with the district court previous ruling,which is still intact,that jeff had no actual knowledge.the concurrence instead focuses on the question and argues that it is inapplicable in this situation.i disagree.
the concurrence relies heavily on the contention that the exception does not apply with respect to the rights of third parties acting without knowledge of the fraud.conc.op.at citing grassmueck am.shorthorn,d.the court in grassmueck relies on the american jurisprudence treatise for its position that the rights of innocent third parties should not be affected by exception.see partnership.but this provision seems to apply only in the context of the relationship between the partnership and the innocent third party.it says nothing of the relationship between innocent partner and innocent third party.i have not suggested that the partnership here should be able to avail itself of the exception to relieve it of any liability to oakwood bank.indeed,i agree with the majority that summary judgment is appropriate with respect to all of the funds that unjustly enriched the partnership itself.see supra at.however,this is simply not relevant to the question of whether jeff,an innocent party as well,may avail himself of the exception in order to limit his personal liability.
the concurrence also suggests that exception should not apply when the fraud is committed for the benefit of the partnership.the concurrence then asserts,wit
