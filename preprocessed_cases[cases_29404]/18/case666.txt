litigation stemming from the attempted,but failed,takeover of taubman centers,tci by simon property group,spg gives rise to this appeal.lionel glancy glancy,a california citizen,filed an action,containing class and claims,against tci and various members of the tci board of directors tci board or board,alleging that tci opposition to spg tender offer was a breach of the fiduciary duties of the tci board.the district court dismissed the action,ruling that because complete diversity of parties did not exist the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the case.the district court reached this conclusion because it ruled that an absent partnership,which owned a sizeable portion of tci shares,had an interest in the litigation that would be impeded or impaired by a disposition in its absence but could not be joined as a defendant because two general partners were citizens of the same state as plaintiff glancy.on appeal,the question is whether that absentee partnership is an indispensable party pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b such that the action must be dismissed rather than proceed in the partnership absence.for the following reasons,we vacate the district court judgment and remand the case back to the district court for further proceedings.
background 
as an initial caveat,we note that the following rendition of facts is based upon our reading of the documents compiled by the parties at an early stage of the litigation.the district court upon remand may receive additional factual and evidentiary materials that may appropriately lead to different factual conclusions.the organization of tci,its affiliated partnerships,and the enterprises of the taubman family is complex and laden with acronyms.tci is a publicly traded corporation that was incorporated in michigan in and that has its principal place of business in michigan.tci is organized as a corporate real estate investment trust reit,which is a legal entity that holds real estate interests and,through its payment of dividends,is able to reduce or avoid incurring federal income tax at the corporate level,allowing shareholders to participate in real estate investments without the double taxation of income joint appendix at tci initial public offering prospectus.tci sole asset is a partial ownership stake in taubman realty group limited partnership trg,which owns,operates,manages,leases,and develops shopping centers around the country.alfred taubman,along with several members of his family,formed trg in,to consolidate their various shopping center interests in a single partnership.interests in trg were parceled out in units.the taubman family controlled a share of these units,but about of trg units were controlled by several pension trusts owned by general motors gm trusts.at.
in late,trg began a restructuring so that it could develop from a limited financial arrangement into a more expansive operating business.tg partners limited partnership tg partners was formed as a partnership separate from trg,and it owned of trg units.at.tci announced an initial public offering,selling million shares to the public and offering an additional million shares to the gm trusts and the at t trust,so that when added to a residual number of shares held by the taubman group which included the taubman family members and tg partners,approximately million shares would be outstanding after the offering.at.following the reconfiguration,tci owned of trg units at.the million shares of tci offered to the public represented a ownership stake in tci,such that the purchasers of the publicly available tci stock controlled of trg units even though tci as a whole controlled of trg units at.alfred taubman sons,robert and william,form the upper management of both tci and trg robert is the chairman,president,and chief executive officer of tci,as well as the president and chief executive officer of trg,while william is the executive of both tci and trg.
in,tci and trg again restructured,partially to accommodate gm desire to withdraw from the previous arrangement.upon gm withdrawal,tci unit ownership in trg would have increased from approximately to approximately.at tci bd.of dirs.meeting minutes.consequently,trg then minority unit holders,in particular the taubman family alfred taubman,robert taubman,william taubman,and gayle taubman kalisman and tg partners,would have less control over the management of trg assets.the result was the increased likelihood that a potential acquirer could gain a controlling interest in trg by acquiring tci stock.to counter this threat,the tci board in issued a new class of preferred tci series b preferred stock series b to the remaining partners of trg in order to give them increased control over tci and thus increased control over trg.see at,restated tci articles of incorp.at stating that tci will initially issue the series b preferred stock to each person who,on the initial date of issuance,is a registered unitholder at the rate of one share for each unit held by such registered unitholder,and defining registered unitholder as a person,other than the corporation who is reflected in the records of trg as a partner in trg.tci distributed nearly million series b shares for per share,or an extremely low total price of.at keath decl.at bebchuk decl.each series b share gave its holder the same voting rights as those attached to the preexisting million common shares.at keath decl.
the influx of the series b preferred tci shares had its desired effect and diluted the voting power of tci common shareholders.after,approximately of tci stock,which then was all common stock,was controlled by shareholders including gm and at t other than the taubman family.at tci initial public offering prospectus.after,family control of tci total outstanding shares decreased to approximately.at keath decl.this number is highly significant,because tci articles of incorporation required a vote to approve a merger or alter the articles of incorporation.thus,the issuance of series b preferred shares insulated tci,and thus trg,from a takeover attempt,particularly in light of the ownership limit provision of tci articles of incorporation,which prohibited any entity from owning more than of the value of tci total outstanding capital stock.at tci restated art.of incorp.at tci initial public offering prospectus.this provision could not be removed without a vote,so a potential acquirer had to purchase over of tci outstanding shares including series b shares in order to effectuate a takeover.at.
taubman family members,and the various entities controlled by taubman family members,owned over million series b shares,or of all the series b shares distributed at poissant decl.these million series b shares account for of the total outstanding tci shares.the taubman family controls its series b shares through a series of entities,including tg partners,which plays a critical role in this case.tg partners is a limited partnership formed under the laws of delaware.it owns of the series b stock approximately million shares and about of all outstanding tci shares.the general partners of tg partners include two general partners who are california citizens avner naggar and sidney unobskey.at poissant decl.another general partner of tg partners is a separate partnership formed under the laws of michigan,taubman realty ventures trv,whose partners are taubman family members alfred,robert,william,and alfred daughter,gayle taubman kalisman.alfred taubman,as trustee of the alfred taubman revocable trust,is the managing general partner of trv and votes the series b shares owned by trv.the managing general partner of tg partners is a michigan corporation,tg michigan,see at at trg agreement,whose sole shareholder is alfred taubman,acting through a revocable trust.it is alleged that alfred taubman votes tg partners series b stock.see at poissant decl.
the bulk of the taubman family series b shares are owned through other partnerships.alfred taubman votes the series b shares of tra partners,a michigan partnership that owns almost million or of the outstanding series b shares.two other alfred entities,management,and the alfred taubman trust,own almost shares combined.the other members of the taubman family also own in their individual capacities relatively minimal quantities of shares 
on october,spg,said to be the largest reit in the united states,initiated communication with robert taubman in hopes of purchasing all the publicly traded tci stock.robert taubman declined even to discuss the issue,and spg responded by outlining an offer to purchase all outstanding tci shares for a share.the tci board of directors rejected the offer on october,prompting spg to announce a public tender offer to purchase all of tci outstanding common stock for a share on december.spg offer was conditioned upon the removal of the ownership limit provision,and accordingly spg needed to acquire at least of the outstanding shares to alter tci articles of incorporation.on december,the tci board met with its financial advisors and rejected the offer.eventually,spg joined with westfield america westfield,an australian corporation,and increased the offer to a share.the tci board again rejected the offer,but many shareholders tendered their shares.spg announced on february,that of the common shares of tci had been tendered,which amounted to only of the total outstanding shares.spg thus had failed to obtain the requisite ownership needed to abolish the ownership limit provision.
spg filed an action in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan against tci,alleging that the issuance of the series b shares constituted a control share acquisition,which was at the time illegal under michigan law.spg sought an injunction against the voting of the series b shares.after receiving a favorable judgment in the district court,and even fully briefing a response to tci appeal in this court,cir,spg withdrew its tender offer on october,and the parties stipulated to the dismissal of the appeal on october,because of intervening michigan state legislation that overturned the ruling of the district court 
glancy,a california citizen and a tci shareholder,filed an action in the district court for the eastern district of michigan both as a representative of a class of tci shareholders and as a shareholder derivatively on behalf of tci on december.he later amended the complaint with the permission of the district court on january.at the heart of the complaint is the charge that the tci board members abus ed their fiduciary positions of control over tci to thwart any legitimate attempts or interest to acquire tci for a substantial premium.at.glancy states that his claims arise under michigan law,at,and both sides agree that michigan law applies.
glancy amended complaint seeks various kinds of relief.in counts,glancy presents class and derivative claims against the tci board for various breaches of fiduciary duties.at.in count vii,glancy asks the court to order the tci board defendants to cooperate with any entity proposing any transaction which would maximize shareholder value,at to declare that the tci board members violated their fiduciary duties and to enjoin the tci board members from entrenching themselves in office.at.most significantly,in counts,glancy seeks the invalidation of the series b shares.glancy amended complaint reads p laintiff seeks a declaration that the taubman family series b preferred stock does not have any voting rights,at,and p laintiff seeks a declaration that the taubman family may not validly vote the series b preferred stock under circumstances that would have the effect of foreclosing the spg tender offer at.glancy names as defendants tci and the tci board members but does not name as parties alfred taubman,tg partners,or any of the other partnerships.
tci did not file a motion pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b alleging lack of subject matter jurisdiction or a rule b motion alleging failure to join a party pursuant to the joinder provisions of rule.rather,tci raised the issue of joinder and lack of subject matter jurisdiction in its brief in opposition to glancy motion for a preliminary injunction.see at.rule h permits a defense based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction to be raised in a motion other than a rule b motion.h.
the district court issued an opinion and order on may.the district court then issued an amended opinion and order on may,which superseded the previous order,but did not differ substantially.the district court addressed tci contention that subject matter jurisdiction was lacking because glancy did not satisfy the diversity or requirements.the district court held that because tg partners was a real party in interest,given its ownership of six million shares of series b stock that the district court ruling could invalidate,tg partners citizenship,and the citizenship of its constituent partners,had to be considered for diversity purposes.because plaintiff glancy was a citizen of california as were two general partners of tg partners,complete diversity did not exist between plaintiff and the proper defendants.the district court thus dismissed glancy suit,but did not rule on the issue.glancy timely filed his notice of appeal.we have appellate jurisdiction over the district court order of dismissal pursuant to.
ii.analysis 
before delving into the depths of the federal rules of civil procedure joinder provisions,we must pause to comprehend fully what precisely glancy seeks from his litigation.as glancy argues,the plaintiff is the master of the complaint.holmes group,vornado air circulation,d quotation omitted.the benefits of that stewardship are often accompanied by pitfalls,as is the case here.the central problem is an incongruence between the defendants named by glancy and the relief he seeks.glancy named only tci and the tci board as defendants,but part of the relief he invalidation of the series b impacts the interests of more than just those named defendants.
there is little doubt that glancy complaint seeks comprehensive relief that entails the invalidation of all the series b shares owned by the network of partnerships controlled by the taubman family.in his amended complaint,glancy states that the taubman defendants improperly gave themselves a blocking voting position against unsolicited takeovers,at.emphasis added,by providing to themselves,for nominal consideration without shareholder approval,series b stock that increased their purported voting power over tci from less than to just over.at.this passage alone demonstrates the disconnect between the named parties and the actual owners of the series b shares there are only two named taubmans william and robert,yet they do not own enough series b shares to give them a voting block over tci.it is only the combined partnerships that possess such a large bloc of shares.throughout his substantive allegations,glancy uses the term taubman family broadly and.for example,he states that t he taubman family currently owns both series b shares and common stock which purportedly provide them with approximately of the voting power of tci,at,even though the voting block is in reality owned by absentee parties,such as tg partners,trv,and tra partners.
the purpose of glancy action was to remove the impediment to acquisition created by the series b shares,which he contended gave the taubman family the power to veto any sale of tci and to prevent the consummation of any tender offers,thus entrenching the family control over the company to the alleged derogation of the b shareholders.see at.accordingly,the relief sought by glancy is not limited to the invalidation of just a few series b shares,as glancy wanted a declaration that the taubman family may not validly vote the series b shares under circumstances that would have the effect of disenfranchising the public shareholder body.at.it is only the large voting bloc controlled by tg partners and others that would have such an effect.glancy also requested injunctive relief that would prohibit the taubman family from voting the series b shares,at,so as to abrogate the effective veto position for the taubman family.at.it is patently clear that glancy complaint seeks the invalidation of all the series b shares owned by the archipelago of partnerships controlled by the taubman family,which together possess the blocking position glancy seeks to abrogate.
we vacate the district court judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.because glancy has sought relief that will affect the interests of various absentees,it is necessary to engage in a rule analysis to assess the proper parties to glancy lawsuit and to determine whether the application of rule impacts the district court ability to hear the case.we first consider the threshold question of whether tg partners is a necessary party and answer in the affirmative because tg partners interest in voting its series b shares would be impeded or impaired by the requested relief.the joinder of tg partners as a defendant is not possible because of the citizenship of two of its constituent partners,which raises the question of whether tg partners is an indispensable party pursuant to rule b such that we can not in equity and good conscience.b,proceed without tg partners.the answer to that inquiry centers on whether any named parties tci or the tci board,or any other absentees who should be joined as necessary parties,can adequately represent the interests of tg partners.we hold that none of the named parties can adequately represent the interests of tg partners,but we can not determine at this time whether alfred taubman,another absentee whose interests may be impaired by a judgment in glancy favor,can adequately represent the interests of tg partners.upon remand we instruct the district court to consider the issue.
federal rule of civil procedure 
we begin by analyzing the joinder provisions of the federal rules of civil procedure.we have subject matter jurisdiction over all civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of and is between citizens of different states a it is well settled that as a matter of statutory construction,diversity of citizenship requires complete diversity between all plaintiffs on one side and all defendants on the other side.see caterpillar,lewis,d.parties seeking to evade the rule may attempt to maintain federal jurisdiction by failing to name persons or entities that have an interest in the litigation and otherwise should be named.federal rule of civil procedure addresses this problem by providing guidance for the joinder of persons needed for just adjudication.it establishes guidelines for determining when it is proper to dismiss a case because a person or entity has an interest in the outcome of the litigation that could be impaired in the absence of that person or entity,but joinder of the person or entity will deprive the court of subject matter jurisdiction.rule provides 
a persons to be joined if feasible.a person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action shall be joined as a party in the action if in the person absence complete relief can not be accorded among those already parties,or the person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in the person absence may i as a practical matter impair or impede the person ability to protect that interest or ii leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double,multiple,or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of the claimed interest.if the person has not been so joined,the court shall order that the person be made a party.if the person should join as a plaintiff but refuses to do so,the person may be made a defendant,or,in a proper case,an involuntary plaintiff.if the joined party objects to venue and joinder of that party would render the venue of the action improper,that party shall be dismissed from the action.
b determination by court whenever joinder not feasible.if a person as described in subdivision a hereof can not be made a party,the court shall determine whether in equity and good conscience the action should proceed among the parties before it,or should be dismissed,the absent person being thus regarded as indispensable.the factors to be considered by the court include first,to what extent a judgment rendered in the person absence might be prejudicial to the person or those already parties second,the extent to which,by protective provisions in the judgment,by the shaping of relief,or other measures,the prejudice can be lessened or avoided third,whether a judgment rendered in the person absence will be adequate fourth,whether the plaintiff will have an adequate remedy if the action is dismissed for nonjoinder.
the current phrasing of rule reflects the amendment of the rule.the changes eschew rigid application and adopt a more pragmatic approach.provident tradesmens bank trust patterson,d.as the supreme court described it,
where the new version emphasizes the pragmatic consideration of the effects of the alternatives of proceeding or dismissing,the older version tended to emphasize classification of parties as necessary or indispensable.although the two approaches should come to the same point,since the only reason for asking whether a person is necessary or indispensable is in order to decide whether to proceed or dismiss in his absence and since that decision must be made on the basis of practical considerations,and not by prescribed formula,the committee concluded,without directly criticizing the outcome of any particular case,that there had at times been undue preoccupation with abstract classifications of rights or obligations,as against consideration of the particular consequences of proceeding with the action and the ways by which these consequences might be ameliorated by the shaping of final relief or other precautions.

rule and adequately represented 
before deciding pursuant to rule whether various series b shareholders must be joined or the case must be dismissed if the shareholders can not be joined,we must analyze whether the presence of a party that can adequately represent the interests of the absentee shortens our rule inquiry.the subsection of rule a that is most pertinent to this question makes joinder compulsory when the absent person or entity claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in the person absence may as a practical matter impair or impede the person ability to protect that interest.a i.this test reflects the interest in avoiding the prejudice that might befall the absentee interest if the litigation proceeded without the absentee.moore federal practice,at.
what if a person or entity already named as a party to the action has the same interests and litigation goals as the absentee whose joinder is at issue can an absentee suffer the impairment or impediment of its interests if another party,who has already been named,is fighting the same fight moreover,if an absentee interests can be adequately represented by an existing party,should we consider that fact at the rule a stage or at the rule b stage we have not definitively answered these questions previously,although our lone decision that touches on the issue suggests that adequate representation should be considered when evaluating the rule b factors.local,at considering whether the absent entity interest was adequately represented by an party under the rule b factors see also prof l hockey club cent.sports club of the army detroit red wings,same.the first rule b factor to evaluate is to what extent a judgment rendered in the person absence might be prejudicial to the person or those already parties.b.many courts have suggested that the presence of a party with identical interests to the person or entity whose joinder is in question serves to mitigate any prejudice that might befall the absentee because of the identity of their interests.see local,at holding that a union presence at the particular arbitration proceeding in question was not essential because a named party had the same interest in avoiding arbitration as the union dainippon screen cfmt,ruling that any prejudice to subsidiary would be mitigated by presence of parent company in the litigation because both subsidiary and parent shared common interest of preserving a patent.several circuits have addressed this question of adequate representation as part of a rule b analysis,as opposed to during the threshold rule a analysis.see,witchita affiliated tribes of hodel,hansen peoples bank of bloomington,cir prescription plan serv.franco,cir.
other circuits have employed an adequate representation test when considering whether a person or entity should be joined under rule a they have ruled that there will be no impairment or impediment of an absent person or entity interest under rule a i if a named party is already adequately representing that interest.for example,the ninth circuit has ruled that i mpairment may be minimized if the absent party is adequately represented in the suit.makah indian tribe verity,cir see also washington daley,cir as a practical matter,an absent party ability to protect its interest will not be impaired by its absence from the suit where its interest will be adequately represented by existing parties to the suit.that court employs a test in determining whether existing parties adequately represent the interests of the absent ee whether the named party undoubtedly will make all the arguments that the absent person or entity would make whether the named party is capable of and willing to make such arguments and whether the absent person or entity would offer any necessary element to the proceedings that the named party would not.shermoen united states,cir quotations omitted.various other circuits also account for adequacy of representation in their rule a analyses,but they employ a more rigorous test that requires close to a perfect identity of interests in order for representation to be adequate.tell trs.of dartmouth,cir w ithout a perfect identity of interests,a court must be very cautious in concluding that a litigant will serve as a proxy for an absent party.see also union fire ins.rite aid of,cir a court should hesitate to conclude that a litigant can serve as a proxy for an absent party unless the interests of the two are identical.pujol.express,cir breyer,finding that named party adequately represented the interests of the absentee when the interests of both entities were virtually identical.
there is clearly considerable overlap between rule a i and rule b.moore federal practice a,at to the first b factor clearly overlaps with the considerations of whether an absentee is necessary under the impair or impede clause kickapoo tribe of indians babbitt,the inquiry as to prejudice under rule b is the same as the inquiry under rule a i regarding whether continuing the action will impair the absent party ability to protect its interest.yet,in order to be faithful to the text and purposes of the rules and to provide parties with guidance,it is necessary to decide at what stage of the rule test does adequacy of representation play a role.some courts believe that it is proper to assess the question of adequate representation during the first rule a stage of the analysis,even though this can make consideration of the first rule b factor completely redundant.however,in part because of our sole decision on this issue,see local,at,it is proper that adequacy of representation should be considered as part of the rule b multifactor analysis.
adequate representation should be considered as a part of the rule b analysis,and not the threshold rule a analysis,because the text of rule a i does not support an component,especially when juxtaposed with the text of rule a and consideration of whether an absentee interests are adequately represented will almost always occur only when the absentee should be joined under rule a i,but can not be joined for jurisdictional reasons,in which case the four factors of rule b will need to be weighed.
first,the text of rule a i mentions nothing about measuring adequacy of representation.the importation of an adequate representation test into rule a i is prompted by the similarities between the provisions of rule a and federal rule of civil procedure a,which provides for intervention as a matter of right.the language of rule a is nearly identical,but in one critical way,not exactly identical,to that of rule a i.rule a states,upon timely application anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action when the applicant is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the applicant ability to protect that interest,unless the applicant interest is adequately represented by existing parties.a emphasis added.intervention of right pursuant to rule a is a kind of counterpart to rule a i.a,advisory comm.notes cited in cascade natural gas el paso natural gas,d see also pujol,at noting similarity between rule a i and rule a.rule,which was amended contemporaneously with rule in,and has not changed substantively since that time,provides that an applicant is entitled to intervene in an action when his position is comparable to that of a person under rule a i,as amended,unless his interest is already adequately represented in the action by existing parties.a,advisory comm.notes emphasis added.given that both rules were amended at the exact same time and that rule explicitly mentions its relationship to rule a i,the absence of an adequate representation clause in rule a i is impossible to ignore.
second,the practical realities of joinder explain why consideration of adequate representation should occur as part of the rule b analysis.rule is the tool of the defendant,as the plaintiff has the power to choose which parties it wishes to sue and generally has ample freedom to amend its complaint to add a party aside from the rare instance of pure altruism,it is difficult to conceive of a reason why a defendant would invoke rule a i,as opposed to the other provisions of rule a for any reason other than to seek dismissal of the case.the defendant has no incentive to invoke rule a i unless the absentee that the defendant seeks to join can not be joined for reasons of jurisdiction or venue and because the defendant seeks to rid itself of the case the issue of adequate representation will thus likely only arise in a situation in which the absentee should be joined under rule a i,but can not be,in which instance the court proceeds to analyze the four factors of rule b to determine whether in equity and good conscience the action should be dismissed because of the indispensability of the absentee.b.
to consider adequacy of representation as part of the determination of whether a party should be joined pursuant to rule a i analysis is to undermine the test of rule b.if,for example,adequacy of representation were considered as part of the rule a i analysis,an absentee whose interests were adequately represented would not be joined.yet,such a result would be unfortunate if in reality the absentee joinder would create a jurisdictional problem and the other three rule b factors suggest that the proper course is to dismiss the case because the court in equity and good conscience can not proceed without the absentee.adequacy of representation then becomes a trump card,mooting consideration of rule b in its entirety.furthermore,to the extent that rule a i and rule b are redundant eliminating the repetition by considering adequate representation in the rule a stage improperly amends the text of rule by adding language to rule a i and rendering language in rule b surplusage.
there is no justification for considering adequacy of representation during the threshold analysis of whether a absentee is necessary when the text of rule a does not command it and when,in most instances of this ilk,adequacy of representation will need to be assessed as part of a rule b analysis anyway.it makes more sense simply to consider adequacy of representation as a part of the first factor of rule b,where it will most often need to be considered,rather than to read into rule a i language that does not exist 
the application of rule 
in applying rule here,the district court held that tg partners was an indispensable party.the district court specifically held that the citizenship of tg partners had to be considered for diversity purposes and that the overlap of glancy california citizenship with that of two of the general partners of tg partners would destroy diversity.the district court made two chief errors one of fact and one of logic.first,the district court erroneously stated that alfred taubman was the managing general partner of tg partners in fact tg michigan,a michigan corporation,of which alfred taubman is the sole shareholder,is the managing general partner.at.second,after determining that tg partners did not need to be joined because its interests could be represented by alfred taubman,the district court wrote 
i t can not be disputed that alfred taubman has an interest in his ability to vote the series b stock that he owns or controls.this fact implicates the joinder provisions of rule,under which either alfred taubman is an indispensable party who should be joined so that his interests can be adequately protected or alfred taubman is a dispensable party who does not need to be joined because his interest will be adequately protected since they are identical to his sons,who are named defendants 
at.this formulation improperly creates a false dichotomy in the application of rule.alfred taubman can not be considered an indispensable party who should be joined because an indispensable party by definition can not be joined.nor is he a dispensable party,as that term has no meaning under rule.
is tg partners necessary 
regarding tg partners,the first inquiry of the test must be answered in the affirmative.tg partners falls within the reach of rule a i,as it claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in tg partners absence may i as a practical matter impair or impede tg partners ability to protect that interest.a i.first,tg partners interest is in the continued validity of its million series b shares.second,the granting of an injunction and declaration would place the series b shares at the center of the litigation.third,tg partners is so situated that the disposition of the action in its absence would undoubtedly impede its interest in the shares because an injunction against the use of the series b shares would prevent tg partners from voting its sizeable stake thus,tg partners is a necessary party under rule a.
can tg partners be joined 
continuing to the next step of the test,tg partners can not be joined because its presence would violate the requirement.section requires complete diversity,and it is settled that a limited partnership is a citizen of each state in which its partners general or limited are citizens.carden arkoma,d.here,the joinder of tg partners is not possible,because two general partners hail from california,which is plaintiff glancy state of citizenship.
must the action be dismissed because tg partners is indispensable 
the final step then is to determine whether the court should in equity and good conscience dismiss the action because tg partners is indispensable according to the factors described in rule b.courts are to consider at least four factors in assessing whether the action should be dismissed,including but not limited to,first,to what extent a judgment rendered in the person absence might be prejudicial to the person second,the extent to which,by protective provisions in the judgment,by the shaping of relief,or other measures,the prejudice can be lessened or avoided third,whether a judgment rendered in the person absence will be adequate and fourth,whether the plaintiff will have an adequate remedy if the action is dismissed for nonjoinder.b.the final three factors clearly suggest that the court can not proceed in the absence of tg partners.first,the district court could not have mitigated the prejudice to tg partners of being denied the voting power of its shares except by denying the requested injunction.second,a judgment in which the shares of tg partners were not invalidated may not have been adequate for plaintiff glancy,because those million shares could be the difference between success and failure in spg or any other future acquirer attempt to acquire the of all available shares needed to delete the ownership limit provision.third,glancy would still have an adequate state court remedy if the federal court case were dismissed.
the remaining factor requires us to consider whether a judgment rendered in tg partners absence might be prejudicial to tg partners.b.as described above,the analysis of this factor requires an examination of whether tci,the tci board,or any other parties can adequately represent the interests of tg partners.as we explain further below,tci and the tci board,as named parties,do not adequately represent the interests of tg partners because the complete identity of interests that is required to satisfy rule b does not exist.yet,in trying to determine whether any other absentee can adequately protect the interests of tg partners,we are unable to determine,based upon the record at this stage of the litigation,whether alfred taubman can adequately protect the interests of tg partners if he can be joined as a party.we therefore remand to the district court for further consideration of these issues.
adequate representation by tci and the tci board 
we begin by resolving the question of whether a named corporation or board of directors can adequately represent the interests of shareholders whose shares are threatened to be invalidated at the outset,we note that several rule cases,including the one sixth circuit case on the issue,broadly discuss the issue of the indispensability of shareholders whose shares will be invalidated,even though these cases do not analyze whether a named corporation or board of directors can adequately represent the interests of those shareholders.these cases are dated,in their use of the older,more inflexible rule analysis,but they help to demonstrate the pattern of the courts unwillingness to proceed in the absence of shareholders whose shares will be invalidated by the action.in general investment lake shore michigan southern railway,cir,a plaintiff shareholder sought to enjoin a larger shareholder from voting its stock in favor of a merger.the court concluded that the larger shareholder was an indispensable party,writing that a stockholder in a corporation is an indispensable party to a suit seeking to enjoin him from voting his stock at a stockholders meeting.id.at see also inv.lake shore.ry.affirming the sixth circuit decision and stating that if the action sought to enjoin a shareholder voting rights,it was obvious that the larger shareholder was an indispensable party tucker linen serv,cir ruling that a shareholder is an indispensable party to an action that attempts to void his shares steinway majestic amusement,cir,cert.denied.same.a more recent,rule case reaches a similar result.klaus,cir.additionally,several commentators have stated generally that when a plaintiff sues a corporation to compel stock of absentee to be canceled and reissued in the joint names of plaintiff and absentee the absentee has an interest in the proceedings and its ability to protect that interest could be impaired by a judgment in the pending case.moore federal practice c,at see also federal practice procedure,at stating that joinder depends upon nature of interest in the controversy and citing to a case involving cancellation of stock that was dismissed because a necessary party could not be joined william fletcher,cyclopedia of the law of private corporations,at ed.if shareholders have distinct and indivisible individual rights which will be affected in the action by or against the corporation,they must be joined as coparties.
more specific to the acute inquiry here,courts have held that a corporation can not always adequately represent the interests of shareholders when the invalidation of shares is involved.in istituto bancario italiano spa hunter engineering,a bank brought suit against several defendants,including the company,hunter engineering,alleging that hunter and its parent defrauded the bank by issuing a block of shares that were eventually sold to another entity,tools.id.at.tools had been named as a defendant,but defendant hunter moved to dismiss under rule b because the court could not assert personal jurisdiction over tools.the delaware supreme court wrote that the current owner of the shares which plaintiff ibi seeks to have canceled clearly has an interest relating to the subject matter of the action such that disposition of the action in its absence as a practical matter may impair or impede its ability to protect that interest.id.at.the court believed that tools me t the criterion set forth in rule for an indispensable party even though the corporation that issued the stock had also been named,but the court ultimately ruled that the action did not need to be dismissed because the court properly had personal jurisdiction over tools.in so holding,the istituto court followed a line of delaware cases holding that shareholders are indispensable parties in actions to cancel or invalidate shares of stock.elster am.airlines,hodson hodson,no federal court of which we are aware has held that a named corporation adequately represents the interests of a small group of shareholders who stand to lose a large number of shares such that those shareholders interests will not be prejudiced in their absence.but omnioffices,kaidanow,no.civ,wl,at,rev on other grounds sub nom.carramerica realty kaidanow,shareholder controlling a substantial portion of shares to be voided was not indispensable because named party agreed to indemnify the absentee in the event that the shares were invalidated wheaton diversified energy,llc,holding that a subsidiary is adequately represented by the parent when its shareholder interests may be impacted.
particularly in light of the tendency of courts to join all shareholders whose rights will be determined by litigation,we can not say that tci and the tci board adequately represent the interests of tg partners.there is a similarity of interests,but the interests are not identical tg partners monolithically desires to maintain its voting rights while tci and the tci board must respond to and defend themselves from various other charges of breach of fiduciary duties unrelated to the continued existence of the series b shares these distinct but overlapping interests could come into conflict tci is responsible in this litigation to act not only for the best interests of the series b shareholders,but for the best interests of the corporation and all its shareholders.
on appeal,glancy does not even suggest that tci or the tci board adequately represents the interests of tg partners.instead,glancy argues that robert and william taubman,who are named parties,can adequately represent tg partners interests.glancy br.at.there are several reasons why this is questionable.first,the taubman sons were named as members of the tci board,not as individual series b shareholders.as explained above,the tci board interests are not completely identical to those of tg partners.second,even if the taubman sons were named as individual shareholders,they control a relatively tiny number of series b shares in their own names out of the million shares controlled by the taubman family.as individual shareholders,they would have a similar interest in fighting any action to invalidate the stock,but the intensity of that interest differs from tg partners interest,as tg partners controls five hundred times more shares.courts have held that asymmetry in the intensity of the interest can prevent a named party from representing the interests of the absentee.see union fire ins.rite aid of,cir holding that although both the named subsidiary and the unnamed parent had an identical interest in the subsidiary being covered as a beneficiary of a liability policy,the subsidiary could not represent the parent interest regarding the impact of the court decision on future cases concerning coverage burger king am.bank trust of chicago,finding that even though named and unnamed franchisee both sought determinations that they did not violate the lease,the named franchisor could not adequately represent the interests of the franchisee because the latter faced greater future liability.third,to the extent that glancy is arguing that the taubman sons can protect the interests of the taubman family regarding the series b stock because alfred taubman will exert his influence through their presence,see glancy br.at,roberts and william function in this capacity does not assure that the interests of the partners in tg partners will be protected.see infra partially listing the partners of tg partners.
ii.adequate representation by alfred taubman 
given that none of the named parties can adequately represent the interests of tg partners,we must consider whether alfred taubman should be named as a necessary party who can represent the interests of the absentee,tg partners.glancy discussed alfred taubman in his complaint,but glancy did not name alfred taubman as a defendant.in their answer and their brief opposing glancy action,defendants tci and the tci board did not request that taubman be joined.nor did they file a rule b motion seeking dismissal of the action for failure to join alfred taubman.however,the district court considered the joinder of alfred taubman and its effect on whether the action should be dismissed pursuant to rule b.both parties also discuss the issue in their appellate briefs.glancy br.at arguing that alfred taubman either directly,or indirectly through his sons,can adequately represent the interests of tg partners,although not explicitly asking for alfred taubman joinder tci br.at.furthermore,we may raise the issue of joinder sua sponte.moore federal practice b ii,at.
we discuss the joinder of alfred taubman mainly to assess whether the impact of his presence as a party and his ability to represent the interests of tg partners would obviate the need to dismiss the action because of tg partners effect on subject matter jurisdiction.based upon the factual record we currently possess,we can not determine whether alfred taubman,named in his individual capacity as the owner voter of million series b shares,can adequately represent the interests of tg partners.upon remand,the district court and the parties must address this issue.if tg partners interests will not be adequately represented by the joinder of alfred taubman in his individual capacity,glancy action must be dismissed because tg partners will be indispensable given that the action can not proceed in its absence.if tg partners interests can be adequately represented by alfred taubman,the district court must analyze whether alfred taubman joinder is proper under the three steps of rule.the court must assess whether alfred taubman has an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in his absence may i as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that interest.a i,and whether his joinder is possible if his joinder is not possible,the court must,pursuant to rule b,then determine whether in equity and good conscience the action can proceed in alfred taubman absence or whether the action must be dismissed.without the presence of a party who can adequately represent the interests of tg partners,the action must be dismissed.
iii.conclusion 
because of the multiple pleading,jurisdictional,and joinder complications with this appeal,several of which can not be resolved on the basis of this record,we vacate the judgment of the district court.we remand to the district court with instructions to resolve the incongruence between the relief glancy seeks and the parties he has named.the district court must analyze whether alfred taubman can adequately represent the interests of tg partners and whether alfred taubman can be joined in his individual capacity as a series b shareholder under the strictures of rule.if alfred taubman can not adequately represent the interests of tg partners,the action must be dismissed because the court can not in equity and good conscience proceed without tg partners,whose interests will be impaired by a judgment invalidating the series b stock,but who can not be joined because of the requirement of complete diversity for subject matter jurisdiction.
i concur in the judgment and in judge moore careful and thoughtful opinion,with the exception of part.
in this case,it appears clear that adequacy of representation by one shareholder of an absent shareholder interest is not enough to make the absent shareholder unnecessary for purposes of rule a.adequacy of representation therefore becomes relevant in the context of this case only at the rule b stage.i am reluctant to conclude,however,that adequacy of representation is categorically not to be considered as part of a rule a analysis,and such a conclusion is unnecessary to our holding.
while i agree that the district court judgment dismissing the plaintiff lawsuit must be vacated and the case remanded,i respectfully disagree with the majority analysis.i believe my colleagues have imposed on the plaintiff their own idea of the ideal complaint and the relief they think such a complaint should have requested,rather than reading the complaint as it was written.while the majority rightly faults glancy for his wildly inconsistent use of the term the taubman family throughout his amended complaint,the amended complaint clearly demonstrates that glancy sought no relief with respect to alfred taubman.glancy explicitly excluded from his suit alfred taubman,who allegedly own ed control ed shares of taubman centers common stock and shares of series b stock.
in my judgment,vacatur and remand are nevertheless appropriate because the district court failed to make adequate findings of fact and conclusions of law,thereby depriving this court of a sufficiently definite predicate for proper appellate review.cousin mcwherter,cir citation omitted see also.
the district court appears to have concluded that although alfred taubman was not named as a defendant in this suit,the plaintiff glancy request for declaratory and injunctive relief against the taubman family would,if granted,prevent alfred taubman from voting the series b stock that he owns or controls.the district court then assumed that an injunction against alfred taubman in his individual capacity would prevent tg partners tg from voting its series b shares.the court appears to have relied upon cases in which general partners have been named either on behalf of their partnerships or in their capacity as partners,which suggests that the court thought that an injunction against a person in his individual capacity would have the same effect as an injunction against a person in his capacity as a general partner of a partnership.the court assumed,without explanation,that there was no substantive difference between an injunction against alfred taubman in his individual capacity and an injunction against him in the capacity of the managing general partner of tg.the first difficulty with this assumption is that alfred taubman is not the managing general partner of tg.a corporation of which alfred taubman is the sole shareholder is the managing general partner of tg.the district court made no findings of fact or conclusions of law to support its assumption that an injunction against alfred taubman individually would prevent a separate entity,the corporation of which he is the sole shareholder,from voting tg series b stock.
although the district court appears to have concluded that if glancy requested relief were granted,alfred taubman in some unspecified capacity would suffer an impairment of his ability to vote the series b stock that he owns or controls,the court did not conduct a federal rule of civil procedure rule analysis with respect to alfred taubman.instead,it merely concluded that regardless of whether alfred taubman should have been joined as a party,if glancy relief is granted,the shares that alfred taubman controls through the tg partnership would be affected that is,tg would be prevented from voting its series b shares.the court also failed to conduct a rule analysis with respect to tg,which,likewise,was not a named party in the action.instead,it merely concluded that tg citizenship had to be considered for diversity purposes.
in my judgment,the district court erred in taking an overly simplistic view of the jurisdictional complexities of this case.specifically,it failed to distinguish between alfred taubman various capacities,and instead,spoke generally of alfred taubman interest in his ability to vote the series b stock that he owns or controls.in my view,the complexities of the case,particularly the various legal capacities in which alfred taubman is involved,required a far closer analysis.i would remand the case to afford the court an opportunity to explain its reasoning.
