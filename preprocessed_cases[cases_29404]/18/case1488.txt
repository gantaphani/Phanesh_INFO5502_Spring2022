a shareholder in a company acquired in a merger transaction sued the law firm which represented the acquiring company for fraud.he alleged the law firm concealed the toxic terms of a third party financing transaction,and thus defrauded him into exchanging his valuable stock in the acquired company for toxic stock in the acquiring company.the law firm demurred.it contended it made no affirmative misstatements and had no duty to disclose the terms of the third party investment to an adverse party in the merger transaction.we conclude the complaint stated a fraud claim based on nondisclosure.the complaint alleged the law firm,while expressly undertaking to disclose the financing transaction,provided disclosure schedules that did not include material terms of the transaction.
factual and procedural background 
frank vega vega,a percent shareholder in a company known as,sued jones,day,reavis pogue jones day,a law partnership,for fraud and negligent misrepresentation in connection with a merger transaction.in the merger transaction,jones day represented transmedia asia pacific,which acquired monsterbook.monsterbook and vega were represented by the law firm of heller,ehrman,white mcauliffe heller ehrman.
the terms of the acquisition included vega receipt of restricted stock in transmedia in exchange for his interest in monsterbook.monsterbook and vega accepted the merger offer on march.closing occurred on april,when the two companies exchanged stock based on a million valuation of monsterbook.vega thus exchanged stock valued at million for the restricted transmedia stock.
during the weeks between vega acceptance of the merger offer on march and the closing on april,transmedia,which e verybody knew was an iffy company,sought and secured million in investment financing from a third party the terms of transmedia million third party financing transaction included toxic stock provisions,under which the investors received convertible preferred stock that seriously diluted the shares of all other transmedia stockholders.both transmedia and jones day knew that toxic stock financing is a desperate and last resort of financing for a struggling company and that percent of companies who engage in such financing end up in bankruptcy.
jones day prepared a disclosure schedule that clearly described and properly disclosed the toxic provisions of the million investment,but did not send the disclosure to vega,monsterbook or heller ehrman.jones day knew that a full disclosure of the toxic terms of the financing would have killed the acquisition,without which transmedia would not have obtained the financing and would have gone out of business.instead,vega,monsterbook and heller ehrman were told,on about march,that the million financing then being negotiated was standard and nothing unusual and that jones day and transmedia would supply additional documents to support these characterizations of the financing no documents showing the toxic nature of the investment were provided instead,jones day supplied heller ehrman with a different sanitized version of the disclosure schedule which did not include the toxic stock provisions.
jones day also prepared,and transmedia sent to monsterbook and vega,a consent form concerning the million investment,which vega signed.the consent form stated that the million investment would be convertible into an aggregate maximum of shares of common stock,thus misrepresenting that it fell within the dilution toxic cap mandated by nasd rule i d.on march,two weeks before the closing of transmedia acquisition of monsterbook,jones day filed a certificate of designation with the delaware secretary of state,certifying the creation of the convertible preferred stock.this document,available to the public,contained all the terms of the financing,including the toxic provisions.
the closing of the monsterbook acquisition occurred on april.eight months later,on december,vega learned for the first time,through a press release issued by transmedia,about the toxic stock provision of the million financing.several legal actions ensued.
first,on october,monsterbook former majority shareholder,william mckee,who had owned percent of monsterbook stock,sued heller ehrman for legal malpractice.in a first amended complaint on november,mckee and a second shareholder,paul estrada,who had held a percent interest in monsterbook,also named transmedia and jones day as defendants,alleging causes of action for fraud and negligent misrepresentation.
second,on december,another shareholder,john cuero,who had held a percent interest in monsterbook,sued heller ehrman,jones day,and transmedia.this suit was consolidated with mckee lawsuit.in the consolidated actions,jones day sought and obtained summary judgment,and judgment was entered in its favor on august,estrada waived his right to appeal mckee abandoned his appeal and cuero appeal was dismissed at his request.
third,on may,vega filed this lawsuit against jones day and transmedia,and jones day demurred the demurrer to the fraud claim was sustained,without leave to amend,on multiple grounds,as follows 
the claim did not allege an actionable,affirmative misstatement by jones day 
vega could not justifiably have relied on the statements allegedly made by jones day 
because jones day owed vega no duty to disclose,vega could not state a claim based on omission or nondisclosure 
vega did not allege damages proximately caused by jones day 
vega had no standing to bring the claim because it was derivative in nature 
the claim was barred by the statute of limitations and 
the claim was barred by res judicata.
jones day demurrer to the negligent misrepresentation claim was sustained on the same grounds and,in addition,because a negligent misrepresentation claim can not be based on an omission or nondisclosure.the court also concluded vega failed to plead both causes of action with the requisite specificity.
the trial court order sustaining the demurrers and dismissing vega complaint with prejudice was filed august,and this appeal followed 
discussion 
vega allegations may be summarized as follows.jones day hid the existence of the toxic stock provisions with the intent to induce vega to give up his valuable stock in monsterbook in exchange for transmedia toxic and worthless stock.jones day knew about the toxic stock provisions,and knew the acquisition would not occur if monsterbook,vega and their lawyers discovered them.jones day deliberately concealed the toxic stock provisions by telling heller ehrman the transaction was standard and nothing unusual,by failing to provide the proper written disclosure it prepared,and by instead providing a different,sanitized version of the disclosure.vega did not know,and had no reason to suspect,that the financing contained toxic provisions,and would not have given up his valuable stock in monsterbook had he known.as a result of jones day concealment of the toxic terms of the financing,vega lost his million interest in monsterbook.
we agree with vega that the complaint properly states a fraud claim.
before we analyze the elements of the claim,we note the governing legal principles.a fraud claim against a lawyer is no different from a fraud claim against anyone else.if an attorney commits actual fraud in his dealings with a third party,the fact he did so in the capacity of attorney for a client does not relieve him of liability.shafer berger,kahn,shafton,moss,figler,simon gladstone th,d shafer,quoting jackson rogers wells d.while an attorney professional duty of care extends only to his own client and intended beneficiaries of his legal work,the limitations on liability for negligence do not apply to liability for fraud.ibid.accordingly,a lawyer communicating on behalf of a client with a nonclient may not knowingly make a false statement of material fact to the nonclient shafer,supra,th at,d,and may be liable to a nonclient for fraudulent statements made during business negotiations.cicone urs d.the case law is clear that a duty is owed by an attorney not to defraud another,even if that other is an attorney negotiating at arm length.
with these principles in mind,we turn to the elements of fraud,which are representation falsity knowledge of falsity intent to deceive and reliance and resulting damage causation.witkin,cal.procedure ed.pleading.active concealment or suppression of facts by a nonfiduciary is the equivalent of a false representation,actual fraud,italics omitted.we treat the various elements,and the bases for the trial court decision,in turn.
false representation.
we agree with jones day that a mere statement that the million financing then being negotiated was standard and nothing unusual is not itself an actionable misrepresentation.while expressions of professional opinion are sometimes treated as representations of fact,a casual expression of belief is not similarly treated.bily arthur young cal th,d,quoting gagne bertran cal d.moreover,no party to a major transaction could reasonably rely on a casual statement by counsel for another party to the transaction 
more problematic,however,is the question of active concealment or suppression of facts,which is the equivalent of a false representation.vega alleges that jones day,after telling heller ehrman that transmedia was about to close a million private stock transaction which it wanted to include in its disclosure schedules,prepared a proper disclosure schedule containing the pertinent terms,but provided a different sanitized version of the schedule,without the toxic stock provisions.thus,vega alleges that jones day deliberately or with a reckless disregard of the truth concealed the toxic stock provisions from vega,monsterbook and heller ehrman.these allegations state an active concealment or suppression of facts.witkin,cal.procedure,supra,italics omitted.so long as the remaining elements of a fraud claim are met see discussion post,we are unable to conclude these allegations are deficient.
jones day contends that fraud based on concealment requires that the defendant have a duty to disclose the suppressed fact,and that as counsel for the adverse party in a merger,jones day owed no duty to disclose to vega or monsterbook the terms of the third party million investment.thus,the disclosure schedule,they contend,is entirely irrelevant because jones day had no duty to provide it to monsterbook or vega or heller ehrman.we disagree.jones day specifically undertook to disclose the transaction and,having done so,is not at liberty to conceal a material term.even where no duty to disclose would otherwise exist,where one does speak he must speak the whole truth to the end that he does not conceal any facts which materially qualify those stated.citation.one who is asked for or volunteers information must be truthful,and the telling of a calculated to deceive is fraud.cicone urs,supra,d at.shafer,supra,th at,d.
jones day insists this case is controlled by sabo deitsch th,d,and that held that defendant attorneys owed no duty of care to the adverse party when they provided an opinion on a material aspect of the transaction at issue.jones day misconstrues,a case with which we have no quarrel.the defendant lawyers in specifically stated an opinion on a material point in the transaction on which third party relied.the court concluded that it would be inappropriate to hold an attorney liable to a third party for a legal opinion which the third party could not,under the rules of professional conduct,have contracted to obtain from that attorney,supra,th at,d.the court therefore held that reliance on the legal opinion of another party lawyers was not justifiable under the facts alleged ibid.the court specifically stated we do not suggest that an attorney should be exempt from liability for negligent misrepresentation under circumstances in which a nonattorney could be held liable we merely decline to extend professional liability under a negligent misrepresentation theory to individuals who are not clients of the attorney,fn.omitted.
is entirely inapposite.first,plaintiff claims were grounded solely in professional fraud.on appeal,argued it should be permitted to proceed against the attorneys under a theory of negligent fraud.the court reviewed that contention,and ultimately concluded failed to sufficiently allege that the lawyers had the intent to induce reliance on their representations,or that the reliance of was justifiable under the circumstances of the case,supra,th at,d.second,as the court in pointed out,third parties may recover against an attorney under a negligent misrepresentation theory,in cases involving misrepresentations of fact rather than legal opinions.id.at,d.the case under review involves the lawyers alleged concealment of a material fact in a transaction the lawyers undertook to the expression of an inaccurate legal opinion as in consequently,jones day can take no comfort from,which is in no way inconsistent with our conclusion here.certainly jones day had no professional duty of care to vega as an adverse party in the merger transaction.however,as in shafer,supra,jones day did have the same duty others have not to defraud another,even if that other is an attorney negotiating at arm length.shafer,supra,th at,d,quoting cicone urs,supra,d at.
jones day contends that shafer is irrelevant,and suggests the result there was due to the peculiar circumstances.in shafer,the court held that an attorney,who was retained by an insurance company to provide coverage advice in a lawsuit against its insured,could be held liable to the plaintiffs in that lawsuit for making a fraudulent statement about coverage.shafer,supra,th at,d.this case is different,jones day says,because vega has not alleged an affirmative misstatement of fact made to him by jones day,and because vega can not allege any special circumstances that would give rise to an independent duty of disclosure owed by jones day to him.neither of these asserted differences assists jones day.first,shafer indeed involved an affirmative false statement,while this case involves the concealment or suppression of material facts.however,we can deduce no reason why a lawyer may be liable for one form of fraud but not the other.see lovejoy v.at t th,d it is established by statute that intentional concealment of a material fact is an alternative form of fraud and deceit equivalent to direct affirmative misrepresentation,quoting stevens superior court d.witkin,cal.procedure,supra,active concealment or suppression of facts is the equivalent of a false representation.second,jones day invocation of the principle that fraud based on nondisclosure requires an independent duty of disclosure is erroneous.in some but not all circumstances,an independent duty to disclose is required active concealment may exist where a party w hile under no duty to speak,nevertheless does so,but does not speak honestly or makes misleading statements or suppresses facts which materially qualify those stated.baji cicone urs,supra,d at.o ne who is asked for or volunteers information must be truthful,and the telling of a calculated to deceive is fraud.providing a disclosure schedule which deliberately omitted material facts seems clearly to fit this category.
justifiable reliance.
jones day argues that publicly available information can not form the basis for a concealment claim,and vega,with reasonable diligence,could have known about the toxic stock provisions.jones day points out that vega had notice,in the consent form he signed,that a certificate of designation regarding the million investment and its terms would be filed with the delaware secretary of state at some time in the future,and that this certificate,containing all the financing terms,was in fact filed two weeks before the merger closed 
jones day argument fails on two counts.first,the contention that publicly available information can not form the basis for a concealment claim is mistaken.the mere fact that information exists somewhere in the public domain is by no means conclusive.see,seeger odell cal d,a plaintiff is not barred by constructive notice of a public record which would reveal the true facts.second,the question in a nondisclosure case is whether the defendant knows of material facts,and also knows that those facts are neither known nor readily accessible to the plaintiff see baji.in this case,jones day knew about the toxic provisions of the financing,and knew those facts were unknown to vega unless,and only to the extent that,jones day transmedia disclosed those terms.indeed,the point of disclosing material information in a transaction is that it is not otherwise available to the other side.jones day stated its desire to disclose the million financing transaction,and then allegedly provided a sanitized disclosure,without the toxic terms.questions as to whether jones day intentionally concealed that information in order to induce vega to believe the transaction was standard,and whether the consent form indicating that a certificate regarding the investment and its terms would be filed in delaware in the future made the toxic terms reasonably accessible to vega,are questions of fact to be resolved on the evidence,not as a matter of law on a demurrer.
reliance and causation.
jones day argues vega can not establish that nondisclosure of the toxic terms of the million third party financing resulted in any damage.this is because vega agreed to exchange his monsterbook stock for transmedia stock on march,before the third party financing transaction arose and before he consented to it,and vega concedes in his complaint that transmedia would have gone out of business without the million investment.this claim is puzzling at best.first,while vega agreed to exchange his stock on march,he may have had good grounds to rescind the agreement if the toxic terms of the financing had been disclosed.this is not a point that can be determined on a demurrer.second,jones day quotes only part of the sentence in which vega concedes transmedia would have gone out of business without the financing.the complaint alleges that disclosure of the toxic terms of the financing would have killed the acquisition,and that w ithout the acquisition,transmedia would not have obtained the financing and would have gone out of business.we fail to see how these allegations show vega was not harmed by the failure to disclose the toxic terms of the financing.quite the contrary.vega alleges that had full disclosure been made,he would not have exchanged his valuable monsterbook stock for the toxic transmedia stock.those allegations,if true,show the nondisclosure resulted in damage.
requisite particularity.
the trial court also sustained the demurrer on the ground vega failed to allege the cause of action with the requisite degree of specificity.jones day argues vega has not alleged who,said what,to whom,when,and in what manner,and waived the opportunity to replead again we disagree.the pertinent question in a concealment case is not who said what to whom the question,among others,is whether jones day,in undertaking to disclose the million financing,intentionally concealed its toxic terms from vega and monsterbook so that they would proceed with the transaction.the complaint sufficiently apprises jones day of the facts of vega fraud claim to allow jones day to prepare its defense.see committee on children television,general foods cal d.
standing to sue.
jones day contends vega has no standing to sue jones day for fraud because his claims are derivative claims.in a tortuous argument,jones day concludes that because vega agreed to accept transmedia stock before the third party financing transaction arose,the gravamen of his complaint must be for the diminution in the value of the transmedia stock he acquired,which was caused by transmedia entering into the private stock transaction.this,jones day asserts,is a classic example of a derivative claim because the harm to vega is the same harm suffered by every other transmedia or monsterbook shareholder.
jones day is mistaken.a derivative suit is a suit brought on behalf of a corporation for injury to the corporation,often for breach of fiduciary duty,mismanagement or other wrongdoing by corporate officers or directors,or for wrongs against the corporation by third parties.see friedman,cal.practice guide corporations the rutter group,to.an action is derivative if the gravamen of the complaint is injury to the corporation,or to the whole body of its stock and property without any severance or distribution among individual holders,or it seeks to recover assets for the corporation or to prevent the dissipation of its assets.jones ahmanson cal d,citing gagnon,nevada desert inn,cal d.this is not such a case.vega alleges that jones day deceived him into exchanging his valuable stock in monsterbook for worthless stock in transmedia.as in jones,vega does not seek to recover on behalf of the corporation for injury done to the corporation by jones day.jones ahmanson,supra,cal d at.instead,the gravamen of his cause of action is injury to himself ibid.
statute of limitations.
jones day argues that vega fraud claim is barred by the statute of limitations again,we disagree.
vega alleged he first discovered the toxic terms of the million financing transaction on december,when a transmedia press release revealed that the terms of the financing had included a toxic stock provision.he filed suit on may.jones day argues the statute expired no later than march,three years after the filing in delaware of the certificate of designation containing all the terms of the transaction.jones day recognizes that the statute of limitations in a fraud action does not begin to run until the discovery,by the aggrieved party,of the facts constituting the fraud code civ,subd.d.however,it argues vega should have discovered the toxic terms of the financing on march,since the filing of the certificate in delaware put him on inquiry notice.
the rule is that the statute commences to run only after one has knowledge of facts sufficient to make a reasonably prudent person suspicious of fraud,thus putting him on inquiry.hobart hobart estate cal d.the means of knowledge are equivalent to knowledge only where there is a duty to inquire,as where plaintiff is aware of facts which would make a reasonably prudent person suspicious.hobart hobart estate,supra,cal d at.we can not say,as a matter of law,that vega knowledge that the million financing transaction would occur,standing alone,should have made him suspicious of fraud,or suspicious that the transaction might contain toxic terms.whether other circumstances exist which,in conjunction with knowledge of the existence of the financing transaction,would have made a prudent person suspicious is a question that can not be resolved on demurrer.
res judicata.
finally,jones day contends that vega claims are barred by the doctrine of res judicata,because jones day obtained summary judgment in its favor on fraud claims in earlier lawsuits brought by three other shareholders,who subsequently waived,abandoned and dismissed their respective appeals.jones day argues vega was in privity with each of those three shareholders,because he is also a former shareholder in monsterbook,his fraud claim is the same as their claims,he knew about their lawsuits,and he is using the same attorney.this relationship,jones day contends,is sufficiently close to justify application of the principle of preclusion.again,we can not agree.
the doctrine of res judicata precludes parties or their privies from relitigating issues decided in a prior action in which a final judgment on the merits was entered.while jones day obtained summary judgment on fraud claims by three other shareholders,vega was not a party to those lawsuits.the concept of privity has been expanded to include a relationship between the party to be estopped and the unsuccessful party in the prior litigation which is sufficiently close so as to justify application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel.clemmer hartford ins.cal d.however,n otwithstanding expanded notions of privity,due process requirements must be satisfied.ibid.the cases uniformly state that,in addition to an identity or community of interest between the party to be estopped and the losing party in the first action,and adequate representation by the latter,the circumstances must have been such that the party to be estopped should reasonably have expected to be bound by the prior adjudication.clemmer hartford ins,supra,ca
