a group of individual investors brought this securities fraud action on behalf of themselves and a proposed class comprising all individuals collectively,the investors who purchased gilead sciences,gilead publicly traded securities between july,and october,class period.they allege that gilead misled the investing public by representing that demand for its most popular product was strong without disclosing that unlawful marketing was the cause of that strength.
the district court dismissed under rule b of civil procedure,holding that the investors failed to sufficiently allege loss causation.we have jurisdiction under,and we reverse.
facts and procedural history 
i.the complaint allegations 
the investors fourth amended complaint complaint alleges violations of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of,b,a,and sec rule.the complaint names as defendants gilead and some of its top officers officers.
taking its allegations as true,the complaint tells the following story about gilead and its marketing practices 
gilead is a biopharmaceutical company that specializes in developing and marketing treatments for diseases.one of the company commercial products is viread,an antiretroviral agent used in combination with other drugs to treat hiv.
gilead fortunes,as reflected in its stock price,depended heavily on viread commercial success.sales of viread amounted to about of gilead total revenues at all relevant times of this action.wall street analysts looked to sales of viread,gilead most important and most promoted drug,to gauge whether the company business was on track and growing.if gilead failed to publicly report healthy,growing viread sales,its stock price would be greatly diminished.
although gilead had a clear incentive to aggressively promote viread,it was required to comply with federal law,including the food and drug administration fda marketing regulations.generally,those regulations prohibit the marketing of drugs for uses,commonly referred to as uses.for example,it would be considered for a company to market a drug as also being effective for fighting hepatitis b infection if such use of the drug had not been reviewed and approved by the fda and included in the drug package labeling.while physicians are free to prescribe drugs for uses they rely on the prescribing information to determine which drugs can be used safely and effectively by patients with specific health problems.the fda approved viread for use in approximately of the available hiv patient pool.repeatedly violating the fda marketing regulations in an effort to have viread prescribed to some of the remaining of available hiv patients,gilead and its officers 
implemented a scheme to promote and market viread with,false,and misleading statements in violation of the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act.in order to gain market share,artificially increase perceived demand,and increase sales,gilead officers,executives,and clinical personnel,with the express knowledge and approval of the officers,routinely and consistently provided gilead sales and marketing team with information and encouraged,expected,and directed them to use it to sell viread 
gilead management began preparing gilead sales staff for marketing as early as september,one month before viread received fda approval.management continued to encourage marketing throughout and the first half of.
these training efforts produced their intended effect.according to two confidential witnesses who served as gilead salespeople viread marketing took three forms marketing to hiv patients with hepatitis b marketing viread as a or initial therapy for hiv infection and marketing against viread safety profile.ultimately,to of viread sales resulted from marketing efforts.
the company and its officers emphasized to the public that they carefully complied with federal and state regulations,when in fact they knew that they were acting unlawfully by aggressively marketing viread for uses.
the first sign of trouble came on march,when the fda sent an untitled letter to gilead that accused the company of understating the risks of form of improper marketing.the letter ordered gilead to immediately cease this practice.on march,per the fda request,gilead sent a reply that acknowledged receipt of the fda letter and agreed to immediately stop marketing.this was not done.in fact,gilead marketing increased,either at the officers direction or with their knowledge and tacit encouragement.
by june,gilead marketing put it in the position to raise viread price.consistent with standard industry practice,gilead informed national drug wholesalers of this plan in advance of the price increase.the wholesalers there are the three major ones that purchase approximately ninety percent of drug manufacturers drugs typically stockpile drugs in advance of price increases so that they can resell at a higher price to retailers after the increase takes effect.
because gilead had illegally inflated sales and artificially inflated demand for viread,the major drug wholesalers stockpiled mass quantities of viread in advance of the june price increase.this wholesaler stockpiling would not have occurred but for the marketing and the resulting creation of an artificially increased demand for viread.the stockpiling furthered gilead fraudulent scheme by confirming the impression that viread was in high demand and that gilead financial and operational results were strong.
on july,gilead issued a press release announcing that it anticipated its second quarter financial results would exceed analysts expectations,and explaining that the company success was driven primarily by strong sales growth of viread increasing viread sales reflect broader prescribing patterns in all commercial markets,as well as increases in wholesaler inventory levels in the second quarter in anticipation of a viread price increase.
these statements were materially false and misleading because gilead and its officers marketing and promotional activities for viread were not in compliance with fda approved guidelines,violated federal laws,and created serious public health and safety implications for viread users.gilead promotional scheme was designed to,and did,create the impression that demand for viread was strong.this campaign was misleading,however,because it was unlawful marketing that was driving prescription volume and gilead had already been ordered to cease such marketing.
while securities analysts,for the most part,reacted favorably to the july,press release,gilead and its officers felt the need to respond to some analysts concern that second quarter revenues were primarily attributable to the wholesaler stockpiling,and not a result of strong demand.on the same day that the press release was issued,a gilead spokeswoman,acting with the knowledge and approval of gilead and its officers,told bloomberg news that t he main reason for the jump in viread sales is an increase in prescriptions,not inventory stocking.this statement was misleading.it created the impression that demand for viread was strong,which it was,but for reasons that were not by the public.omitting the role of marketing in a press release highlighting the drug success made a true statement that demand was strong also a misleading one.
gilead financial news had a marked effect on its stock price.on july,the price of gilead shares closed at,up from the previous day closing price of per share.this increase represented a high.
some two weeks later,the fda issued a july warning letter that chastised gilead for statements made by one of its sales representatives at the national update conference in march and april of.the letter stated that the employee made oral statements that minimized the risk information and broadened the indication for viread.it reminded gilead of the untitled letter,expressed the significant public health and safety concerns raised by these repetitive promotional activities,and ordered gilead to make corrective disclosure.gilead made such disclosure to the conference attendees on november.
on august,the fda made public its warning letter.gilead shareholders and the investing public did not find it very significant,though,because they failed to appreciate the extent of gilead marketing,and thus could not foresee the letter impact on viread sales.
the public underestimation of viread troubles was reflected in gilead share price.notwithstanding the public revelation of the letter,shares closed at higher prices than they opened on both august and august.indeed,by the end of august,the stock was trading a few dollars higher than it had been at the beginning of the month,without having experienced any significant fluctuations.
yet,u nbeknownst to investors,the disclosure of the fda warning letter had a detrimental effect on viread sales.physicians,now alerted to gilead illegal marketing efforts and to the safety problems with viread,were less eager to prescribe it to their patients.competitors invoked the letter in efforts to persuade physicians to switch from viread to their products.in the remaining weeks of august,there was a marked drop in prescriptions and sales of viread.although the investors lack precise sales figures,a morgan stanley analyst report shows that viread prescriptions experienced a sharp drop in august,followed by flattened growth for the remainder of the third quarter.the prescriptions would have suffered further decline were it not for certain that made it dangerous for some patients to discontinue using the drug.
the wholesalers observed the initial drop in sales and prescriptions of viread,and the ensuing slow growth.because viread was underperforming relative to the expectations generated by the second quarter reports,the wholesalers drew down much more of their excess inventory than they had originally planned,letting supply of viread drop to the lowest level in four quarters,and well below the industry average for other drugs.
although wholesalers recognized viread struggles,the public continued to misunderstand the significance of the warning letter.gilead did nothing to correct that misunderstanding.in its form reporting on the second quarter,issued on august,gilead persisted in emphasizing the increased volume of viread second quarter sales without discussing the role of marketing.although the form did briefly address the warning letter,it failed to reveal the activities that gave rise to that letter,or the impact the letter would have on sales of viread.
the officers exploited the public ignorance.in the days between the receipt and public disclosure of the warning letter,two of the officers each sold over million worth of stock.on august,the day the fda disclosed the letter,gilead senior vice financial officer sold nearly worth of shares.throughout august,while the market misapprehended gilead impending troubles,the officers continued to sell off substantial numbers of shares.this activity was unusual and suspicious because this was the first month in which all of the officers sold stock.more to the point,this was proof that the officers acted with knowledge or with deliberate recklessness when they issued materially false and misleading documents and statements that were disseminated to the investing public.
not until october,did the public finally realize the impact of the marketing and the warning letter.after the markets closed that day,gilead issued a press release detailing third quarter financial results.the public learned that viread sales fell significantly below expectations because there had been substantially more overstocking by wholesalers than previously reported.accordingly,third quarter prescriptions were filled by wholesalers existing inventory,and wholesalers did not reorder viread at a commensurate level.market analysts attributed the disappointing sales to lower demand.that lower demand,as noted,was a direct result of the warning letter,which had exposed gilead unlawful marketing efforts to physicians.
the market was stunned by the third quarter results.share prices closed at on october,before the press release was circulated.it may be the case that the market had already begun to slowly incorporate the information regarding viread marketing into the share price.but the earnings release made the effect of that information inescapably clear.the day after the press release was issued,trading volume of gilead shares was up from its average daily level.the day opened with gilead price per share at,and closed with a price of per share,a decrease from the previous day closing price.
summing it all up,
at all relevant times,the material misrepresentations directly or proximately caused or were a substantial contributing cause of the damages sustained by the investors gilead and the officers made or caused to be made a series of materially false or misleading statements about gilead sales,business,product marketing and promotion,prospects,operations and financial results.these material misstatements had the cause and effect of creating in the market an unrealistically positive assessment of gilead thus causing the company publicly traded securities to be overvalued and artificially inflated at all relevant times.
ii.the district court decision 
the district court dismissed the complaint with prejudice.based on the investors allegations and documents that had been referenced in the complaint,the court concluded that the investors had failed to adequately plead loss causation as that requirement was articulated in dura pharmaceuticals,broudo,d.
specifically,the district court found the complaint failed to 
connect the following chain of events that gilead and the officers alleged failure to disclose the marketing scheme caused a material increase in sales that practitioners materially decreased their demand for viread due to the publication of the fda warning letter and most importantly,that the alleged decrease in sales due to the fda letter proximately caused gilead stock to decrease three months later.
the district court rested its decision exclusively on loss causation,and did not consider whether the investors sufficiently alleged falsity or scienter.
