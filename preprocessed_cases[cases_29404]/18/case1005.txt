in this shareholder derivative action,katherine potter potter alleges that the collectively,defendants,who are managers and directors of public storage,ps,wrongfully managed ps.the district court dismissed the action on the grounds that potter failed to make an adequate demand on the board of directors of ps board before filing her suit.we affirm.
ps is a california corporation that is publicly traded on the new york stock exchange.potter and charles krieger krieger filed a derivative complaint against ps and sixteen individual defendants on december,alleging twelve causes of action including waste of corporate assets,breach of fiduciary duty,fraud,and violation of the act of.these allegations related to three alleged transactions ps acquisition of an entity known as psic psic transaction the use of ps resources to provide services to a canadian business owned by the hughes family,who are prominent members of the board canadian transaction and ps payment of management and advisory fees to entities owned by other defendants m a transaction.upon defendants motion to dismiss,the district court dismissed the complaint with leave to amend,concluding that krieger and potter did not satisfy the requirements of rule of the federal rules of civil procedure and california law 
potter and krieger filed an amended complaint on july,alleging the same twelve causes of action but this time relating them to only two transactions,the psic transaction and the canadian transaction.defendants once again moved to dismiss,and the district court dismissed the second complaint,concluding that krieger failed the contemporaneous ownership requirement and that potter failed to make an adequate demand on the board.
krieger does not appeal his dismissal,so this appeal concerns only the adequacy of potter demand on the board.however,krieger plays a major role in the facts leading to potter appeal.krieger sent a demand letter to the board on november.this letter complained of the psic transaction but did not discuss the canadian transaction.it also did not mention potter by name,but noted that t wo individuals who reside in southern california where the lawsuit will be filed will join with me to bring the action.potter alleges that she was one of the two unnamed individuals to whom krieger was referring in the letter.
on january,krieger and attorney douglas connon connon met with members of the special committee established by the board to investigate the allegations in the november letter.at the meeting,connon told the members of the committee that he was representing potter and that he had her power of attorney.in a series of later letters,dated march,april,june,and november,krieger wrote to the board reiterating the complaints relating to the psic transaction that he had raised in the demand letter,and also asked the board to provide him information concerning the canadian transaction.when the board did not take action that krieger and potter found satisfactory,they sued.
having doubts about the foundation for federal question jurisdiction under,the panel by order raised the issue of subject matter jurisdiction sua sponte and received additional briefing.having reviewed the briefing and having considered the matter further,we take no position on whether appellants complaint raises a sufficient federal question under because we instead conclude that we may consider at the outset whether potter satisfied federal rule of civil procedure.deciding that rule was not satisfied,we hold that the complaint should be dismissed and we need not further address jurisdiction.
supreme court precedent is clear that we may choose among threshold grounds for denying audience to a case on the merits.wilbur locke,cir quoting ruhrgas ag marathon oil,d see also ruhrgas ag,at.while steel citizens for a better environment,d,reasoned that jurisdiction necessarily precedes a ruling on the merits,the same principle does not dictate a sequencing of jurisdictional issues.these precedents apply most commonly where both of the competing threshold issues go to the court power under the constitution.
however,there are grounds on which we may dismiss a suit before considering the existence of federal subject matter jurisdiction.these include jurisdictional grounds that are discretionary,such as pendent jurisdiction or younger abstention,see steel,at,grounds of prudential standing,such as statutory standing,see national passenger national ass of passengers,d since we hold that no right of action exists,questions of standing and jurisdiction became immaterial,and grounds that are logically antecedent to the existence of any article iii issues,such as class certification under federal rule of civil procedure,see ortiz fibreboard,d amchem prods.windsor,d.
in this case,the issue of whether potter satisfied the demand pleading requirements of rule is logically antecedent to the issue of whether we have jurisdiction over this action.pursuant to rule,a putative derivative plaintiff can initiate a derivative action only if he or she makes an adequate demand on the board under applicable state law.see also kayes,at.therefore,unless we determine that a proper demand was made,there is no lawsuit over which to exercise jurisdiction.thus,as in ortiz and amchem,the jurisdictional issue would not exist but for this court determination regarding the adequacy of potter demand.accordingly,it is appropriate for us to reach the rule issue first.see ortiz,at.amchem,at.
we note also that a valid demand is a requirement for statutory standing under california law.shields singleton,th,d.although california courts do not define the limits of our jurisdiction,this required demand supports our conclusion that the satisfaction of the requirements of rule is a logical antecedent to federal jurisdictional questions.see ortiz,at.noting that rule certification is logically antecedent to article iii concerns,and pertain s to statutory standing,which may properly be treated before article iii standing.
accordingly,we address whether rule was satisfied both because compliance with rule is logically antecedent to assessing article iii issues,and because this raises an issue of state statutory standing 
the parties disagree about the applicable standard of review.potter argues that because her complaint was dismissed,we should review the district court dismissal de novo.defendants argue that district court determinations regarding the demand requirement for derivative actions are reviewed for abuse of discretion.
defendants are correct.although dismissals for failure to state a claim are reviewed de novo,the district court determination that potter did not comply with rule or california law regarding the demand and regarding demand futility is reviewed for abuse of discretion.in re silicon graphics.sec,cir see also greenspun del webb,cir the district court determined that greenspun failed to make a demand and that such a demand would not have been futile.we must affirm unless the district court abused its discretion in reaching this conclusion.
federal rule of civil procedure permits a plaintiff to bring a shareholder derivative suit if two requirements are met.first,the plaintiff must have owned shares in the corporation at the time of the disputed transaction the contemporary ownership requirement.second,the plaintiff must allege with particularity the efforts,if any,made by the plaintiff to obtain the action the plaintiff desires from the directors the demand requirement.however,failure to meet the demand requirement may be excused if the facts show that demand would have been futile.smith sperling,d.in this appeal,the questions are whether potter adequately made a demand and,if not,whether the lack of demand is excused as futile.
we first consider whether potter made a valid demand on the board for either or both of the transactions raised in the complaint.the parties do not dispute that a valid demand must give the board of directors the opportunity to consider and act upon the proposed litigation by presenting to the board the ultimate facts of each cause of action and the action which plaintiff wishes the board to take to remedy the alleged wrongdoing.shields,th at,d see also lewis sporck,listing factors.
defendants argue that although these elements were generally present in krieger letters regarding psic,potter failed to make a valid demand about that transaction because she was not named in the demand letter.the november,demand letter was sent by krieger alone and it did not mention potter by name.potter argues that the mere absence of her name should not invalidate an otherwise valid demand,and that the board was informed of potter participation at the time of the january,meeting,which potter attorney,connon,attended.
the gist of the defendants position is that the identity of the plaintiff shareholder is a required element of a valid demand,and for us the dispositive issue is whether defendants are correct in this respect.stated another way,the key issue is whether potter failed to make a demand by remaining anonymous in krieger letters.
in support of their contention,defendants rely primarily upon a delaware case,smachlo birkelo.in smachlo,the district court considered a demand letter sent by a shareholder attorney.like krieger letter in this case,the demand letter in smachlo did not identify the shareholders making the demand,stating only that the represent s the owners of approximately shares of el paso stock id.the district court in smachlo concluded that the letter was not a valid demand because it failed to include the name of the shareholder making the demand,and that a company board of directors should not be required to act upon the demand of an alleged shareholder when that shareholder fails to properly identify himself.id.
smachlo is directly on point.although the case applies delaware law,california law,as we have said,is identical to delaware law on the demand requirement.see oakland raiders,th at,d noting reliance on delaware law shields,th at,d noting that california and delaware law are substantively identical on the demand requirement.
potter efforts to distinguish smachlo do not persuade us.it is of no moment that the letter in smachlo did not identify any potential plaintiffs,while the november,letter identified krieger,because krieger known presence does not relieve potter of the obligation to make a valid demand.a plain reading of rule also supports this result.rule requires particularized pleading of the efforts undertaken by the plaintiff.in this case,potter has alleged only that krieger undertook efforts to demand action by the board.even if krieger purported also to represent additional unnamed plaintiffs in southern california,and one of these unnamed plaintiffs was potter,the complaint simply does not show that potter herself undertook any efforts to demand action from the board.
the facts here make the attempt to distinguish smachlo especially unconvincing,because the district court held that krieger could not bring a derivative suit because he failed the contemporaneous ownership requirement.because krieger was not qualified to make a demand due to his lack of contemporaneous ownership,it would be an odd result if potter were allowed to remain anonymous in reliance on the demand made by krieger,who beyond doubt did not satisfy rule.
the identity of the shareholder is also an important practical element of a demand.the identity of the complaining shareholder may shed light on the veracity or significance of the facts alleged in the demand letter,and the board might properly take a different course of action depending on the shareholder identity.before a demand letter can properly invoke a duty of a corporate board to take action to correct alleged wrongdoing,the board is entitled to know with specificity the identity of the person making the demand.see generally james moore et,moore federal practice the demand requirement permits the board to correct the alleged wrong,encourages dispute resolution,and allows the board to use its expertise and resources to control litigation.
this is not merely a technical or unimportant requirement.rather,the general rule of american law is that the board of directors controls a corporation.accordingly,strict compliance with rule and the applicable substantive law is necessary before a derivative suit can wrest control of an issue from the board of directors.as a leading treatise observes,t he demand requirement is designed to promote the basic principle of corporate governance that the board of directors,and not individual shareholders,manages the affairs of the corporation.id.
potter argues that her attorney attendance at the january,meeting with members of ps special committee amounted to a valid demand because the board learned of potter identity at that time.but as defendants point out,the complaint does not allege that the attorney said anything at the meeting that would amount to a legal demand.nor does potter allege that the attorney submitted any demand to the board in writing,as california law requires.see cal.b.the board was entitled to receive a valid demand and was not required to piece together by inference the disparate events that,if taken together,might have been sufficient to require corporate action.accordingly,the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that potter failed to make an adequate demand.
we next consider whether potter sufficiently alleged that making a demand on the board would have been futile.potter argues that her suit should be allowed to proceed even if she failed to make a valid demand,because making such a demand would have been futile.the test for proving the futility of a demand for relief is whether the facts show a reasonable doubt that the directors are disinterested and independent,or the challenged transaction was otherwise the product of a valid exercise of business judgment.in re silicon graphics.sec,at citing aronson lewis,overruled on other grounds,brehm eisner.potter has alleged demand futility on appeal only with regard to the canadian transaction.she alleges that the members of the board were interested in the transaction or were not independent because they were dominated by the hughes family,which held several seats on the board.
potter demand futility argument fails.most significantly,potter allegations are not complete and detailed enough to excuse her from the demand requirement.i n order to evaluate the demand futility claim,the court must be apprised of facts specific to each director from which it can conclude that that particular director could or could not be expected to fairly evaluate the claims of the shareholder plaintiff.shields,th at,d.
the complaint contains few details about the members of the board aside from the fact that they voted for the transactions that potter disputes.these allegations,taken alone,are insufficient as a matter of law.w here mere approval of corporate action,absent or other indication of bias,is the sole basis for establishing the director wrongdoing and hence for excusing demand on them,plaintiff suit should ordinarily be dismissed.greenspun,at internal citation omitted.and while potter does make some specific accusations about the directors,only a few directors are alleged to have any interests that might excuse demand if held by a majority of the board.a majority of the directors discussed in the complaint are not alleged to have any interest that would make them unable to consider a demand made by a shareholder.also,that the board appointed a special committee to consider krieger demands regarding the psic transaction reflects rather poorly on potter argument that the same board would not have taken at least that step to consider the canadian transaction,which,potter alleges,was a product of the same.
accordingly,potter allegations do not create a reasonable doubt as to the board overall honesty or independence,and she is not excused from the demand requirement as we have explained,t he task of demanding action under rule is not onerous.no policy recommends eviscerating the demand requirement as plaintiff would have us do.greenspun,at.
katherine potter potter has filed a state law derivative shareholder suit on behalf of nominal defendant public storage.the district court dismissed her suit on the ground that her failure to name herself in the written demand presented by the plaintiffs to the corporation deprived her of standing to maintain this action under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure potter appeals,arguing that california law does not require her to identify herself by name in the written demand presented to the board of directors.before addressing this open issue of california law,however,we should recognize our independent obligation to inquire into the presence or absence of subject matter jurisdiction,in re excel innovations,cir,and dismiss this case for want of subject matter jurisdiction.in bypassing this jurisdictional question,the majority strays from the supreme court direction in steel citizens for a better env t,d and sinochem int l malaysia int l shipping,d,as well as from the fifth circuit interpretation of these cases.see rivera,cir.
a federal court generally may not rule on the merits of a case without first determining that it has jurisdiction over the category of claim in suit jurisdiction and the parties personal jurisdiction.sinochem.at.put another way,j urisdiction is power to declare the law,and when it ceases to exist,the only function remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause.steel,at.quoting ex parte mccardle,wall.
the supreme court has clarified that this general rule has exceptions a federal court has leeway to choose among threshold grounds for denying audience to a case on the merits.sinochem.at quoting ruhrgas ag marathon oil,d.for example,a district court may dispose of an action by a forum non conveniens dismissal,bypassing questions of and personal jurisdiction,when considerations of convenience,fairness,and judicial economy so warrant.id.at.in addition,a district court could dispose of a case on threshold grounds,such as abstention under younger harris,d,discretionary refusal to entertain pendent jurisdiction,see moor county of alameda,d,and dismissal under the rule of totten united states,which prohibits suits against the government arising out of covert espionage agreements.sinochem.at 
the supreme court has also held it may avoid reaching subject matter jurisdiction and instead dismiss an action for failure to meet class certification requirements under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.see ortiz fibreboard,d amchem prods.windsor,d.as noted by the fifth circuit,this is a limited exception for suits in which the class certification issues are logically antecedent to the existence of any article iii issues,and the class certification itself create s the jurisdictional issue.rivera,at quoting amchem,at.in amchem,the proposed class of plaintiffs included persons whom the defendants alleged lacked article iii standing to sue because they had not sustained a cognizable injury or because their injury was not redressable.id.at.if the class did not meet the substantive prerequisites imposed by rule the court would not need to determine the article iii standing issue.accordingly,the court determined that the class certification issues were logically antecedent to jurisdictional issues in amchem and ortiz because the jurisdictional issues would not exist but for the certification.amchem,at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted,alterations in original see also ortiz,at.
neither sinochem nor the class action certification cases,amchem and ortiz,change the supreme court command that we address subject matter jurisdiction at the outset in the mine run of cases,and reach other issues first only where the jurisdictional issue is difficult to determine and the other ground is relatively less burdensome.sinochem.at accord ruhrgas,at.stating that expedition and sensitivity to state courts coequal stature should impel the federal court to dispose of the issue of subject matter jurisdiction first.in sinochem,the court was faced with a textbook case for immediate forum non conveniens dismissal,while the jurisdiction issue presented an issue of first impression.at.moreover,d iscovery concerning personal jurisdiction would have burdened sinochem with expense and delay.id.requiring the court to address jurisdictional issues in such circumstances would disserve judicial economy.id.as the court clarified 
if a court can readily determine that it lacks jurisdiction over the cause or the defendant,the proper course would be to dismiss on that ground.in the mine run of cases,jurisdiction will involve no arduous inquiry and both judicial economy and the consideration ordinarily accorded the plaintiff choice of forum should impel the federal court to dispose of those issues first.
id.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
in sum,federal courts normally must resolve questions of subject matter jurisdiction before reaching other threshold issues.only where the other issue itself creates the jurisdictional issue as in the class action certifications under rule in ortiz and amchem,or the resolution of the issue is clear while the jurisdictional issue is difficult,see sinochem.at,is it appropriate for the court to proceed without confirming jurisdiction.
in this case,the district court dismissed potter claim on the ground that potter lacked standing under rule of the federal rule of civil procedure due to her failure to make a valid demand on the public storage board of directors.the majority agrees with this approach.op.at.in my view,the majority has gone astray,first by misconceiving the nature of rule,and second by deciding a threshold issue that is neither clear nor logically antecedent to the jurisdictional question.
the majority starts down the wrong path by characterizing the threshold question in this case as being whether potter satisfied the demand pleading requirements of rule,and asserting that p ursuant to rule,a putative derivative plaintiff can initiate a derivative action only if he or she makes an adequate demand on the board under applicable state law.op.at.but rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure is a rule of pleading only it does not impose any substantive demand requirement.kamen kemper fin,d.as kamen held 
a lthough rule clearly contemplates both the demand requirement and the possibility that demand may be excused,it does not create a demand requirement of any particular dimension.on its face,rule speaks only to the adequacy of the shareholder representative pleadings.indeed,as a rule of procedure issued pursuant to the rules enabling act,rule can not be understood to abridge,enlarge or modify any substantive right.b.
id.at.emphasis in original.rule b required potter only to state with particularity any effort to obtain the desired action from the directors and the reasons for not obtaining the action or not making the effort.id.potter complaint met these formal pleading requirements she stated that she made a formal written demand on the board of directors,and that though the original demand letter identified her merely as a plaintiff,she was identified by name at a subsequent meeting with a public storage special committee formulated to investigate the plaintiffs demand for suit.
neither the district court nor the majority disputes that potter satisfied rule formal pleading requirements.rather,the majority holds that the district court correctly dismissed potter action on a different threshold ground,namely,that her action is deficient on the merits because she failed to establish the substantive adequacy of her demand as required under california corporate law.op.at.in effect,the majority holds that this issue of state law is an appropriate threshold ground for denying audience to a case on the merits.sinochem.at quoting ruhrgas,at.alteration added.
i disagree with this conclusion.sinochem,ortiz,and amchem made only limited exceptions to the general rule that we must address our jurisdiction first.they do not support dismissing an action based on a threshold ground that raises an unsettled issue of state law.california courts have not considered whether california law requires plaintiffs bringing a derivative action to identify themselves by name in a written demand.in declaring that california law imposes such a requirement,the majority relies on a analysis.first,the majority notes california decisions that stand generally for the proposition that corporate law developed in the state of delaware is identical to california corporate law for all practical purposes.oakland raiders football league,th,d see also shields,th,d.second,the majority relies on smachlo birkelo,in which a federal district court considered whether the plaintiff had met the demand requirement to bring a shareholder derivative suit.
in smachlo,the court jurisdiction was premised on diversity and exclusive federal jurisdiction for claims alleging violations of section b of the securities exchange act,b and rule of the securities and exchange commission.id.at.the district court held that a shareholder demand letter was inadequate because,among other faults,it failed to identify a single complaining shareholder,gave the board only a deadline for action,and answered the corporation request for additional information by filing the derivative complaint.smachlo.at.but the district court did not identify the source of law from which it derived this requirement.although the majority asserts that smachlo applies delaware law,op.at,the district court cited no delaware case and provided no indication that it was applying delaware law.
based on this analysis,the majority concludes that a decision by a federal district court sitting in delaware has established a bright line california rule that plaintiffs lack standing to bring a derivative action unless they identify themselves by name in a written demand to the corporation.but the majority points to no california or delaware case holding that the failure to constitutes a failure to make a valid demand.as noted,smachlo does not expressly interpret delaware law,and more fairly stands for the limited proposition that a putative derivative plaintiff must permit the board,as part of its reasonable investigation of the claims at issue,to ascertain the identity of the shareholder.see id.considering that the directors of public storage were informed in a meeting of potter identity,the demand in this case was arguably sufficient under smachlo.smachlo is thus a thin reed on which to avoid consideration of our subject matter jurisdiction in favor of a dismissal on state standing grounds.
not only is the threshold issue identified by the majority an open issue of california law,but nothing in sinochem suggests that a state standing requirement would ever be an appropriate threshold basis for dismissal.the threshold issues identified in sinochem as appropriate bases for dismissing a case before reaching the question of the court jurisdiction were federal procedural rules,not requirements of substantive state law.see.at.to dismiss a case on a state standing requirement,a federal court must delve into state law to clarify often fine distinctions between threshold and issues,and may have to resolve an open issue of state law.see sinochem.at the critical point is that r esolving a forum non conveniens motion does not entail any assumption by the court of substantive power.sinochem provides no support for dismissing an action on an issue of state standing as uncertain as the demand requirement in this case.
nor does the exception for class action certifications in ortiz and amchem avail the majority.as stated,ortiz and amchem created only a limited exception for suits in which the class certification issues are logically antecedent to the existence of any article iii issues.rivera,at quoting amchem,at.yet the california standing question raised by this case is not logically antecedent to the question of our jurisdiction and does not create a jurisdictional issue in the same way that class certification in amchem created questions about the article iii standing of members of the class.see rivera,at stating that the amchem exception is not applicable to the question whether the plaintiffs had standing because the question would exist whether rivera filed her claim alone or as part of a class class certification did not create the jurisdictional issue.while the need to determine whether members of a class meet article iii standing requirements does not arise until a class has been certified,the jurisdictional issue whether there is a federal question or other basis for federal jurisdiction exists whether or not potter has made an adequate demand under california corporate law.although a determination that potter lacks standing under california law to bring her derivative suit would certainly dispose of this case,see op.at,the same can be said about any dispositive threshold issue.
the majority approach allows a federal court to bypass subject matter jurisdiction and dispose of a case by adjudicating a difficult state law issue,despite the supreme court direction that we should generally address subject matter jurisdiction at the outset.sinochem.at.in my view,we should join the fifth circuit,and address our lack of subject matter jurisdiction at the outset,rather than rely on the limited exception articulated in amchem and ortiz,which is not applicable here.see rivera,cir.
the correct path here is to consider our subject matter jurisdiction first.under,we have jurisdiction over only those cases in which a complaint establishes either that federal law creates the cause of action or that the plaintiff right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal law.franchise tax bd.constr.laborers vacation trust,d.the second basis for jurisdiction arises when a federal court determines that a claim necessarily raise s a stated federal issue,actually disputed and substantial,which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities.williston basin interstate pipeline v.an exclusive gas storage leasehold easement in the cloverly subterranean geological formation,cir quoting grable sons metal,darue eng g,d.potter complaint does not allege a federal cause of action and the federal statutes potter cites in her complaint do not provide for a private right of action.see provision of the act requiring issuers to certify periodic financial reports and providing criminal penalties,but no cause of action,for violations of the section.nor am i aware of a basis for inferring such a private right.see alexander sandoval,d holding that a court may not infer a private right of action from a federal statute unless congress has displayed an intent to create not just a private right but also a private remedy,and noting that statutes focusing on the person regulated rather than the individuals protected fail to indicate the requisite congressional intent see also walzer ual,civ.cm,wl,at,holding no private cause of action under the act citing in re bisys group.derivative action,d.the absence of a federal private right of action undercuts the existence of subject matter jurisdiction under.see grable,at.discussing merrell dow pharm.thompson,d.
the state law claims potter raises also do not necessarily raise a stated federal issue,actually disputed and substantial,which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities.grable,at.in grable,the court determined it had federal question jurisdiction over a state claim where the meaning of the federal statute was an essential element of a state quiet title action,and the meaning of the federal statute was actually in dispute.id.at.although the complaint here alleges breach of fiduciary duty to public storage by,among other things,failure to comply with the act certification requirement,neither the complaint nor the parties raise a substantial dispute regarding its meaning.rather,the complaint raises claims typical of state derivative actions its assertions that defendants failed to comply with the act are incidental.because the complaint does not necessarily raise a disputed and substantial federal question,t his case can not be squeezed into the slim category grable exemplifies.empire healthchoice assurance,mcveigh,d
