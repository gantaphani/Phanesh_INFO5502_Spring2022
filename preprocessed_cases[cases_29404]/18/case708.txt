mary harp was an employee at charter communications,which held the cable franchise for the city of louis and surrounding areas,including parts of southern illinois.in february,she was terminated as part of a reduction in force rif that resulted in the loss of employment for approximately people.at the time,she was the supervisor for the technical audit department for the louis marketing area,and the entire audit department was eliminated as part of the rif.harp subsequently brought this action,alleging that her termination was in retaliation for her whistleblowing activities as an employee of charter,in violation of the act.see a.harp asserts that she reported,within the proper channels in the company,that payments were being authorized to a contractor for work that was not performed.the district court granted judgment in favor of charter,and harp appealed.
section a of the act provides whistleblower protection for employees of companies by prohibiting employers from retaliating against them for any lawful act done by the employee to provide information,cause information to be provided,or otherwise assist in an investigation regarding any conduct which the employee reasonably believes constitutes mail fraud,bank fraud,securities fraud,or violation of any rule or regulation of the sec,or any federal law relating to fraud against shareholders,when the information or assistance is provided to a person with investigatory authority.a.that provision adopts the framework applicable to whistleblower claims brought under the wendell ford aviation investment and reform act for the century,b,and the relevant burdens of proof are set forth in b and numerous court opinions 
to prevail under this provision,an employee must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she engaged in protected activity the employer knew that she engaged in the protected activity she suffered an unfavorable personnel action and the protected activity was a contributing factor in the unfavorable action if the employee established these four elements,the employer may avoid liability if it can prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the absence of that protected behavior.

harp claim of retaliation rests on her belief that barry wilson,her supervisor and the senior general manager of the louis key marketing area kma at charter,authorized payments to a contractor,msta,for work that msta had not in fact performed under its contract with the company.the genesis of this claim is somewhat convoluted,but will be briefly described insofar as it is relevant to the particular claim before us.
charter technical audit department was responsible for conducting audits to determine whether households were unlawfully obtaining cable services.the audits were performed both internally and through the use of outside contractors.charter contracted with msta to perform certain auditing services required for charter business.those services included visiting the homes of to determine whether they had access to cable for which they were not paying.msta claimed that the contract also directed it to visit the homes of subscribers to ensure that they were only receiving the cable services for which they paid.charter,and particularly harp,disputed that the contract included payment for visiting the homes of subscribers.as part of her job as supervisor of the technical audit department,harp was responsible for ensuring that msta performed the services for which it sought payment.harp determined that msta was seeking payments for services that it either had not performed,or for services not authorized by the contract.
by harp own admission,her supervisor barry wilson was initially receptive to harp complaint as to msta billing practices.wilson acknowledged that msta was notorious for improper billing,encouraged harp to look for proof of falsification,and instructed her to meet with charter counsel,hunt brown.harp agrees that those actions by wilson support an inference that wilson was taking msta fraudulent billing seriously.on january,wilson assembled a meeting which included harp,wilson,tom baker,and a representative from msta.the meeting devolved into accusations by harp of discrepancies in the services performed and the invoices submitted by specific documentation of msta denials and challenges to those positions.although harp was prepared with specific examples of improper billings by msta,she did not have a summary of numbers that she believed were proper or figures that would represent a just resolution of the matter.ultimately,wilson abruptly terminated the meeting.it is that action,and the directive given by wilson at that time,that forms the crux of harp allegation here.
according to harp,in summarily terminating the meeting,wilson rescued msta representatives from having to answer direct questions about their wrongdoings.harp then asserts that at the close of that meeting,wilson directed baker to pay msta the full contract amount.on appeal,harp allegation of fraud relies specifically on that alleged directive to pay the full amount,as she states in her reply brief 
wilson abruptly ended the meeting and ordered tom baker to pay msta the full contract amount app,not a negotiated amount,which would have been more suggestive of the inference charter asks the court to draw,that harp could have viewed barry wilson conduct only as a legitimate negotiated settlement.
reply brief at.harp further noted that prior to that meeting,she had reported directly to wilson as her immediate supervisor,but that a restructuring was implemented that interposed baker between herself and wilson in the command chain.she maintains that the sudden inclusion of baker was a means of avoiding harp,in that wilson could then instruct baker to pay the entire contract amount.after that january meeting,harp spoke with the contract administrator,mary capstick,and informed her that wilson had assigned the project to tom baker to get together with msta and determine how much charter would have to pay to make the matter go away.two days later,harp filed an oral report with brooke wilson,who was authorized to handle such complaints,alleging that barry wilson conduct violated charter ethics code.
harp claim therefore rests on the apparent change of heart by wilson as evidenced in that january meeting,and harp subsequent reporting of the alleged misconduct through the proper investigatory channels at the company.we note initially that although the testimony is that harp reported a violation of the code of ethics,as opposed to a violation of federal laws,the critical focus is on whether the employee reported specific conduct that constituted a violation of federal law,not whether the employee correctly identified that law.see welch,at.if the specific conduct reported was violative of federal law,the report would be sufficient to trigger protection even if the employee did not identify the appropriate federal law by name.id.
the problem with harp case,however,is that the record does not support harp characterization of that january meeting.specifically,the record does not indicate that wilson ordered payment of the full amount to msta,or even that he ordered payments of any amounts not properly earned.in the deposition testimony upon which she relies for this point,harp does not recite any statements by wilson.instead,harp relates a conversation with baker,in which she asks him what he thinks wilson intended after ending the meeting.baker replied that with respect to the invoices,he had accrued for them,so he thought they were going to be paid.when harp was then asked if she knew what amount accrued,and whether it was the excess amounts she did not authorize,harp replied that she did not know.therefore,harp allegation of fraud in this case rests on a conversation with baker in which she attempts to divine wilson intent in paying the invoices,and in which baker states that he thinks that the accrued amount is to be paid.
harp acknowledges that she does not know if that accrued amount was more than the amount she had determined was properly earned by msta.those statements are far too ambiguous to support an objectively reasonable belief that a fraudulent payment had been ordered by wilson.this is particularly true given that wilson conduct to that point had been to support harp in her investigation of msta and to include her in the meeting which sought to address the payments to msta.finally,that characterization of the january meeting is contradicted by harp herself.in plaintiff supplemental response to defendant first interrogatories,harp states that wilson had stopped the meeting and assigned to baker the job of meeting with msta and determining what amount would have to be paid to make the matter go away.that is different than stating that charter should pay msta the entire amount requested,and instead reflects a decision to meet with msta concerning the disputed amount to come to a resolution.in fact,harp complaint of unethical conduct,which forms the basis for her claim,refers only to wilson desire to achieve a negotiated settlement,not an authorization to pay the full amount.the record contains the written copy of that complaint,and she alleges only that it was a breach of ethics for wilson to end the meeting and to seek a speedy resolution of the msta billing problems for the sake of putting this behind us,and to come to a negotiated settlement above that which is approved for payment.harp,then,was concerned that msta would be paid more than it had earned,but she clearly contemplated future not present action in paying msta.her complaint itself speaks in terms of a negotiated settlement,and there is no evidence that any such settlement figure had been reached at that time.
therefore,there was no basis,subjective or objective,for harp to conclude at that time that wilson had authorized full payment.on appeal,harp does not argue that wilson was engaging in fraud in attempting to negotiate a settlement.in fact,she argues that wilson ordered payment of the full a negotiated amount which,according to harp,would have reflected a legitimate attempt to resolve the issue.we have no need to consider whether efforts to pursue a negotiated settlement at such an early stage as was present here can ever give rise to an belief that a fraud was being committed,because that is not argued here.
the conclusion that harp did not reasonably believe a fraud was being committed is further buttressed by wilson subsequent actions in the case.after the january meeting,harp continued to investigate msta,and no amounts were paid without harp authorization.full payment was not in fact made to msta after that meeting,and in fact was never made.instead,the amounts paid to msta reflected the amounts approved by harp as earned by msta.moreover,after the january meeting,harp sent an email to wilson regarding the meeting and making clear that she did not believe that msta should be paid any more than it was owed.wilson responded by indicating that he terminated the meeting because he did not want to continue in a fashion,and that he had no qualms supporting harp as they moved forward with the msta matter.he further stated that it was important to document their claims in an unequivocal fashion,and declared that u nder no circumstances will we pay them for work not done.in plaintiff response to defendant first request to admit,harp acknowledges that no one at charter ever told her to stop investigating the billing issues with msta,and that wilson never told her that msta should be paid for work that msta did not do.in light of the sequence of events set forth by harp herself in written statements and deposition testimony,there is simply no objective basis for harp to have believed that fraudulent payments were authorized on january,or at a later date for that matter.that is the only fraud that is before the court today under the act.
we note that harp in the opening brief expounds at length on charter allegedly improper use of msta,which was a business,to meet the city of st louis minority goals,while allowing msta to subcontract much of the work to firms.harp acknowledges that she was unaware of any of that history at the time of the incidents at issue here,and in any event those facts point to fraud on the city,not the shareholders,and that was not the fraud reported within the company nor is it the basis for the challenge.therefore,those facts are irrelevant to the issues before us.
because harp has failed to establish the first prong of the test,she can not succeed in her challenge.even were she to succeed in that hurdle,however,her claim could not succeed on the record before us.harp has the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that her report of the alleged misconduct was a contributing factor in her termination.and if she met that burden,charter could nonetheless prevail by establishing through clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the absence of that protected behavior.allen,at livingston,at.the circumstances of the termination would make those steps insurmountable for harp.
harp entire department,the technical audit department,was eliminated as part of the rif.in addition,approximately other persons at charter were laid off.the uncontradicted evidence in the record is that charter louis kma did not achieve its budget revenues for january.as a result of it falling short in its revenue collected,it also missed its cash flow.because this occurred in the first month of the year,the impact on the budget would be significant in each of the succeeding months if not corrected immediately.accordingly wilson was instructed by charter executive vice president for the midwest division and its chief operating officer to correct the problem as soon as possible.because it takes time to rebuild revenue,wilson was instructed to move quickly to reduce expenses.a decision was made to terminate approximately positions,and in order to minimize adverse impact on revenue generated by customers,it was decided that those positions should be the ones least related to customer recruitment and retention.therefore,departments such as marketing and service were not targeted,but the audit department was the audit functions taken over by the department in charge of quality control.as harp acknowledged in her deposition,that was not the first time in which the company would not have a dedicated group of individuals assigned to auditing in the past,the job had been done at times by technicians who would look for violations in the course of their work.harp has presented no evidence that charter was not in financial trouble,or that the audit department was selected for other,nefarious reasons.nor does she present evidence that any significant number of the employees subjected to the rif were rehired shortly,which would also be suggestive that the rif was not what it appeared to be.instead,harp focuses on minor discrepancies in testimony as to when the directive was issued that required the drastic improvements in the financial situation.differences such as whether a directive was made in early or late january or february,and as to whether the budget cuts had to show general improvement or meet a specific monetary target,are ancillary to the issue,which was whether the cuts were required by the financial situation of the company and the departments and individuals chosen were dictated by those financial considerations.harp does not contest that charter loui
