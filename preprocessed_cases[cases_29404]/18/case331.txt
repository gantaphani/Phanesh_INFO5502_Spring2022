alan schmidt,a former shareholder in the nowdefunct genaera corporation genaera,appeals from the district court order dismissing his complaint on statute of limitations grounds.genaera was a biotechnology company that dissolved in june and liquidated its assets.on june,schmidt brought suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania on behalf of himself and all other former genaera shareholders against the liquidating trustee argyce,llc argyce the genaera liquidating trust john skolas,who served as argyce ceo and genaera former cfo former major genaera shareholders xmark capital partners,llc xmark and biotechnology value fund,bvf former directors and officers of genaera d o defendants and the purchasers of certain genaera assets.the essence of schmidt complaint is that the liquidating trustee and the d o defendants breached their fiduciary duties by disposing of promising drug technologies in tainted insider deals for far less than their true value.he also alleges that xmark and bvf,genaera two largest shareholders,aided and abetted this behavior so that companies they controlled could acquire genaera assets at fire sale prices.all defendants except for sco financial group sco moved to dismiss schmidt complaint as untimely under the applicable statute of limitations.
schmidt did not dispute the applicability of the twoyear statute of limitations and acknowledged that he filed suit more than two years after the relevant assets were sold.instead,he argued that the statute of limitations should be tolled under pennsylvania discovery rule because he could not have been aware of the insider nature of the sales or that the assets were sold for far below their actual value until he learned the details of the sales,and certain subsequent market events suggested to him that the assets were quite valuable.the district court rejected this argument and held that schmidt had all the information he needed to file the suit more than two years before he filed.schmidt timely appeals 
genaera was a biotechnology company that developed pharmaceutical drugs and held licenses to patents and other intellectual property.in april,genaera board of directors concluded that the company prospects were dim,and announced their intent to dissolve the company.on april,the board unanimously approved,and recommended that the shareholders approve,a plan of dissolution to dispose of the company assets through a liquidating trust.on may,the board submitted a proxy statement to shareholders regarding the dissolution plan and filed that proxy statement with the sec.the proxy statement warned shareholders that they should expect to receive only of a penny to cents per share once the assets were liquidated.the complaint alleges that the proxy statement contained misrepresentations about whether any genaera officers or directors would profit from the dissolution,and that it was flawed in various ways.the shareholders approved the dissolution plan on june,and genaera filed articles of dissolution with the delaware secretary of state on june.pursuant to the dissolution plan,the company assets were transferred to the genaera liquidating trust,with defendant argyce as liquidating trustee.
three of genaera assets that were ultimately sold,with the proceeds being distributed to shareholders,are relevant to this appeal.the allegations related to each of those assets are discussed in turn.
a.the aminosterol assets 
the aminosterol assets consisted of compounds used for treating macular degeneration.the trustee sold the aminosterol assets in may for to bbm holdings,bbm,the predecessor to defendant ohr pharmaceuticals ohr.the complaint states that in august,the trustee publicly reported that the aminosterol assets inventory had been sold for a nominal sum.app.at.it is not clear from the complaint whether the trustee announcement named the purchaser or the sale price.ohr filed a form k in august announcing the purchase,with the purchase agreement including the sale price attached.
the complaint avers that the purchaser,bbm,is a shell company that arranged financing for the purchase before genaera shareholders even formally voted to dissolve the company.the complaint further alleges that argyce and skolas breached their fiduciary duties by agreeing prematurely to this offer instead of marketing the assets properly.the complaint also asserts that the aminosterol assets were worth far more than the sale price,citing a may presentation in which defendant ohr,the successor to bbm,estimated the potential market for drugs based on the compounds at million patients.
pexiganan was a topical cream for the treatment of diabetic foot infections.macrochem macrochem licensed the right to develop pexiganan from genaera in.under the terms of the license,genaera would receive payments totaling million upon the achievement of certain development milestones,up to million for reaching certain sales milestones,and of sales as royalties.the complaint alleges that at some point in,macrochem abruptly reversed course on pexiganan,app.at,spending only on development of pexiganan that year.defendant access pharmaceuticals acquired macrochem in,and ceased development of pexiganan.the complaint alleges that genaera had a right under its agreement with macrochem to demand the return of pexiganan if macrochem ceased development,but the d o defendants,in breach of their fiduciary duties,failed to exercise that right.pexiganan was ultimately returned to genaera liquidating trust in december,after genaera dissolution.the complaint implies that demanding the return of pexiganan earlier and continuing its development could have staved off the need to dissolve genaera.
the complaint further alleges that the liquidating trustee ultimately sold pexiganan in an improper,transaction.specifically,certain insiders from macrochem founded a new company,dipexium,which bid on pexiganan in liquidation.the liquidating trustee set a short deadline for bidding,announcing the availability of pexiganan on january,and setting a deadline of february,for bids.the complaint alleges that this short deadline favored the macrochem insiders associated with dipexium because they were already familiar with pexiganan.meanwhile,outside bidders had to await receipt of a confidential information package,review it,and perform pharmacological,regulatory,and valuation analyses,all in just one month before submitting their bids.although pexiganan sales potential for genaera was allegedly estimated to exceed million,dipexium ultimately acquired the rights to pexiganan for a minor purchase price and free of any royalty and milestone payment obligations.the complaint does not contain the exact date of the sale.and,schmidt contends that the earliest he could have known of pexiganan sale price was,when argyce publicly issued unaudited financial statements for the year ended december,which,according to the complaint,evidences that pexiganan was sold for approximately.the complaint alleges that about ninety days after buying the rights to pexiganan,dipexium raised million in funding to develop the asset,and raised another million ninety days after that.
interlukin 
was an antibody program for asthma.genaera had licensed the technology to medimmune,llc medimmune.under its agreement with medimmune,genaera could have received up to million in payments and royalties if reached certain development milestones.the complaint alleges that defendant skolas had previously told schmidt that had the potential for to billion peak year sales.app.at.
on may,the liquidating trustee sold for a mere million to defendant ligand pharmaceuticals ligand.two days later,ligand conveyed half of that interest to defendant bvf one of genaera largest shareholders.ligand filed the purchase agreement with the sec on may,as an attachment to a form k.the purchase agreement disclosed the price and the subsequent sale to bvf.
the complaint alleges that the sale to ligand for a de minimis price was a fraudulent transaction intended to allow bvf to acquire the asset at a price below its value.the complaint points to the fact that prior to the liquidation,bvf was both genaera shareholder and also owned of ligand stock.however,in the period before genaera dissolution,bvf sold ligand stock until it held less than a share,and thus would no longer be considered a ligand insider.bvf reduction in its ownership of ligand,the complaint alleges,was a smokescreen to disguise the fact that the sale of to ligand,which subsequently conveyed it to bvf,was actually a preferential sale to a major genaera shareholder.finally,the complaint alleges that the net effect of this transfer was to take a valuable asset that would have benefited all of genaera shareholders and transfer it to a single major shareholder.
schmidt brought suit against the liquidating trustee,the liquidating trust,john skolas,former officers and directors of genaera,bvf,ligand,xmark,ohr,dipexium,macrochem,access,and sco.the complaint contained twelve counts.those relevant to this appeal are 
count breach of fiduciary duty by the d o defendants 
count breach of the duties of a trustee by the liquidating trustee 
count waste of corporate assets by the d o defendants 
count breach of fiduciary duties owed by controlling shareholders to minority shareholders by defendants xmark,kaye and bvf 
count punitive damages 
count rescission of the sale of the aminosterol assets to ohr and 
count rescission of the sale of pexiganan to dipexium.
several of those counts also charge other defendants with aiding and abetting.all of the defendants except sco moved to dismiss on statute of limitations grounds.schmidt agreed to dismiss counts without prejudice before the district court rendered its decision.
the district court dismissed all counts of the complaint with prejudice.in relevant part,it held that schmidt filed the breach of fiduciary duty and corporate waste claims after the applicable statute of limitations had expired,and that the discovery rule did not save the claims.specifically,the district court held that schmidt had not met his burden of demonstrating that the discovery rule should apply here.app.at.in doing so,the district court noted that by may,all of the relevant transactions had occurred and been publicly announced,through a combination of updates from genaera liquidating trust,public sec filings,and press releases from the acquiring companies.id.at.it dismissed the rescission and punitive damages claims because they can not stand without their underlying claims,and dismissed counts with prejudice,even though schmidt had previously agreed to dismiss those claims without prejudice.
the district court decision did not cite,and the parties did not call to its attention,this court opinion in in re mushroom transportation,cir,which bears on this appeal because it provides standards for applying the discovery rule in cases involving the statute of limitations applicable to fiduciary defendants.
schmidt timely appeals.while he concedes that a statute of limitations applies and acknowledges that the relevant transactions occurred more than two years before he filed his suit,he argues that the district court erred in considering materials outside of the complaint in evaluating the defendants motions to dismiss,and that material factual disputes exist as to whether pennsylvania discovery rule tolled the limitations period.
we review a district court dismissal of a complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b de novo.phillips cnty.of allegheny,cir.under federal rule of civil procedure,a complaint need not anticipate or overcome affirmative defenses thus,a complaint does not fail to state a claim simply because it omits facts that would defeat a statute of limitations defense.see in re adams golf.sec,cir citing doe gte,cir l itigants need not try to plead around defenses.
schmidt argues that the district court erred in two ways first,by considering documents not appropriate for consideration at the motion to dismiss stage,and second,by holding that the discovery rule did not apply to toll pennsylvania statute of limitations.we address each of schmidt arguments in turn.
the district court erred in considering certain documents attached to defendants rule b motions.technically,the federal rules of civil procedure require a defendant to plead an affirmative defense,like a statute of limitations defense,in the answer,not in a motion to dismiss.see robinson johnson,cir.in this circuit,however,we permit a limitations defense to be raised by a motion under rule b only if the time alleged in the statement of a claim shows that the cause of action has not been brought within the statute of limitations.id.quoting hanna veterans admin,cir.however,i f the bar is not apparent on the face of the complaint,then it may not afford the basis for a dismissal of the complaint under rule b.id.quoting bethel jendoco constr,cir.
to decide a motion to dismiss,courts generally consider only the allegations contained in the complaint,exhibits attached to the complaint and matters of public record.pension benefit guar.white consol,cir see also mayer belichick,cir.however,an exception to the general rule is that a document integral to or explicitly relied upon in the complaint may be considered without converting the motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment.in re burlington coat factory sec,cir quoting shaw digital equip,cir,superseded on other grounds by pslra,b.the rationale underlying this exception is that the primary problem raised by looking to documents outside the complaint lack of notice to the plaintiff is dissipated w here the plaintiff has actual notice and has relied upon these documents in framing the complaint.id.quoting watterson page,cir.w hat is critical is whether the claims in the complaint are based on an extrinsic document and not merely whether the extrinsic document was explicitly cited.id.
the defendants in this case attached several different kinds of documents to their motions to dismiss.some,like the affidavits attached by the dipexium defendants,clearly may not be considered at this stage.see cent.contracting.cas,cir converting a motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment where the parties submitted affidavits in support of their positions.others,like the sec filings attached by a number of the defendants,are matters of public record of which the court can take judicial notice.see city of pittsburgh penn power,cir see also pension benefit guar,at explaining that public record s in this context are materials like decision letters of government agencies and published reports of administrative bodies.
the district court relied not just on the complaint and sec filings,but also on updates from genaera liquidating trust and press releases from the acquiring companies that the defendants attached to their motions to dismiss.app.at.the defendants argue that these materials,available before june,contain all the information schmidt needed to ascertain his injury.while that may be true,these materials may not be considered at the motion to dismiss stage.they are not integral to the complaint the complaint was not based on press releases or updates from genaera liquidation trust,but rather on sales transactions.see in re burlington coat factory sec,at.nor are those documents the records of a government agency.see pension benefit guar,at.
moreover,taking notice of these postings on genaera liquidating trust website and the press releases is inconsistent with the rationale of the integral documents exception.as this court explained in in re burlington coat factory securities litigation,the justification for the integral documents exception is that it is not unfair to hold a plaintiff accountable for the contents of documents it must have used in framing its complaint,nor should a plaintiff be able to evade accountability for such documents simply by not attaching them to his complaint.see at.but schmidt claims that he never saw the updates on the genaera liquidating trust website and disputes that they were publicly posted on the dates that the defendants claim that they were posted.he asserts that the document on which he based his complaint is genaera liquidating trust financial information for fiscal year,which was disclosed sometime in in a rep
