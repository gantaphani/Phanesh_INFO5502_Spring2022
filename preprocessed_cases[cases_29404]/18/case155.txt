statement of the case 
a.the mgps 
this case arises from the cleanup of hazardous waste created at certain former manufactured gas plants mgps in upstate new york,currently or formerly owned by nyseg or its predecessor companies.mgps began operating in the united states in the,producing gas used for cooking,lighting,and heating.the plants created gas by heating coal to very high temperatures in large ovens.the gas was then cleaned,processed and piped out for use.unfortunately,as the gas cooled,it created a number of,including coal tar,which inevitably leaked from equipment.because coal tar is heavier than water,it tends to migrate in the subsurface,and travels underground from a site through the water table until it runs into a confining layer,such as bedrock.coal tar also leaches into groundwater,causing groundwater contamination.the environmental protection agency epa listed coal tar as a hazardous waste in.see c.a see also identification and listing of hazardous waste cercla hazardous substance designation reportable quantity adjustment coke by products wastes.codified at pts.
most of the mgps closed in the and when natural gas began to be delivered through interstate pipelines.in this case,all of the waste in dispute was manufactured before.nyseg or its predecessors owned at least mgp sites,including the sites at issue in this case.
b.the cleanup 
most of the sites at issue were listed by the new york state department of environmental conservation dec in as class sites on the registry of inactive hazardous waste disposal sites in new york in the,nyseg investigated all the mgp sites involved in this case,except newark and corning.in march,dec entered into a consent order with nyseg addressing the investigation and cleanup of coal tar and associated hazardous substances at all the sites in this action,except corning.since then,dec has retained oversight of the cleanup process and approved all cleanup projects at each mgp site at issue in this case.
corporate history 
the history of the corporations involved in this case is long and tortured.we relate only the points relevant to the issues before us 
ageco was incorporated as a public utility holding company in.by it owned the common stock of several utility companies.mergers of certain of its subsidiaries in and eventually led to what became known as the new york state gas and electric corporation.in,the latter entity changed its name to the new york state electric corporation,and a year later it adopted its current name,new york state electric and gas corporation.hence,nyseg was created through the merger of certain ageco subsidiaries.
over the years,ageco acquired other utility companies and mgps,either directly or through other holding companies.in the,nyseg acquired a number of mgps from ageco subsidiaries.by,nyseg had acquired all the mgps at issue in this action from ageco.
d.the bankruptcy 
on january,ageco filed for bankruptcy.pursuant to the reorganization plan,ageco merged into agecorp,which subsequently changed its name to general public utilities corporation,which later became gpu.in,gpu merged into firstenergy.hence,firstenergy is the successor to ageco.
on june,during the bankruptcy proceedings,nyseg board of directors adopted a resolution not to bring any claims against ageco,instead assigning nyseg claims to pa nj utilities company 
t hat in accordance with the request of pa nj utilities company dated may,this company shall take no action with respect to the filing of any claim or claims against the estate of ageco or the estate of agecorp provided,however,that in consideration therefor pa nj utilities company shall release this corporation and its officers and directors from any liability arising from the omission of this corporation to file such claim or claims and also from any liability for having made or approved allegedly excessive payments through various service corporations or funds prior to and provided,further that the trustees of the abovementioned estates shall execute and deliver to this corporation an appropriate covenant not to sue on account of any alleged failure to pay its pro rata share of any alleged federal tax liability for the years to,inclusive.

procedural history 
this litigation began in april,when nyseg sued firstenergy under section a of cercla for cleanup costs at mgps in upstate new york.this number was reduced to seventeen sites before trial.during the trial,nyseg claims with respect to the auburn clark street site were dismissed pursuant to.c,leaving sixteen sites at issue.nyseg,d at.
at trial,nyseg alleged that it spent more than million in cleanup costs on the sixteen sites through the end of,and that it faced another million in future cleanup costs.id.at.
on july,the district court issued a decision and order,nyseg,d,holding principally that 
nyseg was not barred by a covenant not to sue from seeking contribution from firstenergy under cercla.
firstenergy was not liable for cleanup costs as an owner.
firstenergy was not directly liable for cleanup costs as an operator.
nyseg was permitted to pierce the corporate veil to hold firstenergy liable as an operator for the period from to.
nyseg was not permitted to pierce the corporate veil for the period prior to or after.
cost recovery by nyseg at the norwich and owego sites was precluded by the statute of limitations.
cost recovery by nyseg at the plattsburgh site was not precluded by the statute of limitations.
a portion of a million insurance payment to nyseg could be used to offset costs assigned to firstenergy.
the court could rely on firstenergy coal tar production calculations for the pre period and the post period.
firstenergy was entitled to contribution from booth based on booth status as an owner of one of the sites.
an amended final judgment was entered on september,awarding nyseg for past and future cleanup costs for sixteen sites.booth was held liable for plus a share of future costs with respect to the cortland homer site.
these appeals followed.
discussion 
congress enacted cercla,et,to address the cleanup of hazardous waste by imposing strict liability for necessary cleanup costs incurred that are consistent with the national contingency plan.cercla a b,a b.private parties who engage in cleanup activity can recover costs associated with such actions by bringing claims under either section a or section f of cercla against potentially responsible parties prps.cercla created four classes of prps present owners and operators of facilities that accepted hazardous substances for transport past owners and operators of such facilities generators of hazardous substances and certain transporters of hazardous substances.a see also price trucking norampac,cir.
private parties have two options to recover their cleanup costs from other prps.first,under section a,a property owner or operator who has spent money on cleaning up hazardous waste may seek reimbursement for cleanup costs from other prps.see niagra mohawk power chevron,cir.this option,however,is limited to the necessary costs of response consistent with the national contingency plan.a b.
second,under section f,a ny person may seek contribution from any other person who is liable or potentially liable under section a during or following any civil action under section of this title or under section a of this title.f.in other words,a prp who has been sued under section a to contribute to cleanup costs even if it has not yet spent any money on cleanup activities can seek contribution from other prps for cleanup costs,including from the initial plaintiff who sued the prp under section a.here,nyseg has sued firstenergy under section a and firstenergy has filed claims against nyseg and booth under section f.
we construe cercla liberally to advance its dual goals of cleaning up hazardous waste and holding polluters responsible for their actions.new york next millenium realty,llc,cir see also prisco v.a d carting,cir as a remedial statute,cercla should be construed liberally to give effect to its purposes.quoting goodrich betkoski,cir,overruled on other grounds by new york nat l serv,cir internal quotation marks omitted goodrich murtha,cir because it is a remedial statute,cercla must be construed liberally to effectuate its two primary goals enabling the epa to respond efficiently and expeditiously to toxic spills,and holding those parties responsible for the releases liable for the costs of the cleanup.
these appeals present the following issues whether nyseg cercla claims against firstenergy are barred by the covenant not to sue whether ageco is directly liable under cercla as an operator whether firstenergy is liable to nyseg on a piercing the corporate veil theory a based on ageco control over nyseg from to,and b for contamination created by other ageco subsidiaries before the subsidiaries were merged into nyseg,and before ageco owned the subsidiaries that were later merged into nyseg whether nyseg claims as to the plattsburgh,norwich,and owego sites are whether the district court erred in calculating total gas production at the sites whether nyseg recovery from firstenergy could be reduced by a portion of nyseg million insurance settlement whether nyseg recovery should have been reduced either a to reflect the increased value of the remediated properties or b because of nyseg alleged delay in the remedial efforts and whether booth is liable for a portion of cleanup costs.
we review the district court interpretation of the covenant not to sue,its decisions whether to pierce the corporate veil,and its determinations de novo.see krumme westpoint stevens,cir waiver thrift drug,universal prescription adm rs,cir veil piercing castagna luceno,cir statute of limitations.we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo,amalfitano rosenberg,cir,and its evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion,boyce soundview tech,cir.we review the district court allocation of response costs for abuse of discretion.goodrich town of middlebury,cir.
the covenant not to sue 
firstenergy argues the district court erred when it held that nyseg claims were not foreclosed by the covenant not to sue that ageco included in the resolution adopted by nyseg board of directors during the bankruptcy proceedings in.nyseg,d at.
nyseg argues that the covenant does not bar its claims because there is no evidence the covenant was ever executed and delivered and the resolution is limited to claims of nyseg in against the bankruptcy estates of ageco and agecorp in the bankruptcy proceedings.
a covenant not to sue is an agreement by one having a present right of action against another not to sue to enforce such right.colton new york,dep t accord mcmahan bass,dep t covenant not to sue constitutes an agreement to exercise forbearance from asserting any claim which either exists or which may accrue.although a covenant not to sue is distinct from a release,which is the present abandonment of a right or claim,colton,at,a covenant not to sue has been held to operate as a release in so far as the person to whom the covenant,in terms,runs,is concerned.shaw crissey,misc.saratoga cnty.
here,however,the covenant never became operative because a condition precedent to its validity never occurred.under new york law,when there is a condition precedent to the formation or existence of the contract itself no contract arises unless the condition occurs.adams suozzi,cir quoting oppenheimer,oppenheim,appel,dixon,emphasis omitted.the board resolution explicitly stated that nyseg releases its claims provided that ageco trustees shall execute and deliver to nyseg an appropriate covenant not to sue for certain alleged failures.nyseg,d at.yet firstenergy failed to offer proof that satisfied this condition.because firstenergy failed to carry its burden of proof to show that the conditions precedent to the existence of the nyseg covenant occurred,we affirm the district court ruling that the covenant does not bar nyseg claims 
ageco direct liability as a cercla operator 
nyseg argues that firstenergy is directly liable as an operator of the cortland homer,ithaca court street,and norwich mgps between and and the oneonta mgp between and because ageco directly managed and operated these mgps.nyseg br.at.
under cercla,any person who operates a polluting facility is directly liable for the costs of cleaning up the pollution regardless of whether that person is the facility owner or the owner parent corporation.united states bestfoods,internal citations omitted.an operator is defined as someone who directs the workings of,manages,or conducts the affairs of a facility.id.at.to be held liable under cercla,an operator must manage,direct,or conduct operations specifically related to pollution,that is,operations having to do with the leakage or disposal of hazardous waste,or decisions about compliance with environmental regulations.id.at.whether an entity directly operates a facility is a factual issue that we review for clear error.see am.cyanamid capuano,cir.
there are three circumstances under which a parent can be held liable as a direct operator of a subsidiary facilities when the parent operates the facility in the stead of its subsidiary or alongside the subsidiary in some sort of a joint venture when a dual officer or director depart s so far from the norms of parental influence exercised through dual officeholding as to serve the parent,even when ostensibly acting on behalf of the subsidiary and when an agent of the parent with no hat to wear but the parent hat manage s or direct s activities at the facility.bestfoods,at.in considering these questions,a court must focus on the relationship between the parent and the facility in question,not the parent and the subsidiary.see id.at 
here,the district court found that ageco was not an operator during this period because it did not sufficiently participate in the activities of the facilities.id.at.specifically,the district court relied on the fact that 
e ach mgp facility retained its own superintendent on site who was responsible for the activities,and there is no evidence that the superintendent reported to and was controlled by ageco and the service companies,as distinct from the corporate management and board of directors of nyseg and those of other subsidiary utility companies.
nyseg,d at.
the district court noted that while nyseg and ageco entered into service agreements under which ageco was retained to provide such services as general operator and financial manager of nyseg properties,those agreements did not reveal the type of management and control over polluting activities envisioned by bestfoods as necessary to support a finding of direct operator liability.id.at.the fact that ageco took steps to monitor and control its subsidiaries activities,including arranging for these service agreements,was consistent with ageco role as a parent corporation managing the activities of its subsidiary.id.as the bestfoods court observed 
activities that involve the facility but which are consistent with the parent investor status,such as monitoring of the subsidiary performance,supervision of the subsidiary finance and capital budget decisions,and articulation of general policies and procedures,should not give rise to direct liability.
at alterations omitted.
nyseg arguments to the contrary are not persuasive because the activities it cites are consistent with acceptable practices of a parent corporation.for example,nyseg points to a series of reports issued by the federal trade commission between and,which stated that after ageco owners transferred the stock of ithaca gas light,norwich gas company,and homer cortland gas light company the owners of the cortland homer,ithaca court street,and norwich mgps to ageco,ageco brought the companies under common control and management and managed and operated their mgps from to.nyseg br.at.more specifically,nyseg cites brown directory of american gas companies brown directory,which reported that the same ageco personnel held the offices of president,vice president,secretary,and general manager of the three mgp during this period.nyseg also points to the previously mentioned service contracts with barstow company and white company,which were in effect at various points between and as evidence of direct control of the cortland homer,ithaca court street,norwich,and oneonta mgps.
the district court did not err in holding that these general allegations failed to support a finding of direct operator liability as they do not show that ageco operated the facility in the stead of its subsidiary.see bestfoods,at.the holding of dual officerships and directorships,without more,is insufficient to establish operator liability.id.at.to warrant direct liability,a dual officer or director must depart so far from the norms of parental influence exercised through dual officeholding as to serve the parent,even when ostensibly acting on behalf of the subsidiary in operating the facility.id.the district court did not commit clear error in finding no such departure in this case.providence,cir we will set aside a district court findings of fact following a bench trial only if those findings are clearly erroneous.similarly,the supervisory activities engaged in by ageco monitoring performance,supervising finances,fall within the parameters of the relationship.bestfoods,at.thus,we affirm the district court decision not to find direct operator liability.
piercing the corporate veil 
contamination created by nyseg.
firstenergy argues that the district court erred in piercing the corporate veil to hold it liable for cleanup costs for pollution created by nyseg.
it is fundamental that a parent is considered a legally separate entity from its subsidiary,and can not be held liable for the subsidiary actions based solely on its ownership of a controlling interest in the subsidiary.bestfoods,at carte blanche singapore,diners club,cir.under new york law however,a parent can be held liable for the actions of a subsidiary where a plaintiff shows the parent corporation dominates the subsidiary in such a way as to make it a mere instrumentality of the parent the parent company exploits its control to commit fraud or other wrong and the plaintiff suffers an unjust loss or injury as a result of the fraud or wrong.passalacqua builders,resnick developers,cir internal quotations omitted accord bestfoods,at.
as to the first prong,courts consider the following factors to determine the degree of domination by the parent 
the absence of the formalities and paraphernalia that are part and parcel of the corporate existence,issuance of stock,election of directors,keeping of corporate records and the like 
inadequate capitalization 
whether funds are put in and taken out of the corporation for personal rather than corporate purposes 
overlap in ownership,officers,directors,and personnel 
common office space,address and telephone numbers of corporate entities 
the amount of business discretion displayed by the allegedly dominated corporation 
whether the related corporations deal with the dominated corporation at arms length 
whether the corporations are treated as independent profit centers 
the payment or guarantee of debts of the dominated corporation by other corporations in the group and 
whether the corporation in question had property that was used by other of the corporations as if it were its own.
passalacqua,at.the ultimate question is whether the policy behind the presumption of corporate independence and limited shareholder liability encouragement of business development is outweighed by the policy justifying disregarding the corporate form the need to protect those who deal with the corporation.id.
nyseg sought to pierce the corporate veil here in three respects a ageco control over nyseg from to b contamination created by other subsidiaries before they were merged into nyseg and c contamination created by other subsidiaries before ageco owned the subsidiaries that were merged into nyseg.
firstenergy argues that the district court failed to make sufficient findings to warrant piercing the corporate veil we disagree.the district court made numerous findings regarding ageco domination of nyseg when it carefully considered the passalacqua factors in reaching its decision.these include findings specific to nyseg as well as more general findings regarding ageco abuse of all its subsidiaries,including nyseg.while it is true that not every factor is present in this case,that is not a requirement under passalacqua,which recognized the infinite variety of situations that might warrant disregarding the corporate form.passalacqua,at see also freeman complex computing,cir holding n o one passalacqua factor is decisive.
as an initial matter,the district court found that between and ageco was dominated and controlled by howard hopson and john mange.nyseg,d at.hopson and mange had acquired all ageco shares of voting stock by april.id.one way in which hopson controlled the subsidiary companies was by holding the directors undated,signed resignations in hand.id.at.
while the district court found that nyseg was not undercapitalized,it did find that hopson freely transferred funds in and out of ageco and its subsidiaries,and that the subsidiaries were considered mere pockets of ageco.id.for example,the new york public service commission psc examined the books,records,accounting methods and documents of nyseg,as well as other subsidiaries,from to.id.at.it issued a report the brewster report finding that ageco and its affiliates siphon ed off funds from the operating companies and deposited them into the pockets of those individuals and corporations engaged in milking the operating companies through the device of servicing and management contracts.id.at internal quotation marks ommitted.it also found that hopson and howard hopson company defrayed personal expenses with funds from the operating companies within the ageco system.id.at.
furthermore,the district court found abuses by the utility management corporation umc,which charged operating companies in the ageco system,including nyseg,a management fee of percent of their gross revenues even though no management employees from umc were located on any property owned by the operating companies.id.the court also found substantial overlap in officers,directors,and personnel of ageco and the subsidiaries.for example,during virtually all the years from to,mange served as president of ageco and a director of nyseg,and hopson was on the nyseg board from to.id.at.
between and,board meetings for nyseg and various other ageco operating companies were usually held in new york city at or near ageco office at broadway,which was also the primary location of hopson accounting and financial organization that rendered financial,legal,accounting,and auditing services to ageco and its subsidiaries.id.at.
the district court found that the terms of the service contracts between the service companies run by ageco and the operating utility companies,including nyseg,left the utility companies with no vestige of independent authority or control because u nder the provisions of these contracts,the service corporations manage,dominate,and practically operate the utilities.id.at quoting psc report.
the district court found that ageco and the subsidiaries did not deal at arms length,as no one represented nyseg or any of the other subsidiaries in the service contract negotiations.id.at.in addition,ageco loaned money to nyseg and guaranteed debts by others to nyseg.id.at.considering the totality of these findings,we conclude the district court correctly found that veil piercing was warranted.see passalacqua,at 
the question remains as to when ageco domination of nyseg ended.firstenergy argues that any domination ended on january,the day the bankruptcy was filed.the district court held that ageco domination did not end until december.nyseg,d at.
the district court conclusion that domination continued throughout is not supported by the record as the party seeking to pierce the corporate veil,nyseg has the heavy burden of demonstrating domination,tns holdings mki secs,yet it adduced a paucity of affirmative evidence that ageco continued to control nyseg after filing for bankruptcy.indeed,in its findings of fact the district court found that nyseg failed to prove a basis for for the period following ageco bankruptcy filing.nyseg,d at emphasis added.it was only later,in its conclusions of law,that the district court concluded that liability would extend throughout because there was testimony from nyseg expert that control and dominance of ageco over its subsidiaries extended well into.id.at.we conclude that these seemingly contradictory statements betray the lack of affirmative evidence needed for nyseg to have carried its burden of proving dominance and control sufficient to warrant piercing the corporate veil past ageco bankruptcy filing.
contamination created by other ageco subsidiaries.
the parties have raised two additional issues regarding veil piercing whether the district court erred in piercing the corporate veil to hold firstenergy liable for contamination created by other ageco subsidiaries before those subsidiaries were merged into nyseg by ageco and whether the district court erred in refusing to pierce the corporate veil to hold firstenergy liable for contamination that was created by companies before they were owned by either nyseg or ageco.
between and,ageco merged five subsidiaries into nyseg eastern new york electric and gas company owner of the granville,mechanicville and plattsburgh mgps elmira light,heat power corporation owner of the elmira mgp new york central electric corporation owner of the corning,dansville,newark,and penn yan mgps empire gas electric company owner of the geneva mgp and owego gas corporation owner of the owego mgp nyseg,d at.nyseg also acquired the federal new york company,owner of the goshen mgp during this period.id.hence,these five subsidiaries owned ten mpgs.
according to nyseg,firstenergy absorbed all of the subsidiaries preexisting liabilities when nyseg veil was pierced,even those liabilities that were incurred before either nyseg or firstenergy owned the subsidiaries.nyseg argues that because ageco merged the five subsidiaries into nyseg,these subsidiaries fall into one of the exceptions to the general rule regarding liabilities acquired through asset purchases.we disagree.
when a corporation purchases the assets of another corporation,it does not acquire its liabilities,unless one of four exceptions applies.see new york serv,cir.the four exceptions are the buyer expressly or impliedly assumed the predecessor tort liability,there was a consolidation or merger of seller and purchaser,the purchasing corporation was a mere continuation of the selling corporation,or the transaction wa s entered into fraudulently to escape such obligations.id.internal quotation marks omitted.here,because there is no question that ageco merged these five subsidiaries into nyseg,nyseg acquired their liabilities,including liabilities for past contamination.see maline city of utica,dep t as a result of merger with,defendant became the owner of property and assumed all of its liabilities,obligations and penalties.that does not answer the question,however,as to what extent those liabilities flowed to nyseg parent,ageco,under a theory.
pre merger liability 
firstenergy argues that the district court erred in piercing the corporate veil to hold it liable for contamination created at the ten mgps owned by ageco subsidiaries before the subsidiaries were merged into nyseg.firstenergy notes that six of the mgps ceased producing gas before ageco merged these subsidiaries with nyseg 
as a general matter,under a theory,a parent can only be liable for a wrong committed by the subsidiary under the influence of the parent.passalacqua,at.the use of control to commit a wrong is a key component to veil piercing.id.control of the subsidiaries by the parent is the key the control must be used to commit a fraud or other wrong that causes plaintiff loss bedford affiliates sills,cir court must find that parental control was used to cause a wrong,overruled on other grounds by grace.zotos,cir.domination and control by themselves are not sufficient to support a finding of veil piercing.id.mere domination or control of the corporation is insufficient to permit a court to disregard the existence of the corporate entity.
the district court held that the veil of the subsidiaries could be pierced to hold firstenergy liable for contamination created while the subsidiaries were dominated by ageco but before they were merged into nyseg.nyseg,d at.e quity requires piercing of the nyseg corporate veil as well as the other operating companies within the ageco empire and ultimately folded into nyseg during the times between and when ageco acquired domination and control over the various subsidiary operating utility companies owning those facilities.the district court based this holding primarily on the testimony of nyseg expert,jonathan macey,who stated that ageco treated these other operating companies in the same manner as nyseg.id.at.
the district court,however,did not make any specific findings or discuss the passalacqua factors with respect to ageco alleged control over the subsidiaries before nyseg acquired them.the district court did not make any findings concerning,for example,capitalization,overlap,and observance of corporate formalities,with respect to these subsidiaries during this time period.hence,the district court findings are insufficient to support a conclusion of veil piercing in this respect.see william wrigley.waters,cir vacating finding of veil piercing where evidence showed individual defendant was personally involved with corporation work but not that he controlled corporation and was using it for fraudulent ends.accordingly,we conclude that the district court erred by piercing the corporate veil of the five subsidiaries to hold firstenergy liable for contamination that occurred while under ageco control,but before the subsidiaries were merged into nyseg 
pre ownership liability 
nyseg then goes one step further with its argument.because all five of these subsidiaries were merged into nyseg during the period when ageco improperly dominated nyseg between and,nyseg argues that ageco is responsible for all of the subsidiaries liabilities,even those that ageco ownership.nyseg reasons that all of the subsidiaries liabilities became nyseg liabilities as a result of the merger,even those incurred before the subsidiaries were purchased by ageco.thus,once nyseg veil was pierced,all of its liabilities including those inherited from the merged subsidiaries became ageco liabilities.
courts will pierce the corporate veil to prevent fraud or achieve equity by imposing a corporate obligation upon a parent.matter of morris new york state of taxation and.but to successfully pierce the veil,a plaintiff must show both domination of the corporation and that such domination was used to commit a fraud or wrong against the plaintiff which resulted in plaintiff injury.id.
here,the fraud or wrong committed by ageco would be the merger of the subsidiaries into nyseg,not the creation of coal tar.there is nothing in the record to suggest ageco was directing the creation of coal tar at the subsidiaries prior to purchasing them.while ageco may have sought to merge its subsidiaries into nyseg to further its financial improprieties,nyseg does not allege ageco did so to avoid cercla liability.environmental liability for spilling coal tar was not a major concern at the time these subsidiaries were merged.ageco domination was not used to commit a fraud or wrong against nyseg regarding pollution,and domination by itself is not enough to justify veil piercing it must be accompanied by a showing of wrongful or unjust action toward the plaintiff.id.at plaintiff must show that owners abused the privilege of doing business in the corporate form to perpetrate a wrong or injustice against that party such that a court in equity will intervene see also freeman complex computing,cir passalacqua,at control by parent must be used to commit a fraud or other wrong that causes plaintiff loss.thus,the district court correctly declined to pierce the corporate veil to hold ageco responsible for contamination on sites that occurred prior to when either nyseg or ageco owned the sites.nyseg,d at.
statute of limitations regarding the plattsburgh,norwich,and owego mgp sites 
the district court held that that the statute of limitations barred nyseg from recovering cleanup costs from firstenergy for the norwich and owego sites,but not the plattsburgh site.nyseg,d at.firstenergy argues that actions for cleanup expenses at the plattsburgh,norwich,and owego sites are all barred by cercla statute of limitations on remedial actions.see g b.because we conclude that the cleanup at the norwich and owego sites were remedial actions and the cleanup at the plattsburgh site was a removal action,we affirm the district court decisions.
removal and remedial actions are governed by different statutes of limitations.for removal actions,a party must seek to recoup cleanup costs within three years after completion of the removal action.id.at g a.for remedial actions,a party must seek to recoup costs within six years after initiation of physical construction of the remedial action.id.at g b because a statute of limitations is an affirmative defense,firstenergy bears the burden of proof to show it bars the claims.see overall estate of klotz,cir yankee gas servs.ugi utils,d.
whether a suit to recover response costs under section of cercla is a removal action or a remedial action is a question of law that we review de novo.next millenium,at united states grace,cir whether the cleanup activity was a removal action or,on the other hand,a remedial action in removal action clothing is a question of statutory interpretation.
removal actions are generally measures taken in response to immediate threats to public health and safety.see see also next millenium,at grace,at courts have stressed the immediacy of a threat in deciding whether a cleanup is a removal action.collecting cases minnesota kalman abrams metals,cir removal actions are those taken to counter imminent and substantial threats to public health and welfare.removal actions are also generally designed to address contamination at its endpoint and not to permanently remediate the problem.see next millenium,at grace,at finding cleanup activity to be removal action where it did not fully eliminate the public health threat or amount to a remediation.

plattsburgh 
the district court held that nyseg claim to recover costs for the cleanup at the plattsburgh mgp pursuant to a dec consent order was timely.nyseg,d at.firstenergy argues that nyseg claim was untimely because the cleanup nyseg conducted in was a remedial action,triggering the statute of limitations.although nyseg is not seeking to recover cleanup costs associated with the consent order,id.at,firstenergy contends that the cleanup triggered the statute of limitations 
the plattsburgh mgp,which sits adjacent to the south bank of the saranac river,functioned as a coal gasification plant from to.coal tar had been kept on site in unlined ponds since.as coal tar is heavier than water,it migrated from these ponds through the subsurface soils into the saranac river,creating both soil and groundwater contamination.
in,nyseg began investigating the coal tar seeping into the saranac river.id.at.in mid,dec became aware that coal tar was seeping into the river.in,nyseg entered into a consent order with dec to undertake work to prevent coal tar from reaching the saranac river from a tar lagoon located across the street from the mgp.id.this work was also to include cleaning up coal tar that had already migrated from the lagoon into the saranac river,roughly thirty feet away.id.at.as part of this effort,nyseg built a slurry wall around the lagoon to isolate the coal tar,as well as a second slurry wall to catch any coal tar that made it past the first wall.it also excavated contamination from the river,filled in excavated areas with clean fill,capped containment areas,and constructed a treatment system for the water collected from behind the slurry wall.id.this work did not involve the area where the former mpg plant was located.id.at.this project took one year and cost less than million.
unfortunately,by the,coal tar was found in the river again.between october and november,nyseg conducted further study of the plattsburgh site.id.at.between april and august,nyseg excavated and removed waste from three gas holder foundations,process pipe,and other mgp associated structures.dec approved this work in.id.
in,dec issued a record of decision rod requiring additional remedial efforts.id.this work included excavation of the former mgp tar lagoon and surrounding areas where coal tar had migrated to the subsurface,as well as excavation of the contaminated sediment from the parts of the saranac river immediately adjacent to the mgp site.id.the excavated soils were disposed of.id.nyseg performed the work between and.id.this included paying the city of plattsburgh approximately to move a substation and associated electrical lines owned by the city municipal power company from the northeast portion of the site.id.nyseg also relocated a inch sewer crossing,constructed a stabilized soil barrier wall,and removed tons of soil down to till or bedrock inside the wall.id.
in,nyseg prepared another report which proposed dewater ing the saranac river channel to permit further excavation of sediment.id.nyseg has implemented the first phase of this project and was scheduled to begin the second phase in.id.at.between and,nyseg incurred in response costs.id.at.
firstenergy argues that because the cleanup pursuant to the consent order was a remedial action that triggered the statute of limitations,all later cost recovery efforts at the site are,including the work done pursuant to the consent order.the district court disagreed,and held instead that the statute of limitations was not triggered because at the time the cleanup was conducted,coal tar was not a hazardous substance 
the work performed at plattsburgh under the consent order can not properly be regarded as consistent with the epa remedial plan under cercla based upon more modern notions regarding the hazards presented by the presence of coal tar and soils contaminated with coal tar,and thus the actions taken at plattsburgh did not commence the running of the statute of limitations.
the district court also noted that the cleanup was far more akin to a removal action than a remedial action because it only addressed work performed at a discrete portion of the site,which was significantly removed from the location of the former mgp facility the source of contamination,and was designed to contain the contamination migrating from the lagoon to the saranac river.id.accordingly,the district court concluded that the removal action did not trigger the statute of limitations for the later remedial effort for which nyseg now seeks contribution.
assuming the cleanup was a triggering event,we agree with the district court that the cleanup was more akin to a removal than a remedial action.this cleanup was a discrete project designed both to prevent coal tar from reaching the river and to remove it from the river.see nyseg,d at.it was not designed to clean up contamination at the source,namely by removing the coal tar from the area around the mgp.id.at.instead,as the district court pointed out,t he evidence at trial reflected that neither dec nor nyseg envisioned the project as encompassing a of the entire mgp site.id.at emphasis added.as we noted in next millenium,measures taken to minimize and mitigate contamination,but not to permanently eliminate it,are properly classified as removal actions.at see also grace,at cleanup activity was a removal action where it did not fully eliminate the public health threat or amount to a remediation.
here,the cleanup was an immediate response to a health concern about coal tar in the saranac river.dec first became aware of the problem in the mid and by had a consent order in place with nyseg.moreover,the cleanup was not a permanent solution designed to remove the ultimate source of contamination at the mgp.rather,it involved building slurry walls to contain coal tar from further migrating into the river.these actions were not designed to remedy the underlying source of the contamination,namely,the hazardous waste at the mpg.next millennium,at accord schaefer,at.
the work in and pursuant to the rod,in contrast,was designed to remediate the pollution at its source.it included excavating the former mpg tar lagoon and surrounding area,moving an entire substation and corresponding electrical wires,the relocation of a sewer line,and the removal of over tons of soil.the remedial action was clearly designed to permanently remediate the coal tar on the site.
in addition,the cleanup has already taken several years and cost over million,with costs expected to rise to million.this is in keeping with a remedial,rather than removal,action.see c generally removal measures shall not continue after has been obligated for response actions or months has elapsed from the date of initial response accord b.in sum,the district court correctly held that,because the cleanup was a removal action,it did not trigger the statute of limitations for the later remedial actions 
the district court held that nyseg cost recovery claims for its cleanup at norwich were barred by the statute of limitations on remedial actions.nyseg argues that the cleanup was a removal action,subject to a different statute of limitations.
the norwich mgp produced gas from to.in,nyseg began a interim remedial measure irm in conjunction with dec to clean up this site.in phase i,which ran from to the last quarter of,nyseg excavated the former distribution holder area and stockpiled the soil.in phase ii,which ran from may to september,nyseg transported and thermally treated tons of the stockpiled soil.
in phase iii,which ran from april to august,nyseg removed two or more feet of soil from the surface of the entire site,as well as the former relief holder,the former tar well,and process piping.this project was conducted to protect potential customers at an adjacent supermarket to be constructed shortly thereafter.in total,more than tons of soil were removed.phase iii cost less than million and was completed in four months.this is the cleanup for which nyseg is seeking to recover costs.
firstenergy argues that the three phases of the irm constituted one remedial project that commenced in,and thus nyseg cost recovery action is barred by the statute of limitations.nyseg argues its claims are timely because all three phases of the irm were removal actions,including the irm.according to nyseg,the irm was a discrete project undertaken to address an immediate health hazard to future customers at a nearby supermarket.nyseg also argues that because dec approved the work as an irm,it is a removal action.
the district court correctly found that the irm cleanup was one remedial cleanup.first,nyseg stipulated that the norwich irm was a single action comprised of three phases.second,the cleanup was not designed to address an imminent health concern.see next millenium,at holding that removal actions are cleanup measures taken in response to immediate threats to public health and safety.as the court noted,immediate action was not required to address high levels of toxic chemicals.nyseg,d at.similarly,in its preliminary assessment,epa deemed cleanup at the site a medium priority,rather than a high priority.id.hence,this was not an immediate threat to public health and safety.
third,while irms can resemble removal actions,they can also resemble remedial actions.under new york law,irms are defined as 
a ctivities to address both emergency and site conditions,which can be undertaken without extensive investigation and evaluation,to prevent,mitigate or remedy environmental damage or the consequences of environmental damage attributable to a site.
regs.tit,ab.this definition encompasses elements of both removal emergency and remedial actions,as well as elements common to both preventing or mitigating environmental damage.see defining removal to include actions to prevent,minimize,or mitigate damage to the public health or welfare or to the environment id.defining remedial to include actions to prevent or minimize the release of hazardous substances so that they do not endanger public health or the environment.
dec present internal guidance and the guidance in effect during the norwich irm make clear that irms are not always removal actions.see,new york state department of environmental conservation,der guidance for site investigation and remediation,at may,available at http.describing a n emergency irm as well as a or critical irm which may be undertaken at any time during the course of the remedial program pl.exh,new york state department of environmental conservation,interim remedial measures procedures tagm,at,providing guidance for an irm consist ing of a removal as identified in the ncp at d and an irm represent ing a significant portion of the remedy,which must be part of the proposed remedial action plan prap rod process at the completion of the remedial study clearly,irms can either be removal or remedial actions.accordingly,because the cleanup was part of a larger remedial action that began in,nyseg claims are.
the district court found that the statute of limitations barred nyseg from recovering costs for the cleanup of a portion of the owego site because that cleanup was part of a remedial cleanup begun in.nyseg,d at.nyseg argues that the cleanup was separate from the cleanup,triggering a separate statute of limitations.
between september and july,nyseg remediated the portion of the site known as operational unit ou by removing and thermally destroying tons of coal soil.id.nyseg performed this work pursuant to the rod issued by dec in.
in,nyseg discovered more coal tar contamination in the susquehanna river on what became operational unit ou.in,nyseg identified a pipe leading to the riverbed as the source of contamination.in,dec ordered nyseg to remove the pipe as well as the contaminated river sediments.in,nyseg completed remediating the river and pipe by removing tons of sediment and feet of pipeline.
nyseg now seeks to recover for the cost of groundwater monitoring and pipe and sediment removal performed at ou in,arguing that it was a separate remedial action.firstenergy argues that this cleanup is a continuation of the remedial work begun in on ou,and thus.
the district court found that the work at ou was part of the earlier remedial action at ou.we agree.first,the work at ou was remedial it was designed to permanently eliminate the coal tar contamination from the susquehanna river by removing the pipe leading to the river and the contaminated sediment.
second,the district court correctly held that there can only be one remedial action at any given site.id.virtually every court that has considered this issue has agreed.see generally colorado sunoco,cir in our view,this language of the statute indicates there will be but one removal action per site or facility,as well as a single remedial action per site or facility.kelley dupont de nemours,cir holding that all removal activity should be considered part of one removal action because i t is simply inconsistent with the essential purposes of cercla to require suit on each arguably independent removal activity internal citations omitted yankee gas servs,d at c ourts have generally held that there can be only one removal and one remedial action per facility,regardless of the number of phases in which the occurs.california ex rel cal.dep t of toxic substances control hyampom lumber.there is no authority for the view that each remedial activity undertaken at a site triggers a new cause of action for the cost recovery of that activity.but see united states manzo,d finding different statutes of limitation for different operable units united states ambroid,d,finding more than one removal action in the unusual circumstance where eighteen months after epa closed site leaving behind drums of hazardous waste which had no method of disposal,site was broken into and drums damaged,requiring second removal action.
we agree with the majority view and hold that there can only be one remedial action at a site.the very nature of a remedial action is to permanently remediate hazardous waste.next millenium,at.a remedial action is supposed to be a final,cleanup of a site,and once a prp completes an approved remediation plan,it would not be logical or fair to subject that entity to additional cercla lawsuits seeking yet additional permanent relief,although we recognize that what seems final at a given point in time might come to appear inadequate at a later date as scientific knowledge progresses 
this limitation on remedial actions does not,however,foreclose cost recovery actions for supplemental cleanup costs incurred after the limitations period has run on the initial cleanup,if they are filed within three years of the completion of the remedial work.section g distinguishes between an initial action and a subsequent action or actions to recover additional response costs as part of the same remedial action.u.g.section g provides that subsequent actions for further response costs may be maintained at any time during the response action,but must be commenced no later than years after the date of completion of all response action.id.as long as the party seeking to recover costs filed an initial action for cost recovery within the time period specified in g a and b,the party can recover the costs of later cleanups if the action to recover such costs is filed no later than three years after the date of completion of the new cleanup.see id.here,the later cleanup could not qualify as a further response cost because the period had expired.id.
therefore,the district court correctly held that nyseg claims for cost recovery for the remedial work at ou is.
gas production 
the district court used total gas production at each site to allocate liability because both parties agree that coal tar was generally created in proportion to the amount of gas produced.nyseg,d at.the parties disagree,however,as to how to determine the amount of gas produced by a particular plant at a particular time.while the parties agree on the amount of coal tar produced between and,they do not agree about the amount of coal tar produced before or after 
specifically,nyseg argues that the district court was incorrect in adopting firstenergy estimates for the pre and post period.regarding the pre period,firstenergy expert took the production numbers reported in the first year of the brown directory in for a particular plant and assumed that the plant had produced of that amount of gas each year,from its first year of operation until.
for the period from to,first energy expert used brown directory records which contained not reports for to.he then made production estimates for each plant based on those records and extrapolated to estimate production for years when exact gas volume data was not available.
nyseg argues that for the period before,the district court should have found no gas production at all even though there was gas production because the numbers are not reliable.for the to period,nyseg expert relied on yearly production figures found in data collected by the psc for most of the operating plants.if a psc record was not available for that year,nyseg expert treated that year as if there were no gas production.
in light of the severely limited information available,the district court did not err in using firstenergy estimates.it was reasonable for the court to use its best estimates for periods in which there was indisputably some gas production,rather than to treat those years as if there were no production at all.
nyseg million insurance settlement 
nyseg received million in an insurance settlement,which covered sites,including the sixteen sites in this suit.id.at.the settlement also extinguished property damage claims against the settling insurer.id.
although there was no evidence regarding the allocation of the settlement amount among the sites,the district court chose to apply a portion of the settlement to reduce firstenergy cleanup costs.id.at.in doing so,the district court calculated a pro rata share of the insurance settlement by using percent of million,which represented the proportion between the sixteen sites in this case and the involved in the insurance settlement.id.this came to a total of,the pro rata share of the settlement attributable to the sixteen sites.that amount is percent of the total amount of money sought for cleanup,which percentage the court then applied evenly over the sixteen sites to reduce nyseg recovery.id.
nyseg argues that none of the money should have been applied to reduce firstenergy payments because firstenergy did not carry its burden to prove the affirmative defense that the insurance proceeds should be applied to reduce its liability and there is no risk of double recovery for nyseg 
the district court did not err in reducing nyseg recovery to account for the insurance proceeds.to begin,we note that the district court was correct that the collateral source rule does not apply in cercla cases.the collateral source rule generally provides that damages recoverable for a wrong are not diminished by the fact that the party injured has been wholly or partially indemnified for his loss by insurance effected by him and to the procurement of which the wrongdoer did not contribute.ocean ships,stiles,cir internal quotations marks omitted.t he policy underlying the collateral source rule to provide the innocent party with the benefit of any windfall is simply not advanced in cercla cases.friedland tic the indus,cir see also basic mgmt.united states,d d.refusing to apply collateral source rule to insurance proceeds because cercla contribution actions are not injury actions in which the injured party is seeking compensation for damages to be made whole again.rather,in resolving contribution claims under cercla,a court may allocate response costs among liable parties using such equitable factors as the court determines are appropriate.f see goodrich town of middlebury,cir t he court must allocate response costs among liable parties in an equitable manner.
here,in reducing nyseg recovery in light of the insurance payment,the district court reasonably exercised its equitable powers to allocate response costs between the parties.first,insofar as nyseg contends that firstenergy failed to carry its burden of proving that consideration of the insurance settlement was warranted,the argument fails.firstenergy presented evidence of the million insurance payment.nyseg,the party in position to explain how the proceeds were allocated among the sites,failed to present any such evidence.given the sparseness of the record as to the allocation of the proceeds,therefore,the district court pro rata allocation based on the number of sites should be applied was not arbitrary or haphazard,but reasonable.
second,while it is undoubtably correct that there was no risk of nyseg receiving a double recovery,that fact did not preclude the district court from equitably reducing nyseg recovery to account for the insurance proceeds.see,basic mgmt,d at equity and common sense dictate that p laintiffs can not recover the remediation costs paid for by their insurance policies.instead,cercla expansive language affords a district court broad discretion to balance the equities in the interests of justice.bedford affiliates,at.accordingly,the district court did not err in applying nyseg insurance settlement to reduce firstenergy liability.
should nyseg recovery be reduced either because of economic benefit or alleged delay in cleaning up 
firstenergy argues that the district court should have reduced nyseg recovery to reflect the fact that nyseg would benefit from the increased value of the cleaned up sites.it also argues that nyseg recovery should be reduced because nyseg was slow to remediate and engaged in unnecessarily piecemeal remediation.firstenergy br.at.these arguments are not persuasive.
regarding the economic benefit of the cleanup,the district court recognized the substantial amount of money nyseg was spending on cleanup million to date with another million expected in future costs.considering that nyseg does not expect to collect a comparable amount from other prps,nyseg is hardly gaining a windfall.firstenergy also fails to offer evidence about any increase in the value of the land,much less an increase over the million nyseg will expend to clean up the properties.
firstenergy argument that nyseg caused unreasonable delay in the cleanup fails as well.firstenergy points to two specific examples of alleged delay in,a nyseg employee proposed a program under which all mgp investigation would be completed by,with remediation completed within two years this plan was not adopted and in,nyseg employees proposed a comprehensive approach to site cleanup,but nyseg did not move forward with broad remediation efforts until.firstenergy reply br.at.firstenergy offers no explanation as to why nyseg was unreasonable in failing to adopt the plan,nor has it shown that the plan was even technically or financially feasible.firstenergy also fails to explain how nyseg was unreasonable in adopting the plan instead of the proposal.in short,the record simply does not support firstenergy argument that nyseg caused unreasonable delay in the cleanup by declining to follow a plan suggested in or delaying its cleanup plan until it adopted a joint plan with dec in.
booth bought the cortland homer mgp from mack trucks,in,which bought it from nyseg.nyseg,d at.as a result,it is liable under cercla as a current owner.it now raises two issues on appeal.first,booth argues that the district court erred in finding it liable for cleanup costs at the cortland homer site.second,booth argues alternatively that the amount of liability assigned to it by the district court was too high.
the cortland homer site is divided into two parcels ou,which is comprised of the former mgp area and the structures below its surface,and ou,which consists of the adjacent land.booth office building was located in ou and sat on top of two buried gasholders.
sometime in the mid,after coal tar contamination was discovered on the cortland homer site,nyseg offered to buy the southern portion of the booth building from booth.although the building was appraised at,booth demanded million,which included the cost of business disruption.negotiations began in.on may,nyseg paid million for the southern portion of the building and gave booth the right to buy the property back after remediation for in the event nyseg were to decide to sell it.booth retained ownership of the northern portion of the building.
booth claims to be entitled to a defense under section b,which requires it to establish that 
t he offending release of a hazardous substance and the damages resulting therefrom were caused solely by an act or omission of a third party,provided that the third party is not one whose act or omission occurs in connection with a contractual relationship,existing directly or indirectly,with the defendant,the defendant took precautions against foreseeable acts or omissions of any such third party and the consequences that could foreseeably result from such acts or omissions,and the defendant exercised due care with respect to the hazardous substance concerned,taking into consideration the characteristics of such hazardous substance,in light of all relevant facts and circumstances.
new york lashins arcade,cir quoting b.booth bears the burden of showing by preponderance of the evidence that all four of these conditions are met.nyseg,d at.
here,the district court correctly held that booth failed to meet its burden with respect to the third requirement because it did not exercise due care with respect to the cleanup effort.id.at see lashins arcade,at explaining that due care would include those steps necessary to protect the public from a health or environmental threat internal citations and quotations omitted.
the district court found that booth tactics created extensive delays in negotiations.despite knowing that nyseg could not begin remediation until it acquired portions of the cortland homer site which included the removal of two former gasholders from below booth building booth engaged in protracted negotiations.nyseg,d at.as a result,booth was largely responsible for a delay in the cleanup due to its untimely responses to nyseg proposals and its aggressive price demand.id.as firstenergy expert testified,this delay most likely allowed more coal tar to migrate.id.at.because booth delays prevented nyseg from obtaining control of the booth building located on ou,nyseg was forced to consider implementing the remedy at ou first,even though this was not the optimal order in which to proceed with cleanup.id.
to further exacerbate the problem,booth cooperation in cleanup efforts was somewhat lackluster,as it failed,for example,to provide nyseg with feedback.see lashins arcade,at landowner failed to exercise due care where it remained passive simply because public environmental authorities are addressing a hazardous waste situation.because this finding was not clearly erroneous,we affirm 
booth also complains that the portion of the cleanup costs assigned to it was too high.the district court assigned booth percent of firstenergy costs at the cortland homer site,or percent of nyseg total cortland homer costs.nyseg,d at.accordingly,the district court found that booth was liable for in past costs,and for percent of all future necessary and ncp compliant costs incurred by nyseg.id.booth argues that even if it caused a delay,that delay should be measured from date of the issuance of the rod approving the remediation method march to the date of sale april,or months.using those dates,booth would only owe percent of total costs months out of total years of production to.in the alternative,booth argues that the amount it owes should only be percent,which is one year out of the roughly and fifty years the site has been in existence.
we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in allocating the response costs.the district court reasonably took into account the fact that booth would benefit from the increased property value after remediation and that its negotiating tactics led to significant delays in remediating the property.id.at.accordingly,we affirm.
