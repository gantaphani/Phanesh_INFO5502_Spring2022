kottwitz and the marchellettas requested a reliance on accountant jury instruction at at,exh.a at at.based on its interpretation of united states johnson,cir,the district court denied the instruction,finding that the good faith reliance instruction required that the defense show,one,that the defendants fully disclosed all relevant facts to the expert and,two,that the defendants relied in good faith on the expert advice.at.it commented that there wa s no evidence that the defendant s supplied all relevant information to their accountant or accountants and relied in good faith on accountant opinion and that the instruction was not appropriate as it was not adjusted to the facts.id.at.junior counsel responded that,as to the returns initially drafted by schwartz and ultimately prepared by brown,he did not want to be foreclosed from arguing that they had presented testimony through brown and through hishon that the defendants believed that what they did in filing the returns fixed the problem,if you will.and that is reliance on the advice of an expert.at.the government objected that it did not think the c ourt should put its imprimatur on randy brown advice and that the defendants were asking that the court essentially ignore their contemporaneous intent to look to what they did after the fact.id.at.when the district court asked whether it was not sufficient for the government just to make that argument to rebut junior attorney point,the government responded that was what it would do,to which junior attorney replied,t hat all i need.id.at.
during closing arguments,the government claimed that kottwitz was central to the tax scheme,and characterized kottwitz statement,to wit,that she understood circle payments for the marchellettas residences as income to the marchellettas,as a lie under oath.at see also at.it suggested that kottwitz was liable for the conspiracy and the tax fraud because she failed to disclose to schwartz that circle was paying for the marchellettas residences.at.the government also maintained that,because the marchellettas did not direct allocation of their home construction costs to any specific account,the payables clerks had no idea how the marchellettas would treat the income shown on their home job ledgers or whether or not they would actually declare it as income.id.at.it suggested that the defense argument that schwartz was supposed to know about the inclusion of the marchellettas personal expenses in circle expense logs was nonsense since he only reviewed the accounts on one day.id.at.senior attorney closing argument emphasized that there was no evidence that he had any knowledge of how entries were booked on circle accounting records,that certain entries should have alerted schwartz to potential problems and the need to file amended returns,and that senior had no criminal intent to violate the tax laws.id.at.
the district court instructed the jury to base its verdict only on the evidence and the court instructions on the law,and not on the lawyers statements.id.at see also at.the court provided the jury with a general instruction on the elements of a good faith defense to the charge of intent to defraud and on willfullness at at.after closing arguments,the jury was excused for lunch,instructed to begin deliberations when they returned to the jury room,and advised that they would be provided with the admitted exhibits and a copy of the indictment and verdict form.id.at.with the jury out of the courtroom,junior attorney notified the district court that he had prepared a written objection to court denial of the requested jury instructions the district court instructed him to j ust file it.id.at.in the written objection,junior observed that the district court had refused to give the defendants proposed jury instruction number,concerning good faith reliance upon accountant failure of accountant to exercise due care and argued that the district court should have granted the good faith reliance instruction.at.

kottwitz and the marchellettas jointly moved for an acquittal on all of the counts of conviction,arguing that there was no evidence to support a finding of intent to violate the tax laws,and that the government improper references during the trial to their wealth violated due process rights.at.they argued,inter alia,that many,if not all,of the government specific items of alleged omitted income were not required to be reported as income for the year in question.at.the district court denied the motion,finding that there was substantial evidence from which a reasonable jury could have found criminal intent to violate the tax law and that the government properly introduced evidence of the defendants wealth because the evidence of their failure to report a high volume of income was relevant to their willfulness.
at sentencing,senior objected to the probation officer determination as to the amount of the tax loss.at.the district court overruled senior objections and found that the loss amount was between and.id.at.kottwitz was sentenced to months of imprisonment on each of the two counts of conviction,to run concurrently,and three years of supervised release on each count,to run concurrently.at.she was also fined and assessed.see also.junior was sentenced to months of imprisonment on each of the three counts of conviction,to run concurrently,months of supervised release on count one and twelve months of supervised released on each of counts three and six,to run concurrently.at.he was also fined and was assessed.see also.senior was sentenced to months of imprisonment on each of the four counts of conviction,to run concurrently and months of supervised release on each count of conviction,to run concurrently.at.he was also fined and was assessed.id.at.kottwitz and the marchellettas were each released on bond pending appeal.

kottwitz,junior,and senior contend that the trial evidence was insufficient to show the existence of a tax conspiracy,that they knowingly participated in any conspiracy that may have existed,or that they aided and abetted in the filing of a false tax return for circle in.senior maintains that,because he was owed at the end of from the assignment of the loan made by nastasi to circle and the stock swap,any personal expenditures made by circle for him should have been credited against the notes payable,thus reducing circle debt to him.as such,the expenditures were properly accounted for and did not result in any taxable income to him.senior also argues that the evidence was insufficient to show that he knowingly evaded taxes or filed a false tax return for.kottwitz maintains that the evidence showed she consistently tried to do the right thing and never saw any of the tax returns at issue or had any expectation that the filed returns would be materially false.she contends that there is no trial evidence showing that she knew of any conspiracy that would result in the filing of false tax returns or that she agreed to join any such conspiracy.junior and senior also argue that the district court erred by denying their motion for judgment of acquittal because,under boulware united states,distributions made to a shareholder of a corporation can not be classified for tax purposes until the final date of the corporation fiscal year.

despite the lack of direct evidence that kottwitz and the marchellettas conspired to impede the irs,the circumstantial evidence was sufficient for the jury to have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that they had entered into the charged conspiracy count one.kottwitz oversaw the accounting books and knew where the various home and personal expenses of the marchellettas were booked on the circle accounts.she communicated with schwartz concerning theses expenses in conjunction with both the circle and marchelletta tax returns.kottwitz,junior,and senior had a employment relationship and were not distant.
filing of a false income tax return 
junior and senior contend that the home construction costs were the only basis for the jury verdict related to junior tax return.the jury rejected the prosecution accusation that junior had understated his income on his tax return by failing to include the loan from c g enterprises or the clothing and entertainment expenditures which were omitted from both the and returns count two.they assert the boulware objective characterization rule requires consideration of the timing or tax year of the recognition of the distribution and the classification of the transaction as compensation,loans,dividends,returns of capital,or gains from the exchange or sale of property.they reason that junior home construction cost distributions could not be assigned to him as income in because it was impossible for circle to classify the distributions paid after april until its fiscal year closed in march and that the deposit made in january was de minimis and,therefore,not a material matter.they suggest that boulware holding as to extends to since both contain similar language regarding the truthfulness of the tax return every material matter in and any material matter in.they maintain that the only expense paid by circle on junior home before april was the general contractor deposit paid in january.
the government responds that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the convictions because it showed that the marchellettas skimmed over from their company to fund personal expenses,failed to disclose this information to their accountant,and signed false tax returns omitting this income.they also maintain that kottwitz facilitated the marchellettas actions by writing checks and supervising circle books which showed the expenditures as business expenses.

for a conviction under,the government must prove that the defendants filed a tax return with a written declaration made under the penalty of perjury did not believe the return to be true and correct as to every material matter and acted willfully and not merely negligently.united states edwards,cir.a conviction under requires that the government show that the defendants acted willfully deficiently paid their taxes and affirmatively acted to evade or attempted to evade their taxes.sansone united states.therefore,the specific intent of willfullness is a requirement in both offenses.united states lankford,cir sansone,at.at.the willfulness standard requires the voluntary,intentional violation of a known legal duty and can be negated by a misunderstanding of the law,a belief that one is not violating the law,regardless of whether or not the belief is reasonable,or a reliance on a professional advice.united states morris,cir citing cheek,at.at.
in boulware,the supreme court noted that tax classifications mandated consideration of the objective economic realities of a transaction rather than the particular form of classification that the parties employed.boulware,at.at.the court held that intent is irrelevant to the timing of objective tax classifications and irs reporting requirements for distributions to shareholders of closely held corporations objective application of the internal revenue code sections and apply.id.at.specifically,it stated that a criminal tax defendant does not need to show a contemporaneous intent to treat diversions as returns of capital before relying on sections and to demonstrate that no taxes are owed.id.at.the supreme court applied boulware to cases noting that a lthough does not require the prosecution to prove the existence of a tax deficiency,the nature and character of the funds received can be critical in determining whether has been violated.id.at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the court noted that classifications of transactions between corporations and shareholders may be difficult because a corporation and its shareholders have a common earn a profit for the corporation to pass onto its shareholders,that a corporation wholly owned by one shareholder becomes the alter ego of the shareholder in his profit making capacity,and that,by passing corporate funds to himself as shareholder,the is acting in pursuit of these common objectives.id.at.citing truesdell comm r,irs non docketed service advice review,wl internal quotations omitted.e conomic substance remains the right touchstone for characterizing funds received when a shareholder diverts them before they can be recorded on the corporation books as the diverted funds may be treated as dividends or capital distributions based on the benefit received by the shareholder.id.at.if it is unclear,however,whether the corporation will have sufficient funds to cover distributions to its shareholders at the end of its tax year,it must report the distributions as dividends even if the distribution will later be treated as a capital gain or a return on capital.id.at.

although the personal expense entries in circle books could not have been characterized as dividends or balanced in relation to junior and senior shareholder interests until the end of circle accounting year,the jury possessed sufficient evidence to convict on counts three,four and five.circle payment of for suits and for visits for junior,which were erroneously labeled on circle books and not reported by junior as personal income,provided sufficient substantive evidence of the understatement of income.circle payments of new york landscaping fees for senior,which were not reported by senior as personal income,provided sufficient substantive evidence of the understatement of income.further,if the jury determined that circle payment of the landscaping fees constituted personal income to senior,the objective element of a tax deficiency was met to satisfy the charge that senior evaded taxes.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,the jury could find sufficient circumstantial evidence to support a finding of intent and willfulness on these counts.
aiding and abetting the filing of a materially false income tax return

in this case,no evidence suggests that kottwitz or the marchellettas knew that circle would file a false tax return.kottwitz and the marchellettas never saw the tax return before it was filed or took any action in preparation of it with an expectation that it would be filed with materially false statements.their convictions on count six are reversed.
failure to give the requested good faith reliance jury instruction 
kottwitz and the marchellettas argue that the district court erred by failing to give their proposed jury instruction regarding good faith reliance on schwartz accounting advice and his failure to exercise due care in his audit of circle.they maintain that the district court misapprehended the law regarding what the jury needed to decide in order for a defendant to succeed as opposed to when they should be instructed for their ultimate determinations as to guilt or innocence.they contend that there was overwhelming evidence that schwartz failed to exercise due care of diligence in discharging his duties.
the government responds that kottwitz and the marchellettas were not entitled to a good faith reliance instruction because schwartz never advised them how to record and report the personal expenditures on their tax returns,they never told schwartz about the payments,and they gave him false books that disguised the payments.it maintains that the charge would have confused the jury and was unnecessary because the court provided an instruction regarding the high standard of criminal intent and that good faith is a complete defense.finally,it asserts that we should review this issue for only plain error because junior never articulated any specific evidentiary grounds in support of the charge and did not object to its omission until after the jury had retired.

the requested good faith reliance jury instruction was based on our pattern jury instructions and was,therefore,a correct statement of the law 
we must first determine whether kottwitz and the marchellettas preserved the issue of the good faith reliance instruction through their objection in the district court.the good faith defense theory was presented throughout the trial.the theory was set out in the opening statements,during schwartz,and in closing arguments that kottwitz,junior,and senior,none of whom were trained or experienced in taxes,relied on schwartz for his advice in classifying entries made in circle books and in preparing correct tax returns.they specifically requested the instruction and objected both orally and in writing to the district court refusal to grant the instruction before jury deliberations commenced.we,therefore,review the district court refusal to give the instruction for abuse of discretion.
whether it was necessary to provide the good faith reliance instruction depends on whether a juror could find any evidence to conclude that kottwitz and the marchellettas provided all material facts to their accountant,and a juror could find any evidence that kottwitz and the marchellettas relied in good faith on that accountant advice and decisions.the evidence demonstrated that the marchellettas hired schwartz to prepare circle audited financial statements and tax returns,and that kottwitz worked closely with him during his yearly audits.in a letter dated august,junior confirmed to schwartz that he had to the best of my knowledge and belief made available to you all f inancial records and related data and m inutes of the meetings of stockholders,directors govt.ex.schwartz explained that he conducted the audits but relied on kottwitz for mostly everything because neither junior nor senior wanted to be involved or provided him with clear answers regarding the technicalities of the books and records.at.he stated that senior would walk through but did not participate and did not seem to care about the numbers.id.at.kottwitz did not limit schwartz audit in any manner,provided him with requested documentation,and relied on his accounting advice to insure the propriety of circle accounting.schwartz testified that kottwitz made her best efforts to assure that circle accounting was correct and to make appropriate changes.logan and diggs both testified that schwartz was given access to circle books and records and to any other requested documents,and that he directed the correction of misclassified entries.schwartz admitted that neither the time that he spent on the audit nor his access to the documents was limited,and made no changes to the time that he allocated after he found it difficult to perform the audit in two days.schwartz not only reclassified the monies circle received from nastasi as a loan,but he failed to inform senior of the reclassification or its effect on his previously filed tax return and took no steps to correct that tax return.schwartz admitted reviewing the jm reports,which included the crabapple and newport bay costs of,respectively,about million and,and reflected no income.
based on this evidence,the marchellettas were entitled to have the jury instructed on their good faith reliance on schwartz advice and on schwartz failure to exercise due care.the requested instruction properly placed the determination with the jury as to whether they acted in good faith in seeking advice,fully and completely reporting to their accountant,and acting strictly in accordance with the advice.the district court refusal to deliver the requested instruction,which addressed the defense theory of the case on counts three,four,and five was not substantially covered by other instructions seriously impaired kottwitz and the marchellettas defense.the district court refusal to deliver the requested instruction did not,however,impair kottwitz and the marchellettas defense as to the conspiracy charge count one.the defense theory of the case as to the conspiracy charge was fully encompassed by the good faith instruction given by the district court because the conspiracy was consummated before any reliance upon the advice of an accountant.
before we resolve this issue,however,we must look again to our review of the sufficiency of the evidence as the counts in question because o nly if the evidence is sufficient for a properly instructed jury to have convicted the defendants of the charged offenses do we have to determine whether the district court erroneous jury instruction constituted error requiring reversal and remand for a new trial.united states mount,cir citation omitted.if the record does not contain sufficient evidence under which a properly instructed jury could have convicted the defendants of the charged offenses,then double jeopardy principles mandate that we vacate the conviction and remand to the district court with directions to enter a judgment of acquittal on the count in question.id.quotation marks and citation omitted.

birch,circuit judge,concurring in part and dissenting in part 
i fully concur with the majority analysis of and ruling on the district court failure to properly charge the jury.with regard to the majority conclusion that the record reflects adequate evidence to sustain the prosecution burden on the conspiracy charges,i respectfully dissent.
mindful of the prosecution burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,a review of the record manifests that there was no direct or circumstantial evidence presented that kottwitz and the marchellettas conspired to impede the irs.there was no evidence that showed that kottwitz knew how the marchellettas would treat any of the circle expenses which benefitted them personally on their tax returns,had any in put in the preparation of their tax returns,or ever saw their tax returns.there was no evidence presented showing that kottwitz ever even saw the consulting agreement or the payment guarantee between senior and nastasi associates,had any direct knowledge of the terms of those documents,or had any information as to their tax treatment.as senior maintains,the the irs acceptance of circle taxes on the first three months payments of the consulting a conclusion that the payments were income to circle and not to senior.the written consulting agreement provided that nastasi was retaining the services of senior and circle,and nastasi it people consulted with circle it people.senior was a salaried employee of circle and paid income taxes based on a that he received from circle.the nastasi monies were reclassified by schwartz so as not to be recognizable as taxable income to circle and schwartz failed to inform senior of the adjustment or to advise him that his tax returns needed to be amended to reflect the adjustment.there was no evidence that kottwitz directed the readjustment of senior payments as taxable income to senior,attempted to cover up the original classification of the payments,or senior knew of the readjustment of these payments.there was no evidence presented that either junior or senior directed any account entries into circle accounts.the construction costs for crabapple and newport bay were set up as separate accounts in circle books,and all expenses were tracked within those accounts.there was no evidence that kottwitz made any decisions regarding the newport bay property or how it was,or was not,treated on circle books or by senior.there was no evidence that kottwitz ever saw circle tax returns or had any input other than providing documentation for schwartz.there was no evidence that kottwitz had any involvement in the preparation,execution or submission of junior or senior tax returns or knew how circle payments for the home construction and other expenses were treated in junior and senior personal tax returns.
there was no evidence that suggests that kottwitz or the marchellettas knew that circle would file a false tax return.kottwitz and the marchellettas never saw the tax return before it was filed or took any action in preparation of it with an expectation that it would be filed with materially false statements.
moreover,the personal expense entries in circle books could not have been characterized as dividends or balanced in relation to junior and senior shareholder interests until the end of circle accounting year.the determination of these expenses from april until march as taxable income could also not occur until the end of circle fiscal year,after march,and the adjusted entries were made in september.at that time,the marchellettas recognized their constructive income and paid their respective taxes.those determinations could not be made for the tax year.the conspiracy convictions should be reversed.
because the government did not show that kottwitz or the marchellettas knew of a tax conspiracy or that kottwitz or the marchellettas voluntarily and knowingly agreed to impede the irs collection of taxes,it failed on its burden of proof with respect to the convictions on count one.
