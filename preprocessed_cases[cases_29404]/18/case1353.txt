ceradyne designs and manufactures advanced technical ceramic products for industrial,automotive,defense,and commercial uses.quest,a limited partnership,was an original equipment manufacturer of ceramic components.as of may,the zalkinds owned a percent interest in quest.
in may,the zalkinds and quest entered into the asset purchase agreement with ceradyne,by which the zalkinds agreed to sell quest assets to ceradyne for million,of which was paid in cash and the balance paid with unregistered shares of ceradyne the stock consideration.
section of the asset purchase agreement required ceradyne to use its best efforts to register the stock consideration with the sec.registration would permit the stock consideration to be publicly traded.ceradyne was required to file a form s registration statement within days of the closing date of the asset purchase agreement.section b ii of the asset purchase agreement provides if the registration statement covering the stock consideration is not declared effective by the sec on or before november,then within ten days of such date,ceradyne shall make a cash payment to the selling parties in the amount of,against delivery by the selling parties to ceradyne of stock certificates constituting the stock consideration.
section of the asset purchase agreement is entitled indemnification.section provides that ceradyne shall indemnify,hold harmless and defend the selling parties and their respective successors and assigns from and against any and all damages that arise from or are in connection with a any breach of or inaccuracy in any of the representations or warranties of any of ceradyne contained in section of this agreement or in any of the certificates delivered hereunder by or on behalf of ceradyne pursuant to such representations or warranties or b any breach or default by ceradyne of its covenants or agreements contained in this agreement.section similarly provides that quest and stanley zalkind agree to indemnify,hold harmless and defend ceradyne from and against any and all damages.

pursuant to the asset purchase agreement,the zalkinds received shares of ceradyne common stock based on the average closing price of per share for the days preceding the closing date of may.these shares grew to after ceradyne had a stock split 
on august,ceradyne filed the form s registration statement with the sec for the stock consideration.on september,stanley zalkind and ceradyne chief financial officer agreed to extend the asset purchase agreement deadline for registering the stock consideration in section b ii for one month from the original date of november.between november and march,ceradyne filed three separate amendments to the form s in response to correspondence from the sec.the zalkinds did not invoke section b ii of the asset purchase agreement and demand million in cash from ceradyne for failure to timely register the stock consideration.on march,the sec declared the registration of the stock consideration to be effective.
by april,the zalkinds had sold shares of the stock consideration.their proceeds from the public sales were based on an average selling price of per share.

procedural history 
in june,the zalkinds and quest filed a complaint against ceradyne,alleging breach of the registration requirements of section of the asset purchase agreement.the zalkinds and quest filed a first amended complaint,the operative pleading,in october.
the first amended complaint alleged that ceradyne breached section of the asset purchase agreement by failing to file the form s registration statement within days of may,and by failing to use best efforts to cause the stock consideration to be registered by the sec.the first amended complaint also alleged the delay in registering the stock consideration meant the zalkinds could not take advantage of a temporary and significant rise in the price of ceradyne shares between december,and january.the zalkinds were damaged,according to the first amended complaint,because if they had been able to sell their ceradyne shares during that time period,they would have realized more than they ultimately did.
after conducting discovery,ceradyne filed a against the zalkinds and quest in may.the asserted a single cause of action for violation of corporations code section and alleged the zalkinds made a series of false and misleading statements and omissions of material fact about quest revenue projections and customer and market opportunities to induce ceradyne to enter into the asset purchase agreement and purchase quest assets.the sought damages and rescission of the asset purchase agreement.
ceradyne moved for summary judgment on the first amended complaint on the ground,among others,the zalkinds and quest lawsuit constituted a claim for indemnification under section of the asset purchase agreement but was not filed within months of the closing date of may.the zalkinds and quest moved for summary judgment on the on the ground,among others,that ceradyne suffered no damages under corporations code section.
the trial court took the motions under submission after hearing argument of counsel and issued a minute order on november,granting both motions.on december,the court signed an order submitted by the zalkinds and quest,stating plaintiffs summary judgment motion is granted with respect to the on the grounds cross complainant has not suffered any damages and rescission is unavailable because the parties can not be returned to the status quo ante.summary judgment i s not warranted on any other bases proffered by plaintiffs.cross complainant summary judgment motion is granted with respect to the complaint on the grounds the limitations provision in section of the asset purchase agreement executed by the parties bars plaintiffs claims.summary judgment i s not warranted on any other bases proffered by.
judgment was entered on december.after entry of judgment,ceradyne moved to correct a clerical error in the order granting summary judgment,or,alternatively,for reconsideration.in the motion,ceradyne asserted the statement summary judgment i s not warranted on any other bases proffered by was inconsistent with the trial court tentative ruling,argument and findings at oral argument,and the court minute order.ceradyne also asserted the order granting summary judgment did not comply with code of civil procedure section,subdivision g.the trial court denied the motion,stating any error in including that statement without stating the grounds for it would be judicial not clerical error.the court intended to include the statement in the order.
standard of review 
a trial court properly grants summary judgment where no triable issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.citation.we review the trial court decision de novo,considering all of the evidence the parties offered in connection with the motion except that which the court properly excluded and the uncontradicted inferences the evidence reasonably supports.citation.merrill navegar,cal th.
discussion the zalkinds and quest appeal 
the trial court concluded the zalkinds and quest complaint was because it was not filed within the month limitations period prescribed by section of the asset purchase agreement.it was undisputed the zalkinds and quest filed their lawsuit for breach of contract against ceradyne more than months after the closing date.if the lawsuit for breach of contract filed by the zalkinds and quest is a claim for indemnification under section of the asset purchase agreement,then their complaint is.
after examining the language of section of the asset purchase agreement and relevant law on the meaning of indemnification,we agree with ceradyne the term claim for indemnification as used in the asset purchase agreement includes the zalkinds and quest breach of contract action.
the zalkinds and quest complaint was because it was not filed within the month limitations period in section of the asset purchase issue does the term indemnify in section of the asset purchase agreement include direct actions between the parties 
section of the asset purchase agreement states,in relevant part,n o claim for indemnification under this section may be made more than months after the closing date if a lawsuit for breach of contract is a claim for indemnification under section of the asset purchase agreement,then the zalkinds and quest complaint is.
what does claim for indemnification under section of the asset purchase agreement mean 
the zalkinds and quest argue indemnification under section of the asset purchase agreement covers only claims involving liability or potential liability to third parties or obligations imposed on a party by operation of law and therefore does not apply to their direct claims against ceradyne for its alleged breach of the asset purchase agreement.ceradyne argues the month limitations period of section applies to the zalkinds and quest complaint because section was drafted broadly to encompass both direct,garden variety breach of contract claims between the parties and claims arising from third parties.
the parties agree the asset purchase agreement was a fully integrated contract and there is no extrinsic evidence relating to section founding members of the newport beach country club newport beach country club,supra,th at.we therefore look to the language of the asset purchase agreement itself.id.at.the basic goal of contract interpretation is to give effect to the parties mutual intent at the time of contracting.citations.when a contract is reduced to writing,the parties intention is determined from the writing alone,if possible.citation.the words of a contract are to be understood in their ordinary and popular sense.id.at.when,as in this case,no extrinsic evidence is introduced,the appellate court independently construes the contract.id.at.
section of the asset purchase agreement provides in relevant part subject to the limitations in section hereof,the buyer shall indemnify,hold harmless and defend the selling parties and their respective successors and assigns from and against any and all damages that arise from or are in connection with b any breach or default by the buyer of its covenants or agreements contained in this agreement.
section of the asset purchase agreement states damages,as used in this section,shall mean i demands,claims,actions,suits,investigations and legal or other proceedings brought against any indemnified party or parties,and any judgments or assessments,fines or penalties rendered therein or any settlements thereof,and ii all liabilities,damages,losses,taxes,assessments,costs and expenses including,without limitation,reasonable attorneys and accountants fees and expenses incurred by any indemnified party or parties,to the extent not reimbursed or paid for by insurance,whether or not they have arisen from or were incurred in or as a result of any demand,claim,action,suit,assessment or other proceeding or any settlement or judgment.boldface added.
if the word damages in section of the asset purchase agreement is replaced by the boldface language from section,and the words buyer and selling parties are replaced with the parties names,the result is the following ceradyne shall indemnify,hold harmless and defend the zalkinds and quest from and against any and all damages,losses incurred by the zalkinds and quest that arise from or are in connection with b any breach or default by ceradyne of its covenants or agreements contained in this agreement.
the zalkinds and quest alleged they incurred damages and loss arising from ceradyne breach of its covenants or agreements contained in the asset purchase agreement.the issue comes down to the meaning of ceradyne shall indemnify such loss.does indemnify have the narrow meaning,asserted by the zalkinds and quest,of reimbursement for losses to third party claims,or does it have the broader meaning,asserted by ceradyne,of paying for or reimbursing any claimed loss 
although the terms indemnify and indemnity ordinarily refer to third party claims,they may include direct claims,depending on the parties intent.
the terms indemnify and indemnity have been defined in several ways.indemnity may be defined as the obligation resting on one party to make good a loss or damage another party has incurred.rossmoor sanitation,pylon,cal d,rossmoor.civil code section defines indemnity as a contract by which one engages to save another from a legal consequence of the conduct of one of the parties,or of some other person.the indemnitor is the party obligated to pay another,and the indemnitee is the party entitled to receive the payment from the indemnitor.maryland casualty bailey sons,th.
indemnity generally refers to third party claims.a clause which contains the words indemnify and hold harmless is an indemnity clause which generally obligates the indemnitor to reimburse the indemnitee for any damages the indemnitee becomes obligated to pay third persons.citation.indemnification agreements ordinarily relate to third party claims.myers building industries,interface technology,th,myers see also queen villas homeowners tcb property management th,quoting myers wilshire doheny associates,shapiro th,wilshire doheny a n indemnitor in an indemnity contract generally undertakes to protect the indemnitee against loss or damage through liability to a third person.contracts of indemnity are distinguishable from those of guaranty and suretyship in that in indemnity contracts the engagement is to make good and save another from loss upon some obligation which he has incurred or is about to incur to a third person,and is not,as in guaranty and suretyship,a promise to one to whom another is answerable.somers united states cal.
although indemnity generally relates to third party claims,this general rule does not apply if the parties to a contract use the term indemnity to include direct liability as well as third party liability.dream theater,dream theater th.e ach indemnity agreement is interpreted according to the language and contents of the contract as well as the intention of the parties as indicated by the contract.wilshire doheny,supra,th at.when indemnity is expressly provided by contract,the extent of the duty to indemnify must be determined from the contract itself.rossmoor,supra,cal d at see also heppler peters th,parties to an indemnity contract have great freedom of action in allocating risk,subject to certain limitations of public policy rooz kimmel th,we must determine the scope of a contractual duty of indemnification from the contract itself myers,supra,th at the extent of the duty to indemnify is determined from the contract.
t he question whether an indemnity agreement covers a given case turns primarily on contractual interpretation,and it is the intent of the parties as expressed in the agreement that should control.when the parties knowingly bargain for the protection at issue,the protection should be afforded.this requires an inquiry into the circumstances of the damage or injury and the language of the contract of necessity,each case will turn on its own facts.rossmoor,supra,cal d at.the indemnity provisions of a contract are to be construed under the same rules for interpreting contracts,with a view to determining the actual intent of the parties.wilshire doheny,supra,th at see also maryland casualty bailey sons,supra,th at.
section of the asset purchase agreement is written broadly to include direct claims and does not expressly exclude them.
the terms indemnify and indemnity do not necessarily refer only to third party claims and are reasonably susceptible to the interpretation urged by ceradyne.as we have noted,the california supreme court has defined indemnity as the obligation resting on one party to make good a loss or damage another party has incurred.rossmoor,supra,cal d at.this definition is not limited to third party claims and is broad enough to include the zalkinds and quest direct breach of contract claim against ceradyne.one court has concluded the definition of indemnity in civil code section plainly states that indemnity may apply to either direct or third party claims.dream theater,dream theater,supra,cal.app th at,fn.
in wilshire doheny,supra,th,the court addressed the issue whether particular indemnity provisions were limited to third party claims.in that case,stanley shapiro and jeffrey matsen were corporate officers of daishin,daishin usa.id.at.pursuant to three different indemnity provisions,daishin usa agreed to indemnify shapiro and matsen with respect to any action or claim brought against them in their capacity as corporate officers.id.at.daishin usa sued shapiro and matsen,alleging various causes of action arising out of their conduct as corporate officers.id.at.shapiro and matsen prevailed at trial,but the trial court denied their motion for attorney fees,which was based on the indemnity provisions.id.at.the court of appeal reversed,rejecting the argument the indemnity provisions were limited to third party claims there is nothing in the language of any of the three indemnity provisions specifically limiting their application to third party lawsuits.daishin usa point s to no extrinsic evidence introduced to demonstrate that the parties intended these provisions to apply to third party lawsuits only.citations.thus,it has not been shown the indemnity provisions are inapplicable merely because shapiro and matsen seek indemnification for attorney fees and costs incurred in an action brought by the indemnitor.id.at.
black law dictionary broadly defines indemnification as.the action of compensating for loss or damage sustained.the compensation so made.black law dict.ed.black law dictionary similarly defines indemnity as.a duty to make good any loss,damage,or liability incurred by another.the right of an injured party to claim reimbursement for its loss,damage,or liability from a person who has such a duty.reimbursement or compensation for loss,damage,or liability in tort,the right of a party who is secondarily liable to recover from the party who is primarily liable for reimbursement of expenditures paid to a third party for injuries resulting from a violation of a duty.id.at.the first definition in black law dictionary for indemnify is t o reimburse another for a loss suffered because of a third party or one own act or default.id.at,italics added.
several ninth circuit court of appeals cases have adopted a similar definition of indemnify from the sixth edition of black law dictionary.yang ming marine okamoto freighters cir,atari ernst whinney cir.these cases hold an indemnity provision may encompass direct breach of contract claims.in atari,supra,at page,the ninth circuit concluded the district court erred by limiting an indemnification provision to third party claims,stating the district court was wrong to assume that the word indemnify necessarily carries with it the baggage of the clauses in which it most frequently appears.the word indemnify,the ninth circuit stated,refers to compensation for loss in general,not just particular types of loss.ibid.
in battelle memorial inst.nowsco pipeline services d,the court defined indemnity to include the shifting of losses,rather than any requirement that third party losses be involved.the court stated it is clear from both the ohio and sixth circuit definitions of indemnification that a party wishing to narrow an indemnification clause to damage is obligated to limit the scope of the clause expressly and absent such express limitation,indemnification clauses may apply to damage suffered by the contracting parties themselves.id.at.in this case,section of the asset purchase agreement does not expressly limit the meaning of indemnify to third party claims,and,as we have mentioned,there is no extrinsic evidence relating to section.
section and the definition of damages in section of the asset purchase agreement are broadly worded to provide that ceradyne shall indemnify,hold harmless and defend the zalkinds and quest from and against any and all damages and losses incurred by the zalkinds and quest that arise from or are in connection with a ny breach or default by ceradyne of its covenants or agreements contained in this agreement.this language does not limit indemnification to third party claims and extends indemnification to any and all damages incurred by the zalkinds and quest arising out of ceradyne breach of the asset purchase agreement.read in the context of section,the word indemnify makes better sense when read to mean make good,reimburse,or compensate.
other parts of section of the asset purchase agreement support the conclusion indemnify includes direct claims between the parties.
another indication of the meaning of indemnify in section of the asset purchase agreement comes from the use of the terms indemnity,indemnify,and damages in other parts of section.the whole of a contract is to be taken together,so as to give effect to every part,if reasonably practicable,each clause helping to interpret the other.to the extent practicable,the meaning of a contract must be derived from reading the whole of the contract,with individual provisions interpreted together,in order to give effect to all provisions and to avoid rendering some meaningless.sy first family.partnership cheung th,city of atascadero merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,th.
section of the asset purchase agreement defines the term damages by dividing them into two categories.the first category is demands,claims,actions,suits,investigations and legal or other proceedings brought against any indemnified party or parties,and any judgments or assessments,fines or penalties rendered therein or any settlements thereof.this category correlates to indemnification of third party claims.the second category is all liabilities,damages,losses,taxes,assessments,costs and expenses including,without limitation,reasonable attorneys and accountants fees and expenses incurred by any indemnified party or parties,to the extent not reimbursed or paid for by insurance,whether or not they have arisen from or were incurred in or as a result of any demand,claim,action,suit,assessment or other proceeding or any settlement or judgment.this category would include damages sought in a direct lawsuit between the parties.the clause whether or not they have arisen from or were incurred in or as a result of any demand,claim,action,suit,assessment or other proceeding or any settlement or judgment in particular suggests the second category is not limited to third party claims for which a party to the asset purchase agreement seeks indemnity.
section of the asset purchase agreement is entitled notice of claims.the first sentence of section requires prompt notification to the indemnifying party of a claim for indemnity.the second and third sentences distinguish third party claims.the second sentence reads in the event of any claim for indemnification hereunder resulting from or in connection with any claim or legal proceeding by a third party,the notice to the indemnifying party shall specify,if known,the amount or any estimate of the amount of the liability arising therefrom.the third sentence provides that neither the indemnified party nor any indemnifying party may settle a claim by a third party without the other party prior written consent.there would be no need to distinguish third party claims in section if indemnify only referred to third party claims.
section of the asset purchase agreement is entitled third party claims and concerns the indemnifying party defense obligations.section states,i n connection with any claim giving rise to indemnity hereunder that results or may result from or arises or may arise out of any claim or legal proceeding by a person who is not a party to this agreement this section would not be necessary if indemnification by definition meant only third party claims.
section of the asset purchase agreement,entitled subrogation,states,i n the event that an indemnifying party pays all or any portion of a third party claim or demand concerning which the indemnified party submits a claim for indemnification,the indemnifying party shall be subrogated.this passage expressly recognizes subrogation rights to third party claims and would be unnecessary if,by definition,indemnification only applied to third party claims.
section of the asset purchase agreement,entitled remedies,states the indemnification rights and remedies set forth in this section shall be the sole and exclusive rights and remedies of the parties hereto with respect to any damages incurred by any such parties for which indemnification is provided to such parties under this section provided,however,that if the selling parties fail to perform their covenant to sell the purchased assets to the buyer,buyer shall be entitled to obtain specific performance of such covenant,and injunctive relief against any breach or threatened breach thereof.the part after the second provided would be unnecessary if indemnification only referred to third party claims.
many provisions in section of the asset purchase agreement therefore support the conclusion the parties intended the term indemnify in section to have the broader meaning and to encompass direct claims for breach of contract.if the term indemnify were limited to third party claims,portions of sections,and would be superfluous.
the zalkinds and quest argue the reference to third party claims in those sections of the asset purchase agreement was meant to distinguish third party claims from claims arising by operation of law,liabilities that arise without a demand or claim,such as environmental cleanup.this interpretation might be convincing if the term indemnify necessarily refers only to third party claims,as the zalkinds and quest argue.however,the term indemnify in section is subject to the broader definition that encompasses direct claims,and section,read as a whole,makes better sense with that interpretation,rather than the narrow interpretation limiting indemnify to third party claims.
the zalkinds and quest argue ceradyne interpretation of section of the asset purchase agreement would require ceradyne to defend them in this lawsuit.that result would obtain if section were read in isolation section does require the indemnifying party to indemnify,hold harmless,and defend.italics added.but section must be read with section,which sets forth the rights and duties of defense and applies only to third party claims,and the balance of the asset purchase agreement.
agreements to shorten the statute of limitations are enforceable if reasonable,and civil code section is inapplicable based on the terms of section of the asset purchase agreement.
the zalkinds and quest argue we must strictly construe the language of section of the asset purchase agreement against ceradyne because agreements to shorten the statute of limitations are disfavored.in lewis hopper d,lewis,the court stated c ontractual stipulations which limit the right to sue to a period shorter than that granted by statute,are not looked upon with favor because they are in derogation of the statutory limitation.hence,they should be construed with strictness against the party invoking them.see also sanders american casualty d,this general rule is correct.in western filter agran,cir,the court cited that rule and the lewis case with approval however,no published california opinion has done so in the over years since sanders american casualty in.
as ceradyne argues,agreements to shorten the statute of limitations do not violate public policy and are enforced if reasonable.courts generally enforce parties agreements for a shorter limitations period than otherwise provided by statute,provided it is reasonable.moreno sanchez th,fn.omitted see also charnay cobert th,hambrecht quist venture partners american medical,th.long before lewis,the california supreme court held,i t is a proposition of law that the parties to a contract may stipulate therein for a period of limitation,shorter than that fixed by the statute of limitations,and that such stipulation violates no principle of public policy,provided the period fixed be not so unreasonable as to show imposition or undue advantage in some way.citations.beeson schloss cal,see also tebbets fidelity and casualty cal,statute of limitations is a personal right that can be waived or shortened.
the zalkinds and quest do not contend the shorter limitations period of section of the asset purchase agreement is unreasonable as an agreement to shorten the statute of limitations does not violate public policy under california supreme court authority,we do not agree that section must be construed with strictness against ceradyne and decline to follow lewis.even if we would construe that contract provision with strictness,we would still enforce it under the supreme court authority cited in the prior paragraph.
the zalkinds and quest also argue that interpreting section to encompass direct breach of contract claims is contrary to civil code section,which sets forth rules for interpreting contracts of indemnity true,each situation identified in section addresses indemnification of third party claims.but,as ceradyne points out,section expressly states its rules of interpretation apply,unless a contrary intention appears,italics added.here,we conclude,a contrary intention appears from reading together the various parts of section of the asset purchase agreement.further,as ceradyne points out,the asset purchase agreement does not refer to civil code section,but does refer to other statutes when they are controlling.
conclusion 
claims for indemnification under section of the asset purchase agreement include direct claims between the parties.as a consequence,the month limitations period of section of the asset purchase agreement applies to such direct claims.the zalkinds and quest did not file their complaint against ceradyne within months of the closing date therefore,the complaint is and the trial court did not err by granting ceradyne motion for summary judgment.because we are affirming on the ground the complaint was,we do not address ceradyne contention the trial court erred by rejecting ceradyne other grounds for summary judgment without specifying reasons.
discussion ceradyne appeal 
ceradyne alleged the zalkinds violated corporations code section by making false statements and omissions in connection with the purchase and sale of the stock consideration under the asset purchase agreement.ceradyne sought damages and rescission of the asset purchase agreement pursuant to corporations code section.the trial court granted the zalkinds and quest motion for summary judgment on the ground ceradyne suffered no damages under section from the alleged violations of section.
ceradyne argues the trial court misinterpreted corporations code section in concluding ceradyne suffered no damages,and ceradyne may rescind the asset purchase agreement despite the fact none of the parties to it can restore the consideration.
we conclude,based on the evidence presented in the moving and opposition papers and pertinent legal authorities 
the term the complaint as used in the formula for calculating a seller damages under corporations code section means the pleading by which the seller of the security asserts the violation of corporations code section.
ceradyne the seller of the security asserted a violation of corporations code section in the therefore,in this case,the term the complaint under corporations code section refers to ceradyne,not the complaint filed by the zalkinds and quest.
because the complaint refers to ceradyne under corporations code section formula for calculating a seller damages,ceradyne suffered negative damages or no damages based on the undisputed facts.
under the express provisions of corporations code section,ceradyne is not entitled to rescission because the undisputed facts are that the zalkinds and quest no longer own the security the stock consideration and ceradyne can not tender the consideration paid for the security.
ceradyne suffered no damages under corporations code section.issue in calculating a seller damages under corporations code section,does the term the complaint include a seller alleging securities fraud 
corporations code section makes it unlawful to offer or sell a security by means of a written or oral communication that includes an untrue statement of material fact or omits a material fact.corporations code section provides that a seller of a security who violates section is liable to the purchaser of the security,who may sue for either rescission or damages.
corporations code section permits recovery of damages by a seller of a security,as follows damages recoverable under this section by a seller shall be an amount equal to the difference between the value of the security at the time of the filing of the complaint plus the amount of any income received by the defendant on the security and the price at which the security was sold plus interest at the legal rate from the date of sale.
in this case,ceradyne is the seller of the security the stock consideration and the zalkinds are the buyers of the security.ceradyne,the seller,asserted its securities fraud claim against the zalkinds and quest by.the issue is,does the term the complaint in corporations code section include a seller,or is the term limited to the complaint,whether filed by the buyer or the seller 
whether the term the complaint includes a seller directly affects the amount,if any,of ceradyne damages.a seller damages under corporations code section are the difference between the value of the security at the time of the filing of the complaint plus the amount of any income received by the defendant on the security and the price at which the security was sold plus interest at the legal rate from the date of sale.
the zalkinds and quest filed the complaint on june.the value of the security on that date is calculated as follows per share x shares.all numbers are rounded up or down to the nearest dollar.
ceradyne filed its on may.the value of the security on that date is calculated as follows per share x shares.
the zalkinds received in net income from selling shares of ceradyne stock between march to april,it is undisputed the zalkinds paid for the shares of the stock consideration that they sold and received.
based on the asset purchase agreement,the price of the ceradyne stock sold to the zalkinds was million interest on that amount at the legal rate of percent per for the period from may,the date of sale to june,the date the complaint was filed by the zalkinds and quest is interest on million at the legal rate of percent per annum for the period from may,the date of sale to may,the date the was filed is 
the damages formula in corporations code section produces this result if the complaint in this case means the complaint filed by the zalkinds and quest 
value of the stock when the complaint was filed income earned on the stock 
sale price of the stock consideration interest to date the complaint was filed 
in damages.
the damages formula in corporations code section produces this result if the complaint in this case means ceradyne 
value of stock when the was filed income earned on the stock 
sale price of the stock consideration interest to date the was filed 
negative thus,no damages.
the trial court concluded the valuation date for the stock pursuant to corporations code section was the date the seller ceradyne was filed and,apparently accepting the later calculations,found ceradyne suffered no damages.

but the language and purpose of corporations code section establish the term the complaint must mean a when that is the means by which a seller alleges securities fraud.
those principles are inconclusive,however,in interpreting corporations code section.in setting forth the amount of the seller damages,section does not say a complaint or complaint but the complaint italics added.to whose complaint does this refer we must interpret the complaint in terms of the context of the statute as a whole,and in that context,the complaint must refer to the seller complaint for violations of corporations code section in other words,in calculating damages,the stock is valued as of the time the seller files a pleading alleging the securities fraud claim.we know that because in calculating the amount of the seller damages,section considers the amount of any income received by the defendant on the security italics added.thus,the defendant in section must be the defendant buyer,who would have received income on the security purchased.because the buyer is the defendant,the term the complaint must refer to the complaint filed by the seller.the term the complaint can not refer,as in this case,to the buyer complaint because then the phrase the amount of any income received by the defendant on the security italics added would make no sense.
a leading treatise on california securities laws,in explaining a seller damages under corporations code section,also treats the seller as the plaintiff initiating the action and the buyer as the defendant in the case of a purchase in violation of these provisions,a plaintiff seller is given a cause of action for damages when the defendant no longer owns the security for an amount equal to the difference between the value of the security at the time of the filing of the complaint plus the amount of any income received by the defendant on the security and the price at which the security was sold by the plaintiff plus interest at the legal rate from the date of sale.in such a case,the plaintiff would have been entitled to recover the security itself and therefore its value at the time of the lawsuit except for the action of the defendant in disposing of it before the plaintiff brings the action.this action by the defendant,over which the plaintiff had no control,should not result in the plaintiff being entitled to recover less.therefore,this section provides that the plaintiff may recover the value of the security at the time of the filing of the complaint.marsh volk,practice under the cal.securities laws b,rel.
corporations code section,in setting forth a seller damages,thus contemplates only the situation in which the seller as the plaintiff files a complaint against the buyer as the defendant for securities fraud,and does not expressly address the situation in which the seller files a in response to the buyer complaint.what happens when,as here,the seller files a asserting violations of corporations code section 
interpreting the term the complaint in corporations code section to include a seller for securities fraud is consistent with the purpose for valuing the stock at the time the complaint is filed.that purpose is explained as follows i t was believed that the proper time at which to value the security for the purpose of computing damages when rescission was unavailable was the time the action was commenced.by that action,the plaintiff has indicated his or her election to repudiate the transaction,and future market changes in the price of a security no longer owned by the defendant should not affect the amount of his or her recovery.if it did,then delays in litigation,perhaps beyond the control of either party,would determine to some extent the substantive rights of the parties.marsh volk,practice under the cal.securities laws,supra,b.
ceradyne,the seller in this case,indicated its election to repudiate the transaction when it filed the against the zalkinds and quest for securities fraud.valuing the stock for the purpose of calculating ceradyne damages at the time the zalkinds and quest filed the complaint would be inconsistent with the purpose of corporations code section because that act did not demonstrate ceradyne election to repudiate the transaction.
ceradyne argues that interpreting the term the complaint in corporations code section to include a seller would encourage sellers to maximize damages by rushing to file a as soon as possible.section intends that result by valuing stock for purposes of calculating the seller damages at the time the seller files the complaint.section permits a seller to control the amount of its damages by filing the complaint when the stock price is high.the perverse incentive s feared by ceradyne are inherent in section.
ceradyne posits hypothetical situations in which valuing the stock when the seller is filed would deny the seller damages,while valuing the stock when the buyer complaint is filed would permit recovery.of course,hypothetical situations producing opposite results are also possible.under the undisputed facts of this case,application of corporations code section produces no damages,and that result is consistent with the statutory purpose.the corporate securities law of demonstrates a legislative intent to afford victims of securities fraud a remedy without the task of proving common law fraud.because it has eased the requirements for victims to recover successfully,the legislature has also imposed certain restrictions on them,such as shortening the statute of limitations for bringing a statutory action and limiting the damages available.boam,supra,th at.
the doctrine does not apply to corporations code section.
the does not relate back to the date the buyer complaint was filed for purposes of calculating a seller damages under corporations code section.the code section itself says nothing to suggest it incorporates the doctrine.the doctrine has been applied in only two contexts to determine the time of commencement of an action for the purpose of the statute of limitations barrington robins cal d,and to a statute requiring dismissal of an action for failure to serve a summons within three years of its commencement id.at.in the latter situation,the california supreme court has concluded the doctrine applies because the nature and purpose of the statute of limitations and the statute were virtually identical in that both statutes were designed to move suits expeditiously toward trial.id.at.
the doctrine does not extend to corporations code section because its nature and purpose are not the same as or similar to those of a statute of limitations.ceradyne therefore does not relate back to the date the complaint was filed for purposes of determining damages.
ceradyne failed to raise a triable issue as to whether the price of the ceradyne stock was less than the price stated in the asset purchase agreement.
ceradyne argues the price of the stock consideration was less than million because the value of quest assets had been inflated by the zalkinds fraud.as a result,ceradyne argues,there is a triable issue of material fact as to whether it suffered damages under corporations code section.
undisputed fact in the separate statement in support of the zalkinds and quest motion for summary judgment was the assets of quest sold to ceradyne were valued by quest and ceradyne at,as reflected in exhibit a to the asset purchase agreement ceradyne agreed to pay for these assets by giving stanley zalkind,elizabeth zalkind and quest cash a
