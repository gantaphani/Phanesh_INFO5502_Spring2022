in this appeal,we review the district court dismissal with prejudice of a securities fraud complaint filed by robert plotkin and members of his family collectively plotkin against ipaxess,ipaxess and two of its officers,michael mcdonnell mcdonnell and james scogin scogin.plotkin complaint alleges that the defendants committed securities fraud under federal and illinois laws by making false or misleading statements in press releases,and that plotkin purchased common stock in ipaxess based on these statements.the district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.for the reasons stated below,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand.
background 
from the late to,data race,ipaxess,was a fledgling technology company with executive offices in plano,texas.the company principal business was the design,manufacture and marketing of communication products enabling remote access to all elements of corporate communications networks,including the internet and intranet.ipaxess lead product for purposes of this suit was the vocalware ip remote access system.throughout the relevant period,defendant mcdonnell served as the chief operating officer,president,chief executive officer and director of the company,while scogin was its controller,senior vice,chief financial officer,secretary and treasurer.scogin also apparently served as the company investor relations officer.
according to plotkin second amended complaint the complaint,ipaxess struggled financially before the events in question revenues decreased from approximately million in its fiscal year to approximately in and only for.the complaint goes on to allege that,during much of,the defendants carried out a campaign to attract new investors in the company common stock and to persuade existing investors to increase their holdings.the campaign allegedly proceeded with the issuance of several false and misleading press releases that induced plotkin to purchase considerable amounts of ipaxess stock.he bought stock for himself and family members following two press releases issued on may,and one on august,this case centers around the three press releases.
may releases 
in the may press releases,ipaxess announced a letter of intent and a purchase order involving ipaxess,associated global partners agpi,and lynxus,lynxus.the first press release stated,in relevant part 
ipaxess,formerly data race,nasdaq race today announced a letter of intent to enter into a strategic partnership with associated global.
under terms of the agreement agpi and lynxus will be granted exclusive international marketing rights for ipaxess products for all business associated with the ip education solution opportunities in any country in which they are actively engaged in business partnerships.the agreement calls for an annual commitment of million of net purchases from ipaxess.
going forward,this strategic relationship with represents an important component of ipaxess worldwide distribution strategy,and will enable us to expand our market opportunity by delivering the vocalware ip technology to a broader range of customers,stated ipaxess president and ceo,michael mcdonnell.decision to market vocalware ip as a solution confirms that ipaxess is on the way to becoming a recognized leader in remote communications technology.
in the second may press release,ipaxess announced that it had received a multimillion dollar purchase order from 
ipaxess,formerly data race,nasdaq race today announced receipt of a million purchase order for the vocalware ip remote work technology from,an application service provider which supplies internet access solutions to businesses,schools,churches and homes.
the releases also described the operations of ipaxess new customers and announced the companies contributions to the planned joint undertakings 
with current or developing operations in latin america,africa,asia and the middle east,agpi is rapidly becoming a leading provider of telecommunications transport services,with networks designed to complement existing global carrier networks.lynxus,is one of north america fastest growing enhanced application service providers.their education business unit is currently deploying a safe,reliable,affordable internet access solution to schools in atlanta,georgia,funded through the fcc universal services fund program.
agpi has designed and is implementing a fiber optic network in south america,the caribbean,and africa,which will provide carriers with high quality transmission and advanced network capabilities.as a technology partner,lynxus will provide strong infrastructure support,offering a full array of internet solutions.
ipaxess,agpi and lynxus will work together to provide advanced,integrated ip remote access solutions for a number of global opportunities currently under development.agpi will provide independent transport services.lynxus will provide innovative applications services,and ipaxess will implement their patented vocalware tm ip remote access solution.
each press release concluded with a boilerplate cautionary statement 
this press release contains various statements which represent the company expectations or beliefs concerning future events,including its belief regarding the impact on the company of the new technology.these statements involve numerous risks,uncertainties and assumptions,and actual results could differ materially from anticipated results.there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of revenue from the new technology.
the deals described in these press releases failed quickly and spectacularly.public statements by ipaxess trace the turn of events.the company shipped approximately of vocalware products and user licenses to lynxus within three to four months of the may announcements.while the company booked the revenue at the time of shipment,as was its custom,its auditors kpmg disputed this action,evidently because they were unpersuaded of lynxus ability to pay.on november,the company announced that it had acquiesced in kpmg advice and withdrew the from its revenue statement for the first quarter of.nevertheless,kpmg resigned from auditing ipaxess.
having failed to receive even a dollar of the promised million annual purchases from the association,or a dollar of the announced million equipment purchase,or even a dollar of the shipment the products were eventually returned to ipaxess,the company publicly admitted the deals collapse in february.the company stated that it had been able to maintain its connection to the caribbean project,for which the products had been shipped.in a shareholder letter published on the company website about that time,mcdonnell asserted that lynxus had been unable to pay because one of its customers had delayed paying lynxus.no mention was made that lynxus had filed bankruptcy three weeks earlier.
august press release 
the august,press release announced,in a bold face subheading,that agreements are in place with major customers for commercial shipments in september.in this release,ipaxess named several major companies including time warner antonio and continental airlines.the august press release states as follows 
ip axess tm announces closure of vocalware tm ip integrated server beta program.
agreements in place with major customers for commercial shipments in september.
ip axess,formerly data race nasdaq race,today announced that it has closed participation in the vocalware ip integrated server beta program.customers participating in the beta trial include time warner cable of san antonio,continental airlines,associated global,as well as a global carrier and an agency of the federal government.these first installations position ip axess to ship commercially available product in september.
the enterprise access compact pci server is unparalleled in the scale,scope and flexibility of its design,said michael mcdonnell,ip axess president and chief executive officer.these organizations have established themselves as leaders in the application of remote access solutions and pioneers in the use of ip protocols to effectively converge voice and data connectivity.we are excited about our beta partners remote access application plans and commencement of shipment of the enterprise access server to partners of such distinction.we look forward to working closely with them as we begin implementation.
plotkin alleges that this notice touted agreements that never existed.in any event,none of them ever generated ongoing business for ipaxess.
according to plotkin complaint,the price of the company stock rose after the may and august press releases.within a few months,however,after the revelation that the lynxus revenue must be removed from the company books,and after the publicized deals failed to come through,the stock sank steadily.
on may,the plaintiffs filed their initial federal complaint in illinois against ipaxess,mcdonnell,and scogin,setting forth claims under sections b and a of the securities exchange act of,codified at b,and securities exchange commission rule,codified at plotkin also alleged a common law fraud claim,along with a violation of the illinois consumer fraud and deceptive business practices act.the case was transferred to the eastern district of texas.the district court had to sever plotkin claims against ipaxess,which filed for chapter bankruptcy relief in july.
the individual defendants,mcdonnell and scogin,moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.the magistrate judge to whom the motion was referred issued his first report and recommendation first magistrate report recommending dismissal of the complaint federal claims.he concluded that plotkin failed to identify a factual basis that would make the three press releases false or misleading failed adequately to allege scienter failed to satisfy the pleading standards in the private securities litigation reform act of pslra,and and the statements in the releases were not actionable because they were and accompanied by sufficient cautionary language.see c a safe harbor.in a second report,the magistrate judge recommended the dismissal of the state law causes of action for analogous reasons.the district court adopted both reports without substantive comments,dismissed the federal and state law claims with prejudice,and rendered its final judgment.plotkin has appealed.
ii.discussion 
we review de novo the district court dismissal of the securities fraud complaint against mcdonnell and scogin for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.rosenzweig azurix,cir.in determining whether plotkin has stat ed a claim upon which relief can be granted.b,we must accept the facts alleged in plotkin complaint as true and construe the allegations in the light most favorable to plotkin.id.we do not accept as true conclusory allegations,unwarranted factual inferences,or legal conclusions.southland sec.inspire ins.solutions,cir.
to demonstrate a violation of section b of the securities exchange act of and sec rule,a securities fraud plaintiff must prove that the defendant made a misstatement or omission of material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a security,which was made with scienter,and upon which the plaintiffs justifiably relied,proximately causing injury to the plaintiffs.rosenzweig,at.the private securities litigation reform act pslra,codified at and,requires a securities fraud plaintiff like plotkin to plead these substantive elements with particularity the pslra particularity requirement incorporates,at a minimum,the pleading standard for fraud actions under federal rule of civil procedure b.rosenzweig,at.in this court,the rule b standards require specificity as to the statements or omissions considered to be fraudulent,the speaker,when and why the statements were made,and an explanation why they are fraudulent.nathenson zonagen,at citing williams wmx technologies,cir.
the pslra pleading standard for scienter is especially challenging for plaintiffs.a valid complaint must plead specific facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter.see b nathenson,at cir.the fifth circuit has elaborated that scienter generally encompasses severe recklessness.see broad rockwell intern,cir en banc.thus,a securities fraud plaintiff must prove that the defendant either consciously misbehaved in issuing the releases,or was so severely reckless that it demonstrates that the defendant must have been aware of the danger of misleading the investing public.see mercury air group,mansour,cir scienter encompasses reckless indifference such that the omission or misrepresentation was so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it.quoting rubinstein collins,cir see also southland securities,supra,at.
alleged misstatements or omissions of the may,press releases.
the complaint adequately pleads that material omissions from the may releases rendered those releases misleading.a fair reading of the may press releases would reasonably induce investors to believe that ipaxess had a legitimate expectation of revenues from the agreements it had just struck with agpi and lynxus.the first may press release states that t he agreement strategic partnership with calls for an annual commitment of million dollars of net purchases from ipaxess.likewise,the second release announced that ipaxess anticipated imminent revenue from these companies ipaxess today announced receipt of a million purchase order for the vocalware ip remote work technology from,considering that total revenues for ipaxess had been reported as for fiscal,and just over in the year ended june,the announcement of these transactions would have been regarded by a reasonable investor as particularly significant.
a reasonable investor reading the releases would also have formed the impression that agpi and lynxus were significant international companies which could serve as credible business partners to ipaxess.concerning agpi,the releases state with current or developing operations in latin america,africa,asia and the middle east,agpi is rapidly becoming a leading provider of telecommunications transport services.the releases describe lynxus as one of north america fastest growing enhanced application providers.
these impressions were not dispelled by the press releases standard warnings about the risks and uncertainties facing ipaxess as it started selling new products.both releases included the warning there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of revenue from the new technology.although it is true that letters of intent and purchase orders do not necessarily guarantee the receipt of cash,ipaxess announcement of these agreements properly raised the inference that ipaxess expected its partners to perform under the agreements.the laudatory description of reinforced the expectation.the cautionary statements did not mention the potential uncertainty of agpi or lynxus ability to comply with the contracts.
the district court concluded,however,that plotkin failed to plead facts permitting the inference that lacked the business potential to pay for the products they ordered.we disagree.the complaint alleges that lynxus was actually a very small company with reported revenues of million in and that agpi was incorporated,by lynxus ceo,less than six months before the news releases.the complaint also states that lynxus filed for bankruptcy on january,a mere eight months after the deals had been publicized.further,by the time of the lawsuit,agpi status with the georgia secretary of state was active noncompliance,that it had not filed a timely annual registration statement with accompanying minimal fee.the complaint also alleges that within only three to four months of the may press releases,kpmg,the company auditors,disagreed so strongly over the company desire to reflect as revenue a shipment to lynxus that,even after the company acquiesced in the auditors caution and restated its revenue,kpmg resigned.the complaint states that,contrary to the press releases,neither agpi nor lynxus engaged in the scope of operations attributed to it.
although some of these allegations concern matters that transpired after the press releases,they are so temporally connected that they shed light on the financial condition of the companies at the time of the announcements and bolstered plotkin suspicion that,at the time agpi and lynxus entered into contracts with ipaxess,those companies could not perform their obligations.we subscribe to the rule that a plaintiff can not charge defendants with intentionally misleading their investors about facts defendants may have become aware of after making allegedly misleading statements to the public.lain evans,d.nevertheless,allegations of facts can,in some circumstances,provide warrant for inferences about an earlier situation.for example,the fact that a business files for bankruptcy on day two,may,under the right surrounding circumstances,provide grounds for inferring that the business was performing poorly on day one.see novak kasaks,cir even six months after the class period,substantial amounts of box and hold inventory still dated from and supports the inference that inventory during the class period was similarly dated.further discovery may refute the inferences,but it is not unwarranted to infer that when a company big deal collapses so fast,something was amiss at the outset.
the appellees,echoing the magistrate judge analysis,contend that the press releases were neither false nor materially misleading for several reasons.first,the negative facts that plotkin points to about the press releases.as we have demonstrated,however,events following so closely on the heels of ipaxess announcement of a major new business relationship and signed sales contracts cast doubt on the viability of those transactions from their inception.
appellees also assert that generalized,positive statements about a company prospects are not actionable under federal securities law.nathenson,at.this proposition,while true in isolation,overlooks not only that the announcement of signed,allegedly lucrative contracts is a statement of fact,not a generalized positive statement,but that,in context,the touting of was designed to create an impression that a substantial payoff would soon flow from the contracts the contextualized understanding of the positive statements about also defeats the defendants contention that the negative information about those parties unearthed by plotkin does not render the may releases materially false or misleading.the average investor would certainly be surprised to learn that contrary to the depiction of in the press releases,the two companies were new,small and related to each other.such characteristics would tend to undermine the investor impression of the solidity of the new contracts and would imply instead that ipaxess had embarked on a speculative venture.the omission of those facts was material to a reasonable investor appreciation of the implications of the deals for ipaxess bottom line 
finally,while the defendants characterize some of the statements in these two releases as and subject to the pslra safe harbor provision because of the releases cautionary language,they acknowledge that the facts concerning the contracts are not predictions see griffin gk intelligent systems,d holding that the defendant announcement that it had entered into a agreement from which it expected to realize million in revenues referred to factual conditions and thus did not fall within the provision of the pslra.our analysis is independent of the statements contained in the releases that are properly designated as representations concerning ipaxess 
scienter allegations as to the may,press releases.
the district court concluded that plotkin failed to plead facts giving rise to a strong inference of the defendants fraudulent intent,as is required to state a claim under rule.we disagree.plotkin alleged specific facts about the agreements giving rise to a strong inference that ipaxess knew or was severely reckless in not knowing at the time of the releases that were not able or were not likely to be able to make the payments they contracted to make.according to the complaint,ipaxess was a struggling company that announced to the public that it had reached agreements with lynxus and agpi that would bring them multimillion dollar revenues,which would amount to a increase from the revenues ipaxess reported in.it is reasonable to assume,given the importance of these deals to the company,that ipaxess would have familiarized itself with the financial condition of and would have discovered details about their poor financial the facts that lynxus earned revenues of million in,and that agpi was incorporated less than six months prior to the issuance of the may releases.given the reasonableness of the inference that plotkin possessed material facts casting doubt on its contracting partners credibility,the district court was incorrect to fault plotkin for failing to allege specific facts conclusively proving that ipaxess knew this information.novak kasaks,cir stating that an egregious refusal to see the obvious,or to investigate the doubtful,may in some cases give rise to an inference of recklessness.
additionally,plotkin alleges that ipaxess has referred in inconsistent ways to shipments of its product under the agreement,strengthening the permissible inference that ipaxess intended to deceive or mislead its investors.in its december form annual report with the sec,ipaxess referred to its agreements with lynxus as beta agreements a industry term referring to testing agreements where testers typically receive a temporary usage license from the beta agreements the company shipped vocalware servers and vocalware user licenses for approximately to lynxus.by contrast,when ipaxess first announced the agreements in its may releases,ipaxess indicated that agpi and lynxus had ordered the products under normal commercial sales terms ipaxess,formerly data race,nasdaq race today announced receipt of a million purchase order for the vocalware ip remote work technology from.if ipaxess accurately stated in its later sec filing that the may deal with was a beta agreement rather than a normal commercial sale,then it is curious why this seemingly important qualifying detail was omitted in the earlier press release 
alleged misstatements or omissions of the august,press releases.
the district court concluded that plotkin failed to plead sufficient facts to illustrate that anything in the august press release was false or misleading.on this issue,we agree with the court.
under plotkin reading,the august release represented the statement that ipaxess had commercial sales agreements in place with time warner cable of san antonio,continental airlines,associated global,a global carrier,and an agency of the federal government.plotkin pleaded that this statement is an outright lie because no such commercial shipping agreements ever existed.
the defendants respond that plotkin misinterpreted the august press release and that,properly understood,it is correct in its particulars.according to the defendants,the press release does not announce commercial sales agreements,but,rather,refers to agreements for participation in ipaxess beta trials,as part of its established marketing strategy.ipaxess selling strategy called for it to ship product to prospective customers on a trial basis and,if the customer decided to keep the product,to bill the customer after the trial period.shipments to ipaxess beta partners were,therefore,simply part of ipaxess efforts to generate sales.
the press release expressly refers to beta agreements and does not announce the striking of commercial sales agreements with the listed companies.the release can only properly be read as telling investors that the participants in the beta test had been selected and that beta trials were ongoing.the announcement advised the reader that ipaxess had closed participation in the vocalware ip integrated server beta program meaning that the selection of the participants had concluded and lists customers participating in the beta trial.later,the release describes these organizations as beta partners we are excited about our beta partner sic remote access application plans and commencement of shipment of the enterprise access server to partners of such distinction.
