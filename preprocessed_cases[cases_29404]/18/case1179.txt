in this case involving restrictive covenants in an employment contract,we decide two questions.in a matter of first impression for our court,we hold that our total activities test for a corporation principal place of business for diversity jurisdiction purposes applies to determine the citizenship of a defendant corporation which once operated in the same state as the plaintiff but has since been purchased by and integrated into an corporation as a holding company.we further conclude that because the defendant corporation principal place of business is in the same state as the purchasing corporation,the federal courts have jurisdiction over a suit by a citizen of the defendant corporation former home state.second,we vacate and remand the district court denial of preliminary injunctive relief.
hobbs group,llc hobbs,an insurance brokerage firm,employed douglas macginnitie as its senior vice president and general counsel in.hobbs is incorporated in the state of delaware,and until it undisputably had its principal place of business in the state of georgia.hilb,rogal hobbs company hrh,also an insurance brokerage firm,agreed to purchase hobbs in.hrh is incorporated and has its principal place of business in the commonwealth of virginia.
when hobbs first employed macginnitie,macginnitie signed a form employment agreement which hobbs had drafted.the agreement included restrictive covenants which are at the heart of the present action.the employment agreement provision prohibits macginnitie from engaging in certain activities for a period of two years after termination of his employment.among other things,macginnitie agreed not to 
d irectly or indirectly solicit for employment any person who is an employee of hobbs,unless hobbs first terminates the employment of such employee or hobbs gives its written consent to such employment or offer of employment 
c all on or,directly or indirectly,solicit,divert,or take away any business from hobbs,or,directly or indirectly,accept business from,provide insurance related consulting services of any kind to,or perform any of the services offered by hobbs for,any person,firm,corporation or other entity who is a customer of hobbs or who is,or during the period prior to macginnitie termination of employment was,a prospective customer of hobbs with whom macginnitie had direct contact,or,directly or indirectly,encourage any such customer to cease doing business with hobbs.
the employment agreement also contained a confidentiality provision which obliged macginnitie not to make use of,divulge,or otherwise disclose,directly or indirectly,whether during the period of macginnitie employment with hobbs or at any time thereafter,any confidential information except to the extent such use,divulgence or disclosure is made in connection with macginnitie employment and for the benefit of hobbs.
at the time of the acquisition of hobbs,hrh presented macginnitie with an acknowledgement agreement,under which macginnitie acknowledged the and confidentiality provisions of the employment agreement.the new contract also added a new paragraph to the employment agreement which provided that 
macginnitie grants to hrh during the term of this agreement the continuous and unilateral right,upon written notice to macginnitie of days,to lessen the restrictions of any of the covenants set forth herein by so much as hrh deems necessary either to make this agreement in accordance with the policy of the state of georgia or to fit the circumstances peculiar to macginnitie.
macginnitie alleges that he was subsequently forced to leave hrh shortly after the acquisition because his position was eliminated and his job duties reassigned to attorneys working at hrh headquarters in richmond,virginia.defendants,on the other hand,claim that they did nothing to force macginnitie departure from the company.after macginnitie resigned from hrh in september,he and a partner opened a new insurance brokerage business,beecher carlson risk management.
macginnitie filed the present action for declaratory and injunctive relief in georgia state court in,alleging that the language of the and confidentiality provisions effectively prevents him from competing with hrh.the defendants filed a timely notice of removal,claiming federal jurisdiction under the diversity statute.macginnitie filed a motion for remand,but the district court found that diversity jurisdiction existed and denied the motion.
after the denial of the motion for a remand,macginnitie renewed his motion for a preliminary injunction barring enforcement of the allegedly unenforceable covenants.the district court refused to grant the injunction on three grounds first,that macginnitie was not likely to succeed on the merits because the covenants were not overbroad second,that macginnitie would not suffer irreparable harm because he was not licensed personally to sell insurance in georgia and third,that the balance of harms weighed in hrh favor because it might lose a significant number of clients and employees if the injunction were granted.following the ruling,macginnitie filed a timely appeal.
macginnitie contends that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the present case and should have remanded it to the georgia state court from which it was removed.we review rulings on the jurisdiction of a federal court de novo.williams best buy,cir.factual findings regarding the citizenship of a party are subject to a clearly erroneous standard of review.mccormick aderholt,cir.
macginnitie claims that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the present action because there was not complete diversity between the parties at the time the complaint was filed complete diversity requires that no defendant in a diversity action be a citizen of the same state as any plaintiff.carden arkoma,d.for diversity purposes,a corporation is a citizen of both the state where it is incorporated and the state where it has its principal place of business.c.citizenship for diversity purposes is determined at the time the suit is filed.harris garner,cir.
we have adopted the total activities test to determine a corporation principal place of business.see vareka investments,american investment properties,cir.this test combines the place of activities test and the nerve center test used by other circuits.sweet pea marine,apj marine,cir.under the place of activities test,the location of the majority of the corporation sales or production activities is its principal place of business.id.under the nerve center test,the location of the corporate offices is generally the principal place of business.id.
the total activities test requires a somewhat subjective analysis to choose between the results of the nerve center and place of activities tests,if they differ.toms country quality meats,cir we provided guidance as to how the district courts should balance the two tests in sweet pea marine.where a company activities are not concentrated in one place,a district court is entitled to give these related facts greater significance in determining principal place of business.sweet pea marine,at.
according to macginnitie,hobbs principal place of business was in georgia at the time the suit was filed,because the principal place of business of an inactive corporation remains the same as its last principal place of business while the corporation was still active.
the question of the principal place of business of an inactive corporation is one of first impression in this circuit.we need not,however,reach that issue,because our existing total activities test is sufficient to resolve the question before us.the district court found that at the time the suit was filed 
hobbs continued to exist only as an active corporate holding company that was directed and controlled from hrh corporate headquarters in virginia.every decision necessary to realize the strategic advantage offered by hobbs continued,passive existence was and continues to be made in hrh virginia corporate headquarters by hrh officers.thus,at the time macginnitie filed his complaint,the nerve center of hobbs,for purposes of determining diversity,could only be in virginia.
the plaintiff has
