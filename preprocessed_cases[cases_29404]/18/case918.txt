soon after,the complaint alleges,chinacast founder and ceo,ron chan tze ngon chan,looted the company coffers,including proceeds from the stock offerings.from june through april,chan transferred million of corporate assets to outside accounts that were controlled by him and his allies.in addition,chan permitted a company vice president to move million in company funds to his son unlawfully transferred control of two of chinacast private colleges outside the company and pledged million in company assets to secure loans unrelated to chinacast business.these actions brought chinacast to financial ruin.the company can not even afford its legal bills,according to its lawyers,who submitted a brief on appeal and stated that chinacast now unfortunately lacks the funds necessary to mount with full vigor the defense of this appeal.
in the midst of this fraud on multiple fronts,chan and chinacast chief financial officer antonio sena participated in a series of earnings calls and other communication with investors.during these calls,neither official disclosed the fraudulent activities taking place instead,chan emphasized the company financial health and stability.for example,in a press release and conference call in fall,chan reassured investors that no questions or concern s have ever been raised by the company auditors or audit committee about our cash balances.throughout,chan signed sec filings on behalf of chinacast and never disclosed the million in transfers and other fraudulent activities afoot.
