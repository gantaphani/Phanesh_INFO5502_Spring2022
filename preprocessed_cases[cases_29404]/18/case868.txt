appellant john doe corporation jdc appeals from the district court judgment holding that the government did not improperly use grand jury materials as part of a criminal investigation into jdc and a civil investigation into one of jdc independent sales representative companies,xyz the district court determination that it was not improper for the department of justice to disclose grand jury materials to another department of the government through ex parte orders issued by the district court without giving notice to jdc and the district court refusal to quash any of the subpoenas issued by the grand jury to jdc.after careful review,we affirm in part,dismiss in part,and remand in part.
jdc is the target of a criminal investigation originated by a department of the united states the other department into jdc alleged violation of federal laws through the sale of restricted items.the investigation began in september.xyz is jdc independent sales representative in question and was involved in arranging a sale.the lead agent in the criminal investigation is federal special agent smith of the other department,who worked in conjunction with the united states attorney office in minnesota,although he is not part of the justice department.as part of the investigation,a search warrant for jdc headquarters was issued,and a search was executed in may.the warrant and its supporting affidavit were unsealed three months later and revealed the federal laws claimed to have been violated.a grand jury subpoena was issued to jdc on february,seeking all documents related to jdc contacts with a certain entity and all other individuals and entities in the same country.in response to this subpoena,more than pages of documents were provided in april to the assistant united states attorney ausa handling the case.
shortly after the delivery of these documents,two representatives of the other department met with an xyz employee.a second grand jury subpoena was issued to jdc on march,requesting documents related to the shipping of certain items since january.more than pages of documents were produced in response to the subpoena,with approximately pages sent directly to special agent smith for review.
a third grand jury subpoena was issued to jdc in october.this subpoena repeated the request for documents related to a number of entities and asked jdc for documents related to correspondence between jdc and xyz.jdc sent its responses to special agent smith.
in july,a jdc employee in charge of compliance with federal laws was granted immunity and testified before the grand jury.special agent smith was present at a pretestimony interview the witness had with the ausa,but was not in the grand jury room during the employee testimony.a newspaper story after the employee appearance and testimony named the employee and the employee position,discussed the purported purpose of the investigation,quoted representatives of jdc,and stated the purported nature of the government investigation and portions of what had occurred in the investigation to date.
the other department informed xyz of its intent to initiate an administrative proceeding against xyz in august.special agent smith was also in charge of this civil investigation for the other department.formal civil administrative proceedings were initiated by the other department in february,alleging that xyz conspired to commit violations of various laws by arranging the sale of restricted same charges as leveled against jdc in the affidavit supporting the search warrant.
on april,the ausa asked jdc to provide three documents that jdc had produced in response to the grand jury subpoenas to the other department for use in the civil administrative proceeding against xyz.jdc refused,stating that it believed the documents were protected by federal rule of criminal procedure e.in may,the ausa asked jdc to send two other documents to the other department,but jdc again denied the request.in february,the government made a third request for jdc to send several documents to the other department.this request was also denied by jdc,citing rule e.
as part of its defense in the civil matter,xyz asked to depose special agent smith.the other department agreed,but before the deposition took place the other department moved to stay the civil proceedings against xyz until the grand jury investigation was finished.the other department contended that because special agent smith was in charge of both the criminal investigation of jdc and the civil investigation of xyz,it would be almost impossible for him to give deposition testimony without potentially disclosing grand jury secrets.jdc counsel received a copy of the other department response to xyz opposition to the stay,and from that response jdc learned that the district court had granted the government ex parte request for orders allowing the government to disclose to the other department the documents that jdc had declined to voluntarily provide.
upon learning of these ex parte orders,jdc filed a motion for contempt and a motion for access to the ex parte motions and supporting papers.the district court denied the motion for contempt,declined to grant any injunctive relief,denied the motion to quash,and made no mention of allowing jdc access to the ex parte materials.jdc appeals,arguing that the district court erred by finding no violation of federal rule of criminal procedure e,by allowing the government to obtain ex parte orders without giving notice to jdc,and by not granting jdc any relief from the grand jury subpoenas.
notice of the government ex parte motion 
we first address jdc argument that it was legal error for the district court to allow the government to seek ex parte orders without giving notice to jdc,even though jdc had specifically objected to the disclosure of the documents at issue.we review the district court decision to disclose grand jury materials for abuse of discretion.in re grand jury investigation,cir.stating that a decision to allow disclosure is entrusted to the substantial discretion of the district court,which must weigh the circumstances of each case and that the district court decision will only be overturned if the district court abused its discretion,cert.denied,d.
the need to preserve the secrecy of grand jury proceedings is well acknowledged and is in fact proscribed by the federal rules of criminal procedure.see generally.e douglas oil of petrol stops,d in re grand jury proceedings relative to perl,cir.rule e governs petitions to the district court for permission to disclose grand jury information.relevant portions of the rule state that 
a petition to disclose a matter must be filed in the district where the grand jury convened.unless the hearing is ex it may be when the government is the petitioner must serve the petition on,and the court must afford reasonable opportunity to appear and be heard to ii the parties to the judicial proceeding and iii any other person whom the court may designate.
in the instant case,the government was the petitioner and filed the petition to disclose grand jury matters ex action clearly permitted by rule e f.the rule also clearly exempts ex parte hearings from the notice provisions.jdc reliance on in re united states,cir,to support its argument that lack of notice is legal error is misplaced.the court in that case affirmatively upheld the district court right to allow ex parte proceedings without providing notice to any other party.id.noting that the amendments to rule e explicitly authorize ex parte proceedings when the united states is the petitioner.in these situations,the district court is to use its abundant discretion to determine if notice should be given.see also in re grand jury investigation,cir denying claim that the district court erred by granting an ex parte motion under rule e without providing notice and an opportunity to be heard to appellants,overruled on other grounds,d.here there was no misapplication of the rule,as jdc argues,because the rule plain language permits the district court to allow the government to proceed ex parte.thus,the question before us does not involve one of legal error,but rather whether or not the district court abused its discretion in allowing the government to proceed ex parte without giving jdc notice and an opportunity to be heard 
the united states supreme court has consistently recognized that the proper functioning of our grand jury system depends upon the secrecy of grand jury proceedings.in re grand jury proceedings relative to perl,at internal marks omitted.particularly when a grand jury investigation is ongoing,district courts have broad discretion in taking action to protect the secrecy of that investigation.see in re grand jury,cir.ex parte in camera hearings have been held proper in order to preserve the ongoing interest in grand jury secrecy,cert.denied,d.in a case involving access to a government ex parte affidavit,our sister circuit rejected arguments that unique circumstances,a prolonged period of investigation,and the fact that the nature of the investigation had already at least in part been made public was enough to reverse the district court decision denying access to the ex parte affidavit.in re grand jury subpoena,cir.the court rejected the argument that the district court abused its discretion,relying on the acknowledged need for secrecy in grand jury proceedings and the fact that the affidavit in question included excerpts of witness testimony and documents obtained during the ongoing investigation.id.we agree with this analysis.while ex parte motions do prevent a party from arguing on its own behalf,numerous courts have upheld them as part of the balancing act required to properly protect grand jury secrecy.see in re sealed case,in re grand jury proceedings,cir but see in re united states,at noting that one situation where a district court could possibly abuse its discretion by allowing the government to proceed ex parte without notice to interested parties might arise when the government seeks to further its own interests in a civil suit.while the district court certainly could have exercised its discretion and required notice and a hearing,in this instance we do not find that it abused its discretion by not granting notice to jdc,particularly given the nature of the investigation in question,the fact that the documents being sought could at least arguably have been considered matters before the grand jury,that the government limited its request to a very small number of documents out of the thousands produced,that the other department was not seeking to use the documents against jdc,and the fact that the grand jury investigation was ongoing.
jdc also argues that it was legal error for the district court to fail to grant it access to the ex parte motions and supporting papers.the government did not oppose jdc motion for access to the ex parte materials,but the district court did not,apparently,consider the stipulation.jdc should have renewed its motion before the district court for access to the materials and asked for a ruling after the district court failed to address this issue when it dismissed jdc motion for contempt.jdc did not,however,and instead asks this court to direct the district court to grant it access.even though it appears that the government did not contest jdc motion for access to the ex parte materials,the proper court to grant or deny access to this information in the first instance is the district court,as it is in the best position to assess the overall need for secrecy in this grand jury proceeding if indeed it is still ongoing and any potential impact from allowing access to jdc.as such,we remand this issue to the district court with directions to evaluate and address jdc motion for access to the ex parte materials.
unauthorized disclosure of grand jury materials 
jdc also contends that the government violated rule e b through the unauthorized disclosure of grand jury materials separate and apart from the disclosures authorized by the district court ex parte orders.specifically,it contends that the use of special agent smith as the lead investigator on the simultaneously conducted civil investigation of xyz and criminal investigation of jdc was improper because special agent smith had access to grand jury materials as part of the criminal investigation that he would not have had access to had he solely been investigating the civil matter.jdc argues that,at a minimum,it established a prima facie case of a violation by special agent smith and was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on its claim.the district court disagreed and dismissed jdc motion,holding that in the absence of any evidence of misuse of the materials by special agent smith,there were no grounds to find a violation of rule e.
when considering a district court ruling regarding a rule of criminal procedure,we review the district court legal conclusions de novo and its findings of fact for clear error.united states shepard,cir internal marks omitted,cert.denied,d,wl see also united states pardue,cir holding that a district court interpretation of the applicability of a criminal rule of procedure was reviewed de novo united states olsen,wl,at cir,unpublished noting that a decision regarding whether or not material fell under the protection of rule e was reviewed de novo as a mixed question of law and fact.
we first note that rule e protects the secrecy of the grand jury in two similar,but distinct ways,through regulation both of the use and the disclosure of grand jury information.disclosure,the sharing of information with another,is prohibited except in a few limited circumstances.e a e e see united states,cir defining disclosure under rule e as requiring that information be shared with another,cert.denied,d united states john doe.i,d same.in addition,the rule also limits how certain persons can use grand jury information that has been properly disclosed to them.e b.
disclosure of grand jury materials is permitted to any government personnel that an attorney for the government considers necessary to assist in performing that attorney duty to enforce federal criminal law.e a ii.how a person can use information disclosed to them under this rule is limited,as the information may be used only to assist an attorney for the government in performing that attorney duty to enforce federal criminal law.e b.because jdc does not contend otherwise,we assume without deciding that special agent smith was properly allowed access to the grand jury materials through his work as an investigator of the criminal matter.thus,the issue of improper disclosure to special agent smith is not before us on appeal we must only determine if there was a violation regarding the limitations on the use of grand jury materials.
jdc argues that special agent smith simultaneous work as an investigator into the civil matter involving xyz is itself enough to violate rule e.it contends that the use of a dual investigative agent violates the principle that a grand jury investigation should not be used as a form of civil in general that it is a per se violation of rule e b.see generally united states sells eng g,d noting that unfettered disclosure to government attorneys for civil use poses a significant threat to the integrity of the grand jury itself.the district court disagreed,stating that there is no rule against the same investigator participating in both a criminal and civil investigation,and concluding that without any real evidence that special agent smith misused any grand jury information,there was no violation of rule e.
we have not previously been presented with the issue of an investigator simultaneously working on both a civil and a criminal case.in,we held that it was not a violation of rule e prohibiting disclosure for an attorney who had been assigned to the criminal grand jury investigation to later be involved in a civil investigation into the same company and matter.at see also john doe.i,at,d holding that rule e disclosure rule did not prevent a government attorney from working on a grand jury investigation and then later on a civil case involving the same matter,because t he rule does not contain a prohibition against the continued use of information by attorneys who legitimately obtained access to the information through the g
