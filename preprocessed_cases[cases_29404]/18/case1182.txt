this case is about a directors and officers liability policy policy.more specifically,it about that policy insured insured exclusion,which acts to bar coverage for claims brought by directors and officers.the district court held on summary judgment that this exclusion bars coverage for claims brought by a former director and officer.we agree and thus affirm.
we divide our opinion in three parts.in part i,we explain the case factual and procedural history.in part ii,we apply the law to this history.in part iii,we briefly conclude.
sphinx international,was formerly known as phoenix international.both sphinx and its predecessor,which we refer to exclusively as sphinx,design and implement computer software and systems for financial institutions.when sphinx incorporated in january,bahram yusefzadeh became ceo and chairman of the board at sphinx.prior to incorporation,yusefzadeh met george taylor.soon after their meeting,yusefzadeh offered taylor a job as a director and an officer along with ten percent of the shares of sphinx.taylor accepted.taylor served in these two positions until his employment was terminated in july.sphinx states that it terminated taylor employment because he did not disclose a covenant not to compete from his former job and he misrepresented his qualifications by falsely claiming that he was an expert in technology for financial institutions.
in july,sphinx contracted with genesis indemnity insurance for policies.in general,policies indemnify directors and officers from liability for their business decisions.while sphinx had two policies from genesis,the particular policy at issue here was to run from july,to july,and it was extended to august.this policy was a policy,which means that it covered sphinx for claims made during the policy period,irrespective of when those claims arose.the policy also contained an insured insured exclusion that barred claims 
by or at the behest of any director or officer,or by any security holder of the company,whether directly or derivatively,unless such claim is instigated and continued totally independent of,and totally without the solicitation of,or assistance of,or active participation of,or intervention of,any director or officer or the company or any affiliate of the company.
the policy defined director and officer to mean all persons who were,now are,shall be duly elected directors or duly elected or appointed officers of the company.
for a few years sphinx did well.but it missed its earnings projections in and.as a result,taylor filed a securities class action against sphinx on november.on that same day,taylor published a notice in a national newswire service soliciting other sphinx shareholders.taylor then amended his complaint to add as plaintiffs the shareholders that responded to his solicitation.
in response to taylor lawsuit,sphinx sought coverage from genesis.genesis denied that claim,justifying its denial on the insured insured exclusion.specifically,genesis said that because taylor was a former director and officer,the exclusion barred coverage.
sphinx then filed suit in florida state court against genesis and national union fire insurance company of pittsburgh,another company with which sphinx had insurance coverage.the case was removed to the middle district of florida on the basis of diversity of citizenship under.to make a long procedural story short,there were essentially two sets of motions and responses that matter on this appeal.the first set began with genesis motion to dismiss or,in the alternative,for summary judgment,which focused in large part on the insured insured exception the text of that motion focused on rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,making genesis reference to summary judgment somewhat confusing.sphinx filed a response,arguing that genesis motion to dismiss should be denied on several legal grounds,and that genesis motion for summary judgment was inappropriate because discovery would reveal documents that could affect the court decision.the second set began with sphinx motion for partial summary judgment.genesis responded by filing an opposition to sphinx motion,where it request ed that the court deny sphinx motion for partial summary judgment,and grant summary judgment in favor of genesis.
the district court addressed all of these motions at the same time.faced with these motions and responses,and several other issues not germane to this appeal,the district court granted summary judgement in favor of genesis and denied everything else.the court wrote that s ince the parties have filed affidavits in support of their positions,the court will treat genesis submission as a motion summary judgment rather than a motion to dismiss.sphinx int l,union fire ins.of pittsburgh,d.sphinx appealed,but because the district court order did not dispose of the claims against national union,we dismissed the appeal.sphinx then settled with national union,and the district court dismissed the suit against it,in effect making the court earlier summary judgment decision now final and appealable.
we review a district court rulings on motions for summary judgement de novo,and we apply the same legal standards that bound the district court.fire ins.of hartford fortune constr,cir.but we may affirm the district court where the judgment entered is correct on any legal ground regardless of the grounds addressed,adopted or rejected by the district court.bonanni ship supply,united states,cir.
this case requires us to consider contract claims.under the erie doctrine,a federal court adjudicating state law claims applies the substantive law of the state.dresdner bank ag,cir citing erie tompkins.in particular,t he construction of insurance contracts is governed by substantive state law.provau state farm mut.auto.ins,cir.thus,we evaluate the insurance policy in this case,the policy under florida law.
sphinx makes several arguments,three of which deserve discussion.sphinx first argument focuses on the policy language it argues that taylor was not a duly elected officer or director and therefore not an insured.its second argument focuses on the rationale behind the policy it argues that the insured insured exclusion acts only to prevent collusive suits and therefore does not apply because taylor and sphinx were adversarial.sphinx third argument is its fallback position it argues that even if the language and rationale act to deny coverage,we should deny coverage only to that percentage of the claim attributed to taylor.all of these arguments fail.to explain why,we address each argument in turn.
sphinx first argument focuses on the meaning of duly elected.the insured insured exclusion bars claims brought by or at the behest of any director or officer.the policy defines directors and officers as persons who were,or now are,or shall be duly elected directors or duly elected or appointed officers.emphasis added.sphinx contends that taylor was not a duly elected officer or director because he did not disclose a covenant not to compete and misrepresented his qualifications.
florida courts have said again and again that insurance contracts must be construed in accordance with the plain language of the policy.swire pac.holdings,zurich ins,so d,see also hrynkiw allstate floridian ins,so d,dca interpreting policy language for its everyday meaning.however,i f the relevant policy language is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation,one providing coverage and the other limiting coverage,the insurance policy is considered ambiguous.swire pac.holdings,so d at quoting ins.anderson,so d.such ambiguities are construed in favor of the insured and strictly against the drafter.swire pac.holdings,so d at.and in cases such as this one that involve exclusions to insurance contracts,the rule is even clearer in favor of strict construction against the insurer exclusionary provisions which are ambiguous or otherwise susceptible to more than one meaning must be construed in favor of the insured.state farm mut.auto.ins.pridgen,so d.but courts should not strain to find ambiguity.only when a genuine inconsistency,uncertainty,or ambiguity in meaning remains after resort to the ordinary rule
