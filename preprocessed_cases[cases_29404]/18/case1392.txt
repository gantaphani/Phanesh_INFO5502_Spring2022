in,a nurse working at a hospital suffered a back injury in the course of her employment.by september,approximately million had been paid on the nurse workers compensation claim for wage indemnity,medical care,and vocational rehabilitation.the nurse employer paid the first under the retention on its excess workers compensation insurance policy.by the time the retention was exceeded,the insurance company was insolvent and,consequently,the employer continued to pay for the nurse medical care.
the employer or an affiliate requested the california insurance guarantee association ciga to reimburse it for amounts the insurance company would have paid under the policy had the insurance company remained solvent.the initial claims to ciga may have been presented by the corporation that employed the nurse.subsequent claims were presented by an affiliated corporation into which the employer corporation had merged.
this appeal concerns whether the ciga is statutorily required to pay those claims.the trial court granted ciga motion for summary judgment on the ground that the claims were excluded from the definition of covered claims that ciga was obligated to pay the court relied upon section,subdivision c b,which excludes any claim by any person other than the original claimant under the insurance policy in his or her own name,subd.c b.
in the published portion of this opinion we address two issues regarding the interpretation and application of section,subdivision c b.first,we conclude that any claims presented by the corporation that employed the nurse were covered claims despite the fact that the corporation changed its name to a name not listed in the insurance policy.second,we interpret the phrase original claimant under the insurance policy in his or her own name to include the affiliated corporation into which the employer corporation was merged because the merger was an internal restructuring of a family of corporations,and did not expand or otherwise change the ownership or control of the operations,and because the surviving corporation continued the employer corporation corporate activities as well as its hospital operations.we regard this interpretation as creating a narrow exception to the holding in baxter healthcare ciga th,d baxter where the court concluded that the surviving corporation of a merger between unaffiliated entities was not an original claimant under an insurance policy in the name of the disappearing corporation.based on our interpretation of section,subdivision c b,we conclude that ciga motion for summary judgment should be denied.
in the unpublished portion of this opinion we address whether triable issues of material fact exist regarding equitable estoppel and the equitable defense of laches.we conclude that questions of fact exist concerning the application of these affirmative defenses to ciga.these questions of fact are another reason why ciga should not have been granted summary judgment on its.
the judgment will be reversed and the matter remanded for further proceedings.
mercy hospital bakersfield 
the accurate identification of the entity named mercy hospital bakersfield is important to the issues raised in this appeal and is complicated by the fact that the entity changed its name twice and was involved in corporate reorganizations.mercy hospital bakersfield was the name of a california nonprofit public benefit corporation until late,when it changed its corporate name to mercy healthcare bakersfield.in march,the corporation filed an amendment to its articles of incorporation that changed its name to catholic healthcare west central california.for convenience,we sometimes will refer to the nonprofit public benefit corporation successively named mercy hospital bakersfield,mercy healthcare bakersfield,and catholic healthcare west central california as hospital corporation.

this association has assumed administration of the mission excess claim.do not communicate further with international surplus.it appears it will be many,many years before the retention is exceeded,if ever.therefore,we are closing our file.no further reports will be needed unless the retention is exceeded.

discussion 
standard of review 
appellate courts independently review a motion for summary judgment using the same legal standards that governed the trial court determination of the motion.millard biosources,th,d.code of civil procedure section contains these standards,which courts apply using a analysis.brantley pisaro th,d brantley see aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,aguilar.
first,a court must identify the issues framed by the allegations in the pleadings.brantley,supra,th at,d.second,a court must determine whether the moving party has satisfied its initial burden of producing evidence to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact aguilar,supra,cal th at,d,brantley,supra,th at,d.third,if the moving party has made the requisite showing,a court must examine the opposition and determine whether it demonstrates the existence of a triable issue of material fact.aguilar,supra,cal th at,d,
a triable issue of fact exists when the evidence reasonably would permit the trier of fact,under the applicable standard of proof,to find the purportedly contested fact in favor of the party opposing the motion.aguilar,supra,cal th at,d.
ii.ciga for return of the and payments 
background 
ciga for indemnity alleged that ciga had mistakenly believed that the claims made by or on behalf of catholic healthcare west were covered claims for purposes of section,the claims were not covered claims and ciga was not authorized to pay them,and catholic healthcare west was legally obligated to return the paid by ciga,but had refused to return the payment as demanded by ciga.
ciga motion for summary judgment asserted,among other things,that the claims it paid were not covered because the statute excludes any claim by any person other than the original claimant under the insurance policy in his or her own name,subd.c b.in baxter,supra,th,d,the court of appeal interpreted this statutory language to mean a claim for coverage must be made by an original insured.id.at,d.
catholic healthcare west contends summary judgment on ciga is inappropriate because triable issues of material fact exist regarding what entity or entities made the claims paid by ciga,whether ciga is estopped from denying that catholic healthcare west was an original insured,and whether the doctrine of laches bars ciga.
the trial court reached three conclusions in granting summary judgment to ciga on its for the return of the.first,ciga was not authorized to pay the claims because the claims were excluded from the definition of covered claims by section,subdivision c b.second,there was no triable issue of fact regarding catholic healthcare west estoppel defense because an essential element had been negated.third,the evidence did not support catholic healthcare west laches defense because there was no showing of prejudice.
issues presented 
broadly stated,this court must decide whether the paid by ciga in and was paid on claim s by any person other than the original claimant under the insurance policy in his or her own name,subd.c b and thus outside the definition of a covered claim.in other words,were the claims made by a person other than an original insured 
the papers filed in the trial court and the appellate briefs did not address some issue pertinent only to ciga,probably because the concerned only a small percent of the total amount in dispute.to obtain the parties positions on these issues,this court sent counsel a letter that asked specific questions.counsel provided written answers shortly before oral argument.
those questions primarily concerned who acted as the claimant in and,and if it was hospital corporation,what impact did that corporation earlier name changes have on its eligibility to make a covered claim.
identity of the claimant 
ciga separate statement 
motions for summary judgment shall include a separate statement setting forth plainly and concisely all material facts which the moving party contends are undisputed.code civ.proc,subd.b,italics added see cal.rules of court,rule.the facts material to ciga theory included the identity of the entity or entities that acted as the claimant in and.therefore,the first question in our letter of august,asked counsel does ciga separate statement of undisputed facts identify the person or persons that acted as the claimant in and both sides answered no.
we agree with the parties assessment.consequently,we will not discuss the contents of ciga separate statement in detail.despite this omission of a material fact from ciga moving papers,we will not end our analysis here but will proceed to the question whether the evidence presented negates the possibility that a named insured acted as a claimant in and.
possibility hospital corporation was a claimant 
the second question in our letter of august,asked counsel is it possible that hospital corporation was the person or among the persons that acted as the claimant in and both sides answered yes.
our review of the evidence in the record confirms ciga concession on this issue.because of the concession,there is no need to set forth a discussion of that evidence here.
legal effect of hospital corporation name changes 
in early,hospital corporation name was changed to catholic healthcare west central california.this name was not listed in endorsement as one of the employers covered by the insurance policy.
to clarify the position of the parties regarding the legal effect of hospital corporation name changes,the fifth question in our august,letter to counsel asked 
do hospital corporation name changes,standing alone,mean that any claim made on its behalf in,and may was a claim by a person other than the original claimant under the insurance policy in his or her own name for purposes of insurance code section c b 
both parties answered no.we agree with the position taken by the parties and conclude that hospital corporation name changes did not change its status as an original insured capable of presenting a covered claim to ciga.because ciga has conceded this question of statutory construction,we need not include an analysis in this opinion.
based on ciga answers to the questions asked in this court letter of august,it follows that ciga is not entitled to summary judgment on its for the recovery of.hospital corporation name at the time of bonham injury was mercy hospital bakersfield and mercy hospital,bakersfield is one of the employers listed in endorsement to the insurance policy.thus,hospital corporation is an original insured.if the trier of fact finds that hospital corporation presented the claims to ciga in and,which ciga concedes is possible,then those reimbursement claims would not be excluded from coverage by section,subdivision c b.
accordingly,the summary judgment granted to ciga on its can not be upheld.
ciga for the return of the it paid in the bonham matter can not be resolved by ciga motion for summary judgment because triable issues of material fact exist regarding the application of section,subdivision c b and catholic healthcare west affirmative defenses.
first,based on the evidence in the appellate record,a trier of fact reasonably could find that the claims for reimbursement submitted to ciga in and were claims for coverage made by an original,hospital corporation.
second,assuming that the trier of fact finds the claims for reimbursement submitted to ciga in and were not made on behalf of a named insured,questions of material fact exist regarding catholic healthcare west affirmative defenses of laches and equitable estoppel.
iii.catholic healthcare west reimbursement claim 
legal effect of the.facts regarding the mergers 
in,catholic healthcare west oversaw and coordinated the operations of a health care system that was organized into three tiers of nonprofit public benefit corporations.the top tier consisted solely of catholic healthcare west,the parent corporation.the middle tier consisted of multiple regional subsidiary corporations of which catholic healthcare west served as the sole member the bottom tier consisted of the corporations that operated the hospitals within a particular region the regional corporation acted as the sole member of these corporations 
in september,catholic healthcare west reorganized the corporate structure and management of the health care system.hospital corporation,then named catholic healthcare west central california,merged with catholic healthcare west north state,another subsidiary of catholic healthcare west.the merger documents described hospital corporation as the disappearing corporation and catholic healthcare west north state as the surviving corporation.shortly after the merger,the surviving corporation was renamed catholic healthcare west ii.
in december,catholic healthcare west ii merged with its parent corporation,catholic healthcare west.catholic healthcare west ii was the surviving corporation and changed its name to catholic healthcare west.
as a result of these mergers and name changes,the entity now named catholic healthcare west is the corporation into which hospital corporation merged in.
pursuant to corporations code section catholic healthcare west succeeded to all the rights of hospital corporation and is subject to all of hospital corporation debts and liabilities.thus,insofar as california corporate law is concerned,catholic healthcare west is responsible for the workers compensation benefits owed to bonham and holds all of hospital corporation rights under policy no.rws issued by mission insurance company.
contentions of the parties and issue presented 
ciga contends that the trial court correctly determined that the corporate entity named catholic healthcare west could not make a covered claim because it was a person other than the original claimant under the insurance policy in his or her own name,subd.c b.ciga also contends that baxter,supra,th,d supports the conclusion that catholic healthcare west,as the surviving corporation of the mergers,is a separate legal entity and can not be regarded as mercy hospital bakersfield,a named insured.
catholic healthcare west contends that the mergers should not bar it from asserting a claim because,among other things,it is still operating mercy hospital bakersfield at the same location where bonham was injured,it is the entity liable to bonham on her workers compensation claim,and it is the entity that emerged from an internal corporate restructuring and is not a completely new corporate entity like the entities whose claims were rejected in baxter.
the parties contentions frame the following issue is catholic healthcare west the original claimant under the insurance policy in his or her own name for purposes of section,subdivision c b as a result of the corporate reorganization 
in baxter,two affiliated corporations,baxter healthcare corporation bhc and baxter international,bii sued ciga seeking a judicial declaration that certain product liability claims against them should be covered by ciga.baxter,supra,th at,d.ciga filed a motion for summary judgment contending the claims of bhc and bii were not covered claim because the corporations were not the original
