introduction 
plaintiff and appellant montgomery sansome lp plaintiff,a limited partnership,appeals after the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants and respondents zhian rezai and jacklyn rezai individually and as trustees of the zhian rezai and jacklyn jordan rezai revocable trust collectively,defendants on plaintiff complaint seeking payment for repair work performed at a building owned by defendants.the trial court ruled that,under business and professions code section plaintiff could not recover from defendants because the business entity that contracted with defendants was montgomery sansome.lp,a general partnership that did not have a contractor license.in two appeals,which we consolidated pursuant to the parties stipulation,plaintiff challenges the judgment and a subsequent order denying a new trial no,and the court award of attorney fees to defendants no.because we conclude summary judgment was erroneously granted,we reverse the judgment and the fee award.
ii.factual and procedural background 
a.the montgomery sansome business filings 
on july,leonard nordeman filed a certificate of limited partnership for montgomery sansome,lp with the california secretary of state.the certificate names nordeman as a general partner.the certificate lists the limited partnership office address as prairie creek drive in pacifica.in,an amendment added catherine diane magee and deborah fico as general partners.
on october,the contractors state license board cslb issued license number to montgomery sansome ltd.the license application states that this entity is a partnership,and lists nordeman as a general partner and magee and fico as limited partners.the application lists nordeman as the qualifying individual for the limited partnership.the application lists as the partnership business address the same pacifica address that was listed on the certificate of limited partnership discussed above.a renewal application filed in also lists montgomery sansome ltd as the licensed entity it identifies nordeman as the qualifying partner and magee and fico as limited partners.the renewal application lists the partnership address as adrian road in millbrae.a may printout of a cslb record identifies the licensed entity as montgomery sansome lp,and lists the same millbrae address.the parties agree that the entity holding license number was and is a limited partnership.
on february,nordeman,magee and fico filed a fictitious business name statement fbn statement in san mateo county,listing the fictitious business name montgomery sansome,the fbn statement states this business is conducted by general partnership.the statement lists the same millbrae business address as used for the limited partnership in the more recent cslb records.the fbn statement,although filed in,states the registrant commenced to transact business under the fbn or names on.as noted above,october,is the same date on which the cslb issued license number to montgomery sansome ltd the certificate of limited partnership for montgomery sansome,lp was also issued in.nordeman signed the fbn statement and declared all information in it to be true.
b.the contract 
on february,defendants hired montgomery sansome.lp.to perform repairs at an apartment building they owned the property.on that date,and again on march,the parties executed work orders collectively,the contract with the name montgomery sansome.lp.printed at the top.the work orders list contractor license number and the adrian road address in millbrae.each work order includes an attorney fee provision stating in the event of legal action to enforce any of the terms of this agreement,owner agrees to pay all costs incurred by montgomery sansome involved in the legal process,including reasonable attorney fees,process serving costs,any and all testimony for which montgomery sansome may be required to pay.
in april,defendants terminated the contract.prior to doing so,they made payments totaling.
c.the complaints against defendants 
in july,montgomery sansome.recorded a mechanic lien against the property.in august,nordeman filed an action the nordeman action to foreclose the mechanic lien and for other relief,alleging defendants had failed to pay owed for work performed at the property.the complaint stated it was filed by leonard nordeman,individually and montgomery sansome,lp.the complaint alleged that montgomery sansome,lp.is a limited partnership.the complaint asserted causes of action for breach of contract,foreclosure of mechanic lien,common counts and fraud.on june,nordeman voluntarily dismissed the action without prejudice montgomery sansome.subsequently released the mechanic lien.
also on june,plaintiff montgomery sansome lp filed the complaint in this action.the complaint like the one in the nordeman action alleges that defendants failed to pay for work performed at the property.plaintiff complaint asserts the same causes of action as the nordeman complaint breach of contract,foreclosure of mechanic lien,common counts and fraud,and adds a cause of action for imposition of constructive trust 
defendants motion for summary judgment 
defendants moved for summary judgment,arguing that plaintiff montgomery sansome lp was not the real party in interest and lacked standing to sue,because it was not a party to the contract.defendants also contended that section,which precludes compensation for unlicensed contracting work,barred plaintiff claims.
in support of the motion,defendants submitted a declaration of zhian rezai,attaching the work orders and related documents.defendants also submitted an attorney declaration attaching the montgomery sansome business filings discussed above,including a certified copy of the certificate of limited partnership for montgomery sansome,lp,certified copies of cslb records,showing issuance of license number to montgomery sansome ltd as well as an uncertified document showing montgomery sansome lp as the licensee,and a certified copy of the fbn statement for montgomery sansome,
in opposition,plaintiff contended that it held a valid contractor license,and that differences in the names used on various documents were not significant.plaintiff submitted a declaration from its attorney,attaching documents that he stated had been obtained from the cslb,pertaining to license number,and documents that he stated had been obtained from the california secretary of state,pertaining to the limited partnership.plaintiff did not submit any other evidence or declarations.plaintiff submitted no evidence contradicting the information in the fbn statement for montgomery sansome,
defendants objected,on grounds of hearsay and lack of proper authentication and foundation,to most of the substantive portions of plaintiff attorney declaration,and to all the attached exhibits.the court sustained the objections and excluded the evidence.
after hearing argument,the trial court granted defendants summary judgment motion pursuant to section.the court stated that the undisputed evidence showed montgomery sansome.lp was the party that entered into the contracts montgomery sansome.lp through nordeman filed a fictitious business name statement with the san mateo county clerk the fictitious business name statement lists montgomery sansome.lp as a general partnership montgomery sansome.lp recorded the mechanics lien and montgomery sansome.lp never had a contractors license.
the court entered judgment for defendants.the court later amended the judgment to add an award of costs to defendants.
plaintiff motion for new trial 
plaintiff moved for a new trial,arguing that nordeman was operating a single business entity that held a valid contractor license.plaintiff submitted a declaration from nordeman,purporting to authenticate two of the exhibits the court had excluded when ruling on summary judgment.defendants objected to nordeman declaration as untimely.after hearing argument,the court sustained defendants evidentiary objections and denied the new trial motion.
plaintiff appealed the judgment and the new trial order.
defendants motion for attorney fees 
defendants filed a motion for attorney fees,based on the fee provision in the contract and civil code section defendants requested a total of in fees,which included incurred in defending the nordeman action.after hearing argument,the court awarded fees in the amount requested by defendants.
plaintiff appealed the fee award.
iii.discussion 
summary.standard of review 
the standard of review for an order granting or denying summary judgment is de novo.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,aguilar.similarly,to the extent a subsequent order denying a new trial relies on the resolution of a question of law,including the nonexistence of triable issues of fact,we examine the matter de novo.wall street network,new york times th,d.the trial court stated reasons for granting summary relief are not binding on the reviewing court,which reviews the trial court ruling,not its rationale.kids universe th,d.
a party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.aguilar,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.there is a triable issue of material fact if,and only if,the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof,fn.omitted.a defendant bears the burden of persuasion that one or more elements of the cause of action in question can not be established,or that there is a complete defense thereto.citation.ibid.
generally,the party moving for summary judgment bears an initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact if he carries his burden of production,he causes a shift,and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden of production of his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact a prima facie showing is one that is sufficient to support the position of the party in question.citation.aguilar,supra,cal th at,d.if the moving party does not meet its initial burden of production,the opposing party has no burden to produce evidence of its own.consumer cause,smilecare th,d.
on appeal,in determining whether the parties have met their respective burdens,we consider all of the evidence the parties offered in connection with the motion except that which the court properly excluded and the uncontradicted inferences the evidence reasonably supports.merrill navegar,cal th,d.we view the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff as the party opposing summary judgment,strictly scrutinizing defendants evidence in order to resolve any evidentiary doubts or ambiguities in plaintiff favor.johnson american standard,cal th,d.
the statutory framework 
section,subdivision a section a,a provision of the contractors state license law csll et,generally prohibits unlicensed contractors from recovering compensation for performance of work requiring a license.section a states except as provided in subdivision e,no person engaged in the business or acting in the capacity of a contractor,may bring or maintain any action,or recover in law or equity in any action,in any court of this state for the collection of compensation for the performance of any act or contract where a license is required by this chapter without alleging that he or she was a duly licensed contractor at all times during the performance of that act or contract,regardless of the merits of the cause of action brought by the person if licensure is controverted,the plaintiff must prove,by producing a verified certificate of licensure from the cslb,that it held all necessary licenses during performance of the work,subd.d.
the purpose of the licensing law is to protect the public from incompetence and dishonesty in those who provide building and construction services.citation.the licensing requirements provide minimal assurance that all persons offering such services in california have the requisite skill and character,understand applicable local laws and codes,and know the rudiments of administering a contracting business.citations.section advances this purpose by withholding judicial aid from those who seek compensation for unlicensed contract work.the obvious statutory intent is to discourage persons who have failed to comply with the licensing law from offering or providing their unlicensed services for pay.hydrotech systems,oasis waterpark cal d,hydrotech.
because of the strength and clarity of this policy citation,the bar of section a applies r egardless of the equities.citation.indeed,it has long been settled that the courts may not resort to equitable considerations in defiance of section.citation.section represents a legislative determination that the importance of deterring unlicensed persons from engaging in the contracting business outweighs any harshness between the parties,and that such deterrence can best be realized by denying violators the right to maintain any action for compensation in the courts of this state.citation.citation.mw erectors,niederhauser ornamental and metal works,cal th,d.
california courts previously applied a judicial doctrine of substantial compliance,under which a contractor was not barred from a just recovery if his licensure was defective only in form and the defendant had received the full measure of protection intended by the legislature.hydrotech,supra,cal d at,see asdourian araj cal d,pacific custom pools,turner construction.th,d.the legislature has since amended section to narrow the doctrine of substantial compliance.section,subdivision e,provides that t he judicial doctrine of substantial compliance shall not apply under this section where the person who engaged in the business or acted in the capacity of a contractor has never been a duly licensed contractor in this state.a contractor that was licensed prior to performance of the act or contract in question may,however,show substantial compliance in specified circumstances see wss industrial construction,great west contractors,th,d wss pacific custom pools,turner construction,supra,th at,d.
defendants are not entitled to summary judgment 
in granting summary judgment,the trial court held that section applied because the entity that contracted with defendants montgomery sansome.lp did not have a contractor license.we conclude that triable issues of material fact exist as to whether the contracting entity was a separate entity from the licensed montgomery sansome entity,and that the trial court therefore erred by granting summary judgment.
a.the parties contentions and applicable case law 
defendants contend that montgomery sansome.lp is a general partnership and a separate legal entity from the limited partnership that held cslb license number referred to in cslb records as montgomery sansome ltd and montgomery sansome lp.the cases cited by the trial court in its summary judgment order opp paul fire marine ins.th,d opp,and wss,supra,th,d which defendants also cite in their brief establish that,under section a,if an individual or entity without a required license is engaged in the business or acting in the capacity of a contractor,a license held by a different individual or entity does not permit the unlicensed contractor to recover.
in opp,an individual opp held a contractor license.opp,supra,th at,d.opp was also the president of a corporation,mci,that did not hold a license.ibid.opp,as president of mci,entered a subcontract and inserted his individual contractor license number where the contract documents called for a license number.id.at,d.when mci later sued for compensation under the subcontract,the trial court entered summary judgment for the defendant insurer,and the appellate court affirmed.id.at,d.the court held that mci was the contracting party and was unlicensed,and that mci claim therefore was barred by section.id.at,d.the court rejected opp argument that he should be permitted to recover because he did the work on the construction project the court held that,under section,t he issue is not who did the work,but who was engaged in the business or acting in the capacity of a contractor.id.at,d.the court also rejected opp claim that the use of his individual contractor license number on the contract documents could support a finding that he was a party to the contract.id.at,d.the court held that it would render ineffective the contractor license requirement and encourage fraud if insertion of the license number of one who is not the contractor permitted a suit that otherwise was barred by section.ibid.
similarly,in wss,the appellate court held that,under section,a corporation could not recover under a subcontract because it performed a portion of the work before it obtained a license.wss,supra,th at,d.it was irrelevant that the corporation president and a wss partnership had held valid licenses.id.at fn,d.the unlicensed corporation was the entity that entered the subcontract and was thus the person engaging in the business or acting in the capacity of a contractor.id.at,d.
plaintiff argues that the above cases do not apply because there is a single montgomery sansome business entity,and the slightly different names used in different documents are just trivial variations on the name for that single entity.plaintiff relies on ball steadfast blk th,d ball,which was decided after the trial court ruled in this case.in ball,an individual ball received a license from the cslb as a sole owner,an individual owner,under the fictitious business name clark heating and air conditioning.ball,supra,th at,d,citing.ball later entered into contracts under the transposed business name clark air conditioning heating.id.at,d.when ball sued in his own name to foreclose a mechanic lien arising from alleged nonpayment under the contracts,the trial court sustained a demurrer without leave to amend,holding that ball was not licensed as a contractor to do business under the name of clark air conditioning heating.id.at,d.
the appellate court reversed,holding that the trial court had confused the individual owner to whom the contractor license was issued with the name under which the individual conducted his contracting business.ball,supra,th at,d.as a sole proprietorship,clark heating and air conditioning was not a legal entity separate from its individual owner ball,and was not among the categories of persons defined by the csll to whom a contractor license may issue.id.at,d.although the name clark heating and air conditioning appeared on the license,ball was the licensee as the owner of clark heating and air conditioning.ibid.similarly,when ball later entered into contracts using the fictitious business name clark air conditioning heating,ball was the contracting party clark air conditioning heating like clark heating and air conditioning was legally indistinguishable from ball.ibid.because ball was the contracting party and was licensed,section did not bar his claim.id.at,d.the ball court distinguished opp,stating here,unlike the plaintiff in opp,ball entered the contracts on behalf of his sole proprietorship,not on behalf of a separate legal entity that could,and should,have obtained its own license.ball,supra,th at,d.
in accord with the result in ball is handyman connection of sacramento,sands th,d,in which a corporation that held a contractor license entered a contract under the shortened name handyman connection,rather than the full name set forth on its license,handyman connection of sacramento,the appellate court held that,for purposes of disciplinary action under section,the licensed entity use of a shortened name was a mere technicality that did not amount to a violation.ibid.
under the above cases,a critical issue in determining whether section bars plaintiff claims is whether the montgomery sansome entity that contracted with defendants is a general partnership and a separate legal entity from the licensed limited partnership.if it is,then,under opp and wss,any claims for compensation it had would be barred by section it is not relevant that a montgomery sansome limited partnership held a license or that the limited partnership license number appeared on the contract.see opp,supra,th at,d wss,supra,th at,fn,d.moreover,the limited partnership could not recover,because it is not the contracting party opp,supra,th at,d.on the other hand,if the entity that contracted with defendants is the same entity that held a license,then,under ball,the use of slightly different names for that entity on different documents montgomery sansome lp,montgomery sansome ltd,montgomery sansome.lp would not bar its recovery under section see ball,supra,th at,d.
accordingly,we next consider the evidence submitted in the trial court on the question of whether there are multiple montgomery sansome entities.in doing so,as noted above,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff as the party opposing summary judgment,strictly scrutinizing defendants evidence in order to resolve any evidentiary doubts or ambiguities in plaintiff favor.johnson american standard,supra,cal th at,d.
b.the evidentiary record 
in seeking to meet their initial burden of production on the question of whether there are multiple montgomery sansome entities,defendants submitted evidence records from the cslb and the secretary of state showing that the licensed entity was a limited partnership referred to in those records as montgomery sansome ltd or montgomery sansome lp.in support of their contention that the contracting entity referred to in the contract as montgomery sansome.lp was a general partnership and a separate entity,defendants rely solely on the fbn statement filed in february.as noted above,the fbn statement lists the fictitious business name montgomery sansome.lp,and states this business is conducted by general partnership.defendants submitted no other evidence such as a partnership agreement or other partnership records showing the existence of a montgomery sansome general partnership.we thus turn to the evidentiary significance of the fbn statement.
we note initially that the use of a fictitious business name or the filing of an fbn statement does not itself create a separate entity.see ball,supra,th at,d pinkerton,superior court th,d see in re marriage of geraci th,d fbn statement filed by husband stating he was doing business as a general partnership with wife did not show partnership was ever formed,where wife had no knowledge of alleged partnership.however,under section,a certified copy of an fbn statement such as the one submitted in this case raises a rebuttable presumption of the truth of the information required to be included in it,including the name and form of the business.section,subdivision c,states that a certified copy of an fbn statement establishes a rebuttable presumption of all of the following the existence of the original statement.the execution of the statement by the person by whom it purports to have been executed.the truth of the information required by section that is contained in the statement.in turn,section requires that an fbn statement include the fictitious business name,the business address,the names of the registrants,the names of individual registrants,or the names of the general partners of a registrant that is a general or limited partnership,the form of the business such as individual,general partnership,limited partnership,or corporation,and the date on which the registrant began transacting business under the fictitious business name,subd.b.
the fbn statement in this case includes the information required by section,including the fictitious business name montgomery sansome.lp and the form of the business general partnership.accordingly,under section,subdivision c,the certified copy of the fbn statement submitted by defendants raised a rebuttable presumption of the truth of that information,subd.c.section,subdivision d,specifies that t he presumptions established by section,subdivision c,are presumptions affecting the burden of producing evidence.as the law revision commission comment following section notes,evidence code section defines the scope of this type of presumption.see cal.law revision com,west ann.bus.ed.foll.evidence code section states the effect of a presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence is to require the trier of fact to assume the existence of the presumed fa
