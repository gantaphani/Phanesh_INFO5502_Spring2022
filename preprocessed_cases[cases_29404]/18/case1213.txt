appellants yang rong,rhea yeung and the broadsino finance company,a limited company controlled by yang rong and incorporated in hong kong,appeal the district court dismissal of their complaint brought under the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia or act,et,against liaoning province province,a subdivision of china,for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.on appeal yang rong a chinese national and permanent resident of the united states,and his fellow appellants argue that the district court erroneously found that the province challenged act was insulated from suit by sovereign immunity.he claims jurisdiction exists under the commercial activity exception set out in section a of fsia,which provides that an action does lie against a foreign state if it is based upon an act outside the territory of the united states in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere and that act causes a direct effect in the united states.id.a.we conclude that the commercial activity exception is inapplicable to the province act and that instead its action was quintessentially sovereign.accordingly,we affirm the district court dismissal of the complaint.
in rong and the municipality of shen yang,a city in the liaoning province in northeast china,entered into a joint venture for automobile production the principal partners in the venture,called shen yang jin bei passenger vehicle manufacturing company,shen yang automotive,were the broadsino finance company broadsino,a hong company wholly owned by yang rong,and jin bei automotive shareholding company,jin bei shareholding,a corporation owned by the shen yang municipal government.at the venture inception jin bei shareholding owned per cent of shen yang automotive,broadsino owned per cent and another partner,hainen huayin international trust investment company hainen,owned per cent.broadsino subsequently acquired hainen shares to effect a ownership split in shen yang automotive,that is,jin bei shareholding had per cent ownership and broadsino had per cent ownership.compl,reprinted in joint appendix ja.
to expand the venture through access to american capital the partners sought to list shen yang automotive on the new york stock exchange.yang rong,who served as shen yang automotive chief executive and manager,incorporated brilliance holdings limited brilliance holdings in bermuda as the financing vehicle to obtain a listing on the nyse and transferred his per cent ownership interest to brilliance holdings.jin bei shareholding also transferred per cent of its interest in shen yang automotive to brilliance holdings,thereby giving the company a per cent interest in shen yang automotive.in return for transferring per cent of its interest,jin bei shareholding received per cent of brilliance holdings stock,thereby reducing rong interest in brilliance holdings to the remaining per cent of its stock.compl,ja.in registering the stock with the securities and exchange commission sec,preparing the initial public offering in the united states and listing the stock on the nyse,senior chinese government officials informed rong that a chinese entity rather than a hong kong private company should be the majority shareholder of the listed company inasmuch as the registration and listing would be the first for a company in years.rong understood that the chinese authorities would be satisfied if the majority interest in the listed company was held in the name of a chinese organization ngo.am.compl,ja.consequently in may,broadsino,the people bank of china and other chinese governmental entities created the chinese financial educational development foundation foundation,an ngo.shang ming,the deputy governor of the people bank of china ming,served as the foundation chairman while rong served as vice chairman.
in september,broadsino transferred its brilliance holdings stock to the foundation.eventually,rong and ming agreed that the foundation would hold the shares in trust for broadsino,in effect acting as the nominee for broadsino,and that rong was to have sole authority to manage,control and administer the foundation equity interest in brilliance holdings.am.compl,ja.the transferred brilliance holdings shares were held in the foundation name.as a result of this arrangement,as well as the sale of per cent of brilliance holdings shares in october,the foundation held per cent of the brilliance holdings shares and jin bei shareholding held per cent.am.compl,ja.at rong direction,broadsino paid the costs to register and list the brilliance holdings stock and paid various administrative fees to the foundation.he also managed and directed brilliance holdings primary holding,shen yang automotive,arranging with toyota and general motors to manufacture automobiles for those companies.all of shen yang automotive manufacturing facilities were located in liaoning province.
meanwhile,in early the province formed a working committee,headed by the assistant to the governor of the province.in march the working committee declared that all equity interests held in the name of the foundation,including rong interest in brilliance holdings,were state assets and demanded that he transfer them to the province.compl,ja.after rong refused,the working committee informed rong and the brilliance holdings board of directors that the foundation no longer recognized broadsino beneficial interest in brilliance holdings.at the direction of the province,the brilliance holdings board dismissed rong as president,ceo and director and placed working committee members in those positions and other management positions.in october the newly installed brilliance holdings board ceased paying rong a salary,dismissed him as a director the next month and terminated his contract.the province also formed huachen automotive group holdings company limited huachen and appointed province officials as officers of the new company.approximately two months later huachen purchased the brilliance holdings shares nominally held by the foundation in trust for broadsino for million,about six per cent of market price.huachen and the brilliance holdings board also made a tender offer for the remaining brilliance holdings shares,including those traded on the nyse,resulting in the suspension of trading of brilliance holdings shares on the nyse from december to december.compl,ja.
as the working committee was executing the takeover,rong,acting for broadsino,sought relief in various courts broadsino initiated proceedings against the foundation in the beijing municipal high court seeking a determination of its interest in the assets nominally held by the foundation,including the brilliance holdings stock the foundation held in trust,but was rebuffed.am.compl,ja.rong also filed a complaint against the province in the district of columbia district court,challenging the province implementation of the scheme to take plaintiffs shares,other equity interests,and other property and then to maintain control thereof for its own commercial benefit under fsia.am.compl,ja.the province moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,asserting that neither fsia commercial activity exception,a,nor its expropriation exception,id.a,applied ja.the district court agreed,holding that the province acquisition of the brilliance holdings shares was a sovereign act and the province was therefore immune from suit.it dismissed the action under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.yang rong et liaoning provincial gov t,d.this appeal followed,in which rong challenges the district court rejection of the commercial activity exception

fsia commercial activity exception provides that a foreign state is not immune from suit in a court if its challenged act is based upon a commercial activity carried on in the united states by the foreign state or upon an act performed in the united states in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere or upon an act outside the territory of the united states in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere and that act causes a direct effect in the united states.a.in determining whether the commercial activity exception applies,the court looks to the character of the foreign state exercise of power rather than its effects.see saudi arabia nelson,d foreign state engages in commercial activity if it exercises only those powers that can also be exercised by private citizens as opposed to those powers peculiar to sovereigns quotations omitted republic of argentina weltover,d sovereign engages in commercial activity if it acts not as a regulator of a market,but in the manner of a private player within it issue is whether the particular actions that the foreign state performs whatever the motive behind them are the type of actions by which a party engages in trade and traffic or commerce emphasis in original quotations omitted.
here rong claims that the province implementation of the scheme to take plaintiff shares,other equity interests,and other property and then to maintain control thereof for its own commercial benefit,am.compl,ja,was commercial activity under the third clause of a,that is,an act outside the territory of the united states in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere and that act causes a direct effect in the united states.in weltover,the united states supreme court declared that the analysis of the third clause of section a proceeds in three parts the lawsuit must be based upon an act that took place outside the territory of the united states the act must have been taken in connection with a commercial activity,and the act must have caused a direct effect in the united states.weltover,at.here there is no dispute that the act took place outside the.the questions in dispute are whether the province act was done in connection with a commercial activity in china,and if so,whether it caused a direct effect in the united states.because we answer the first question in the negative,we do not reach the second.
in weltover,the argentine government had issued bonds,or bonods,which provided for repayment in dollars and permitted the bondholder to specify one of four cities,including new york city,as the location where payment was to be made on the date the bonds matured.when the maturity date arrived,argentina was unable to meet its obligations and attempted to reschedule the payments unilaterally.several bondholders balked,demanding full payment in dollars and naming new york city as the place of payment.when argentina failed to make the payments,the bondholders sued,asserting subject matter jurisdiction under the commercial activity exception of section a of fsia.the supreme court agreed with the bondholders,concluding that argentina issuance of a debt instrument was indistinguishable from the actions of a private party engaged in commerce.in issuing the bonods argentina was participating in the market as a private actor,not as a sovereign.because that act underlay the bondholders claims and the nonpayment of bonds to be paid in new york city had a direct effect in the united states,the third clause of section a applied and argentina could be sued in federal court under fsia.weltover,at.
the parties here do not agree on the conduct of the province that forms the basis of rong suit.rong focuses on the province activities in shen yang city initial participation in the shen yang automotive joint venture,the working committee establishment of huachen,the transfer of brilliance holdings shares from the foundation to huachen and huachen tender offer for the outstanding publicly traded brilliance holdings claims they are the acts of a private player participating in the marketplace.the province,on the other hand,focuses on rong allegation that his property was wrongfully taken by the liaoning provincial government the province asserts rong accuses it of expropriating broadsino equity interest in brilliance holdings and expropriation is a quintessential governmental act.appellee br.citing am.compl,ja.according to the province,any act it committed after it gained control of the foundation and the brilliance holdings the transfer of those shares to to the ultimate disposition of the already expropriated assets those acts,the province continues,can not transform the initial expropriation into commercial activity.id.rong contends that the working committee was formed to take over brilliance holdings through the foundation that act,maintains the province,forms the basis of the complaint and is one that can be performed only by a state as sovereign.
it may be true that in some respects the working committee takeover of the foundation and its ownership of the brilliance holdings shares seem example,removing yang rong from the brilliance holdings board and placing working committee officials in those same positions.but all of these acts flow from the working committee state assets act that can be taken only by a sovereign.rong is correct that this case has some similarity to,supra,where we found the republic of iran takeover of a dairy business commercial,in part because there was no indication that iran nationalized pak dairy by taking it over through a process of law,no formal declaration by the government of iran that a takeover was to occur and no statutory restrictions or governmental decrees or directives referring to the takeover,at.in,however,the plaintiff and various instrumentalities of iran entered into a formal contract for an venture the commercial activity there was the sovereign instrumentalities use of their majority position to lock the appellee out of the management of the dairy and to deny the appellee its share of the company earnings.id.at.we affirmed the district court conclusion that those allegations sound ed in the nature of a corporate dispute between majority and minority shareholders allegations of breach of contract and of the directors duty of care,with the only distinction being that the majority shares were held by the iranian government and its subsidiaries rather than by a private party.id.at.here,by contrast,there was no contractual relationship between yang rong and the province regarding the foundation.the province did not assume control over brilliance holdings by purchasing the majority of brilliance holdings stock from broadsino,as a private party would instead,it declared the brilliance holdings shares held by the foundation to be state assets and claimed them as does a sovereign.a private party in the market could not have done what the province did a committee whose goal,as rong complaint describes it,was to assume and exercise control over the foundation and to acquire from it the brilliance holdings shares that it held in trust for broadsino by advis ing yang rong that all equity interests held in the name of the foundation were state assets and demand ing that they be transferred to the province.am.compl,ja.these acts,initiated by the assistant governor of the province and put into effect by the working committee,constituted a quintessentially s
