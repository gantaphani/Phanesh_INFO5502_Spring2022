statement of the facts and case 
on september,the florida department of health department issued an administrative complaint against shari daniels,alleging that she had violated section f,florida statutes daniels disputed the allegations in the department complaint and requested a formal administrative hearing.on march,the department referred the matter to the division of administrative hearings doah.on june,the department filed a notice of voluntary dismissal.consequently,an order was entered on july,closing the department file,canceling the scheduled final hearing,and closing the doah file.
on august,daniels filed a petition for attorney fees under the florida equal access to justice act feaja,section,florida statutes,seeking an award of attorney fees and costs.on august,the department filed a motion to dismiss daniels petition.daniels did not file a response to the department motion to dismiss,and on november,the administrative law judge entered an order granting the motion to dismiss with leave to file an amended petition on or before december.the motion to dismiss was granted because daniels failed to allege sufficient facts to support her argument that she was a small business party as defined in feaja.
on december,daniels filed an amended petition for attorney fees under feaja.in support of her assertion that she is a small business party,daniels stated that at the time the underlying action was initiated,her net worth including both personal and business investments did not exceed million and she did not employ more than employees she is the sole shareholder of south beach maternity associates,miami beach maternity center,a corporation she and south beach maternity are one and the same entity and the administrative action stemmed solely from her treatment of a patient of south beach maternity.on december,the department filed a motion to dismiss,and daniels filed a response to the motion.nonetheless,on january,the judge entered an order granting the motion to dismiss the amended petition for attorney fees and providing a date for the filing of the proposed final order.the administrative law judge granted the motion,finding that daniels had failed to allege sufficient facts to support her argument that she was a small business party within the definition of feaja.
in the final order,the administrative law judge,relying on florida real estate commission shealy,so d dca,stated that the action in the underlying case was brought against daniels individually and not her corporation.thus,he found that allowing her to seek feaja fees for acts which she allegedly committed in her individual capacity as if she were a corporation would ignore the corporate form.he also distinguished the instant case from the two cases upon which daniels relied,ann jan retirement villa and albert.lastly,he expressly noted that daniels was not operating as a professional service corporation.on appeal,the third district affirmed,finding that the administrative complaint was filed against daniels individually rather than against her corporation and that on this basis,the denial of feaja fees was proper.see daniels,so d at.we granted review based on certified conflict of decisions.
the key issue in this case is whether daniels,the sole owner of a corporation,qualifies as a small business party as defined in section,florida statutes,when suit is brought against her individually and not against the corporation.if she qualifies as a small business party,she is entitled to fees and costs under feaja.the question before us is a matter of statutory interpretation and is a question of law subject to de novo review.see state glatzmayer,so d.in construing a statute we are to give effect to the legislature intent.see state,so d.in attempting to discern legislative intent,we first look to the actual language used in the statute.joshua city of gainesville,so d,accord bellsouth,meeks,so d.when the statute is clear and unambiguous,courts will not look behind the statute plain language for legislative intent or resort to rules of statutory construction to ascertain intent.see lee county,jacobs,so d.in such instance,the statute plain and ordinary meaning must control,unless this leads to an unreasonable result or a result clearly contrary to legislative intent.see state burris,so d.when the statutory language is clear,courts have no occasion to resort to rules of must read the statute as written,for to do otherwise would constitute an abrogation of legislative power.nicoll baker,so d.because statutes providing for attorney fees are in abrogation of the common law,such statutes are to be strictly construed.see sarkis allstate ins,so d.
the statute at issue in this case,section,florida statutes,is clear and unambiguous.it provides in relevant part 
civil actions and administrative proceedings initiated by state agencies attorneys fees and costs.
this section may be cited as the florida equal access to justice act.
the legislature finds that certain persons may be deterred from seeking review of,or defending against,unreasonable governmental action because of the expense of civil actions and administrative proceedings.because of the greater resources of the state,the standard for an award of attorney fees and costs against the state should be different from the standard for an award against a private litigant.the purpose of this section is to diminish the deterrent effect of seeking review of,or defending against,governmental action by providing in certain situations an award of attorney fees and costs against the state.
