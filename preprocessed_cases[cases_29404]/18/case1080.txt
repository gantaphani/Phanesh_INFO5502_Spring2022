gospel missions of america gospel missions appeals from a summary judgment in favor of the city of los angeles city in an action stemming from the city attempt to enforce against gospel missions an amended version of its charitable solicitations law.gospel missions argues that the city is in contempt of an injunction against the city enforcement of certain provisions of the version of that law and that the threatened enforcement of new provisions in the law would violate gospel missions first amendment rights.
the district court had jurisdiction under,and a.we have jurisdiction under.we affirm in part and vacate and remand in part.
the city regulates charitable solicitations.see,municipal code.the current version of the los angeles charitable solicitation law ordinance requires all persons intending to solicit charitable contributions within the city to file an application with the los angeles police department.id.the police department then investigates the information provided and determines whether to issue an information card to the applicant.id.no one may solicit charitable contributions in the city without an information card.id.the city also imposes an additional set of requirements on professional fundraisers.id.professional fundraisers are those who solicit charitable contributions on behalf of others for gain.id.f.
gospel missions is a religious corporation that provides ministry and shelter to homeless individuals,who in turn solicit funds and share some of the proceeds with gospel missions.in,five of its properties were raided by the los angeles county sheriff department because the sheriff department believed gospel missions might be violating city and county charitable solicitation laws.
in response to the raid,gospel missions filed suit against the city and los angeles county county and included in its allegations constitutional challenges to the city and county charitable solicitation laws.the district court entered summary judgment in favor of gospel missions and enjoined the city and county from enforcing numerous provisions of their respective laws.see gospel missions of america bennett.gma i.
the city then amended the ordinance amended ordinance in an attempt to comply with the gma i injunction.gospel missions reluctantly complied with the amended ordinance requirement that it obtain an information card before soliciting.it then instituted this action gma ii with the expectation that its members would not be allowed to solicit funds upon the expiration of its information card in july of.
at a gma ii status conference,the district court gave gospel missions thirty days to file a summary judgment motion.after the city filed its response to the motion,the court sua sponte granted summary judgment in the city favor.on appeal,gospel missions argues that the district court sua sponte summary judgment for the city denied it a full opportunity to develop its claims that numerous provisions applying to professional fundraisers in the amended ordinance are either in contempt of the gma i injunction or unconstitutional that the district court failed to address gospel missions vagueness,overbreadth and equal protection arguments and that two of the fundraiser provisions in the amended b and section b are either in contempt of the gma i injunction or unconstitutional.we address each argument in turn.
even when there has been no for summary judgment,a district court may enter summary judgment sua sponte against a moving party if the losing party has had a full and fair opportunity to ventilate the issues involved.cool fuel,connett,cir.the salient issues upon which the district court granted summary judgment were presented in the original motion.a fair examination of the record discloses that gospel missions had a full and fair opportunity to ventilate the issues involved.therefore,the district court did not commit reversible error by acting sua sponte.
the district court determined that gospel missions does not have standing to challenge the amended ordinance professional fundraiser provisions.we review de novo the district court standing decision.tyler cuomo,cir.gospel missions argues that the district court is barred by claim and issue preclusion from determining that it does not have standing to challenge the professional fundraiser provisions because the district court in gma i already determined that gospel missions had standing to challenge them.
in migra warren city school district board of education,d,the supreme court described claim preclusion as the effect of a judgment in foreclosing litigation of a matter that has never been litigated,because of a determination that it should have been advanced in an earlier suit and issue preclusion as the effect of a judgment in foreclosing relitigation of a matter that has been litigated and decided.
our decisions on the subject of claim and issue preclusion have not been a model of clarity.compare frank united airlines,cir claim preclusion refers to claims that were raised or should have been raised in earlier litigation with ross alaska,cir claim preclusion refers only to claims that should have been raised in earlier litigation but were not.since migra is controlling,we will follow its formulation.
since gospel missions argues that the standing question has already been decided,its argument addresses issue preclusion.courts have characterized the issue preclusion doctrine in many different ways.see charles wright,arthur miller,edward cooper,federal practice procedure,wright miller.however,among the issue preclusion requirements are two that are particularly relevant to this case the issue must have been both actually litigated and necessarily decided in the former decision.united states weems,cir.
gospel missions standing to challenge the professional fundraiser provisions in gma i was not actually litigated in its ordinary sense.gospel missions did not challenge the professional fundraiser provisions in gma i until it submitted its supplemental trial brief and,even then,neither party raised the standing question.since the standing issue was not framed in the pleadings or contested by the parties in gma i,issue preclusion normally would not bar the district court standing decision.see james moore et,moore federal practice b c ed.moore,wright miller.however,this case is different because the district court necessarily had to resolve the issue to form the basis of its decision.the district court must necessarily have decided whether gospel missions had standing to challenge the ordinance professional fundraiser provisions,because if gospel missions had not had standing,then the district court would have lacked jurisdiction to issue the injunction prohibiting enforcement of the professional fundraiser provisions it found unconstitutional.this case is not unlike weems,in which we struggled with a similar issue.there,a prior forfeiture proceeding may have resulted in the litigation of the issue of whether there was a lack of knowledge of a marijuana growing operation.two forfeiture statutes were involved and only one would have resulted in preclusion.because the district court reached both statutory sections,we held the issue of knowledge precluded,although the actual section relied on for forfeiture did not have a knowledge requirement.weems,at.we believe weems controls.thus,we conclude that we are bound by the district court conclusion or,more properly,its unidentified position,that gospel missions had standing to challenge the professional fundraiser provisions in gma i.but this standing is limited,as far as issue preclusion is concerned,to the ordinance.thus,the issue of standing is precluded only to the extent that the professional fundraiser provisions in the amended ordinance are the subject of the gma i injunction.issue preclusion does not prevent us from determining whether gospel missions has standing to challenge those portions of the professional fundraiser provisions in the amended ordinance that do not run afoul of the gma i injunction.
we thus consider whether gospel missions has standing to challenge the professional fundraiser provisions of the amended ordinance to th
