this is a patent infringement action between companies that sell competing software products designed to track lost or stolen laptop computers,which one company refers to as lojack for laptops.each side asserted claims of patent infringement against the other based on their respective software products.following the parties for summary judgment,the district court entered summary judgment of for each side.see absolute software,stealth signal,d district court decision.both sides appeal from this judgment.specifically,absolute software,and absolute software corporation collectively,absolute challenge certain of the district court claim constructions and appeal from the district court grant of summary judgment of in favor of stealth signal,stealth signal and computer security products,csp collectively,stealth with respect to patent the patent the patent and the patent collectively,the absolute patents.stealth signal likewise challenges certain of the district court claim constructions and from the district court grant of summary judgment of in favor of absolute with respect to patent the patent.
for the reasons discussed below,we do not alter any of the claim constructions challenged on appeal.we also find that the district court correctly granted summary judgment of to absolute.we conclude,however,that issues of fact preclude granting summary judgment of to stealth.accordingly,we,and remand this matter for further proceedings.
background 
a.the absolute patents 
the absolute patents relate to a method,apparatus,and system for retrieving lost or stolen electronic devices such as laptop computers,personal digital assistants pdas,and cell phones,via a global network,such as the internet.the patents are respectively entitled apparatus and method for monitoring electronic devices via a global network patent method and apparatus to monitor and locate an electronic device using a secured intelligent agent via a global network patent and computer security monitoring apparatus and system patent.under the patent,for example,the invention requires a software program the agent that can be loaded onto an electronic device,such as a laptop computer.using a global network,the internet,the agent software program communicates information about the identity and location of the protected electronic device to a host system,which the host system uses to track the whereabouts of the device.
each of the asserted claims of the and patents requires a step of the agent providing said host system with one or more global network communication links used to enable transmission between said electronic devices and said host system,patent ll.patent ll.representative claim of the patent recites in this claim and the others below,the term at issue on appeal is emphasized 
a method for tracing an electronic device having an agent,said agent used for providing identifying indicia and location information for said electronic device to a host system,said electronic device to said host system through a global network,said method comprising the steps of 
loading said agent within said electronic device for initiating communication with said host system such that said agent evades detection 
automatically providing said host system with said identifying indicia through said global network for determining the identity of said electronic device and 
providing said host system with one or more of the global network communication links used to enable transmission between said electronic device and said host system,said communication links used for determining the location of said electronic device.
patent ll.this claim,therefore,requires that the agent,the software program loaded onto a laptop computer provide the host system with one or more global network communication links that the host system can use to track the location of the protected device.with respect to this limitation,the parties dispute whether a communication link can be a single internet protocol ip address or whether it must be a connection between two ip addresses,which by definition requires at least two ip addresses to identify the connection.as discussed below,the district court construed the term to require at least two ip addresses.
with respect to the final absolute patent,the patent,the only independent claim asserted is claim,which recites 
a computer security monitoring system,comprising 
a computer having visual and audible user interfaces 
a telecommunication interface operatively connected to the computer and 
agent means embedded in the computer for sending signals to the telecommunication interface including signals for contacting a host monitoring system without signaling the visual or audible user interface,and for providing the host monitoring system with identification indicia of the computer,whereby the host monitoring system could identify whether the computer has been reported lost based on the identifying indicia.
patent ll.the emphasized term requires that the agent contact the host without making a signal that a user can see or hear.according to the summary of the invention,this feature allows the agent to evade detection and resist possible attempts to disable it by an unauthorized user.id.ll.in other words,the invention requires that the agent send a signal without alerting an unauthorized user,such as a thief,thus preventing the user from becoming aware of the signal and attempting to obstruct it.
stealth patent 
the patent,which issued to inventor david baran on april,is entitled method and apparatus for the remote verification of the operation of electronic devices by standard transmission mediums.stealth obtained a license to this patent in response to absolute assertion of patent infringement.the patent generally describes an invention that remotely monitors electronic devices by imbedding in such devices an agent that makes surreptitious calls to a central monitoring site.the invention has two fundamental purposes to monitor the performance of an electronic device remotely,and to detect the misuse of software,such as when it is installed on multiple computers without a license.
four independent claims of the patent are at issue on appeal claims,and.claims and contain the term rate.representative claim recites 
a remote site performance monitoring system for inclusion in an electrical apparatus to monitor and collect performance data thereof during operation surreptitiously of a user of said electrical apparatus for transmitting said collected performance data to a central site means for comparing the received collected performance data with expected performance data for electrical apparatus of the type in which said remote site performance monitoring system has been added,said remote site system comprising 
transmission means for initiating,at a rate,the transmission of the message packet from the formatting means to the central site means of the system surreptitiously of a user of said electrical apparatus.
patent.emphasis added.this claim requires that the system have a transmission means for sending a message packet to a central site means,and the transmission must occur at a rate.the summary of the invention of the patent states that t he call initiation is preferentially triggered at a carefully controlled rate,perhaps once a week.id.ll.
finally,the last two claims at issue on appeal,claims and of the patent,contain the terms unique usage agreement information and said terms of said usage agreement imbedded in said software.claim recites 
a method for monitoring software usage of proprietary software residing in at least one remote computer surreptitiously of a user of said remote computer to detect violations of software usage agreements surreptitiously of a user of said remote computer at a central site means,said method comprising the steps of 
imbedding unique usage agreement information that is transparent to the user in each original copy of said proprietary software 
each of said at least one remote computers monitoring the use of said software of step sur reptitiously of a user of said remote computer 
each of said at least one remote computers automatically,at various times,reporting said terms of said usage agreement imbedded in said software and the use of said software by said re mote computer monitored in step to said central site means surreptitiously of a user of said remote computer 
patent ll emphasis added.this claim requires the remote computer to send certain usage agreement information to a central site,though the parties dispute whether that information can be just the serial number of a license agreement,or whether it must include the actual terms and provisions of the license agreement.
c.the parties accused products 
absolute and stealth sell competing software products for tracking lost or stolen laptop computers.stealth product is the xtool computer tracker xtool or xtool tracker.there are two important features of the xtool tracker as it relates to this appeal the agent,the software program of the xtool tracker sends message packets to the host that,when they arrive,contain both the ip address of the client computer and the ip address of the host,and it is undisputed that the agent furnishes at least the ip address of the client computer and to design around the contacting without signaling limitation of absolute patent,stealth added an audible signal that occurs at the end of every communication between the agent and the host,just before the connection ends.
absolute product is called computrace.importantly for this appeal,it is undisputed that the computrace product is designed to initiate a call to the monitoring center hours following the completion of its previous call.it is also undisputed that absolute computrace product transmits an electronic serial number relating to a licensing or usage agreement to the host monitoring center but does not transmit the actual terms of the licensing or usage agreement.
litigation and claim construction 
in october,absolute filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of washington alleging that stealth infringed the three absolute patents identified above,as well as other patents that are not at issue on appeal.stealth signal counterclaimed for infringement of the patent and for declarations of,invalidity,and unenforceability relating to the absolute patents stealth successfully moved to transfer the action to the united states district court for the southern district of texas,where the case proceeded to final judgment.
for purposes of claim construction,the district court appointed a special master,professor david johnson,associate professor of computer science and of electrical and computer engineering at rice university,pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.the special master conducted hearings on the parties claim construction arguments and,on february,issued a page report and recommendation on claim construction r r.
when it appointed the special master,the district court entered an order requiring the parties to file any objections to the special master recommended claim construction within twenty days of the r see absolute software,stealth signal,case cv,order vacating hearing and appointing special master,ecf.on february,absolute and stealth submitted their respective objections to the special master claim construction.while stealth objected to several aspects of the special master report,in its objections,absolute commend ed the special master on an extraordinarily thorough and thoughtful analysis of the claim construction issues,and objected to only two portions of the report,neither of which relate to this appeal the construction of the term automatically from the absolute patents and a narrow legal issue relating to the construction of a claim.joint appendix ja.
following the parties objections,the special master issued an amendment to the report and recommendation on claim construction,which amended the claim constructions for three terms,only one of which is at issue on appeal rate.on june,the district court adopted the special master r r as modified by the amendment to the report.the specific claim constructions relevant to this appeal are discussed where appropriate below.
e.the district court summary judgment decision 
the district court allowed each party to file one for summary judgment,not to exceed pages.following the parties,the district court granted summary judgment of for both parties on their respective patent infringement claims.
as it relates to absolute infringement claims,the district court held that stealth xtool tracker did not meet the providing said host system with one or more of the global network communication links limitation of the and patents,finding that absolute failed to demonstrate that the xtool agent sends a link,two ip addresses to the host.see district court decision,at.the district court also held that stealth did not infringe the patent,the asserted claims for which contain the contacting without signaling limitation,because the xtool tracker emits an audible signal at the end of every communication with the host.id.at.
with respect to stealth infringement claim,the district court found that neither the rate limitation nor the terms of said usage agreement limitation reads onto absolute computrace software.as for the rate limitation,the court found that absolute did not literally infringe the patent because the computrace product formula places a call every hours after the end of the previous call and,thus,does not meet the randomness requirement.id.at.it also found that absolute did not infringe under the doctrine of equivalents because the rate limitation of the patent and absolute formula perform different functions.id.at.finally,the district court found that absolute did not meet the terms of said usage agreement limitation because its software sends only a serial number of a license to a monitoring center,but the claim,as construed,requires the agent to send actual licensing terms.id.
accordingly,the district court entered summary judgment of for both absolute and stealth the parties filed timely notices of appeal.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to a.

discussion 
absolute appeal 
absolute raises three issues on appeal,arguing that the district court claim construction of the term global network communication links is erroneous genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment of of the and patents and genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment of of the patent.although we find that absolute waived its right to challenge the district court claim construction by failing to file timely objections to the special master r r,we agree that summary judgment of as to all three absolute patents was improper.we address each issue in turn below.
construction of global network communication links 
in his february,report,the special master construed the term global network communication links as the identification of one or more perhaps less than all of the connections either direct or indirect between two nodes in the internet one of the nodes may be the electronic device itself used to enable data transmission between said electronic device and said host system.ja.the construction therefore defines communication links as the connections between two nodes in the internet rather than as the nodes,or ip addresses of routers,themselves.
on february,absolute filed timely objections to the special master report,but it challenged only two portions of the report,neither of which related to the special master recommended construction of global network communication links.ja.on the same date,stealth also filed objections,including to the special master construction of global network communication links.stealth argued that links should mean ip routers,a position consistent with its proposed construction.ja.the special master ultimately amended its construction of three terms but left the construction of communication links unchanged.the district court adopted the special master amended r 
on appeal,stealth argues that absolute waived its right to challenge the district court construction of global network communication links by failing to object to the special master recommended construction within the deadline established both by rule and by court order.there is no dispute that absolute failed to challenge the special master proposed recommendation within the period.indeed,absolute counsel conceded this fact at oral argument.see oral arg.at,available at http that absolutely right,we did not raise that objection within the time period,and that was a mistake on our part.
despite acknowledging that its objection was untimely,absolute asserts that we should not find waiver because its argument was presented to the district court in the sense that absolute offered its position prior to the special master report on claim construction.we do not find absolute argument persuasive.a primary purpose of appointing a special master is to narrow the issues before the district court judge to facilitate an efficient and timely resolution of complex or issues,such as patent claim construction.see.comm.notes amendments the court responsibility to interpret patent claims,for example,may be greatly assisted by appointing a master who has expert knowledge of the field in which the patent operates the advantages of initial determination by a master may make the process more effective and timely than disposition by the judge acting alone.both rule f of the federal rules of civil procedure and the district court order expressly included a mechanism for parties to file objections and a time limit to do so.it is through these objections that the district court can determine which issues remain in dispute and require the court attention.accepting absolute argument that its challenge to the special master claim construction was presented to the district court simply because it was argued to the special master would eviscerate the very purpose of this procedure.
although it is true that stealth timely objected to the construction of global network communication links,that is irrelevant because it is absolute,not stealth,that seeks to raise this issue on appeal stealth objection to the special master construction differed from that now urged by absolute.indeed,stealth contended that the proper construction should be ip router,which is materially different from the ip address construction absolute would have us now employ.see stealth principal and response br.stealth certainly did not agree that a communication link could be identified using an ip address of any single node,such as the client computer.emphasis in original.under these circumstances,we find that absolute failure to raise this particular objection,in the face of both rule f and a court order setting a specific deadline for the filing of objections,results in waiver of the argument on appeal.see sage,devon,a ppellate courts do not consider a party new theories,lodged first on appeal in short,this court does not review that which was not presented to the district court.see also interactive gift express,compuserve,citing sage for the same proposition.we recognize that this court retains discretion to deviate from the general rule of waiver in certain circumstances.see interactive gift,at.we decline to do so here,however,given the careful claim construction procedure the district court established in this case.in addition,we otherwise do not find that any of the reasons we have enumerated in the past for considering an argument that was not presented properly below are present in this case.see dynatech,allina,an appellate court will consider an issue not presented below only if i the issue involves a pure question of law and refusal to consider it would result in a miscarriage of justice ii the proper resolution is beyond any doubt iii the appellant had no opportunity to raise the objection at the district court level iv the issue presents significant questions of general impact or of great public concern or v the interest of substantial justice is at stake.internal quotations and brackets omitted.
summary judgment of of the and patents 
absolute argues that,even if we affirm the district court construction of global network communication links,summary judgment of is inappropriate because genuine issues of material fact remain as to whether stealth xtool tracker agent furnishes,supplies,or makes one or more connections between two nodes on the internet,two ip addresses to the host.the district court found that the xtool tracker agent furnishes only one ip address to the host and,therefore,does not infringe the and patents as a matter of law.because we conclude that there are genuine issues of fact as to whether the xtool tracker agent also provides a second ip address,and therefore a connection,we conclude that summary judgment of on this issue was improper.
under the district court claim construction,if the agent provides the ip addresses of both the agent and host,the agent will satisfy this limitation of the asserted and patent claims.the parties disputed whether the xtool agent provided two ip addresses,and both sides submitted expert declarations on this point.stealth contended in its briefing that its expert witness,stealth president pedro camargo,stated that the stealth agent provides only the ip address of the monitored device.stealth principal and response br.emphasis added.this is an overstatement of the expert declaration.camargo makes only a conclusory statement that stealth does not infringe absolute patents,adding that the stealth agent provides the ip address of the device and,an ip address is not a link,or a connection it is,instead,a node.decl.of pedro camargo,ja.he never explicitly states that stealth agent does not provide the host ip address,nor does he explain what other component of the electronic device supplies it.
the testimony of absolute expert,gregory ennis,is also not directly on point.ennis only states that the packet generated by the stealth agent,when received by the host system,contains both the ip address of the device and the ip address of the stealth control center.decl.of gregory ennis,ja.he never explicitly states that the agent provides both the agent ip address and the host ip address.rather,he finishes his discussion with the conclusory statement that t he agent thereby provides the host system with such a global network communication link.id.in sum,both experts had the opportunity to provide direct evidence regarding how the host ip address comes to be in the message packet that ultimately arrives at the host,but neither one conclusively states whether it is the agent that provides this address.
given this gap in the record,we are left with the following undisputed facts stealth xtool agent provides a message packet to the host system with at least the agent ip address and the packet contains the ip addresses of both the agent and the host when it arrives at the host system.absolute argues that,based on these facts,the next logical inference is that the xtool agent also provides the host ip address.the district court,however,granted stealth motion for summary judgment of,finding that absolute arguments and evidence fail to demonstrate that the xtool agent,as opposed to any other component of a client device,furnishes,supplies,or makes available any global network communication link.district court decision,at emphasis in original.
we find the district court determination on this point erroneous.the decision fails to draw a reasonable inference in favor of absolute,the party,namely that the xtool agent itself provides the host ip address that appears in the message packet.see.farm bureau mut.cas.am.fid.life ins,cir inferences most favorable to the party must be drawn,and s uch inferences may create disputes regarding basic facts or regarding facts to be inferred from such facts.on these facts,a reasonable jury could find that the same component that provides the agent ip address and sends the packet the xtool agent also provides the host ip address that is in that packet when it arrives at the host.because the evidence of record creates a genuine issue of material fact,we vacate the district court summary judgment of of the and patents 
summary judgment of of the patent 
absolute also appeals the district court grant of summary judgment of of the patent,which was based on its finding that stealth xtool tracker does not meet the contacting without signaling limitation found in claim,the only independent claim asserted.it is undisputed that stealth xtool tracker agent does not emit an audible signal when it establishes a connection with the host,but that it does emit a beep at the end of the contact with the host.decl.of pedro camargo,ja.based on these facts,the district court found that t his claim does not read on stealth xtool agent because upon the occurrence of every communication with the system the agent triggers an audible signal at the end of that communication.district court decision,at emphasis in original.on appeal,absolute argues that there are at least issues of fact as to whether the agent silence at the beginning of the connection and during communication constitutes contacting without signaling as that term has been construed by the district court.as explained below,we agree with absolute and vacate the district court grant of summary judgment on this issue.
the district court,in granting judgment of,relied heavily on reasoning in the special master r r.during claim construction,the parties disputed whether contacting meant only the initiation of a communication or actually encompassed the entire communication,with absolute arguing for the former interpretation finding that there was no clear definition of contacting in the patent,the special master relied on two dictionaries that define the word contacting as to get in touch with communicate with and to communicate with.ja citing american heritage dictionary of the english language ed and random house webster unabridged dictionary ed.he also noted that,s ince there is no clear indication that the patentee intended to limit the use of this word to only the initiation of the communication,i find that the word contacting as used in the patent is not so limited.ja.accordingly,the special master recommended construing the term to mean getting in touch with or communicating with a host monitoring system without signaling not necessarily through active suppression the visual or audible user interface.the district court adopted the special master construction,and neither party challenges the correctness of this claim construction on appeal.
because the district court believed the special master intended to give contacting a broad definition,it rejected absolute argument that the stealth xtool tracker infringes if it either establishes a connection with the host without signaling or sends information without signaling.according to the district court,an audible signal at any time before the communication terminates is sufficient to avoid the without signaling limitation of the patent.we disagree with that conclusion for two independent reasons.
first,the district court claim construction is getting in touch with or communicating with,such that the stealth agent infringes the patent if it does either.here,stealth own expert admits that the agent does not emit a sound when it establishes a connection with the host,thereby confirming that stealth xtool tracker meets this limitation.dep.of pedro camargo,ja.although the special master may have intended to provide a broad definition for contacting,the plain terms of the construction do not comport with that intention.in its response to absolute appeal,stealth effectively asks this court to change or to and in the construction to read getting in touch with and communicating with,but stealth neither sought to clarify this construction before the district court nor challenged it on appeal.stealth can not rewrite a claim construction it previously endorsed at this late stage of the proceedings.
second,even if we agreed with stealth that the use of the disjunctive or in the construction meant only that getting in touch with was synonymous with communicating with,there are issues of material fact as to the temporal relationship between the communication and the audible signal the xtool agent emits.for example,if there is a gap between the communication and the xtool agent audible signal,a might reasonably conclude that the communication is sufficiently removed from the signal that the communication is accomplished without signaling.or,as absolute contends,a reasonable jury might find that,if the communication with the host is complete,that all information to be conveyed to the host system has been conveyed before the signal occurs,the signal does not occur during communication,regardless of any meaningful temporal gap between the completion of the communication and the signal.while stealth argues that the signal always occurs as part of the communication,that is a question of fact to be assessed by the trier of fact.summary judgment of of the patent,therefore,must be vacated.
stealth cross appeal 
stealth raises three issues on its,arguing that the district court claim construction of the term rate is erroneous genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment of of the patent and the district court construction of the terms unique usage agreement information and said terms of said usage agreement imbedded in said software is erroneous.for the reasons explained below,we conclude that the district court correctly construed all the claim terms stealth challenges,and we find that summary judgment of is proper.
construction of rate 
the term rate appears in independent claims and of the patent,which require transmission means for initiating,at a rate,the transmission of the message packet from the formatting means to the central site means of the system surreptitiously of a user of said electrical apparatus.the parties dispute the degree of randomness required for the message transmission,specifically whether the claim is limited to a random call within a predetermined time interval,such as once per day,week,or month,as absolute urged,or whether no such time interval limitation exists,which stealth argued.
the special master agreed with absolute,recommending that rate be construed as normally taking place exactly once at a randomly chosen time during each occurrence of a repeating predetermined time interval.ja ja order adopting construction in reaching this proposed construction,the special master placed significant weight on the fact that the specification refers to an embodiment designed to make one call during a specified time period as the present invention.specifically,the relevant text of the patent describes the randomizer of figure as having two functions ensuring that there is one call per time period,such as and making sure that call is made randomly at only one time during that period.patent ll.that section states that t he present invention is designed to make one,and only one,call during the selected period id.emphasis added.the specification also refers to figure as a flow chart of the major functions performed by the present invention,and states that figure is a detailed flow chart of the randomizer portion of figure.id.ll emphasis added.the description of figure,moreover,describes the preferred embodiment by saying that t he monitoring system of the present invention is intended to be secretly included at the time of sale id.ll emphasis added.accordingly,the special master found that the specification limits the entire invention to placing one call per time interval,a construction the district court adopted.
on appeal,stealth argues that the district court construction of the term rate is erroneous because it improperly imports a limitation from a specific embodiment into a claim based on references to the present invention ignores that the specification expressly refers to predetermined time interval calling as an optional feature ignores that calls are only preferentially triggered at a carefully controlled rate,perhaps once a week,patent ll emphasis added and confuses the misuse detection purpose of the invention,to which the rate limitation relates,with the purpose of the invention.in support of its own proposed construction,stealth argues that semi simply means somewhat,such that the intervals must only vary somewhat randomly,but that there is no predetermined time interval limitation.we do not find stealth arguments persuasive.
although we disagree with the special master reasoning that the references in the specification to the present invention limit the entire invention to the preferred embodiment,the asserted claims themselves,and the specification relating to those claims,otherwise support the district court construction that rate includes a time interval limitation.it is true that,in some circumstances,a patentee consistent reference to a certain limitation or a preferred embodiment as this invention or the present invention can serve to limit the scope of the entire invention,particularly where no other intrinsic evidence suggests otherwise.see verizon servs.vonage holdings,when a patent thus describes the features of the present invention as a whole,this description limits the scope of the invention honeywell int l,itt,noting that,o n at least four occasions,the written description refers to only one particular component as this invention or the present invention and finding that the prosecution history does not support a broader scope.
on the other hand,we have found that use of the phrase present invention or this invention is not always so limiting,such as where the references to a certain limitation as being the invention are not uniform,or where other portions of the intrinsic evidence do not support applying the limitation to the entire patent.see voda cordis,although parts of the specification referred to a certain embodiment as the present invention,the specification did not uniformly refer to the invention as being so limited,and the prosecution history did not reveal such a limitation praxair,atmi,references to a specific embodiment as the apparatus of this invention and a useful feature of this invention in the specification are contradicted by a number of express statements in the specification clearly indicating that the feature at issue is a feature only of certain embodiments rambus.infineon techs.ag,although portions of the written description referred to the term at issue as limiting the claimed invention to a preferred embodiment,the remainder of the specification and the prosecution history shows that rambus did not clearly disclaim or disavow such claim scope in this case.
in this case,the patent is more like the patents at issue in voda,praxair,and rambus,in that the specification does not uniformly refer to a limitation as being with the entire invention.significantly,under the description of operation section,the specification of the patent states that 
some of the features that can be included in the present invention to make a work around more difficult are 
schedule the transmissions to occur randomly the monitored apparatus should phone home every monday at 
program the remote site monitored apparatus to place exactly one call per time period,day,week,or month.thus,if the central site observes multiple calls from the same software serial number in the same time period,then it can be certain that that copy of the software has been installed on more than one system in the field.
patent ll emphases added.
this portion of the specification expressly describes the features of a predetermined time interval and a random call during that interval as two optional features of the present invention.because the specification uses present invention in a way that expressly contradicts earlier references to present invention as requiring both one call during a time interval and the randomness of that call,we do not agree that the invention is so limited.
our conclusion does not change the district court construction,however,because the claim language and the specification otherwise support that construction.notably,the language of claim,which depends from independent claim,strongly suggests that the term includes a time interval component.claim recites a method including the steps of sending messages to the host at a rate.dependent claim recites the method of claim,with the further step of identifying if more than one remote monitoring means transmits the same unique identification to the central monitoring means within the same selected time period as another.patent ll.here,the same selected time period refers to the period in which messages are sent to the host,which is the rate of claim.this claim language,therefore,commends the interpretation that rate,as used in these claims,refers to calls within a particular time period.
the specification further supports a time interval limitation.the term rate appears only in the abstract and in the summary of the invention,both times referring specifically to a time interval of once per week.patent abstract the call limitation is preferentially triggered at a carefully controlled rate,perhaps once a week.id.ll same.there are also repeated references in the specification to the placement of one call per time period,patent ll t o insure that one call per time period,such as,is made to the central site.id.ll thus the triggering time is uniformly randomly distributed over the selected time interval,say one month.id.ll program the remote site monitored apparatus to place exactly one call per time period,day,week,or month.these references provide strong support for the district court construction that the term rate includes a aspect.
given that the patent describes the time interval limitation as an optional or preferred feature,stealth argues that construing rate as requiring such a limitation is erroneous because it improperly imports a limitation from the preferred embodiment to the entire patent.for the reasons explained above,we agree that this time interval limitation does not apply to the entire invention solely because of references to the present invention,but that limitation does apply to the rate term as used in the asserted claims.
we are also not persuaded by stealth argument that it is error to apply the time interval limitation to the term rate because it confuses the misuse detection purpose of the invention,determining whether a product is being used beyond the scope of the license with the performance monitoring purpose of the invention,determining whether the product is functioning properly.according to stealth,claims and the claims at issue that include the term rate relate only to performance monitoring.in contrast,claims and relate to misuse detection and do not include the term rate.stealth asserts that,for purposes of monitoring performance,there is no reason why calls must occur only once within a given interval.
stealth argument is not supported by the record.claims,and include the rate limitation and are directed to detecting software misuse in addition to monitoring performance.dependant claim,for example,incorporates claim rate limitation and recites the step of determining whether a device is
