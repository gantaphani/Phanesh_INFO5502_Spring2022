opinion of the court 
introduction 
this matter comes on before this court on appeal from an order of the district court entered on march,affirming march,and june,orders of the bankruptcy court in proceedings arising from the sale of a major asset of the debtors estate in this bankruptcy proceeding.the bankruptcy court denied the request of an unsuccessful bidder for the asset,kelson channelview llc kelson,for disbursement of administrative expenses in the form of a fee from the estate in the march,order,and then in the june,order approved the sale of the asset to fortistar,llc kelson appealed but the district court affirmed the orders of the bankruptcy court.in re reliant energy channelview lp.we will affirm the order of the district court and,in effect,the order of the bankruptcy court of march.
ii.background 
the debtors in the chapter proceedings,reliant energy channelview lp and reliant energy services channelview llc together,the debtors,decided to sell their largest asset,a power plant in channelview,texas with the assistance of consultants with expertise in the energy industry,the debtors contacted potentially interested purchasers.this substantial effort was fruitful for potential bidders executed confidentiality agreements with respect to a possible purchase,and went further and conducted due diligence on the purchase.ultimately,including fortistar,made bids for the plant.many of the bids,however,were contingent on the bidder obtaining financing,a difficult undertaking in the then prevailing business environment.kelson,however,submitted a complete bid of million not contingent on financing and was selected as the winning bidder.consequently,kelson entered into an asset purchase agreement apa with the debtors for the power plant.
inasmuch as the debtors were in bankruptcy,consummation of the apa required the bankruptcy court approval.consequently,the apa provided that the debtors immediately would seek an order from the bankruptcy court allowing the sale.moreover,the debtors agreed that they would seek an order approving certain bid protections and procedures for kelson benefit if the court determined that there should be an auction for the plant before its sale.these proposed bid protections and procedures provided that debtors could not accept a competing bid unless it exceeded kelson bid by million.furthermore,the proposed bid protections and procedures provided that if a competing bid was accepted,kelson would be entitled to a million fee,about three percent of its bid,as well as reimbursement for expenses it incurred in the sale process up to million.the practice of paying a fee to an initial bidder for assets has developed in bankruptcy and other contexts to compensate the bidder for memorializing its interest in acquiring the asset,an interest which sometimes,as we will explain below,can be useful to the asset seller even if the bid is not accepted.
as the apa required,the debtors requested that the bankruptcy court authorize the sale of the plant to kelson without conducting an auction.in that motion,the debtors asserted that the kelson bid represents the highest and best offer available for the debtors assets and that further marketing of the assets will not result in a higher purchase price.app.at.the bankruptcy court delayed its decision on this motion when one of the debtors equity holders objected to the fast pace of the transaction ultimately,however,the court would not approve the sale to kelson without an auction for the plant.
when the court delayed the approval of the sale,the debtors,with the support of their creditors,asked the court to authorize the bid protection measures that we have described.however,fortistar,which previously had submitted a losing contingent bid,objected to this request and asserted that it was willing to enter a higher and better bid at an auction,but the million fee along with the million reimbursement for expenses would be a deterrent to it doing so.
the bankruptcy court held a hearing to consider authorization of the bid protections at which,among others,william hardie,the consultant to the debtors in charge of shopping the assets,and andrew johannensen,an officer of the debtors,testified.hardie described the process the debtors had followed in seeking a buyer and explained that the debtors dropped fortistar from consideration as a purchaser when it lost its financing.at that point,the debtors and their creditors decided to sign the apa with kelson as its consummation would result in the full compensation of all the debtors creditors,and kelson bid was for a fair price and was financed fully.
hardie thought that by reason of all the work that had been done in seeking bidders there was no need for an auction as the debtors already had obtained the best price for the plant.moreover,hardie explained that in view of the advantages of the kelson bid the debtors were willing to seek the bid protections kelson sought and he believed that kelson would not have agreed to make its bid unless the debtors agreed to seek the bid protections.finally,hardie thought that the kelson apa benefitted the debtor estate because it established a floor price and terms for the sale of the assets.on hardie acknowledged,however,that kelson would be bound by its offer even if the court rejected the bid protections,though he suggested that kelson would find a way to avoid its commitment if it desired to do so johannensen testimony was similar to that of hardie.
the bankruptcy court nevertheless declined to approve the sale of the plant without an auction and,in a ruling from the bench,said that in deciding whether to approve the bid protections it had to consider whether they would enhance or chill bidding.in particular,the court believed that it was required to decide whether the proposed protections would benefit the estate 
it hard generally to consider how bid protections or fees protect the estate.i heard the arguments and have approved them in the case where the parties have convinced me that it is the only way to get other bidders,any bidder to the table.but i not convinced in this case that that is the case.there are other bidders,at least one other bidder.and i have in the past denied fees in circumstances where another party had appeared and expressed an intention to bid at the auction 
ultimately the bankruptcy court entered its march,order approving the million overbid requirement which required that bids competing with kelson bid must exceed it by million.in addition,the court approved the reimbursement to kelson for expenses it incurred in the transaction up to million.finally,however,in the provision of its order at issue on this appeal,the court refused to authorize payment of the million fee.
kelson did not participate in the subsequent auction,and,in fact,argued that its offer was no longer available.fortistar,however,submitted the winning,now fully financed bid,which topped kelson bid by million.in accordance with the bankruptcy court decision,the debtors did not pay kelson the million fee,although they did pay kelson for its expenses 
after the bankruptcy court entered an order on june,approving the sale to fortistar,kelson appealed to the district court from the order denying the payment of the million fee,arguing that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion by denying kelson request for the fee.kelson also argued that it was a bidder entitled to a fee as a matter of fundamental fairness and contended that the debtors were estopped from opposing its appeal because they supported its request for the fee in the bankruptcy court.the district court rejected kelson arguments and affirmed the march,and june,orders of the bankruptcy court and thus the district court did not allow the payment of the fee.kelson then filed this appeal of the district court order to the extent that it affirmed the bankruptcy court order of march.
iii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the bankruptcy court had initial jurisdiction over the matter now before us as it concerned the administration of the estate.b.the district court had jurisdiction to review kelson appeal under a and we have jurisdiction to review the district court final decision under d.
we exercise plenary review over the decision of the district court sitting as an appellate court in this bankruptcy proceeding and consequently we review the ruling of the bankruptcy court.see lowenschuss resorts int l,in re resorts int l,cir.we review the bankruptcy court legal determinations de novo,its factual determinations for clear error,and its decision denying the fee on an abuse of discretion standard.see interface,trans world airlines,in re trans world airlines,cir 
iv.discussion 
a.the standard 
in calpine env t energy,in re env t energy,cir,we set forth the controlling legal principles applicable on this appeal.in,the debtor,after considering bids from several interested buyers for certain of its assets,entered into an asset purchase agreement with calpine corporation,which conditioned its bid on the parties ability to secure bankruptcy court approval of a million fee.the debtor,supported by many of its creditors,sought approval for the fee from the bankruptcy court.nevertheless,the court denied the application,stating that a fee would complicate or even chill the bidding process.however,the court gave calpine permission to renew its application after an auction for the sale of the assets.
notwithstanding calpine insistence that it would not make an offer without the assurance of a provision for a fee,it did enter the bidding process.after a different bidder made the best offer,calpine renewed its request for a fee,but the court denied the request after an evidentiary hearing.calpine appealed and,after the district court affirmed,calpine appealed to our court.
calpine argued to us that it was seeking the fee under applicable case law,but we rejected this contention.we held that courts do not have the authority to create new ways to authorize the payment of fees from a bankruptcy estate,and the methods of recovering fees from an estate are limited to the procedures established by the bankruptcy code.we concluded that a bidder must seek a fee under b,which,so far as germane here,permits payment of administrative expenses for the actual,necessary costs and expenses of preserving the estate.we also held that there was no compelling justification for treating an application for a fee and expenses under b differently from other applications for administrative expenses under the same provision,at.
therefore,we indicated that in considering requests for fees,we would apply the general standard used for all administrative expenses the allowability of fees,like that of other administrative expenses,depends upon the requesting party ability to show that the fees were actually necessary to preserve the value of the estate.id.focusing specifically on fees,we noted that it was permissible to offer a fee and reimbursement for expenses to induce an initial bid,provided the allowance of the fee does not give an advantage to a favored purchaser over other bidders by increasing the cost of acquisition.we also indicated that a fee is not necessary to preserve the value of the estate when the bidder would have bid even without the fee.id.citing bruce markell,the case against breakup fees in bankruptcy,am.
applying this standard to the facts in,we found that calpine would have made its bid even without the assurance of a fee,as it indeed did.for this reason,among others,we found that an award of a fee was not necessary to preserve the value of the estate and we affirmed the order of the district court and thus the order of the bankruptcy court denying allowance of the fee.
application of to this case 
under,we must decide whether an award of a fee was necessary to preserve the value of the debtors estate.in this regard,we recognize that it could be argued that in either or both of two ways a fee could have preserved the value of the estate.first,the opportunity to obtain a fee could have induced kelson to make its bid before the bankruptcy court ordered the auction,and second,the provision for a fee may have been necessary to induce kelson to adhere to its bid after the court ordered the conducting of the auction 
was a fee needed to induce the first bid 
kelson bid undoubtedly provided a benefit to the estate by establishing a minimum price and a complete set of offer terms and,in fact,the bankruptcy court required that any competing bid exceed kelson bid by at least million.indeed,it is plausible to believe that an initial bid,ordinarily or perhaps even always,will provide a benefit to an estate because it will establish a floor price for the assets to be sold.but we have to decide a different question,was an award of a fee necessary to produce this benefit and preserve the value of the estate 
we recognize that the first bidder in a bankruptcy sale necessarily takes a risk at least to the extent of investing the time,money and energy needed to produce its bid nevertheless,while we understand that the first bidder may be motivated in part to submit its bid by the possibility that it will receive a fee,it does not follow from that motivation that the bidder will withdraw its bid,pass up on the opportunity to acquire the asset to be sold,and nullify its work in preparing its bid if a court,when ordering that there be an auction of assets,declines to authorize a fee to be paid to the initial bidder.surely makes that clear because even though calpine had made its bid contingent on the award of a fee,it competed at the auction after the bankruptcy court rejected the request for a fee.
here,however,kelson argues that the provision of a fee was necessary to entice it to bid,but the facts do not support this argument.we are satisfied that it is clear beyond doubt that kelson did not condition its bid on the presence of a provision for a fee,although it did condition the bid on the debtors promise to seek authority to pay it such a fee.thus,section d of the apa provided that sellers shall file a bidding procedures motion with the bankruptcy court seeking the entry of an order approving the bid protections.app.at emphasis added.these bid protections included the fee.accordingly,there is no escape from the fact that kelson did make its bid without the assurance of a fee,and this fact destroys kelson argument that the fee was needed to induce it to bid rather,the mere possibility of the payment of a fee was sufficient for that purpose.
was a fee needed to preserve kelson bid 
the record suggests that although an assurance of a fee may not have been needed to induce kelson bid,it nevertheless could have been useful to assure that kelson adhered to its bid rather than abandoning its attempt to purchase the plant in the event that the bankruptcy court required an auction for its sale.a fee certainly provides a benefit to an estate if a bidder remains committed to a purchase,though,as we have explained,we see no reason to believe that bidders who already have made a full and complete bid necessarily will abandon their efforts to obtain an asset without an assurance of a fee.in this case,the bankruptcy court believed that the provision for the fee would deter other possible purchasers from bidding for the plant and would outweigh any possible benefit achieved for the estate by keeping kelson committed to the purchase through the provision for the fee.
clearly,the bankruptcy court was faced with a difficult choice.if the court denied the fee,then kelson might abandon the purchase,as it supposedly did.if another suitable bid had not materialized and kelson had walked away permanently from the purchase,the estate would have been harmed severely by the denial of a fee.to avoid this result,the court could have granted a fee to secure kelson existing bid.nevertheless,the court decided that a million fee was not necessary for the protection of the estate.this decision,which we view from the court perspective on march,was justified by fortistar assertion that it planned to continue bidding,the binding language of the apa,and the logical belief that kelson would not abandon a fully negotiated agreement if no other bidder materialized.though we do not decide the case on the basis of our knowledge of what happened after the court
