filed suit in illinois state court.following removal by,the district court remanded the action to state court.appeal,arguing that the district court exceeded its authority,and seeking vacatur of the remand order.for the reasons stated herein,we affirm.
between and,worldcom,once the second largest telecommunications company in the world,issued debt securities worth billions of dollars in connection with which served as underwriters.worldcom agreed to indemnify appellants for liability arising out of untrue statements or omissions in prospectuses issued in connection with the offerings.
on june,worldcom announced that it had improperly treated billion in ordinary costs as capital expenditures and that it would have to restate its financial statements.this led to the filing of numerous individual and class actions in state and federal courts across the country.on october,the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation jpml ordered that actions pending in federal courts be centralized in the southern district of new york before judge cote,pursuant to,the multidistrict litigation statute.
many of the individual actions brought in state courts following worldcom announcement were filed by state and private pension funds that had purchased worldcom bonds bondholders.rather than joining a class action against worldcom and the other defendants,the bondholders,represented by milberg weiss bershad hynes lerach,brought individual actions in state courts across the country.between july,and october,milberg weiss filed at least of these individual actions on behalf of over plaintiffs.
the bondholders actions filed in state courts,unlike the class actions filed in federal courts,do not assert claims under the securities exchange act of act,et instead,they allege claims only under the securities act of act,et.unlike the act which provides for exclusive federal jurisdiction,see,the act allows for concurrent federal and state jurisdiction and has an antiremoval provision.see a n o case arising under this subchapter and brought in any state court of competent jurisdiction shall be removed to any court of the united states.drafting the complaints in this way would seem to ensure a state forum and prevent removal.if this was the bondholders intention,however,their efforts have been frustrated by worldcom july bankruptcy filing.after that date,defendants began removing the actions to federal court on the ground that they are related to worldcom bankruptcy.see b,a many of these removed bondholder actions have been identified as actions and transferred to judge cote.
on march,judge cote denied a motion to remand filed by the new york city employees retirement system nycers,holding that subject matter and removal jurisdiction were proper and that abstention was not appropriate.see in re worldcom.sec,this ruling applied to the actions transferred to judge cote pursuant to the jpml october,order,as well as to the actions.on may,the second circuit affirmed judge cote denial of the motion to remand,holding that the act antiremoval provision does not bar removal of actions under a.see cal.pub.employees ret.worldcom,cir.
on june,illinois municipal retirement fund imrf filed suit in illinois state court,alleging claims arising out of imrf purchase of worldcom debt securities and alleging false and misleading statements in registration statements and prospectuses issued in connection with the bond offerings,of which the underwriter appellants allegedly were aware or should have been aware.consistent with the litigation strategy of other individual pension funds,and represented by the same attorneys imrf alleged claims only under the act.on july,appellants removed the case to the united states district court for the southern district of illinois,premising removal on a.on the same day,appellants filed a notice with the clerk of the jpml,requesting that the action be transferred as a action to judge cote.on july,appellants filed a motion to stay the action pending a determination by the jpml on the issue of transfer.the jpml issued a conditional transfer order on september,notice of which appellants filed with the district court on september.
on the same day that appellants filed their motion to stay,june,imrf filed a motion to remand or abstain,raising three arguments the act absolutely prohibits removal,even by way of a imrf action does not fall within federal bankruptcy jurisdiction and even if there is subject matter and removal jurisdiction,the district court should abstain from exercising jurisdiction and should remand pursuant to c,which permits abstention in cases related to a bankruptcy case in the interest of justice,or in the interest of comity with state courts or respect for state law,or b,which permits remand of claims related to a bankruptcy case on any equitable ground.these were the same arguments imrf attorneys already had made to judge cote without success,and would later make to the second circuit with the same result.
on september,although acknowledging judge cote contrary decision and the jpml conditional transfer order,the district court remanded this action to illinois state court,order at.the court found that the act bars removal but that its language conflicts with a.id.it resolved this conflict by concluding that the rules of statutory construction require the act to control over the more general provisions of b and and that the only way to give effect to the legislative intent behind its enactment is to construe it as a bar to removal even under these circumstances.id.at.the district court further held that even if the act did not bar removal,the claims were not related to the worldcom bankruptcy and can not be removed under section,and also that remand is appropriate pursuant to the doctrines of permissive abstention and equitable remand under c and b.id.at.the court denied appellants motion to stay proceedings pending the final transfer decision of the jpml and granted the imrf motion to remand or abstain.id.at.on october,appellants filed a notice of appeal.
ii.discussion 
appellate jurisdiction 
we first must determine whether we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal.the general grant of our appellate jurisdiction is found in,which provides that courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the united states.the breadth of our jurisdiction,however,is limited by several statutes which specifically bar appellate review of certain types of final decisions.each of the following statutes limit our jurisdiction in this case,given the district court alternative grounds for remand d provides that a n order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise d bars appellate review of a ny decision to abstain made in a bankruptcy case or proceeding and b bars review of equitable remands of claims related to a bankruptcy case.
the parties agree that these three statutes bar appellate review of the district court reasons for remand in this case appellants argue,however,that antecedent questions of power are properly presented to courts of appeals.in other words,appellants contend that the district court lacked statutory authority to issue the remand order and that we may vacate the order even though we may not review its reasoning.
in thermtron products,hermansdorfer,where the supreme court first decided that d is not a complete bar to appellate review of remand orders,the court held that it had appellate jurisdiction to review a remand order premised on the district court overcrowded docket,d,abrogated on different grounds by quackenbush allstate ins,d.because the district judge remanded a properly removed case on grounds that he had no authority to consider,he exceeded his statutorily defined power.id.at.we have explained that thermtron permits us to decide whether a district court has the power to do what it did,although we can not examine whether a particular exercise of power was proper.in re cont l cas,cir.
in continental casualty,we issued a writ of mandamus ordering a district court to recall its remand and reinstate the case on its docket
