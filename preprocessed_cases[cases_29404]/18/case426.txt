in this securities case,brought an action under the securities act of against adams golf,a manufacturer of golf equipment,and certain of its officers and underwriters.the plaintiffs contended that the company registration statement and prospectus contained materially false or misleading statements in violation of sections,a,and of the securities act.among other things,adams golf public offering materials indicated that the company sold its golf equipment exclusively to authorized retailers and that the golf industry was flourishing.in their complaint,the plaintiffs alleged that adams golf omitted information contrary to these representations,that unauthorized retailers were selling adams golf golf clubs,and that retailers were carrying an oversupply of golf equipment.finding that neither the unauthorized retail nor the oversupply allegations stated a claim upon which relief could be granted,the district court dismissed the action under.b.in re adams golf.sec,d.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm in part and reverse in part.
when barney adams founded adams golf in,the company was a golfing components supplier and a contract manufacturer.over the years,it grew to become a designer and manufacturer of its own golf clubs.after having much success by introducing a golf club,called tight lies,the company offered its shares to the public.on july,an initial public offering ipo of shares of the company common stock was made at per share,accompanied by the requisite registration statement and prospectus 
in their complaint,the plaintiffs contend that the defendants misrepresented and omitted material facts in the registration statement and prospectus.first,the plaintiffs argue that the defendants failed to disclose that its revenues were artificially inflated by a gray market distribution of adams golf golf clubs.second,the plaintiffs argue that the defendants failed to disclose the existence of an oversupply of golf equipment.the facts with respect to these two sets of allegations will be explored in more detail.
adams golf sold its golf clubs only to authorized dealers.as its registration statement explained 
to preserve the integrity of its image and reputation,the company limits its distribution to retailers that market premium quality golf equipment and provide a high level of customer service and technical expertise the company believes its selective retail distribution helps its retailers to maintain profitable margins and maximize sales of adams products.
the registration statement made clear that,as part of its limited distribution arrangement,the company does not sell its products through price sensitive general discount warehouses,department stores or membership clubs.
prior to the ipo,however,adams golf had learned that tight lies golf clubs were being sold by costco,a discount warehouse.on june,one month before the registration statement effective date,the company issued a press release in which it acknowledged that an unauthorized dealer was selling its signature product.indeed,the plaintiffs alleged that prior to the ipo,costco possessed over tight lies clubs in its inventory.in the press release,adams golf stated it was concerned about costco sale of the golf clubs because costco was not an authorized distributor.concerned enough that,according to the press release,adams golf initiated legal proceedings,by filing a bill of discovery against costco,to determine whether costco claims that they had properly acquired adams tight lies fairway woods for resale were accurate.the plaintiffs further alleged that the unauthorized distribution was not limited to costco and included sales by other unauthorized discount retailers and international gray market distributors.
this unauthorized inventory created a gray market,according to the plaintiffs.the complaint defines gray market to simply refer to the unauthorized distribution of the company products to discount retailers.the complaint sets out the several ostensible consequences of this gray market.the plaintiffs alleged that the company initially experienced a rise in sales as products were diverted to the unauthorized distributors.according to their complaint,t he income generated by sales to the gray market also skewed the company overall financial appearance,creating the false impression of heightened sales and profitability at the time of the ipo,according to the historical financial statements contained in the registration statement and the prospectus.seeking a better deal,consumers bought their tight lies clubs from cheaper,unauthorized sources.with their sales diminished,authorized dealers then reduced their orders for adams golf equipment.in time,the ultimate result for the company was an overall drop in revenue.
about five months after the ipo,on january,adams golf issued a press release anticipating disappointing fourth quarter results.the company stated that sales would continue to suffer as a result of the gray market distribution of its products to a membership warehouse club.further,according to the plaintiffs complaint,adams golf acknowledged,in its form filed in march of,that despite its best efforts,a membership warehouse club had possession of its golf clubs,and that the company does not believe that the gray marketing of its product can be totally eliminated.
the complaint also states that by omitting any mention of an glut of golf equipment carried by retailers,certain passages in adams golf registration statement were materially misleading.specifically,the plaintiffs refer to the statement that t he company believes its prompt delivery of products enables its retail accounts to maintain smaller quantities of inventory than may be required with other golf equipment manufacturers.further,the plaintiffs argue that statements contained in the offering materials,including the belief that a number of trends are likely to increase the demand for adams products painted too rosy a picture of the golf industry,particularly in light of the problem of retail oversupply 
the record indicates that oversupply did eventually come to adversely affect adams golf bottom line.indeed,the first quarter report for indicated that the company had suffered disappointing financial results,partly owing to an oversupply of inventory at the retail level,a condition that weakened club sales industry wide over the last months,and has resulted in substantial reductions in retailer purchases.
the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.adams golf,d at.the court ruled as to both the gray market and the retail oversupply claims that adams golf registration statement contained neither false,nor misleading statements,nor any material omissions.in response,the plaintiffs filed a motion to amend its complaint pursuant to.e and,which the district court denied in a subsequent order.the plaintiffs timely appealed both rulings of the district court.we have jurisdiction to consider this appeal pursuant to.
this court reviews rule b dismissals de novo,accepting all allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of plaintiffs.anthony council,cir.we may not affirm unless we are certain that no relief could be granted under any set of facts which could be proven.id.the district court concluded that the plaintiffs complaint was insufficient to state a claim against the defendants under sections and a of the act 
the act creates federal duties,particularly involving registration and disclosure,in connection with the public offering of securities.sections and a impose civil liability for the making of materially false or misleading statements in registration statements and prospectuses.see,a.in particular,section involves material misstatements or omissions in registration statements,while section a involves prospectuses and other solicitation materials.
to state a claim under section,plaintiffs must allege that they purchased securities pursuant to a materially false or misleading registration statement herman maclean huddleston,d if a plaintiff purchased a security issued pursuant to a registration statement,he need only show a material misstatement or omission to establish his prima facie case.shapiro ujb fin,cir to state a claim under section a,plaintiffs must allege that they purchased securities pursuant to a materially false or misleading prospectus or oral communication.the plaintiffs argue that both their claims concerning the gray market distribution and the existence of a retail oversupply meet the above pleading minima.further,they contend that the district court improperly denied their motion to amend the complaint,which they filed pursuant to.e motion to amend or alter the judgment and.motion to amend the pleadings.we consider each set of claims in turn.
the plaintiffs alleged that by omitting any mention of what they characterize as a gray market problem,adams golf rendered the registration statement false or misleading,specifically those claims concerning the company reliance on a network of authorized distributors.the district court found that costco unauthorized possession of golf clubs did not constitute a material omission adams golf,d at in sum,plaintiffs have not alleged support for their proposition that the fact that an unauthorized discount retailer had illegally obtained a number of adams golf clubs constituted a material risk at the time of the ipo,or a known trend threatening the company future sales,that should have been disclosed.further,the court determined that,in any event,the omission of any information regarding the gray market did not render the registration statement and prospectus false or misleading.
materiality is ordinarily an issue left to the factfinder and is therefore not typically a matter for rule b dismissal weiner quaker oats,cir t he emphasis on a determination of materiality militates against a dismissal on the pleadings.only if the alleged misrepresentations or omissions are so obviously unimportant to an investor that reasonable minds can not differ on the question of materiality is it appropriate for the district court to rule that the allegations are inactionable as a matter of law.shapiro,at citing tsc,at.emphasis added.although the district court did not expressly reference this standard,its dismissal for failure to state a claim was proper only if the gray market and retail oversupply issues were plainly unimportant to a reasonable investor.
to support its determination that the gray market claim lacked materiality,the district court observed that costco possessed what it considered a limited number of golf clubs at the time of the ipo.the defendants explain that these were golf clubs out of,or roughly two percent of the golf clubs sold by adams golf that fiscal quarter.by itself,however,this figure does not persuade us that the fact was plainly immaterial.were costco to have had more than ten percent of the company golf clubs in its inventory,we might agree that the unauthorized inventory would be undoubtedly material.to illustrate the other extreme,if a discount retailer had just a handful of golf clubs,we might conclude that a few errant fairway woods would be obviously immaterial to a reasonable investor.in contrast,the materiality of costco unauthorized inventory of several thousand adams golf golf clubs can not be so easily divined.in order to make the delicate assessments involved in a materiality determination,shapiro,at,we would need more information regarding,for example,the importance of the limited distribution arrangement to adams golf business model and,perhaps,the nature of the golf club industry more generally.in a tightly competitive market,the maintenance of exclusivity among adams golf network of authorized dealers may have been vital,and the company touting this mode of distribution seems to imply that it is.indeed,in its registration statement,the company indicated that its distribution system allowed it to maintain profits and maximize sales of adams golf products.in light of such considerations,the possession of golf clubs in the hands of a nationwide,discount retailer may have been material,since it may have altered the total mix of information available to a reasonable investor.nahc,at.but without further factual development,the answer to this materiality inquiry is far from plain.
the district court also reasoned that the gray market problem was immaterial because it was an isolated incident and not part of a known trend.adams golf,d at.but a fact need not be part of a pattern to be material.even isolated incidents can result in immediate and negative consequences for a company.an aberrant event such as an oil tanker crash may nevertheless be material in the eyes of a reasonable investor in the unlucky oil company.analogously,even if the unauthorized inventory of golf clubs was a occurrence,it may have posed significant consequences for adams golf relationships with its authorized distributors,and signaled trouble that might be difficult to overcome.
perhaps animated by this concern,the company issued a press release on june,one month prior to going public,noting that it had filed an equitable bill of discovery to investigate the unauthorized inventory.according to the press release,adams golf became concerned when it learned that costco was selling their tight lies fairway woods because costco is not an authorized distributor.while not all company press releases publicize material information,we recognize that a company often chooses to issue an extraordinary press release when it needs to disseminate important information to its investors.in light of this public acknowledgment of the unauthorized inventory and its announcement of legal action,and our obligation to draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiffs,we are hard pressed to see how the existence of golf clubs for sale at a discounter,outside the protected distribution network,was unquestionably immaterial to a reasonable investor 
on appeal,the defendants contend that the fact that the gray market was not material is reflected by the absence of any decline in share value when the market learned of it in the january,press release they rely on in re burlington coat factory sec,cir,in which we observed that to the extent that information is not important to reasonable investors,it follows that its release will have a negligible effect on the stock price.id.at.but burlington coat factory was a rule case brought under the act,which requires that plaintiffs plead loss causation,allege that the material misstatement or omission caused a drop in the stock price.actions brought under the act are,however,critically different.under sections and a,plaintiffs do not bear the burden of proving causation.it is the defendants who may assert,as an affirmative defense,that a lower share value did not result from any nondisclosure or false statement.see e,b.while a defendant may be able to prove this negative causation theory,an affirmative defense may not be used to dismiss a plaintiff complaint under rule b doe gte,cir l itigants need not try to plead around defenses.
mindful of this court dismissal standard for immateriality,and our obligation to draw reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor,we can not agree with the district court conclusion that the gray market issue was obviously unimportant to a reasonable investor.of course,ultimately,costco inventory of tight lies golf clubs may be found to be immaterial,but that is for a factfinder to determine in light of a developed record.
a determination that information missing from a registration statement and prospectus is material does not end our analysis.we must also decide whether the issuer had the duty to disclose that material fact such that its omission made the statement misleading.see zucker quasha,to avoid committing misrepresentation,a defendant is not required to disclose all known information,but only information that is necessary to make other statements not misleading.quoting craftmatic sec.litig.kraftsow,cir.in order to make out prima facie violations of sections and a,plaintiffs must allege that an omitted material fact was required to be included by the securities laws or that its absence rendered statements in the prospectus misleading.see a referring to an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading referring to an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading.as noted above,the plaintiffs allege that the company statements touting its limited distribution arrangements were false or misleading in light of the omitted gray market problem.while we agree with the district court that none of these statements in the registration statement was technically false,we disagree with the court conclusion that the statements were obviously not misleading.
the relevant statements in the offering materials indicated that distribution was limited to certain retailers and that the company does not sell its products through price sensitive general discount warehouses.the district court properly found that costco unauthorized possession of adams golf clubs could not be reasonably taken to make those statements false,for there was no allegation that adams golf itself sold golf clubs to unauthorized retailers.but while technically true,those statements may have nevertheless led a reasonable investor to conclude that the selective distribution model was functioning properly,that this method was exclusive,and therefore that unauthorized retailers were not selling significant quantities of its adams golf merchandise.reasonable minds could disagree as to whether the omitted fact of costco unauthorized possession,in addition to the alleged sales by other unauthorized discount retailers and international gray market distributors,were necessary to make the statements regarding the company limited distribution not misleading.accordingly,we will reverse the district court dismissal of the plaintiffs gray market claims.
we next turn to the plaintiffs claims regarding an oversupply of golf equipment among retailers.as noted above,the plaintiffs contend that the omission of this oversupply rendered two sets of statements in the offering materials materially misleading the specific representation that t he company believes its prompt delivery of products enables its retail accounts to maintain smaller quantities of inventory than may be required with other golf equipment manufacturers and the general statements concerning the trends likely to increase the demand for adams golf products.we agree with the district court that neither of these statements were materially misleading by the omission of these industry conditions.
adams golf specific claims to nimble delivery and relatively smaller inventory were not rendered false or misleading in light of any alleged oversupply of golf equipment.the offering materials merely indicated that stores had fewer adams golf clubs in their inventories than the equipment of other manufacturers.the statement can not reasonably be taken to mean that adams golf retailers were not carrying excess inventory,as plaintiffs allege.those retailers may very well have had bloated inventories.but they may have maintained a relatively smaller inventory of adams golf equipment while carrying a surplus of merchandise produced by adams golf competitors.we find that plaintiffs allegations concerning retailers excess supplies of other companies equipment simply can not render false or misleading that portion of the registration statement concerning the retailers smaller inventory of adams golf products.
while the plaintiffs may be able to prove their allegations that adams golf rivals were suffering from retail oversupply and were taking corrective action to address the oversupply problem at the time of adams golf ipo,these allegations are of no moment.whatever financial problems other manufacturers and retailers may have struggled with,the securities laws obligated adams golf to disclose material information concerning its own business and not necessarily the details relating to its competitors.see trump casino,at holding that the issuer of a security need not compare itself in myriad ways to its competitors,whether favorably or unfavorably wielgos commonwealth edison,cir issues or securities must reveal information.emphasis added.
further,the plaintiffs make much of the company april,press release,announcing financial results for the first quarter of,in which,according to their complaint,defendants disclosed that for at least well prior to the had been an oversupply of inventory at the retail level on an basis.initially,we observe that adams golf was not to disclose general trends easily discernable from information already available in the public domain.see klein,at determination of materiality takes into account availability of information in the public domain whirlpool fin.gn holdings,cir the nondisclosure of trends is not a basis for a securities fraud claim.tenexco,the securities laws require the disclosure of information that is otherwise not in the public domain.moreover,all the april,press release seemed to acknowledge was that retailers of golf equipment had experienced generally sluggish sales for over a year.as discussed above,however,there is nothing contradictory or inconsistent about retailers with excess inventories in general and the company representation that those same retailers kept a smaller inventory of adams golf clubs in particular.accordingly,we find that adams golf representation of prompt delivery and relatively smaller retail inventories was not materially false or misleading.moreover,the fact that looking backward,one perceives a trend does not necessarily mean that conditions were such that one year earlier the situation was sufficiently obvious or noteworthy.
the plaintiffs also alleged that the retail oversupply affecting golf industry retailers also rendered misleading the statements made in the registration statement.in particular,the plaintiffs argued that those forecasts were misleading with respect to the prospects for growth in the golf industry.those statements included sanguine prospects for the golf industry and the rising popularity of the sport more generally.but we have firmly held that c laims that these kinds of vague expressions of hope by corporate managers could dupe the market have been almost uniformly rejected by the courts.burlington coat factory,at.
moreover,adams golf was not entirely upbeat about its future.the registration statement referred to a series of risks facing an investor,including the prospects of lagging demand for the company products,competitive products from rivals,unseasonable weather patterns that could diminish the amount of golf played,and an overall decline in discretionary consumer spending.applying the bespeaks caution doctrine,this court has held that meaningfully cautionary statements can render the alleged omissions or misrepresentations of statements immaterial as a matter of law.ep medsystems,echocath,cir collecting cases.and here the cautionary statements relate directly to the claim on which plaintiffs allegedly relied the general representations of better business ahead were mitigated by the discussion of the several factors that could have caused poor financial results.accordingly,we agree with the district court that plaintiffs allegations regarding the statements must also succumb to the motion to dismiss.
we conclude that the plaintiffs can prove no set of facts that would demonstrate that either the specific representation as to prompt delivery and retailers inventory of adams golf equipment or the general statements was materially misleading.as reasonable minds could not disagree on this issue,we affirm the district court dismissal of the plaintiffs retail oversupply claims as a matter of law.
after the dismissal of their complaint,plaintiffs filed a motion under.e to amend or alter the judgment so as to add new allegations by virtue of.they sought to introduce new factual allegations about both the gray market and retail oversupply claims.the district court denied the motion in a subsequent order,which ruling we review for abuse of disc
