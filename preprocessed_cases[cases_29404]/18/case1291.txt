introduction 
california franchise tax is imposed on every corporation that is doing business within california,whether or not it is incorporated,organized,qualified,or registered under california law.tax.code,subd.a.the phrase doing business,for purposes of the franchise tax,means actively engaging in any transaction for the purpose of financial or pecuniary gain or profit,subd.a see cal.code,tit,regulation.the minimum liability for all corporations falling within the purview of section is per year,subd.d.
the issue before us is whether the franchise tax applies to an corporation whose sole connection with california is a percent ownership interest in a california limited liability company llc investment fund.we conclude passively holding a percent ownership interest,with no right of control over the business affairs of the llc,does not constitute doing business in california within the meaning of section.we affirm the judgment of the trial court.
factual and procedural history 
this appeal is based on the parties for summary judgment.there are no material facts in dispute.
swart enterprises,swart,is a small corporation,incorporated in iowa.swart operates a farm in kansas,where it occasionally feeds cattle for beef sales in nebraska.its place of business and headquarters are located in iowa.swart has no physical presence in california,such as real or personal property,or employees it does not sell or market products or services to california and it is not registered with the california secretary of state to transact interstate business.
in,swart invested in cypress equipment fund xii,llc cypress llc or the fund and became a member of the llc.swart investment amounted to a percent ownership interest.this is swart sole connection with california.
cypress llc was formed as an llc under california law in for purposes of acquiring,holding,leasing,and disposing of capital equipment.the llc is,as opposed to.under cypress llc articles of organization and operating agreement,the sole manager of the fund,cypress equipment management corporation iii,was given full,exclusive and complete authority in the management and control of the business of the fund.
swart was not involved in any way in cypress llc operations or management.in fact,members other than the manager were prohibited from taking part in the control,conduct or operation of the fund and had no right or authority to act for or bind the fund.thus,members had no authority to act as an agent,bind,execute an instrument on behalf of cypress llc,or to otherwise act in any way on its behalf.
in and,cypress llc elected to be taxed as a partnership under federal and state law.during these same years,cypress llc was not required to pay taxes pursuant to section,subdivision e because the fund had insufficient income.
in,swart passively held its percent investment.however,based on its ownership interest in cypress llc,the franchise tax board ftb demanded that swart file a california corporate franchise tax return for the tax year ending june,and pay the minimum franchise tax due on that return.swart paid the tax,which amounted to with penalties and interest,but contested it and requested a refund.
to be required to file a california corporation franchise tax return and pay the minimum tax,swart had to be incorporated in california,qualified to transact business in california,or actively doing business in california,subds.a,b.the ftb concluded swart was doing business in california based on the fact it held an ownership interest in cypress llc,and cypress llc had elected to be treated as a partnership for purposes of federal income taxes.the ftb explained under section,a foreign business entity partnership,llc,or corporation is considered doing business in california if it is a member of an llc that is doing business in california,and under section,corporations doing business in the state of california must file a tax return and pay the annual minimum franchise tax of.
swart claimed it was not subject to the franchise tax because it held no other investments in california,it did not otherwise do business in california,and it was only a passive member in cypress llc.swart further claimed imposition of the franchise tax violated the due process clause and commerce clause of the united states constitution.the ftb denied swart request for refund.
swart timely filed a complaint seeking a tax refund and declaratory relief.after briefing and argument on the parties for summary judgment,the trial court entered an order granting swart motion for summary judgment and denying the ftb motion for summary judgment.swart was awarded a refund in the amount of.
on november,notice of entry of judgment was served.
on january,the ftb filed a timely notice of appeal.
swart was not doing business in california 
the attorney general contends swart was doing business in california because cypress llc elected to be treated as a partnership for federal income taxation purposes,and because cypress llc is doing business in california,so is swart.we disagree.
although this matter calls for our independent judgment,our views are substantially consistent with the trial court ruling,which we find to be logical and.we are not persuaded swart may be deemed to be doing business in california because it owns a percent interest in a llc doing business in california.swart only connection to california was a mere percent ownership interest it passively held during the tax year the franchise tax was imposed.this interest closely resembled that of a limited,rather than general,partnership as evinced by the fact swart had no interest in the specific property of cypress llc,it was not personally liable for the obligations of cypress llc,it had no right to act on behalf of or to bind cypress llc and,most importantly,it had no ability to participate in the management and control of cypress llc.because the business activities of a partnership can not be attributed to limited partners appeals of amman schmid finanz ag sbe cal.tax lexis amman schmid,swart can not be deemed to be doing business in california solely by virtue of its ownership interest in cypress llc.
standard of review 
the interpretation and application of a tax statute to uncontradicted facts is a pure question of law,which we review de novo.communications satellite franchise tax bd.d.we also review de novo the grant of a motion for summary judgment,particularly where issues of statutory interpretation and constitutional claims are presented.penrod county of san bernardino th.
b discussion 
swart was not doing business in california under the plain language of section and regulation 
california franchise tax is imposed on the net income of every corporation doing business within the limits of this state,subd.a.for tax years prior to january,section defined doing business as actively engaging in any transaction for the purpose of financial or pecuniary gain or profit.former,now,subd.a.the term actively is the opposite of passively or inactively and means active transaction for pecuniary gain or profit.golden state theatre realty johnson cal d,golden state theatre hise mccolgan cal d.for example,the purchase and sale of stocks or bonds may constitute doing business within the meaning of section,but t he mere receipt of dividends and interest by a corporation and the distribution of such income to its shareholders does not.regulation,subds.a,b.
here,the minimum franchise tax was imposed upon swart several years after swart made its investment and became a member of cypress llc.we are not persuaded such an investment,without more,is sufficient to conclude swart was doing business in california.like a shareholder receipt of dividends and interest,swart merely passively held onto its investment in the tax year the franchise tax was imposed.
nonetheless,citing to golden state theatre,supra,cal d,the attorney general claims the term doing business should be interpreted broadly to include swart passive investment.there,according to the attorney general,our supreme court held that an taxpayer passive investment in california was a transaction for pecuniary gain or profit,so the resulting dividends were subject to california tax.
golden state theatre does not suggest the term doing business should be interpreted broadly.there,the plaintiff,golden state theatre and realty corporation,owned a percent share of stock in a corporation,east bay theatres,which in turn owned a percent share of stock in two other corporations.golden state theatre,supra,cal d at.the plaintiff argued dividends received from its ownership interests were deductible from its gross income as dividends received during the income year from a corporation doing business in this state declared from income arising out of business done in this state.ibid.
the issue was whether east bay theatres,was merely a holding company or whether it was doing business in california,which would entitle the plaintiff to claim the deductions.golden state theatre,supra,cal d at.the defendant argued the entity was not actively engaged in any transaction because east bay theatres,was not established to operate a business,but to acquire property and derive income from properties,which did not even occur regularly.id.at.our supreme court concluded the activities conducted by east bay theatres,demonstrated it was doing business,because it had actively engaged in multiple transactions for pecuniary gain.id.at.specifically,it undertook the following activities endorsing a note of a subsidiary,borrowing funds,purchasing,owning and renting property,collecting rents,giving notices to quit,and arranging for improvements to property.id.at.
golden state theatre illustrates the distinction between actively,and passively or inactively engaging in business transactions.it does not suggest the term doing business should be read broadly.
there is no authority to support the conclusion cypress llc taxation election rendered swart a general partner of cypress llc 
the attorney general further contends swart was a general partner of cypress llc based on an election by cypress llc to be treated as a partnership for purposes of federal income taxes.according to the attorney general,if cypress llc is treated as a partnership,then swart is a general partner of the llc,and swart can therefore be imputed with doing business in california because cypress llc was doing business in california.this is because the activities of a partnership can be attributed to a general partner.we are not persuaded swart interest in cypress llc was transmuted into a general partnership interest for purposes of the franchise tax.
a taxation election refers to a business entity ability to choose its classification for federal income tax purposes by making a election.through regulations.llc are not recognized as an entity choice for federal or california tax law purposes.see,subd.b b ii,iii see also cal.code,tit,b,subd.c.accordingly,for tax purposes,a llc can elect to be treated as either a partnership or a corporation under the election regulations.california tax law conforms to the federal entity classification election system by mandating that an eligible entity be either classified or disregarded for california tax purposes,just as it is for federal tax purposes.see,subd.b b ii,iii cal.code,tit,b,subd.c.
the attorney general asserts an llc member is rendered a general partner of the llc as a result of an llc election to be treated as a partnership for federal taxation purposes.we are not directed to any legal authority to support this conclusion.the trial court identified this same deficiency in the attorney general motion below,but the error was not corrected on appeal.we note the treasury regulations,do not address whether an llc making a partnership election is considered a general partnership or a limited partnership for federal tax purposes,or whether llc members are considered general or limited partners.
nonetheless,relying on the assumption swart owns a general partnership interest in cypress llc and that this classification is relevant for purposes other than the computation of income taxes,the attorney general directs us to internal revenue code section.internal revenue code section provides that for federal income tax purposes,the character of an item of income,gain,loss,deduction,or credit included in a partner distributive share is be determined at the partnership level,as if such item were realized directly from the source from which realized by the partnership,or incurred in the same manner as incurred by the partnership.code,b.
the attorney general ostensibly directs us to internal revenue code section to make the following point wherever the partnership does business,the activities of the partnership are attributed to each partner,whether general or limited,with the consequence that in locations where the partnership is doing business,the partners are also doing business.this is because a partner is recognized as deriving a share of partnership income and loss from the place where the partnership transacts its business.
to explain why this conclusion is flawed,we first examine the attorney general claim that a taxation election is relevant for purposes other than federal income taxes.the plain language of the regulations provides that a taxation election applies for federal tax purposes and not just for federal income tax purposes.a.the absence of language of limitation suggests the llc election is relevant for tax purposes beyond the computation of federal income taxes.
swart disagrees and contends an llc is a separate entity from its owners,and an llc decision to be taxed as a partnership for federal income taxes does not mean the llc separate entity status may be disregarded for all taxation purposes,including the franchise tax.swart directs us to pierre comm r pierre on this point.
in pierre,supra,the united states tax court considered whether the regulations altered the federal gift tax valuation regime.id.at.the taxpayer was a new york resident who wanted to give money to her son and granddaughter.id.at.to ensure the family wealth stayed intact,the taxpayer formed a llc,created trusts for both her son and granddaughter,and transferred million in cash and securities to the llc in exchange for a percent interest in the entity.ibid.the taxpayer then transferred a percent interest in the llc to each trust,and sold each of the trusts a percent interest in the llc in exchange for promissory notes.ibid.the taxpayer paid gift tax in the amount of per transfer,the value of the interests transferred after discounts for lack of marketability and lack of control.id.at.the internal revenue service claimed because the llc was a disregarded entity,which is indistinguishable from its owner,the taxpayer should have valued the gift as a transfer of the underlying assets,minus the value of the promissory notes,which would have amounted to a substantially greater tax burden.ibid.
the tax court held that although a llc was treated as a disregarded entity under the federal regulations,that designation did not control the valuation of the llc interests transferred for federal gift tax purposes.pierre,supra,at.according to the tax court,state laws applicable to the llc controlled the legal rights of the parties,not the llc taxation election,and the legal relationships between the parties justified discounts for lack of control and marketability.ibid.
the attorney general argues pierre is distinguishable because there,a llc was at issue,and a llc can not elect to be treated as a partnership for tax purposes.the attorney general argument misses the point.pierre stands for the proposition that a taxation election may not control for all taxation purposes in all circumstances.
assuming,arguendo,that a taxation election is relevant for purposes of determining whether an llc member is doing business in california under section,the attorney general conclusion is flawed for one other significant reason it draws no distinction between general and limited partnership interests.the state board of equalization sbe has previously recognized a limited partner is not doing business merely by virtue of its ownership interest in a limited partnership.
in amman schmid,supra,sbe cal.tax lexis,the appellants,foreign corporations,acquired limited partnership interests in descending tiers of limited partnerships.the bottom tier of the partnerships were indisputably doing business in california.the ftb claimed the appellants were also doing business in california under section because the general partners were executing business transactions in california as agents for the limited partnerships and all the partners.the corporate limited partners challenged this finding,because doing business requires actively engaging in any transaction for the purpose of financial or pecuniary gain or profit,subd.a.while section does not require a regular course of business,it nevertheless does require active participation in the activity,and limited partners are necessarily passive or inactive members of the partnership.amman schmid,supra,at cal.tax lexis at.
the sbe noted that under the california revised limited partnership act.code,tit,ch,the foreign corporations,as limited partners,were not liable for the obligations of the partnerships,former,they could not act on behalf of the partnership,had no interest in specific property of the partnership,former,and their ownership interests included only intangible property,which is ordinarily located at the domicile of the limited partner.amman schmid,supra,sbe at cal.tax lexis at pp,citing appeals of amyas and evelyn ames et sbe.the sbe concluded the corporate limited partners could not be doing business in california simply because they owned interests as limited partners in partnerships engaged in business in california because a general partner simply does not have agency rights over the obligations or the property of the limited partners.amman schmid,supra,at cal.tax lexis at.
the sbe noted it had previously concluded otherwise.in appeal of ahmanson company sbe cal.tax lexis,ahmanson,the sbe concluded the source of a limited partner income or loss from the partnership is where the partnership property is located and the partnership activity is carried on.id.at cal.tax lexis at.as a result,partnership losses were determined to be sourced in turkey and not in california,because the partnerships were regularly engaged in business in turkey and the appellant,a limited partner,was therefore also engaged in business in turkey.in amman schmid,the sbe changed its position,explaining,this observation is arguably true for general partnerships.but more specific examination has convinced us this is not necessarily true for limited partners.amman schmid,supra,sbe at cal.tax lexis at.
amman schmid strongly supports the conclusion swart was not doing business in california.like the limited partners in amman schmid,swart had no interest in the specific property of cypress llc.code,former,it was not personally liable for the obligations of cypress llc,former,subd.a,it had no right to act on behalf of or bind cypress llc,former,subd.b,and swart was prohibited from participating in the management and control of cypress llc.
the attorney general claims amman schmid is distinguishable because it examined limited partnerships exclusively,rather than llc,when it concluded doing business requires an active role in a limited partnership,rather than a passive investment in a limited partnership.the attorney general further contends amman schmid does not even acknowledge that limited partnerships can elect to be treated as general partnerships for purposes of franchise income taxation.
we are perplexed by these arguments.if an llc taxation election renders the llc and its members partners for all taxation purposes,then no meaningful distinction can be drawn between the limited partnership interests in amman schmid and swart partnership interest although it is unclear to us what the attorney general means by stating a limited partnership can elect to be treated as a general partnership for income tax purposes,we are not directed to any legal authority to support the conclusion that an llc taxation election automatically transmutes llc members into general partners for tax purposes relevant to this appeal.as we explain below,swart partnership interest was akin to a limited rather than general partnership interest.
swart interest in cypress llc was comparable to a limited partnership interest 
swart contends that like a limited partner,it was merely a passive investor,and it had no right to manage or control the business operations of cypress llc.on this basis,it asserts it can not be deemed to be doing business in california solely by virtue of holding a membership interest in an llc doing business in california.we agree.
members in an llc have limited liability for the company debts and obligations kwok transnation title ins.th,and members hold no direct ownership interest in the company specific property.code,former.similarly,a limited partner interest in a partnership is intangible personal property,which ordinarily is located in the domicile of the limited partner.amman schmid,supra,sbe at cal.tax lexis at pp,citing appeals of amyas and evelyn ames et,supra,sbe.although members of an llc may generally participate in the management and control of the business paclink communications,superior court th,whereas limited partners risk losing their limited liability protection by doing so.code,subd.a,this ability ultimately depends on how management is vested within the parties operating agreement and articles of incorporation.
relations among members and the llc are governed by its articles of incorporation and operating agreement.code,former,subd.a,as amended by stats,ch,and repealed by stats,ch,operative.where an llc is established as a llc,any matter relating to the activities of the limited liability company is decided exclusively by the managers.code,subd.c.while llc members have the ability to remove the manager with a majority vote,subd.c,they have no right to control the management and conduct of the llc activities,nor do they have the apparent authority to do so see.code,subd.a every member of a llc is an agent of the llc for the purpose of its business or affairs.
here,the operating agreement executed by cypress llc and its members established the fund as a llc.the operating agreement gave the manager full exclusive and complete authority in the management and control of the business of the fund for the purposes stated in the operating agreement and made all decisions affecting the fund.the specific matters upon which cypress llc members were authorized to act did not empower members to manage or control cypress llc.in fact,the agreement expressly prohibited m embers other than the manager from taking part in the control,conduct or operation of the fund and had no right or authority to act for or bind cypress llc.the attorney general does not contend swart acted outside of the operating agreement.
thus,the relationship between cypress llc and swart supports the conclusion swart was a quintessential passive investor.swart had no authority to participate in the management and control of the fund,it was not liable for the debts and obligations of the fund,it did not own an interest in specific property of the fund,nor could it act on behalf of the fund.under these circumstances,swart interest in cypress llc was akin to that of a limited partner,and it can not be deemed to be doing business in california by virtue of the fact cypress llc was doing business in california.
the attorney general contends members of an llc are themselves doing business in california by virtue of their ownership interest in the llc,whether or not they are members of a llc or a llc.it appears this conclusion was derived from a legal ruling issued by the ftb during the pendency of litigation in this matter.cal.franchise tax,legal ruling july,cal.ftb lexis.to the extent the arguments on appeal were also derived from the ftb legal ruling,we disagree with its analysis and note it contradicts the position previously taken by the ftb 
in its legal ruling,the ftb discussed a hypothetical assuming a california llc is doing business in california.the ftb concluded that a member corporation holding a percent interest in an llc,not incorporated,organized,or registered to do business in california,and
