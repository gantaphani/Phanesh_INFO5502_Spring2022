omnibus financial group fell short of its founders hopes.formed by four in,it was down to two john valinote and stephen ballis by,and in valinote stopped participating in the firm management.early in valinote decided to withdraw from the foundering concern and asked ballis for an exit strategy.this led ballis to initiate the clause of omnibus operating agreement.this procedure,common in closely held businesses,allows one investor to set a price on the shares for an llc,the membership interests next the other investor decides whether to buy the first investor interest,or sell his own,at that price.the possibility that the person naming the price can be forced either to buy or to sell keeps the first mover honest.
nothing in the operating agreement prescribes how investments are to be valued for this purpose.a mechanical valuation for use in the event of a member death or resignation does not apply to voluntary transactions among members.ballis named a price of for each interest in omnibus,implying a total of for the stake that each of the two held.valinote then decided to sell his interest to ballis at that paying ballis to take his off his hands.at the time surely this was no coincidence,omnibus owed valinote exactly that sum to repay a loan that valinote had made to the firm.so the bottom line was that in march valinote surrendered his interest to ballis,who became the sole owner of omnibus financial group.no money changed hands.valinote could have acquired ballis interest on the same terms but must have thought that the real value was even lower than the negative price that ballis had specified.
later events confirmed the dim estimate of the venture prospects.in december omnibus defaulted on a debt to a bank.the bank then collected on the guarantees of this debt that valinote and ballis had made.valinote demanded that ballis indemnify him for his share and for any future payments that valinote may be required to make.omnibus has at least one other bank loan of,though it may be secured by real estate.ballis refused,and the district through a magistrate judge on the parties consent,see c,in this suit under the diversity jurisdiction,a held that ballis is under no obligation to do so.wl,dist.lexis.the magistrate judge concluded that the purchaser in a transaction under omnibus operating agreement acquires the seller membership interest,and that any obligations of the seller to the firm are extinguished,see the buying member must a ssume and become liable for all obligations of the selling member to the company,but that obligations such as guarantees to third parties are unaffected.that the implication of language dealing with obligations to the firm while omitting other obligations.paragraph.j of the operating agreement requires members to indemnify each other for obligations under guarantees,but the court held that this refers to current members,not to former members such as valinote.
the operating agreement offers some succor to former members.requires indemnification of any person for liability reasonably incurred while that person was a member.that covers payment on a guarantee that enabled omnibus to raise operating capital.but the indemnitor under.is t he company,which is to say omnibus,and omnibus is broke.likewise valinote right to indemnity under the law of paying on the guarantee,valinote stepped into the bank shoes and acquired its a right against omnibus.what valinote wants,however,is indemnity from ballis,who unlike omnibus remains solvent.that claim lacks support in.and the law of suretyship,and it runs up against the principle that corporate shareholders or llc members are not liable for the venture debts.that the point of limited liability people put at risk the amounts they invest or contract for explicitly,as by guarantees but not their full personal wealth.omnibus operating agreement makes this explicit.d says that members shall look solely to the assets of the company for the return of their capital and shall have no recourse against the members,or any member except as specifically provided in this agreement.
valinote does not contend that anything in the operating agreement specifically requires indemnity from ballis.instead he insists that it is so strongly implicit in the procedure that it should be treated as if explicit.first,he observes,the procedure allows a member to extricate himself from the company that ca be done unless all financial entanglements are wrapped up.otherwise a departing member remains at risk for things that have passed beyond his control the firm might be sound at the time of withdrawal and be driven to ruin by the remaining members,triggering the guarantees.that uncompensated and uncontrollable risk should be eliminated by an indemnity requirement,valinote insists.second,valinote contrasts the operation of the procedure with the consequences of an outright resignation.under a resigning member receives the mechanically computed value of each interest and shall forfeit all further interest in the company,but shall not be relieved of or released from any personal guarantees or other personal covenants.no such provision appears in,which covers the procedure this implies to valinote that sellers under are relieved of guarantees.why would he have sold to ballis at a negative price under when he could have resigned under and demanded repayment of the loan,unless the procedure shifted the financial burden of the guarantees third comes the coup de gr√¢ce because omnibus was a limited liability company,membership interests can not be worth less than zero.shares of a bankrupt corporation trade for a positive price as a result of limited liability,for shares are worth at worst the scrap value of the paper,and the firm might recover.yet ballis valued each interest in omnibus at.this must mean,valinote insists,that ballis was covering in advance the risk of indemnity on any guarantees.how else could the price go negative 
there is some force to these observations,but not enough to justify overriding the venerable principle of limited liability,which may be vital to a business ability to raise capital.especially not when the operating agreement reinforces that principle by proscribing personal liability except as specifically provided in this agreement.the argument that strongly implicit is as good as explicit is equivalent to a plea that the real explicit language of the the clause limiting personal overridden.that would make all contractual language unreliable,and such a step would not in the long run further the goals of investors such as ballis and valinote,who draft these complex agreements in the belief that what they have written will be enforced when push comes to shove.although enforcement of the agreement may have it makes complete extrication more complex and exposes the withdrawing investor to risk if the unwinding is are not insuperable.valinote could have negotiated with the bank to cancel his guarantee the bank might have agreed,for a price,or ballis might have agreed to assume the liability again for a price.with so few people involved,the negotiations would not be especially costly.far better for valinote and ballis to have resolved this issue between themselves ex ante than to ask a court to guess ex post what that deal would have looked when the process of guessing would override the parties written agreement demanding specificity.paragraph.d also makes it inappropriate to turn to parol evidence about the negotiating history and the parties expectations,which are even less certain than inferences based on the difference between and.
nor is the negative price or the contrast between under and resignation under.c an enigma that can be understood only by assuming that ballis had rolled into the price the risk of indemnifying valinote.for the operating agreement did not strictly adhere to limited liability there is a clause that appears specifically in the agreement.it is.j,which we now reproduce in full
