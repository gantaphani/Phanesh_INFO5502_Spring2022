appellants predecessors in interest borrowed money from two banks to finance a golf course located in la veta,colorado after financial difficulties,appellants settled the inevitable ensuing litigation by paying off the loan to one of the banks.they contend that an agreement between the banks required distribution of the settlement proceeds to appellants debts with both banks.when appellants learned that the settlement money had not been apportioned,they filed suit alleging breach of contract,breach of the duties of good faith and fair dealing,breach of fiduciary duty,constructive fraud,and negligence.appellants lost in all respects at the summary judgment stage and now appeal.exercising jurisdiction pursuant to,we affirm.
before delving into the facts of this case,we note that this appeal is significantly complicated by the fact that each party has gone through several incarnations.to assist the reader,each row in the following chart lists a party,with the parties name changes shown by moving from left earliest in time to right most recent.we refer to appellants collectively as grandote and the other parties by the names applicable to the time period under discussion.
in the,grandote owned a piece of land and water rights in huerfano county,colorado.to develop a golf course and residences on the land,grandote borrowed money from two banks in million from washington,which was secured by a first lien on the land,and from emmettsburg,which was secured by a second lien on the land and a first lien on the water rights.by,grandote needed more cash to complete the golf course and sought additional financing from washington.as a condition of receiving additional credit the revolving loan,grandote gave washington authority to arrange with emmettsburg any modifications to the emmettsburg loan that washington believed necessary to provide adequate security for the new revolving loan.pursuant to that authority,washington and emmettsburg entered into the emmettsburg agreement,which provided that a ll collections received by either washington or emmettsburg on account of the washington loan or the emmettsburg loan shall be shared pro rata by the parties,with going to emmettsburg and the remaining going to washington.i doc.ex.the parties dispute whether grandote was aware of this agreement,although it is undisputed that grandote was not a party to it.
life on the links was not all bliss,and grandote suffered financial setbacks leading to litigation involving grandote and washington successor in interest,metropolitan,regarding payment of grandote loans.that litigation was settled by means of a settlement stipulation,id.ex,which,after further negotiations,was modified by a payment and release agreement,ii doc.ex.pursuant to those agreements,grandote paid metropolitan million to resolve the litigation and pay off the loans.
in september,rtc,which had become the receiver for emmettsburg,initiated foreclosure proceedings on the emmettsburg loan.grandote attempted to pay off the outstanding balance on the loan.now aware of the emmettsburg agreement,grandote interpreted the all collections provision as applying to the settlement proceeds grandote had paid to metropolitan and reasoned that of its million payment to metropolitan should have been applied to the emmettsburg loan.grandote subtracted this amount roughly from the outstanding loan balance and tendered the remaining amount due on the loan just under to rtc.rtc refused this tender because metropolitan had not given any of the settlement proceeds to rtc.grandote viewed this as a breach of the emmettsburg agreement and sued rtc.wahatoyas acquired rtc interest in the emmettsburg loan and was substituted for rtc in the action.metropolitan whose interests were acquired by first bank,and then by bank was brought in as a defendant on the theory that if grandote prevailed,then would seek contribution from.bank.
we need not detail the complex nature of the proceedings below except to note that they were initially filed in colorado state court and then removed to federal court,and that the district court granted summary judgment against grandote on all claims.
before we reach the merits,an unusual procedural issue requires our attention.the notice of appeal naming grandote as a party to this appeal was filed,pro se,by dwight harrison and was later amended to include dwight sons,charles,john,and paul.harrison is not an attorney,and no attorney ever filed a notice of appeal on behalf of grandote wahatoyas and bank argue that the notice of appeal was deficient as to grandote 
as a general matter,a corporation or other business entity can only appear in court through an attorney and not through a corporate officer appearing pro se.see flora constr.fireman fund ins,cir the rule is well established that a corporation can appear in a court of record only by an attorney at law.in this case,however,only the notice of appeal was filed by a,and grandote now has counsel who have performed all of the substantive legal work.
the ninth circuit recently addressed the issue of whether a corporation notice of appeal,signed and filed by a corporate officer,is invalid because it was not signed and filed by counsel.bigelow brady in re bigelow,cir.the court concluded that the notice was valid because a notice of appeal is just notice.it is not a motion or a pleading.id.citing.becker montgomery,d i mperfections in noticing an appeal should not be fatal where no genuine doubt exists about who is appealing,from what judgment,to which appellate court.the first circuit reached the same conclusion in a case citing bigelow.instituto de educacion universal united states dep t of,cir w e believe that a valid distinction can be drawn between ongoing legal representation and the essentially ministerial action involved in the filing of a notice of appeal.
we find the reasoning of these cases persuasive and thus fail to see any compelling reason to refuse to recognize a corporation notice of appeal,signed and filed by a corporate officer,so long as a lawyer promptly thereafter enters a formal appearance on behalf of the corporation and undertakes the representation.bigelow,at.appellees argue that bigelow requires a lawyer to promptly enter an appearance after the notice of appeal,a requirement they claim grandote failed to observe because grandote counsel did not enter an appearance until eight months after the notice of appeal was filed.we disagree.grandote retained counsel in time to perform the necessary substantive legal work,briefing and oral argument.under these circumstances,we hold that grandote is a proper party.see id.at c ounsel for appellant entered his appearance of record prior to the time any briefs,motions or responses were due and filed the brief,responded to the motions and argued the case.under the circumstances,we hold that the notice of appeal was not invalid instituto de educacion universal,at holding that a corporate appellant was a proper party because it retained counsel to take up the cudgels and prosecute the appeal.
