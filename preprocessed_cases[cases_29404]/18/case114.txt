gcx was a delaware corporation that publicly traded on the new york stock exchange nyse.richard smith,peter read,francis sutherby,and gail edwards defendants were all former officers and directors of gcx during the relevant class period gcx was in the movie theater business in the united states and south america and also managed an investment capital portfolio.gcx was the parent company of several subsidiaries,through which it conducted its business operations.

in january,gcx filed its annual report for form which will be reviewed in detail below.that filing,like the press release,anticipated that gcx would emerge from reorganization in a stronger position.contrary to gcx expectations,however,the negotiations between management and creditors did not go well and,on june,gcx announced that it had signed a letter of intent with certain buyers who would purchase all of gcx stock.under the terms of the letter of intent,current shareholders would only receive payment if the liquidation of the investment portfolio yielded more than million.during the class period,the stock traded at between and per share.after the announcement on june,which marks the end of the class period,gcx stock price dropped to a share.
ii.analysis 
the central issue in this appeal is whether the plaintiffs complaint states a cause of action for material omissions under section b of the securities act.we conclude that it does not.
to state a claim under section b of the securities act,a plaintiff must allege,inter alia,that a defendant a made an untrue statement of a material fact or b omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances in which they were made,not misleading.b a b.
sec rule,makes it unlawful for any person,
a t o employ any device,scheme or artifice to defraud,b t o make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading,or c t o engage in any act,practice or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.
id.we evaluate the allegations in the complaint with both proscriptions in mind.
plaintiffs concede that defendants have not engaged in material misstatements thus,to state a claim for securities fraud,they rely on the material omissions prong of b.under the pslra,a complaint must identify what plaintiffs believe to be the material omission and why that omission is material.id.b b.the test for materiality,taken from the case of basic,levinson,d,was recently summarized as follows 
a fact is material if it is substantially likely that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.information which would have assumed actual significance in the deliberations of a reasonable shareholder is material.in general,the materiality of a statement or omission is a question of fact that should normally be left to a jury rather than resolved by the court on a motion to dismiss.thus,we review the complaint only to determine that it pleads the existence of such statements and presents a plausible jury question of materiality.
bielski cabletron,in re cabletron,cir quoting basic,at.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
the complaint focuses on certain gcx financial arrangements as well as the press release.plaintiffs allege that defendants omitted material facts from gcx financial disclosure statements.we discuss each in turn.
a.the press release 
the press release issued by gcx on october,contained the following information 
gc companies,gcx,parent company of general cinema theaters,announced today that gc companies and certain of its domestic subsidiaries,including general cinema theaters,are filing voluntary petitions to reorganize their business under chapter of the bankruptcy code.the company further stated that certain of its subsidiaries in florida,georgia,louisiana,and tennessee are filing chapter liquidation proceedings.the filings were made in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware.in its filings,gcx will report total assets of million and total liabilities of million as of august.
the company believes that chapter reorganization provides the company with the most effective means to terminate and restructure unprofitable leases and position the company to succeed in today highly competitive market.
through the chapter process,the company expects to be able to terminate unprofitable leases,reduce the company operating expenses and make necessary improvements to the business to create a strong competitive future for gcx.while the company completes the restructuring,its operations are expected to continue.
the company is arranging up to million of debtor in possession financing to provide the company with resources to fund its operations during the chapter proceedings.
after announcing a management restructuring which included the named defendants in this action,the press release ended with the following 
statements in this press release are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the pslra of.the words expect,anticipate,intend,plan,believe,seek,estimate and similar expressions are intended to identify such statements however this press release also contains other statements.gcx cautions that there are various important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the statements among them are the overall viability of the company operational reorganization and financial restructuring plan 
to the extent that plaintiffs seek to state a claim under the securities laws for a deceptive press release or as an indication that the company omitted material information from its filings,we agree with the district court that the press release contained statements,as so stated therein,and therefore comes under the protection of the statutory safe harbor.see c see also greebel at discussing the safe harbor for statements suna bailey,cir stating,in a case,that no reasonable investor would have read these statements,especially as they are accompanied by cautionary language,as promises or guarantees of future performance.thu
