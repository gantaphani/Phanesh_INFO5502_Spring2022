defendants and appellants david dubois elder and michael olenick,as trustees of the betty gross thomas trust,appeal from an order granting in part a petition filed by plaintiff and respondent john thomas,also known as piri thomas,to reallocate a million trust distribution from principal to income.appellants contend that under probate code section,subdivision d b the distribution amounted to a partial liquidation which must be allocated to principal.we conclude that the trial court correctly determined that the amount of the distribution did not meet the threshold percentage level constituting a partial liquidation under the statute.accordingly,the million distribution was properly allocated to income.
factual and procedural background 
john thomas thomas is the sole income beneficiary of a testamentary trust trust created in january by his wife,betty gross thomas,shortly before her death.during his lifetime,thomas is to receive all trust income.appellants,who are betty thomas sons by prior marriages,are the trustees of the trust and hold a remainder interest in it.upon thomas death,they will each receive a interest in the trust and will hold as trustees their sister interest.upon their sister death,they will receive her interest as well.
the trust sole asset is shares of the chelsea street corporation chelsea,representing approximately percent of chelsea total ownership.chelsea primary asset is property in new york improved by a hotel which chelsea owns and operates.
chelsea is a subchapter s corporation.as a result,chelsea shareholders are responsible for paying tax on their allocable share of chelsea reported income,regardless of whether that income is distributed to the shareholders.to enable the trust to hold shares in chelsea as a subchapter s corporation,a court order in established the trust as a qualified subchapter s trust.this order required that the trust have only one income beneficiary who would be treated as the owner of the shares for the purpose of paying income tax.as the sole income beneficiary,thomas has been responsible for paying all income tax on the chelsea reported income allocable to the trust shares.
between and,thomas received approximately in income from the trust.during the same time period,chelsea withheld from all shareholders distribution of approximately million of reported income.as of december,thomas share of the undistributed income amounted to.in addition to the income tax thomas paid on income he received from the trust,he paid approximately in income tax on the trust share of undistributed referred to as phantom income.
chelsea financial statement as of december,reported total gross assets of.in october,chelsea distributed to its shareholders million of the million in undistributed income the trust received million as its pro rata share.thomas had previously paid in income tax on the million distribution.
after seeking advice of counsel,appellants allocated the million to trust principal,rather than income,on the ground that the total distribution million constituted more than percent of chelsea gross assets and thus amounted to a partial liquidation as defined by section,subdivisions c and d b.
in september,thomas filed a petition for adjustment between principal and income,or,in the alternative,for appointment of an independentspecial trustee to make adjustments between principal and income.he contended that the million should have been allocated to income,because the amount of the distribution to the trust did not exceed percent of chelsea gross assets.he further asserted that,at a minimum,an amount equal to what he had previously paid in income tax on the distribution be allocated to income.about the same time,he also filed two other petitions challenging legal,accounting and trustees fees.
a trial on all matters was held in may.the facts were essentially undisputed.the parties stipulated that the million distribution was comprised of undistributed income and did not include the proceeds from the sale of any corporate asset.they further stipulated that thomas had already paid income tax on the million distribution.the court heard extensive argument from counsel concerning the application of section and took judicial notice of the legislative history of the statute submitted by thomas.
on june,the trial court issued an order granting the petition to allocate the million distribution to income and denying the fee petitions.it later incorporated those rulings into a statement of decision.with respect to the allocation issue,the statement of decision provided in relevant part probate code b mandates that,except as otherwise provided,a trustee shall allocate to income money received from an entity.the phrase money received refers to monies received by the trustee s not the cumulative amount of distribution to all distributees whether related or unrelated to the trust.accordingly,the million distribution which respondents,on behalf of the trust,received from the entity,chelsea,is money received by a trustee from an entity under subdivision b.the court rejects respondents contention that the million distribution should be allocated to principal as a partial liquidation pursuant to probate code d b.the court further determined that if it had not allocated the entire distribution to income,section,subdivision d,would have entitled thomas to a credit against the distribution for the he had previously paid in taxes.
appellants timely appealed.
discussion 
the issue before us is a narrow one.the only issue raised by this appeal is whether,for the purpose of determining if a partial liquidation has occurred under section,subdivision c,the total amount of money and property received in a distribution is the amount received by the trustee or the amount of the entire distribution by an entity,subd.d b.since this issue involves the interpretation of a statute and the application of that statute to undisputed facts,it is subject to this court independent review.people ex rel.lockyer shamrock foods cal th,d,automotive funding group,garamendi th,d.
a.the enactment of section.
effective january,the legislature enacted the uniform principal and income act upaia.et the upaia was designed to update the law to take account of new estate planning practices and financial instruments,as well as to make principal and income rules consistent with the prudent investor rule embodied in the uniform prudent investor act.recommendation uniform principal and income act february cal.law.revision com.
section,enacted as part of this legislation,directs how a trustee should allocate money to a trust received from an entity and provides a for the purposes of this section,entity means a corporation,partnership,limited liability company,regulated investment company,real estate investment trust,common trust fund,or any other organization in which a trustee has an interest b except as otherwise provided in this section,a trustee shall allocate to income money received from an entity.c a trustee shall allocate to principal the following receipts from an entity property other than money.money received in one distribution or a series of related distributions in exchange for part or all of a trust interest in the entity.money received in total or partial liquidation of the entity.money received from an entity that is a regulated investment company or a real estate investment trust if the money distributed is a capital gain dividend for federal income tax purposes.d for purposes of paragraph of subdivision c money is received in partial liquidation a to the extent that the entity,at or near the time of a distribution,indicates that it is a distribution in partial liquidation,or b if the total amount of money and property received in a distribution or series of related distributions is greater than percent of the entity gross assets,as shown by the entity yearend financial statements immediately preceding the initial receipt.money is not received in partial liquidation,nor may it be taken into account under clause b of paragraph,to the extent that it does not exceed the amount of income tax that a trustee or beneficiary is required to pay on taxable income of the entity that distributes the money.e a trustee may rely on a statement made by an entity about the source or character of a distribution if the statement is made at or near the time of distribution by the entity board of directors or other person or group of persons authorized to exercise powers to pay money or transfer property comparable to those of a corporations board of directors.
summarized,section provides that a trustee must allocate receipts from an entity to income,unless those receipts meet one of the exceptions established in section,subdivision c.if an exception applies,the receipts must be allocated to principal.initially,appellants determined that the million constituted a partial liquidation under section,subdivision c.they reasoned that the entire million chelsea distribution met the definition contained in section,subdivision d b,because the amount of the distribution was greater than percent of the entity gross assets,as shown by the entity yearend financial statements immediately preceding the initial receipt,subd.d b.the trial court concluded,to the contrary,that the amount measured by section,subdivision d b,is the distribution received by the trust,not the entire distribution by the entity.accordingly,it found that the million distribution did not meet the percent threshold necessary to qualify it as a partial liquidation.thus,our task is to ascertain the meaning of the phrase the total amount of money and property received in a distribution as used in section,subdivision d b.
b.the statutory language of section,subdivision d b,plainly refers to the amount of money received by the trust.
in statutory construction cases,our fundamental task is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.citation.we begin by examining the statutory language,giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning.citations.if the terms of the statute are unambiguous,we presume the lawmakers meant what they said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.citations.estate of griswold cal th,d.we turn first to the words of the statute themselves,giving them their usual,ordinary meanings and,if possible,giving each word and phrase significance.curle superior court cal th,d,young gannon th,d.an interpretation that renders related provisions nugatory must be avoided citation each sentence must be read not in isolation but in the light of the statutory scheme citation and if a statute is amenable to two alternative interpretations,the one that leads to the more reasonable result will be followed citation.lungren deukmejian cal d.exceptions to the general provisions of a statute are to be narrowly construed only those circumstances that are within the words and reason of the exception may be included.corbett hayward dodge th,d.at all times,o ur foremost task remains ascertainment of the legislative intent,including consideration of the entire scheme of law of which it is part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain effectiveness.citation.city of long beach california citizens for neighborhood empowerment th,d.
guided by the foregoing principles,we conclude that the total amount of money and property received in a distribution means the total amount of money received by the trust,not the total amount of an entity distribution.we find that the legislature use of the term received is significant.that word and its derivatives are used consistently throughout the upaia to refer to the character of money or property to be administered through the trust.see,income means money or property that a fiduciary receives as current return from a principal asset,a trustee shall allocate to principal a to the extent not allocated to income under this chapter,assets received from a transferor during the transferor lifetime,subd.b a trustee shall allocate to income percent of the receipts from a liquidating asset and the balance to principal.in miranda national emergency services,th,d,the court explained that consistent usage implies consistent meaning a word or phrase,or its derivatives,accorded a particular meaning in one part or portion of a law,should be accorded the same meaning in other parts or portions of the law,especially if the word is used more than once in the same section of the law.
more specifically,within section,the words received and receipts are used consistently to refer to the amount to be allocated by the trustee.the statute generally provides that a trustee shall allocate to income money received from an entity,subd.b.in that context,the term received plainly refers only to money that the trustee has the power to allocate.the statute then proceeds to describe the exceptions to the general other words,the circumstances under which a trustee must allocate to principal the following receipts from an entity,subd.c.similar to the term received in subdivision b,the term receipts in subdivision c must again refer only to money allocable by the trustee.the exception at issue here involves m oney received in total or partial liquidation of the entity,subd.c.according to the statutory definition of this exception,m oney is received in partial liquidation if the total amount of money and property received in a distribution or series of related distributions is greater than percent of the entity gross assets,as shown by the entity yearend financial statements immediately preceding the initial receipt,subd.d b.
we must construe the term received used in section,subdivision d b,to have the same meaning as when used in other portions of the statute.miranda national emergency services,supra,th at,d accord,wilcox birtwhistle cal th,d,words or phrases given a particular meaning in one part of a statute must be given the same meaning in other parts of the statute stillwell state bar cal d,it is a rule of construction that when a word or phrase has been given a particular scope or meaning in one part or portion of a law it shall be given the same scope and meaning in other parts or portions of the law.thus,money received in a distribution necessarily refers only to money that the trustee has the power to allocate.the statute can not reasonably be construed to refer to money distributed by an entity over which the trustee has no control.to construe the term received more expansively than when used in other portions of the statute would also be contrary to the settled principle of statutory construction that e xceptions to the general rule of a statute are to be strictly construed.barnes chamberlain d.accord corbett hayward dodge,supra,th at,d.
our conclusion is buttressed by a separate subdivision in section that qualifies subdivision d b money is not received in partial liquidation,nor may it be taken into account under clause b of paragraph,to the extent that it does not exceed the amount of income tax that a trustee or beneficiary is required to pay on taxable income of the entity that distributes the money,subd.d.in other words,money received in a distribution can not be considered a partial liquidation allocable to trust principal to the extent that the money is needed to satisfy the recipients tax burden.the fact that the deduction applies only to a trustee or beneficiary is a further reason to construe section,subdivision d b,as referring only to money received by the trust.it would make little sense to calculate whether a distribution amounted to more than percent of an entity gross assets by deducting only one party taxes from the entity distribution to all parties.on the other hand,the tax deduction is reasonable and necessary if the only amount of money at issue is the distribution to the trust 
appellants do not focus on language referring to money received in a distribution rather,they rely on a dictionary definition of the term partial liquidation,which describes a distribution of assets to all shareholders.see blacks law dict.ed.but that definition is irrelevant,given that the statute itself provides its own definition of the circumstances constituting a partial liquidation,subd.d.if the legislature has provided an express definition of a term,that definition ordinarily is bi
