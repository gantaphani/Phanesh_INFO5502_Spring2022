who are former directors and officers of mediaone,seek compensation for stock options that were cashed out in a merger between at t wireless and cingular.mediaone originally granted its directors and officers options under a stock option plan.an,clause in that stock option plan preserved the option holders economic position upon the happening of certain specified events,including a merger.
at t acquired mediaone in a stock for stock merger in.in that merger,mediaone options were converted into at t options and continued to be governed by the terms of the mediaone plan.
in,at t spun off wireless.in that transaction,all at t options holders,including,received new options in wireless.an employee benefits agreement and wireless adjustment agreement governed the new wireless options created through the spin off.in addition to those two agreements,the mediaone stock option plan also continued to govern new options in wireless.
in,cingular agreed to a cash out merger with wireless.in that transaction,which gave rise to this dispute,wireless options holders were cashed out at per share minus the exercise price of the option.
the who originally received options in mediaone that were converted into wireless options as a result of the foregoing transaction filed a complaint in the court of chancery against at t and appellee cingular.the plaintiffs claimed that wireless now cingular violated the terms of the plan when it cashed out wireless options without any compensation for the lost time value of their options argued,in the alternative,that at t is liable for any breach of the plan by wireless because at t had a duty to obligate wireless legally to observe those terms.
in a letter to plaintiffs counsel and in its answer to the complaint,at t initially took the position that wireless could not cash out any wireless options based on at t understanding of the employee benefits plan and the wireless adjustment plan,which governed all wireless options created in the spin off.in order to bind wireless to its contractual duties as at t saw them,at t arbitrated its dispute with wireless.after a hearing,the arbitration panel found that wireless did not breach either of those plans.at t then changed litigation strategy in the court of chancery,by asserting that the plan did not proscribe wireless from cashing out the options.although at t acknowledged that the plan required at t to preserve economic position immediately prior to a merger,it argued that in the context of a cash out merger,economic position was limited to the intrinsic value of the options.
a vice chancellor denied cross motions for summary judgment,holding that section of the plan controlled the options but that the term economic position in that section was ambiguous.the vice chancellor then held a trial to consider extrinsic evidence that could aid him in interpreting that term.
interpreting section,the vice chancellor noted at t initial position that wireless could not cancel the stock options and accorded great weight to at t initial stance.the vice chancellor also found that the parties earlier transactions,where stock options were replaced with new stock options,demonstrated that the parties intended to preserve the time value of the options in each transaction.because wireless did not preserve the time value of the options in the merger,he found at t liable for a breach of the plan.the vice chancellor further found that at t had not transferred the mediaone plan obligation to wireless and,thus,did not hold cingular liable.
on appeal,we uphold the vice chancellor conclusion that the term economic position is ambiguous because both and at t present reasonable interpretations of section.on the one hand,the phrase economic position of a stock option is broad enough to encompass the prospect that its worth will increase over time,time value.on the other hand,in a cash out merger,option holders would expect to receive only a fixed cash sum when the merger becomes effective.in that context,the economic position of the options would not include any future value since the options will no longer exist.instead that term would only incorporates the right to receive the options intrinsic value.
to resolve that ambiguity,we must consider what the extrinsic evidence shows the term economic position was intended to mean in the context of a cash out merger.the vice chancellor concluded that that term was intended to encompass the time value of the options in any merger,including a cash out merger.having reviewed the vice chancellor opinion,we conclude that he declined to address the difference between a cash out merger and a stock for stock merger for purposes of interpreting economic position and,that he declined to consider the importance of the cash election in the t merger.because we believe the cash election in the t merger most closely resembles the cash out merger here,we remand the case for the vice chancellor to address fully the significance of i the distinction between a stock merger and a cash out merger and,ii the cash election in the at transaction,in deciding what the contracting parties intended by their use of the term economic position.
we also find that the vice chancellor should not have given any evidentiary weight to at t supposed admission because those supposed admissions did not relate to the interpretation of the plan.thus,the vice chancellor should not afford at t supposed admissions any weight on remand.
facts and procedural history 
are former officers and directors of mediaone.mediaone adopted a stock option plan in and granted stock options to.section of the plan protects options through an,provision.that section reads 
in the event there is any change in the common stock by reason of any consolidation,combination,liquidation,reorganization,recapitalization,stock dividend,combination of shares,exchange of shares or other like change in capital structure of the mediaone,the number or kind of shares or interests subject to an award and the per share price or value thereof shall be appropriately adjusted by the committee at the time of such event,provided that each participant economic position with respect to the award shall not,as a result of such adjustment,be worse than it had been immediately prior to such event.emphasis added 
in,at t entered into merger discussions with mediaone,and agreed to purchase mediaone for a fixed ratio of at t stock,or per share,or a combination of cash and stock.in these negotiations,at t agreed to convert mediaone options into at t options that would be governed by the terms of the mediaone plan.in that merger,option holders had three alternatives they could convert all of their mediaone options into at t options they could cash out all of their options at per share minus the option exercise price or they could receive a combination of new options and cash 
after at t acquired mediaone,at t completed three transactions that required adjustments to options as prescribed by section of the plan.in,at t the wireless portion of its business and created at t wireless services,with wireless having its own stock.at t also sold its cable business to comcast.finally,sbc acquired at t and renamed the combined company at t.in each of these transactions,received options in the new surviving entity shares.
when at t wireless,at t converted a part of at t stock options into options to purchase the new wireless stock thus,after the,option holders,including,held options in both at t and wireless.the new wireless options were governed by two different agreements,an employee benefits agreement and the at t wireless services adjustment plan.
for several years,wireless operated independently with its own issued stock.eventually in,cingular wireless acquired wireless through a merger for per share.in that merger agreement,wireless shares were cancelled and converted into a right to receive cash.similarly,stock options with an exercise price of less than per share,options,were cancelled and exchanged for the right to receive cash minus the exercise price.wireless and cingular agreed that they would not cancel the options those options with exercise prices greater than per share.even though the options were never cancelled,they were nonetheless worthless.
in september,filed a complaint in the court of chancery.claimed that the plan governed their wireless options independent from the wireless adjustment agreement and the employee benefits agreement.based on their interpretation of section,contended that wireless had wrongfully failed to preserve the full economic value of the stock options because the merger cashed out the options and did not grant new stock options in cingular after the merger.also argued that,even if wireless were not legally bound to observe section,at t was bound.because at t was obligated to ensure in the merger agreement that section applied to wireless,at t was liable for any damages resulting from wireless breach of the plan.
based on at t understanding of the employee benefits plan and the wireless adjustment plan,at t took the position that wireless could not cash out options on wireless stock.in its answer and in a related arbitration between at t and wireless,at t contended that wireless was obligated to preserve the time value of the options.by taking this position,at t sought to protect the value of all former at t option holders,including but not limited to.
similarly,in a letter from at t counsel to counsel,at t wrote that t he employee benefits agreement and the adjustment plan i prevent wireless from canceling the adjusted options prior to expiration,and ii require wireless,in the event of any merger,to make such adjustments and other substitutions to the adjusted options as shall protect your clients economic rights in their options.notably,at t counsel did not base their letter on their reading of section of the plan.instead they referred only to the documents created when at t wireless,the employee benefits agreement and the wireless adjustment plan.
to enforce wireless contractual obligation under the employee benefits plan and wireless adjustment plan,at t proceeded with a separate arbitration against wireless.the arbitration panel ruled,however,that wireless had met its obligations under both plans and that wireless was not required to issue new options in lieu of the cash out.thus,wireless had no contractual obligation to preserve the time value of the options granted by either at t or wireless.
as a result of this arbitration decision,at t changed its litigation strategy because wireless now faced no liability for having canceled the options.at t,perhaps optimistically,believed it would avoid any liability to the in this action because of the favorable ruling in the arbitration.once it was established that the employee benefits plan and the wireless adjustment plan allowed wireless to cash out options,at t argued that it was not liable for a breach of section because the plan did not govern options and because at t had no contractual duty to bind wireless to the terms of section.alternatively,at t argued that section permitted wireless to cash out the options for intrinsic value.to pursue its new litigation strategy,at t sought to amend its chancery answer and thereby withdraw some of its admissions made in response to complaint.
at t,however,did not need to amend its answer to alleged legal interpretation of section.in paragraph of their chancery complaint,alleged 
the plan provides that in the event there is any change in the mediaone common stock by reason of any consolidation,combination,recapitalization,combination of shares,exchange of shares or other like change in capital structure of the company,the number or kind of shares or interest subject to an award and the per share price or value thereof shall be appropriately adjusted by the committee at the time of such event,provided that each participant economic position with respect to the award shall not,as a result of such adjustment,be worse than it had been immediately prior to such event.id.at xviii a emphasis added.this means that in the event mediaone is acquired in a merger,plaintiffs economic position with respect to the options shall be maintained and the options shall be appropriately adjusted to ensure that plaintiffs receive securities of an equivalent value 
at t answer properly stated that either no response was needed because the plan was a document which spoke for itself or a conclusion of law,and to the extent a response was required,at t denied the allegations.
moved for judgment on the pleadings based,in large part,on earlier at t admissions,arguing that any admissions in the answer constituted binding judicial admissions.the vice chancellor correctly noted that at t admissions were not binding judicial admissions.in a footnote,he recognized that 
judicial admissions apply only to admissions of fact,not to theories of law,such as contract interpretation.moreover,at t is not barred from changing its position under the doctrine of judicial estoppel because this court did not rely on at t argument in a decision 
granting at t motion to amend its pleadings and denying motion for judgment on the pleadings,the vice chancellor wrote 
while the court concludes that it should grant at t motion to amend,it will not do so unconditionally.in its answer and its brief in opposition to the rule c motion,at t made an irrefutably deliberate choice to admit the substance of the plaintiffs claim including adopting the plaintiffs interpretation of the plan but pointed the finger at wireless as the party obligated to make the plaintiffs whole.based on at t numerous admissions,the plaintiffs made a good faith decision that they were entitled to judgment on the pleadings and moved for such under rule c.they,undoubtedly,incurred substantial expense in briefing and arguing that motion.that effort and expense will be largely wasted if at t is allowed to amend its answer.
a conditional allowance is within the court discretion under rule.in exercising that discretion,the court concludes that the plaintiffs should not be forced to bear the cost of at t procedural maneuvering.therefore,the proper outcome is to grant at t leave to amend its answer,conditional upon at t paying the reasonable legal fees and costs that the plaintiffs incurred in bringing their rule c motion.
after at t amended its answer,both sides moved for summary judgment.the vice chancellor denied both motions and held a four day trial.after trial,the vice chancellor resolved several issues,only one of which is the subject of at t appeal here.
in his opinion,the vice chancellor determined that at t was required,but failed,to obligate wireless to the terms of the plan when it wireless accordingly,at t would be liable for wireless breach,if any,of the plan.at t did not appeal this holding 
at t did appeal the vice chancellor interpretation of section the contended in chancery that section preserves the economic position of their wireless options,and that economic position unambiguously meant the full economic value of the options,which included both the intrinsic value and the time value of the options.in particular they argued that the per share cash out foreclosed the possibility of any future gains in the stock price.in order to preserve their economic position and thus full economic value,they contended that either wireless should have issued to them new options to purchase cingular stock or they should have received a higher cash pay out to compensate them for the lost opportunity to reap future gains.in the alternative,contended that,if the vice chancellor decided that the term economic position was ambiguous,extrinsic evidence and the parties course of conduct supported their interpretation.
on the other hand,at t contended that economic position immediately prior to the merger was preserved because the merger proceeds only provided cash per share.more specifically,wireless needed to do no more than protect the economic position of the options immediately prior to the merger,which in this case consisted solely of the right to receive cash per share minus the exercise price of options that were in the money.options,however,were worthless because the underlying stock would be cashed out at a price less than the exercise price.thus,for options,there was no future value subsumed within the terms economic position immediately prior to the merger to preserve.
the vice chancellor concluded that the term economic position in section was ambiguous he found that the term was not one of art and that this provision may be sui generis in the use of the term economic position because he found economic position to be the operative term in the paragraph in which it appears,the entire paragraph was ambiguous thus,the vice chancellor admitted extrinsic evidence to help him determine the meaning of the entire paragraph.
the vice chancellor found that the extrinsic evidence supported the interpretation of section for several reasons.
first,he considered other adjustments to the options made in earlier the at merger,the wireless spin off,at t cable assets sale to comcast,and sbc acquisition of at the vice chancellor found that a ll of these adjustments were made in the same way the existing options were replaced with options in the new entity based on the positive or negative intrinsic value of the old options and new options.thus,
in this process,even options,with negative intrinsic value,were replaced with new options having equivalent negative intrinsic value,thus maintaining the time value of those options and,therefore,the plaintiffs economic position 
he noted that,in the at merger,both stockholders and option holders elected whether to receive cash,new securities,or a combination.this discussion here focuses on the adjustment calculated for those persons who elected to receive adjusted at t options.
an important fact that the vice chancellor did not consider in his written analysis was that in the t merger,both stockholders and option holders could elect to receive or minus the exercise price in cash rather receive the new stock or options.in our view,that cash alternative is significant to interpreting the intended meaning of the term economic position.
second,the vice chancellor considered the extrinsic evidence that these executives and directors took a large portion of their compensation in the form of stock options thus,he concluded,although not requiring a particular reading of the stock option plan,that fact made it more likely that the terms of the plan and the related agreements were designed to be more than usually protective of the economic interests of the option holders.
finally the vice chancellor found 
more significant,however,in resolving the ambiguity in the phrase economic position is the fact that at t,the entity contractually bound to perform the plan,wholeheartedly agreed with the plaintiffs interpretation.that agreement is evidenced both in the april,letter from fulbright jaworski to weil gotshal manges,and in at t december,answer to the complaint in this action.while at t is not strictly bound by the positions taken in the later withdrawn answer,the court is entitled to consider both the letter and that answer and to give them great weight in reaching a decision 
when considering this evidence,the vice chancellor noted 
this is a long established principle of law.see,sayre mohney,or,or admissions made in pleadings will bind the party in the suit in which they are filed,though such pleadings have been stricken out or withdrawn.upon principle,such pleading must be admissible in evidence,for,if a party makes an oral declaration against his interest,it will be received in evidence,as tending to defeat a right which he attempts to assert in an action or suit in which the admission becomes material and,such being the case,an original pleading,when verified,as in the case at bar,must,when superseded by an amendment,also be admissible for like reasons.quoting am.ed.
having considered the extrinsic evidence,the vice chancellor determined that the ambiguous term,economic position,meant full economic value.because only received the intrinsic value of their options at per share,he held p lainly,this adjustment process was not undertaken with a view to preserving each participant economic position with respect to the award,as contemplated by the plan.
the vice chancellor calculated damages and entered judgment against at t for,plus prejudgment interest.
discussion 
interpretation of section 
the first meaning of economic position as found in section us to consider the language of that section.because this involve s the interpretation of contract language,it is a question of law that this court reviews de novo for legal error.but,
t o the extent the trial court interpretation of the contract rests upon findings extrinsic to the contract,or upon inferences drawn from those findings,our review requires us to defer to the trial court findings,unless the findings are not supported by the record or unless the inferences drawn from those findings are not the product of an orderly or logical deductive reasoning process 
in his opinion,the vice chancellor interpreted section under delaware law.in their brief on appeal,however,argue that colorado law governs the plan.the never raised this argument before the vice chancellor.indeed,in their briefs to the vice chancellor,cited extensively to delaware contract law.under supreme court rule,only questions fairly presented to the trial court may be presented for review,unless the interest of justice requires its consideration.accordingly,have waived the argument that colorado law governs the dispute,and we interpret the contract according to delaware law.
under delaware law,when interpreting a contract,the role of a court is to effectuate the parties intent.in doing so,we are constrained by a combination of the parties words and the plain meaning of those words where no special meaning is intended.
clear and unambiguous language should be given its ordinary and usual meaning.absent some ambiguity,delaware courts will not destroy or twist contract language under the guise of construing it.when the language of a contract is clear and unequivocal,a party will be bound by its plain meaning because creating an ambiguity where none exists could,in effect,create a new contract with rights,liabilities and duties to which the parties had not assented 
a contract is not rendered ambiguous simply because the parties do not agree upon its proper construction.rather,a contract is ambiguous only when the provisions in controversy are reasonably or fairly susceptible of different interpretations or may have two or more different meanings.ambiguity does not exist where a court can determine the meaning of a contract without any other guide than a knowledge of the simple facts on which,from the nature of language in general,its meaning depends.courts will not torture contractual terms to impart ambiguity where ordinary meaning leaves no room for uncertainty.the true test is not what the parties to the contract intended it to mean,but what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have thought it meant 
however,i f there is more than one reasonable interpretation of a disputed contract term,consideration of extrinsic evidence is required to determine the meanings the parties intended.
the vice chancellor found the term economic position in section to be ambiguous.he reasoned that the e vidence at trial,including searches of sec filings databases,showed that neither side could find another agreement that used the term economic position.therefore,because the term economic position may be sui generis t he court is left to infer the meaning of economic position from extrinsic evidence.
we note that,in previous cases involving other contracts,delaware courts have found other terms,undefined by the contract and undefined under delaware law,to be unambiguous.in monsanto aetna cas.sur,the trial judge interpreted the term suit in an insurance contract.the dispute focused on whether suit included administrative proceeding and claims.the parties offered competing dictionary definitions of suit and various legal authorities supporting their respective definitions rather than resorting to extrinsic evidence,the trial judge used reasoned judgment to determine that monsanto interpretation was not supported by its own proffered dictionary text,and accepted defendant definition because it comported with the eighth circuit court of appeals definition of suit.
similarly in du pont de nemours admiral ins,the parties disputed the term sudden in an insurance policy there,the trial judge specifically found that the term sudden unambiguously meant abrupt rather than unexpected,despite conflicting support for each respective definition accordingly,i will consider the language of the exclusion within the context of the entire policy without resorting to conflicting dictionary definitions,inapposite treatise definitions,judicial disagreement or drafting history.
our task on de novo review,then,is to determine what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have thought the term economic position meant assert that economic position means full economic value.maintain that,in this context,full economic value means that the options time value must be preserved.on the other hand,at t contends that economic position simply refers to the intrinsic value of the options immediately prior to a cash out merger.
the language of section protects the economic position of options immediately prior to a merger.the important question,here,is what exactly was economic position in the face of an impending cash out merger 
on the one hand,a stock option worth can increase substantially over time.it therefore is logical that the economic position of the stock option might include time value.on the other hand,at the point of time immediately prior to a cash out merger,the economic position of the stock options retains no time value because the options will be immediately exchanged for the right to receive a cash sum.in light of the impending cash out merger,there is no prospect that the option will ever be worth anything more than that exact cash sum.thus,the economic position of the stock option might relate only to the cash sum for which the option will be exchanged.
we find both interpretations of section to be reasonable.therefore,the vice chancellor appropriately found the term economic position to be ambiguous and properly considered extrinsic evidence.
ii.extrinsic evidence 
urge us to find that the plan required at t and wireless to preserve the time value of their options based upon at t course of conduct and at t alleged admissions.the vice chancellor considered three items of extrinsic evidence to find that the term economic position included the time value of stock options.first,he considered the parties course of conduct in earlier transactions.second,he looked to the fact that mediaone officers and directors received a significant proportion of their compensation through options.finally,he gave great weight to at t supposed admissions.
a.the parties course of conduct 
suggest,and the vice chancellor accepted,that at t course of conduct established at t belief that the options time value was required to be course of conduct arguably supporting the parties intended meaning of the term economic position.but,and the vice chancellor spent no time discussing the fact that,in each of the previous transactions,the transactions were stock for stock cash outs.when reviewing the t merger,the vice chancellor noted t his discussion here focuses on the adjustment calculated for those persons who elected to receive adjusted at t options.the vice chancellor never explained why he disregarded the cash election in that merger,nor did he address why the stock for stock election better evidenced the parties intent in the context of the dispute in this cash out merger.
in the transactions the vice chancellor considered,at t replaced options to buy stock in the company with options to buy stock.at t argues that these prior events demonstrate that options were adjusted consistently to mirror adjustments to the underlying security.but these transactions were also distinguishable from the merger precisely because they were stock for stock transactions.therefore,they did not necessarily evidence what the parties intended to occur in a cash out merger.in the case of a stock for stock merger,option holders expect to have their old options replaced with new options because the old underlying stock is being replaced with new underlying stock.in such a transaction,by its very nature,the economic position of the options will invariably incorporate the expected time value of the new options.
but where the stock and the options are to be cashed out in a merger,the option holders can have no expectation of receiving replacement options in new stock.instead,option holders will,and expect to,receive only cash representing intrinsic value for their options.the question presented in this case is whether,in order to protect option holders economic position,the option holders must receive additional compensation where they receive cash and not stock.the cash election in the t merger is the only earlier transaction that included a cash component.it,therefore,is the only transaction similar to the one at issue here.
in the t merger,shareholders and option holders could elect to receive cash,new stock or in the case of option holders new options,or a combination of both cash and stock or options.stockholders electing cash would receive per share,and the option holder would receive per share minus the exercise price of the options.under interpretation of section,option holders in the t merger should have received additional compensation above the cash out for per share in order to compensate option holders for the lost time value.yet,in that merger,option holders who might have chosen the cash out would have received intrinsic value only.they would not have received additional compensation for the time value of the options.logically,option holders in that merger electing cash would have received the intrinsic value,cash only,because those who wished to preserve time value would have elected the offered options designed to preserve time value in the surviving entity.
because the vice chancellor did not address the distinction between a cash out merger and a stock for stock merger and the significance of that distinction in evaluating the extrinsic evidence of contractual intent,we remand this case for him to reconsider the evidentiary importance of the parties course of conduct in the t transaction.
b.at t admissions 
we also are constrained to comment on the great weight that the vice chancellor afforded to at t supposed admissions.the vice chancellor found at t admissions in its answer and the letter sent from at t counsel to counsel to be persuasive evidence that at t,in fact,believed that it needed to preserve the time value of options under the plan we find,however,that at t letter to admitted nothing relating to the parties intended meaning of the phrase economic position in section.moreover,at t consistently denied interpretation of section.
having reviewed at t alleged admission in its letter,we conclude that that letter does not refer to the plan at all rather,the letter refers to the employee benefit agreement and the adjustment documents that were created when at t spun off wireless at t spin off of wireless preserved all at t options holders rights by issuing options to acquire the new wireless stock.to protect all of these options in the future,at t obligated wireless under the employee benefits agreement and the wireless adjustment plan.when it wrote counsel,at t explained that it,too,was concerned that wireless had cashed out all options holders at per share minus the exercise price.at t asserted that the employee benefits agreement and the wireless adjustment plan prevented wireless from cashing out any options.at t spoke in order to protect the interests of all wireless options created by the spin off,which of course was not limited held by.because at t was attempting to protect all former at t and now wireless options holders,at t did not refer to the plan or to section,because that plan and provision governed only options.thus,in its letter,at t never admitted that section proscribed wireless from cashing out options or that section required wireless to compensate for the lost time value of their options following
