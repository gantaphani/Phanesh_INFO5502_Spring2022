introduction 
m m foods,m m filed a complaint against pacific american fish,paul huh,and peter huh and then petitioned the trial court to compel arbitration based on an arbitration clause in an asset purchase agreement between the parties.pacific opposed the petition,arguing,inter alia,that m m lacked standing to enforce the arbitration provision because the right to do so belonged exclusively to the trustee of m m former bankruptcy estate.the trial court denied the petition on that ground,as well as on others.on appeal,m m argues,inter alia,that because the bankruptcy trustee abandoned the claims asserted in m m complaint,those claims reverted to m m,along with the right to arbitrate them pursuant to the arbitration clause in the asset purchase agreement.
we hold that because m m failed in the bankruptcy proceeding to schedule the claims asserted in the complaint,those claims had not been abandoned,and,only the trustee had the right to compel arbitration of those claims.accordingly,we affirm the order of the trial court denying the petition to compel arbitration.

applicable legal principles 
w hen a petitioner files a petition to compel arbitration,a trial court must make preliminary factual determinations whether there is an arbitration agreement and the petitioner is a party to that agreement or can otherwise enforce that agreement.code civ.code of civil procedure section authorizes petitions to compel arbitration,providing in part on petition of a party to an arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy and that a party thereto refuses to arbitrate such controversy,the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists italics added.therefore,in considering a code of civil procedure section petition to compel arbitration,a trial court must make the preliminary determinations whether there is an agreement to arbitrate and whether the petitioner is a party to that agreement or can otherwise enforce the agreement.city of hope bryan cave,supra,th at d i n addition to determining whether an arbitration agreement exists,the court needs to determine who has standing to demand arbitration.bouton usaa casualty ins.th,bouton.
adjudication of standing issue 
m m contends that in determining whether m m had standing to enforce the arbitration provision,the trial court decided an issue that was outside the scope of the issues properly before it on a petition to compel arbitration.according to m m,because standing was an issue related to the underlying merits of the action,that issue could not be decided on a petition to compel arbitration and was a matter for the arbitrator to decide,not the trial court.
in bouton,supra,th,the plaintiff sought to arbitrate his claim for underinsured motorist benefits under an automobile policy issued to his sister.id.at.he contended,inter alia,that in ruling on his petition to compel arbitration,the trial court could decide the preliminary issue of whether he was an insured under the policy with standing to enforce the arbitration provision.id.at.the defendant insurance company contended that the question of whether the plaintiff was an insured under the policy could not be decided in the proceedings on the petition and could only be decided in a separate action for declaratory relief.ibid.
the court in bouton,supra th analogized the issue before it to cases in which the trial court makes the preliminary determination whether the petitioner is a party to an arbitration agreement.w e conclude the instant case is analogous to those cases in which the trial court makes the preliminary determination whether the petitioner is a party to,or can otherwise enforce,an arbitration agreement.for example,in deciding a petition to compel arbitration,a trial court may decide,based on the evidence before it,that the petitioner is a third party beneficiary to an existing arbitration agreement and therefore may enforce that agreement.that preliminary finding by a trial court on the petitioner standing to compel arbitration of a controversy is one properly made in the proceedings on a petition to compel arbitration.id.at.
the court in bouton,supra,th explained that,t he issue in this case is not significantly different,even if not identical,to the standing issue in third party beneficiary cases.the trial court must decide whether the plaintiff is an insured under the policy entitled to enforce the policy arbitration provision.therefore,the trial cour
