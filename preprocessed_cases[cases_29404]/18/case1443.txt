opinion on rehearing 
plaintiff moves to recuse defendants lawyer in a lawsuit over a partnership and lease agreement.prior to the lawsuit,the attorney briefly represented plaintiff to discuss her concerns about the partnership and lease agreement with another party involving the same business that is the subject matter of the lawsuit.plaintiff knew that the attorney had represented the defendants in other matters.defendants were present at the meetings between plaintiff and the attorney,and privy to all their discussions.
did the trial court properly disqualify the attorney yes.defendants presence at meetings between plaintiff and the attorney does not sufficiently attenuate the attorney conflict.to separate the conflict from the two sets of clients is to separate the silk from the thread.it can not be done.
defendants perry ferguson and paula ferguson appeal an order granting plaintiff laura knight motion to disqualify the fergusons attorney,richard wideman.knight had consulted previously with wideman about forming a partnership and entering into a commercial lease to establish a new restaurant.the dispute between knight and the fergusons concerns that business venture.there is a substantial relationship between wideman representation of the fergusons in this case and his prior consultations with knight.we affirm.
knight owned the pascucci restaurant in santa barbara.in,she decided to open a branch of that restaurant in goleta at the camino real marketplace crm.she found a partner,steven sponder,who agreed to assist her with the financing.they negotiated with chevy,a business in bankruptcy,to become the assignee of the chevy ground lease at the crm.
in december of,knight met with wideman to discuss the lease and her partnership arrangement for the new restaurant,pascucci at the camino real marketplace pascucci crm,a california corporation.wideman,who was also the attorney for the fergusons,knight sister and,billed knight for his consultations.
knight did not form a partnership with sponder.she asked the fergusons to take his place and participate in the ownership and the management of pascucci crm.they agreed to participate and finance the venture.
in,knight sued the fergusons for breach of contract and sought dissolution of pascucci crm.she alleged that the fergusons breached their duties as corporate directors and improperly removed her from her duty of managing and overseeing the overall operation of the r estaurant.
the fergusons filed a against knight,stating causes of action for fraud,breach of contract,and breach of fiduciary duties.they alleged that knight had not managed the restaurant properly and tried to undermine their control knight promised to run pascucci crm as a corporation,but secretly intended to operate it as a sole proprietorship they assumed sponder partnership role after his and knight partnership arrangement fell apart in and they relied to their detriment on knight promises and incurred liabilities when they became the assignee of the ground lease.
initially,the fergusons were represented by the law firm of cappello and noÃ«l.but they changed counsel,and wideman substituted into the action to represent them.
motion to disqualify wideman 
knight moved to disqualify wideman from representing the fergusons.in her declaration,she said she told wideman of her feelings about litigation and her position relating to the crm lease she also discussed her relationship with sponder and her plans to purchase the crm ground lease.
wideman declared that he did not obtain confidential information from knight.he met with knight and her attorney,eric burkhardt,at the request of the fergusons,who were also present.wideman said,i told knight that i was the fergusons attorney and they had asked me to help her,and that i would expect knight to pay me and she agreed.he said knight discussed with him potential litigation involving sponder,who had attempted to change the terms of a partnership agreement for the purchase of chevy in the camino real marketplace.knight was concerned about litigation against her should she go forward with the deal by herself.wideman advised knight to send a letter to sponder and suggested a possible preemptive lawsuit.
at the disqualification hearing,knight testified that she had three meetings with wideman.she expected there would be litigation and that he would be her litigation counsel.burkhardt testified that he met with knight and wideman.at the hearing,wideman asked burkhardt,do you remember that at that meeting at least you knew that i was advising and ferguson at that time burkhardt responded,my understanding at that time is that you were both representing and ferguson and representing knight in,at least,certain regards.wideman asked,my question was only,you knew i was representing and ferguson.burkhardt responded,i did understand that you had in the past represented and ferguson.
the trial court found that wideman role as litigation counsel was brief,but was not peripheral.the nature of the former representation was such that confidential material to the current dispute would normally have been imparted to the attorney.

substantial relationship test 
a motion to disqualify counsel brings the client right to the attorney of his or her choice into conflict with the need to maintain ethical standards of professional responsibility.citations.the paramount concern is the preservation of public trust in the scrupulous administration of justice and the integrity of the bar.citations.jessen hartford cas.ins.th,d jessen.
where an attorney successively represents clients with adverse interests,and where the subjects of the two representations are substantially related,the attorney must be disqualified from the second representation.citation.people ex.rel.of corporations speedee oil change systems,cal th,d,speedee oil change systems.t he substantial relationship test is intended to protect the confidences of former clients when an attorney has been in a position to learn them.ahmanson salomon brothers,d.ahmanson.
the court should focus on the similarities between the two factual situations,the legal questions posed,and the nature and extent of the attorney involvement with the cases.ahmanson,supra,d at.it should consider the attorney possible exposure to formulation of policy or strategy.citation.ibid.where there is a substantial relationship,it is presumed the attorney had access to confidential information.speedee oil change systems,supra,cal th at,d.generally,a trial court decision on a disqualification motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion.id.at,d,citing cho superior court th,d.
the fergusons contend there was no substantial relationship between wideman representation of knight and the current case which concerns different issues.the legal theories and issues that an attorney discusses with a former client may be different than those involved in the subsequent lawsuit against that client.but the substantial relationship test is broad and not limited to the strict facts,claims,and issues involved in a particular action.jessen,supra,th at,d.a substantial relationship exists whenever the subjects of the prior and the current representations are linked in some rational manner.citation.ibid.that is the case here.knight retained wideman to discuss a lease and partnership relating to the creation of the restaurant which is the subject of this action.
the fergusons claim that wideman consultations with knight were remote and peripheral.we disagree.they occurred at a critical stage,when knight was creating the business entity which is at the heart of this action.facts about knight difficulties with sponder could be used to the fergusons advantage.in their,the fergusons allege that knight partnership with sponder fell apart,and that knight asked them to take her partner sponder place and participate in the ownership and management knight discussions with sponder are therefore linked to issues in this action.
the fergusons claim that knight did not prove that wideman obtained confidential information.the aggrieved client need only satisfy a low threshold of proof and does not have to prove the at
