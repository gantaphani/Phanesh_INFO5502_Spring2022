in this case of first impression,we hold that california revenue and taxation code section section,known as the dividends received deduction,violates the commerce clause of the united states constitution commerce clause by discriminating against corporations engaged in interstate commerce section affords to a corporate taxpayer an income tax deduction for a portion of the dividends it receives from another corporation when the dividends are declared from income which was included in the payer corporation measure of california franchise tax,alternative minimum tax,or corporation income tax in holding that section violates the commerce clause,we follow ceridian franchise tax bd.th,d ceridian,in which the first district held that revenue and taxation code section,which governs taxation of insurance company dividends paid to major corporate stockholders,was unconstitutional under the commerce clause.
the franchise tax board ftb appeals from a judgment awarding plaintiff farmer.taxpayer state tax refunds totaling for the tax years through,plus interest and costs,as a remedy for overpaying taxes under the provisions of section,which the trial court determined to be unconstitutional under the commerce clause.we agree with the trial court conclusion and affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
this case was submitted for determination by the trial court on a joint stipulation of facts and written trial briefs,which provide the undisputed factual background.
taxpayer is a california corporation primarily engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling coffee and products.for the years through,taxpayer timely filed california corporate income or franchise tax returns with the ftb.each return reported a dividends received deduction under section,representing a portion of the dividends taxpayer had received during the income year.taxpayer owned less than percent of the stock in each of the payer corporations which had issued dividends to taxpayer during the years at issue.thus,for those dividends which qualify for the deduction under the terms of section,subdivision a,the statute affords taxpayer a maximum deduction of percent of the amount of the dividend,subd.b see fn,ante.
ftb had promulgated a schedule listing the corporations and the percentage of their dividends that were deductible under section.the schedule was based on a formula which allowed for a sliding scale deduction so that the taxpayer was entitled to a greater deduction the more the income of the payer corporation was subject to specified california corporate taxes.see,tit,rule.
as explained in rule,taxpayers are permitted a deduction under section,for dividends received which were declared from income included in the measure of tax of the declaring corporation under this part.rule also provides three examples to illustrate the operation of the dividends received deduction.example states the a corporation receives dividends from b corporation,whose entire income is also subject to tax under this part and has no other earnings not taxable under this part.a is allowed a deduction for all such dividends received from rule.example states the a corporation received dividends from b corporation,which is not subject to tax in california.none of the dividends received from b are deductible.ibid.example states the a corporation receives dividends from b corporation,whose income is subject to allocation because its activities are carried on within and without the state.b allocation percentage is percent.the percentage of the dividends received by a which are deductible is determined by formula.the variance from percent will be affected by the extent of nonunitary and nontaxable income.ibid.
the concept of a unitary business has been developed in cases addressing the problem of the local taxation of businesses operating in more than one jurisdiction.see container franchise tax bd,d.california,like many other states,uses what is called a unitary business system for determining its taxable share of a multistate corporation business income the income of which california taxes a percentage is constitutionally limited to a corporation unitary income.unitary income normally includes all income from a corporation business activities,but excludes income that derive s from unrelated business activity which constitutes a discrete business enterprise,citation.as we have said,this latter nonunitary income normally is not taxable by any state except the corporation state of domicile and the states in which the discrete enterprise carries out its business,franchise tax bd,d.
pursuant to ftb formula and schedule for dividends deductible under section,some of the dividends received by taxpayer from certain corporations in certain years were not deductible.for example,in taxpayer received a dividend from farmland industries of about,but no part of the dividend was deductible,based on section and farmland industries paying no california franchise tax in.as to other corporations which paid dividends to taxpayer,various portions of those dividends were subject to the section deduction.for example,in,taxpayer received a total dividend of about from merrill lynch but only percent of that dividend,or about,was deductible.as to a total dividend in of from san diego gas electric,almost all of the dividend,or percent,was deductible.
taxpayer timely filed amended tax returns claiming a dividends received deduction for all dividends received for the years at issue and requested refunds totaling over,plus interest.taxpayer asserted as the ground for the refunds that section violated the commerce clause of the united states constitution.ftb denied taxpayer claims for refunds.taxpayer appealed the denial to the state board of equalization board,which considered the appeal and sustained ftb action on the ground that the board does not have the authority to deny the application of revenue and taxation code section on constitutional grounds.
in september,taxpayer filed the instant action for refund of corporate franchise or income tax.in a first amended complaint,taxpayer asserted that section is unconstitutional under the commerce clause of the united states constitution because it discriminates on its face against interstate commerce by improperly taxing income that is not attributable to business transacted in california and the deduction can not be justified as a lawful compensatory tax.ftb answered the first amended complaint in may.
on the trial date,october,the parties filed opening trial briefs and a joint stipulation of facts and lodged interrogatories propounded by taxpayer and ftb responses.a witness list proffered by ftb indicated it intended to call as witnesses professors richard pomp and stephen sheffrin regarding the issue of whether section violated the commerce clause.in response to ftb witness list,taxpayer filed a motion in limine to bar expert testimony on the constitutionality issue.the october,minute order indicates that the parties agreed to bifurcate the trial,with the court adjudicating first the issue of the constitutionality of section and then,if necessary,the issue of remedy.the court afforded the parties until november,to file responses to the opening briefs.with respect to the motion in limine,the minute order states that ftb would have until november,to file opposition and then the cause will stand submitted.if the plaintiff motion to bar expert testimony on the constitutionality issue is denied and expert testimony is to be taken,trial will be continued into early next year for that testimony.
in ftb response to the motion in limine,ftb faulted taxpayer for failing to obtain any discovery with respect to expert witnesses and instead,on the day set for trial,taxpayer file d a motion in which it presents to the court taxpayer assumptions as to the nature of the testimony to be offered by the board witnesses and asks that they be barred from testifying because this assumed testimony is inadmissible.taxpayer is not only tilting at windmills,it is doing so after constructing the very edifices at which it aims its lance.ftb then pointed out that expert opinion testimony properly could be offered as to factual issues arising under the compensatory tax doctrine defense but expressly refused to go into any greater detail as to any such testimony,thus refusing to give taxpayer the benefits which it would have received had it exercised the diligence necessary to elicit and refine such information through discovery.according to ftb,taxpayer remaining option is to wait until questions are posed to the board independent expert witnesses and then interpose such objections as it deems appropriate.
on november,both parties filed responsive trial briefs.ftb brief addressed the issue of the compensatory tax doctrine,but ftb did not offer any testimony or additional evidence as to that issue.
on november,the court issued its ruling on submitted matter,ruling in pertinent part it is agreed that to the extent that a corporation had a larger share of its sales,property payroll in california,plaintiff was entitled under section to deduct a larger percentage of the dividends it to a maximum deduction of percent.on the other hand,the section permits no tax deduction as to dividends generated from business outside of california ftb maintains that because corporations have already been subjected to franchise tax,the statutory goal is merely compensatory.it argues the purpose of the statute is to prevent the imposition of a second tax upon the stream of income leading to the dividend citations.california only responsibility is to prevent double taxation in effect,defendant argues that both the statute intent and effect are.
this court disagrees it is a scheme that facially places an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce.
plaintiff objection to the proffer of live testimony by defendant expert is denied as moot.
at a january,further status conference,which was not reported,the court ordered that the issue of remedy was to be determined after the parties submitted briefs on the issue.ftb thereafter filed a petition for an extraordinary writ,challenging,among other rulings,the ruling denying plaintiff motion in limine as moot.in its writ petition,ftb argued that if the court of appeal concludes that factual questions remain to be answered before this issue whether section is a permitted compensatory tax can be resolved,then due process requires that ftb be allowed to present the testimony of its named expert witnesses for that purpose.on march,we denied the petition for extraordinary writ.franchise tax board superior court.
after the parties submitted briefs on the issue of the appropriate remedy,the court determined that taxpayer was entitled to recover refunds of corporate income and franchise taxes for the years to,totaling,plus interest and costs.the judgment awarded taxpayer a remedy consisting of the deduction set out in section for dividends received,as if the dividends were declared from income which had been included in the measure of the taxes imposed upon the taxpayer declaring the dividends,subd.a.judgment was entered on may.ftb filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment.
ftb challenges only the finding that section is unconstitutional under the commerce clause,and not the finding that a tax refund is the proper remedy for the invalidity of section.ftb does not challenge the remedy,and the parties do not discuss that issue,so neither do we.in other words,if we agree with the trial court finding of unconstitutionality,then we may affirm the judgment without addressing the issue of remedy.
discussion 
as the issue of the constitutionality of section under the commerce clause is presented on undisputed facts and is one of law,our review is de novo.ghirardo antonioli cal th,d,state of ohio barron th,d constitutional issues are reviewed de novo.
section is facially discriminatory 
the constitution gives congress the power to regulate commerce between the states,art.i,cl.though phrased as a grant of regulatory power to congress,the commerce clause has long been understood to have a negative aspect that denies the states the power unjustifiably to discriminate against or burden the interstate flow of articles of commerce.citations.citation.ceridian,supra,th at,d.this negative aspect of the commerce clause,also known as the dormant commerce clause fulton faulkner,d fulton,prohibits economic is,regulatory measures designed to benefit economic interests by burdening competitors.ceridian,supra,th at,d.
in evaluating state regulatory measures under the dormant commerce clause,the united states supreme court has held that the first step is to determine whether it regulates evenhandedly with only incidental effects on interstate commerce or discriminates against interstate commerce.fulton,supra,at.north carolina intangibles tax violated the dormant commerce clause.with respect to state taxation,a state law is treated as discriminatory if it taxes a transaction or incident more heavily when it crosses state lines than when it occurs entirely within the state.ceridian,supra,th at,d.state laws discriminating against interstate commerce on their face are virtually per se invalid.fulton,supra,at.a law that is discriminatory on its face must be invalidated unless the state can show that it advances a legitimate local purpose that can not be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives.oregon waste systems,department of environmental quality of,d oregon waste oregon per ton surcharge on disposal of waste violated commerce clause in view of per ton charge imposed on solid waste.
a tax may violate the commerce clause even if it has no discriminatory goal or intent,if it is facially discriminatory,or has the effect of unduly burdening interstate commerce.citations.absent a compelling justification a state may not advance its legitimate goals by means that facially discriminate against interstate commerce.ceridian,supra,th at,d.our cases require that justifications for discriminatory restrictions on commerce pass the strictest scrutiny.citation.the state burden of justification is so heavy that facial discrimination by itself may be a fatal defect.oregon waste,supra,at.
we conclude that section is discriminatory on its face because it affords to taxpayers a deduction for dividends received from corporations subject to tax in california,while no deduction is afforded for dividends received from corporations not subject to tax in california.as a result,the dividends received deduction scheme favors corporations doing business in california and paying california taxes over corporations which do not do business in california and pay no taxes in california.the deduction thus discriminates between transactions on the basis of an interstate element,which is facially discriminatory under the commerce clause.armco hardesty,d.that the tax discrimination comes in the form of a deprivation of a generally available tax benefit,rather than a specific penalty on the activity itself,is of no moment under commerce clause jurisprudence.camps,town of harrison,d.
a regime that taxes stock only to the degree that its issuing corporation participates in interstate commerce favors domestic corporations over their foreign competitors in raising capital among residents and tends,at least,to discourage domestic corporations from plying their trades in interstate commerce.fulton,supra,at.in fulton,the court held invalid under the commerce clause north carolina intangibles tax,which taxed a fraction of the value of corporate stock owned by north carolina residents inversely proportional to the corporation exposure to the state income tax.id.at.
like the sliding scale deduction at issue in this case,residents of north carolina were entitled to calculate their tax liability by taking a taxable percentage deduction equal to the fraction of the issuing corporation income subject to tax in north carolina.fulton,supra,at.thus,a corporation doing all of its business within the state would pay corporate income tax on of its income,and the taxable percentage deduction allowed to resident owners of that corporation stock under the intangibles tax would likewise be.stock in a corporation doing no business in north carolina,on the other hand,would be tax
