background 
in,banking regulators in the united states began investigating suspicious banking activities at park avenue bank,park avenue bank or the bank,a new york bank controlled by defendant intervenor erol aksoy aksoy.aksoy,a turkish national,has been the subject of numerous criminal investigations and prosecutions for fraudulent conduct related to banking in turkey.in november,regulators demanded that park avenue bank remove aksoy as its majority shareholder or risk liquidation.park avenue bank found its white knight in lichtenstein who desired to take a controlling interest in the bank.that same month,park avenue bank,aksoy,and lichtenstein entered into a stock purchase agreement whereby lichtenstein agreed to purchase million worth of newly issued voting common stock from the bank thereby acquiring a controlling interest in the bank.the stock purchase agreement,as amended,required aksoy to exchange all voting common shares owned by him in excess of of the total outstanding shares for an equal amount of preferred stock.aksoy would thus retain an ownership interest in the bank while lichtenstein took over the voting control.
to place additional limits on aksoy involvement in the bank management,the november stock purchase agreement also required the bank,its directors,aksoy,and lichtenstein to enter into a separate bank control agreement with the new york state banking department.this agreement,entered into on january,obligated aksoy to resign from the bank board of directors and deposit all of his common stock in a voting trust administered by an independent voting trustee approved by the state banking department.additionally,the bank control agreement contemplated a of aksoy relationship with park avenue bank by requiring him to dispose of his entire equity interest in the bank by january,five years after the execution of the bank control agreement.if the control transfer from aksoy to lichtenstein,excepting aksoy disposal of his entire equity interest,did not occur by june,the scheduled closing date of the stock purchase agreement,the banking department would liquidate the bank assets.
approximately three weeks prior to the scheduled closing date,on june,sdif,an agency of the republic of turkey with responsibilities similar to those of the federal deposit insurance corporation,brought an action in the new york supreme court for the county of new york seeking revocation and enforcement of a money judgment of approximately million obtained against aksoy in turkey and seeking to prevent the stock purchase agreement from closing.sdif succeeded in securing a temporary restraining order tro preventing aksoy from making any sale,assignment,or transfer of any property in his possession.this tro in turn restricted aksoy from fulfilling his obligations under the stock purchase and bank control agreements,which caused park avenue bank to face the prospect of liquidation.for his part,lichtenstein moved to vacate or modify the tro as it pertained to him.
perhaps recognizing that it stood to recover far less by attaching aksoy interest in park avenue bank,were the bank forced into liquidation,than the amount it could recover if the bank were to receive a capital infusion from lichtenstein and continue its operations,sdif and lichtenstein began negotiating the conditions for lifting the tro and transferring control from aksoy to lichtenstein.on june,lichtenstein and sdif stipulated to the vacatur of the tro against park avenue bank and lichtenstein to the extent necessary to permit the parties to complete the transactions contemplated in the stock purchase and bank control agreements other than delivery of stock certificates to aksoy.at.as a direct result,park avenue bank avoided liquidation,and aksoy was permitted to retain of the bank outstanding voting common shares,which would be placed in a voting trust pursuant to the bank control agreement.were the bank to regain its financial footing following lichtenstein takeover,the value of aksoy interest in the bank would increase correspondingly,and sdif stood to recover an amount closer to the full amount of the judgment it sought to enforce.additionally,the terms of the stipulation mandated that lichtenstein cause the bank to place into escrow all shares in the bank issued or to be issued to aksoy at the closing of the stock purchase agreement,and not oppose any effort by sdif to attach the shares.sdif also received the option to put,or require lichtenstein to purchase,all of aksoy shares at a price to be calculated as the greater of million or of the shares book value,as determined by an independent valuator.in return,lichtenstein received the option to call,or require sdif to sell to lichtenstein,aksoy shares at the same price.the stipulation provided that the put option may be exercised on days notice to lichtenstein and that the call option may be exercised within days after sdif is able to deliver the shares covered by the call option.at emphasis added.
the stock purchase agreement closed as planned on june.park avenue bank issued lichtenstein shares of preferred stock and shares of common stock previously held by aksoy,as well as an additional common shares of stock owned by one of aksoy companies,all of which were promptly placed in escrow pursuant to the stipulation.the new york supreme court granted sdif request for an order of attachment,and in december,the sheriff of new york city seized the escrowed shares formerly owned by aksoy.subsequently,on july,the state court entered judgment against aksoy in the full amount of the judgment obtained in turkey,plus interest,totaling.
with its state enforcement action all but resolved,it seemed that the only remaining obstacle to sdif recovery on the judgment was the exercise of either its put option or lichtenstein call option.on november,counsel for lichtenstein exercised the call option through a letter forwarded to sdif counsel.sdif,however,either failed or refused to remit the shares.accordingly,on april,deep woods,the assignee of lichtenstein rights under the stipulation,filed the amended complaint in this case,asserting claims for breach of contract,constructive trust,and attorney fees.deep woods alleged that lichtenstein,acting through counsel,exercised his call option numerous times in late and early by email to sdif counsel but,in response,received only silence or an explanation that sdif was not yet able to deliver the shares and that,therefore,the purported exercise of the call option was premature.
following an order bifurcating issues of liability and damages at the summary judgment phase,both parties moved for summary judgment as to liability.on october,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of deep woods.despite the bifurcated nature of the proceedings,the court also entered a judgment in the amount of million,plus interest accruing from january,costs,and attorney fees.sdif moved for reconsideration,and the district court vacated the portion of its summary judgment order awarding damages,ordered
