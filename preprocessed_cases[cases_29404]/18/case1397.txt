appellant,the center for and community development center,sued respondent developers on allegations of generating asbestos dust during their construction activities in the bayview hunters point community.although it complied with all the prerequisites for bringing a citizen suit to enforce proposition at the time of giving the mandatory notice and thereafter filing its complaint,the center corporate powers had been suspended.entering judgment for respondents following the granting of their motion for judgment on the pleadings,the trial court ruled that this suspension of corporate powers at the time of serving notice was a defense that could not be cured by the center subsequent revivor.
resolution of this appeal involves the interplay of the notice statute governing proposition citizen enforcement,and the corporate suspension and revivor statutes.we conclude that respondents challenge to the complaint did not raise a noncurable affirmative defense.rather,invocation of the center lack of capacity was a mere plea in abatement.having attained reinstatement prior to judgment,the center regained its capacity to proceed with prosecution of the pending litigation.accordingly,we reverse the judgment.
background 
the center is a nonprofit organization based in san francisco.it operates an education and training center for families and children in the bayview hunters point neighborhood.the center is located adjacent to,and downwind of,the hunters point shipyard parcel a redevelopment project.respondent,llc is the master developer for this redevelopment project.its construction site preparation and development activities have been extensively regulated and monitored by all levels of,state and federal.
on may,the center provided respondents with a notice of its intent to bring a private enforcement action for ongoing violations of proposition.the center also sent this letter to all necessary public enforcers.these public enforcers chose not to commence and prosecute a proposition action against the alleged violations and the center went forward as a citizen enforcer,filing the complaint on august.
the complaint alleged that during respondents construction activities on the hunters point project,they exposed community members and workers to asbestos without warning of that exposure,in violation of proposition.the center prayed for an injunction to prevent respondents from further engaging in construction activities that generate asbestos dust and expose community members and workers to the toxin,without providing proposition warnings an assessment of penalties in the amount of per day for each violation and its attorney fees and costs.
respondents answered the complaint,and nearly two months later moved for judgment on the pleadings.the motion asserted that the center was a suspended corporation at the time it served the notice,the notice was thus defective as a matter of law,and therefore the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.
the franchise tax board suspended the center corporate status on may,for failure to file its tax returns.acting to resolve the issue,the center regained active corporate status by at least december.
ruling for respondents,the trial court reasoned that compliance with the notice requirement was jurisdictional and strictly construed,and the center suspended corporate status when serving the notice was a defense that could not be obviated by revival of that status.this appeal,raising purely questions of law which we review de novo,followed.

the certificate of merit element of the notice requirement operates as a brake on improvident citizen enforcement.first,armed with factual information going to the merits of the citizen claim of violation,the attorney general can pursue prelitigation efforts to deter a suit that is frivolous,or engage with the parties to resolve the matter before a lawsuit is launched.dipirro american isuzu motors,th,d dipirro.second,the statute calls for sanctions for frivolous actions,an obvious deterrent.when the action proceeds to judgment,the trial court may review the underlying factual basis for the certificate of merit.if it concludes there was no credible factual basis supporting the certificate of merit,the action is deemed frivolous as defined,thus empowering the court to impose sanctions.health,subd.h.
