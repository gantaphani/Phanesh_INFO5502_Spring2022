corporation njc appeals the determination made by the district court of the fair value of stock held by,cox enterprises,cox,pursuant to.stat.cox,arguing that,although the valuation method was proper,the district court ought also to have included compensation for past misconduct in its fair value calculation.cox also challenges the district court refusal to award prejudgment interest.we affirm the district court determination.
background 
cox is a privately held delaware corporation with its principal place of business in atlanta,georgia it owns seventeen daily newspapers,including the constitution,austin,dayton daily news,and palm beach post.njc is a closely held florida corporation with its principal place of business in daytona beach,florida.njc publishes the daytona beach,a daily newspaper circulated primarily in volusia and flagler counties.njc has one wholly owned subsidiary,volusia pennysaver,pennysaver,which publishes six local shopping guides.
njc was organized in through the consolidation of two small daytona beach newspapers to form the.njc has one class of common stock of which shares are outstanding.members of the davidson family purchased a controlling interest in njc in and pmv,a closely held corporation controlled by the estate of herbert tippen davidson,owns those,or,of njc shares.cox acquired the remainder of the njc stock in and has maintained its interest since that time.
when the case came before the district court,njc directors were tippen davidson,marc davidson,julia davidson truilo,robert truilo,georgia kaney,jonathan kaney,and david kendall.tippen davidson also served as the president and ceo of njc until his death in january.tippen davidson grandfather,julius,served as the publisher from until,when he relinquished control of the paper to his son herbert davidson.herbert published the paper until his death in.under julius and herbert leadership,njc also owned and operated a radio station,from to.
although tippen davidson enjoyed a brief career as a professional musician,he eventually returned to daytona beach to work as a reporter and city editor for the.upon his father death,he became the paper general manager and publisher.tippen wife,josephine,has also worked as a reporter and editor at the.their two children,marc davidson and julia davidson truilo,are currently members of the staff and the njc board of directors.julia husband,robert truilo,serves on the board of directors and as the business manager.
in his capacity as ceo of njc,tippen davidson continued to pursue his interest in music and the performing arts.as early as,he began to help create several organizations,including the florida international festival fif,central florida cultural endeavors cfce,seaside music theater smt,and lively arts center,laci collectively cultural entities.smt,in particular,has consistently depended on funding from njc.after njc pledged million to smt in,njc management developed a strategy according to which contributions to smt would go down by annually until they totaled no more than per year.the strategy was never effectively implemented,and,in fact,in,njc total contribution to smt came to million.by the following year,this figure had risen to what it had been eight years before.
in,njc directors organized laci as a part of the smt strategy.tippen,georgia kaney,marc davidson,and julia truilo served as its original board of directors.their goal was to build and operate an independent and upscale performing arts center for smt,thereby enhancing the stature of smt and increasing its revenue.the projected cost for the center was million.njc provided million of this amount as part of a naming rights agreement 
in the beginning,njc treated its contributions to the cultural entities as charitable tax deductions.over time,however,the donations began to exceed the maximum allowed for charitable deductions.accordingly,in,njc began to classify its contributions as business expenses for the purpose of corporate promotion.the district court found these cultural expenditures to have been waste.njc does not challenge that finding for the purposes of this appeal.
cox first learned of the million naming rights agreement on march.unsatisfied with the explanations for this expenditure provided by njc,cox filed suit on may,alleging various acts of fraud,waste,and mismanagement.njc then timely elected to purchase cox shares at the fair value of the shares pursuant to florida law.stat.because the parties were unable to come to any agreement,the district court held a bench trial to determine the fair value of cox shares.id.
at trial,both sides presented expert testimony.cox expert,owen van essen,is a partner in dirks,van essen,murray,a firm specializing in the valuation of newspapers.van essen firm has valued in excess of ten billion dollars worth of transactions in its year history and more than fifty percent of the daily newspaper transactions in the united states over the past decade.prior to joining the firm,van essen worked exclusively in the newspaper business,and was,at one point,general manager and part owner of a daily newspaper.on the basis of this background,the district court concluded that van essen was plainly qualified to provide testimony regarding the fair value of cox shares.at.
van essen starting point in valuing cox shares was the fair market value of the as a going concern.to determine fair market value,van essen used a comparable sales analysis,which measures the market value of a newspaper primarily in relation to the purchase prices of comparable newspapers van essen began his analysis by comparing njc earnings before interest,taxes,depreciation,and amortization ebitda margin to the average ebitda or operating margin of eleven publicly traded newspaper companies.in comparison to njc operating margin of,the eleven publicly traded newspaper companies had an average operating margin of.relying on this data,van essen normalized njc operating margin to.at.
from a database of over newspaper transactions,van essen selected seven transactions involving newspaper companies comparable to the.id.at,exh.at.van essen selected the comparables based on different measures,including growth,circulation,financial metrics,and market characteristics.he then calculated the average purchase and purchase ratios of the comparable companies.after excluding two due to abnormally high ratios,van essen determined that the remaining comparables had an average purchase ratio of and an average purchase ratio of.at.
in a slight departure from his standard approach,van essen then adjusted his multipliers downward in order to account for njc higher than average capital expenditures and a possible reduction in njc growth rate.id.thus,van essen determined that the fair market value as of may was million.id.at.under a similar analysis,van essen further determined that the fair market value of pennysaver was million.id.at.accordingly,van essen concluded that njc fair market value was million and that cox share of that thus the relevant fair value came to.id.as a check on the market approach,van essen also conducted a discounted analysis of njc.using a projected growth rate of,as in his view was appropriate to njc circumstances,and a normalized operating margin of,van essen concluded that njc fair value under the discounted analysis was million,exh.at.
njc expert,robert duffy is a certified public accountant and partner in the firm of grant thornton.he is also accredited as a senior appraiser by the american society of appraisers.unlike van essen,however,duffy has had little experience in valuing newspapers.his specialty is in gift taxation and complex dissolutions of marriage.complex dissolutions of marriage account for approximately of duffy practice.based on this background,the district court also found duffy to be qualified as an expert,though appreciably less so than van essen.at.
in assessing the value of njc,duffy relied on discounted the value of a company according to the present value of its anticipated future cash flow.the discounted model has four components estimated earning capacity cash flow adjustments to the earning capacity a discount rate to discount future cash flow to present value and a growth rate to reflect growth in earnings and cash flow beyond the end of the forecast period.
like van essen,duffy operated from the premise that njc should be valued as a going concern.duffy definition of going concern was influenced by jonathan kaney suggestion that valuing a company as a going concern rests on the assumption that a company will operate in the future exactly as it has in the past.duffy further assumed that,in a hypothetical sale of njc,the current controlling shareholder group and current business model of njc would remain intact,purchase of the entire company by a strategic buyer should not be considered and no material change to njc operations,capital structure,business model or profitability would have resulted from the sale.at.
duffy began his analysis by estimating the future projected cash flow of njc from may onward.he then predicted,on the basis of conversations with njc management,that njc would operate for years at its presently low ebitda margin of roughly but would thereafter operate at a higher ebitda margin comparable to the margins the company enjoyed during the period from through.id.at.after accounting for an anticipated reduction in njc corporate contributions to per year,duffy determined that njc would eventually operate at an ebitda margin.id.at.based on these projections,duffy concluded that njc cash flow in would be approximately million.id.at.
using the gordon growth model and applying a capitalization rate of subtracting a projected growth rate of from a discount rate of,duffy projected a future cash flow of million.id.at.after discounting this amount to a present value of,duffy added back the present value of the initial discrete two and a half year cash flows and concluded that the aggregate value of njc was million.id.
an additional to account for a tax shield related to the depreciation of njc naming rights and another for a tax shield related to building depreciation resulted in an adjusted aggregate value of.see id.at.based on studies of restricted stock,duffy then applied a lack of marketability discount to njc value,yielding a final estimated value of.id.at.in duffy opinion,the fair value of cox as of may was.id.
the district court,crediting van essen testimony,adopted the fair market sales analysis methodology for determining the fair value of cox shares.the court reasoned that this method is generally accepted in the financial community and protects minority shareholders.the court rejected duffy methodology on the ground that it would reward wrongdoing by permitting njc to purchase cox shares at a bargain price.more specifically,the court reasoned that accepting duffy definition of a going concern would,in essence,create an incentive for those with control over corporations to violate fiduciary duties,waste corporate assets,and drive down the value of minority shares.at.instead,the court defined a going concern as a corporation that will be managed in a reasonably prudent manner going forward,regardless of how poorly it may have been run in the past.id.
concluding that it would have been more appropriate for van essen to normalize njc operating margin to that of the average of similarly situated papers identified in his comparables rather than to that of eleven publicly traded newspaper companies,the court recalculated van essen numbers.accordingly,the court found a fair market value as of may for the of million,which combined with the million fair market value of pennysaver,yielded a total of million.finally,the court concluded that the fair value of cox interest in njc was.id.at.
on appeal,njc challenges the district court definition of going concern,its use of fair market value as part of its calculation of fair value,and its normalization of the news journal operating margin.in its,cox argues that the district court should have further adjusted its fair value determination to account for mismanagement and corporate waste,and that the court should have awarded cox prejudgment interest for the period between the valuation date and the entry of judgment.
ii.discussion 
fla stat.gives the court charged with valuing shares in a corporation discretion to determine the most appropriate valuation method by which to arrive at fair value.see fashion design,garcia,so d,a trial court selection of one valuation method over another does not require reversal.also citing in re walt submarine sandwiches,the valuation process is fact specific with an emphasis on the particular circumstances of the case see also in re blake blake agency,the factors to be considered in determining fair value are,inter alia,market value,investment value,and net asset value,and t he weight to be accorded each factor depends upon the circumstances of the particular case.citations omitted when trial judges are given such discretion,we review only for an abuse of that discretion.fdic morley,cir.in reviewing for abuse of discretion,we recognize the existence of a range of possible conclusions the trial judge may reach,and we must affirm unless we find that the district court has made a clear error of judgment,or has applied the wrong legal standard.amlong amlong,denny,cir.
consideration of fair market value 
florida courts have explained that determination of fair value for the purposes of the election statute rests on determining what a willing purchaser in an arm length transaction would offer for an interest in the subject business.fashion design,so d at see also friedman beway realty,applying new york statute similar to florida statute.this is not to say that fair value is synonymous with fair market value.most courts have rejected the notion of such synonymity.see boettcher imc mortg,so d.however,the terms are not mutually exclusive.on one hand,as florida courts have explained,where fair market value would take into account appreciation or depreciation in anticipation of corporate action such as a merger or acquisition,the valuation process under must exclude both positive and negative effects of any such impending transaction.id.on the other hand,a court may use fair market value as an estimate of fair value when such potentially distorting corporate actions are not at issue.see,fashion design,so d at affirming trial court reliance on market value approach and evidence of good faith,bona fide,arm length offer for minority shareholder shares in determination of fair value 
accordingly,florida courts have recognized that valuation proceedings necessarily confront them with a variety of evidence and methods aimed at determining the price of minority interests.id.at quotation and citation omitted.in valuing a corporation,a court should consider proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court such as net asset values,market price,earnings,and the like.boettcher,so d at quotation and citation omitted.
here,the district court first found that njc was a marketable viable businesses that would command an attractive price on the open market.at.consequently,in the absence of any imminent merger,acquisition or other distorting corporate action,the court found that the fair market sales valuation method used by van essen was that most appropriate to this case and weighted van essen testimony accordingly.the court then made adjustments to van essen calculations to give greater weight to the closely held status.the court adopted its valuation method based upon the circumstances of this case and offered solid reasons for its decision to do so.we find no abuse of discretion.
definition of going concern and normalization of ebitda 
the fair value of a business should be determined based on the value of that business as a going concern.fashion design,so d at.although neither party disputes this,njc challenges the district court interpretation of the term going concern.the term going concern is generally understood to refer to a commercial enterprise actively engaging in business with the expectation of indefinite continuance.blacks law dictionary ed.in the valuation context,it is generally u
