appellants milton and kathi guenther collectively,the guenthers,appeal a judgment awarding in attorneys fees to appellees timothy shimko,and his law firm,shimko piscitelli the law firm and its partners collectively,shimko in payment for certain legal services allegedly provided to arizona limited partnerships,comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facility corf licensing services,and corf management services,collectively,corf entities,and their limited partners.the organic documents of both the corf entities list milton guenther individually,guenther as a limited partner,not as a general partner.
on appeal,shimko argues that it reasonably believed guenther to be a general,rather than a limited partner,and that,as a result,the guenthers are liable for the legal fees of the corf entities under arizona revised statutes.we disagree.shimko is not an ordinary creditor.
shimko is a law firm hired to defend the corf entities and its limited partners against a significant number of multimillion dollar claims filed across the country,primarily alleging fraud.we hold that because shimko owed a fiduciary duty of care to its clients,it is chargeable under the facts of this case with knowledge of the contents of the corf entities organic documents,whether or not it actually examined them,and,consequently,that it was not reasonable for shimko to believe that guenther was a general partner of either of the corf entities.accordingly,shimko may not recover from the guenthers the legal fees owed by the corf entities to shimko.
we reverse in part,affirm in part,and remand for further proceedings on the guenthers liability for legal fees incurred as a result of shimko representation of the guenthers personally.
background and prior proceedings 
richard ross,david goldfarb,paul woodcock,and guenther collectively,defendants were limited partners of the corf entities the corf entities offered clients consulting and management services to help them establish and operate outpatient treatment facilities.upon commencement of the corf entities operations,guenther was in charge of field operations,actively lectured at corf marketing seminars,and helped find locations and medical directors for corf clients.
during the period from late to,a number of the corf entities clients located in various parts of the country threatened to file or did file complaints against the corf entities,as well as against the defendants in their individual capacities,alleging fraud and other causes of action.
according to shimko response brief filed in this case,shimko was asked to advise guenther and the other owners on the extent of their individual and personal exposure,if any,beyond the protection offered to them by the limited partnership structure under which they owned and operated the corf entities.although the district found otherwise,shimko claims it did not represent the corf entities and billed them only because it was requested to do so by the defendants.neither the corf entities nor the defendants paid shimko for its services during the period from october to april.in april,shimko stopped representing the corf entities and the defendants,and shortly thereafter,it filed suit in district court alleging action on an account,breach of contract,passing bad checks,and quantum meruit and fraud and seeking payment of legal fees in the sum of.
shimko filed a motion for summary judgment against all defendants.ross and goldfarb filed a joint for summary judgment.the guenthers did not file a response to shimko motion for summary judgment.
the district court partially granted ross and goldfarbs for summary judgment,and dismissed them from the suit shimko claims for passing bad checks and fraud were also dismissed.woodcock filed for bankruptcy,staying the suit as to him.shimko remaining claims against the guenthers for breach of contract,action on account,and quantum meruit then proceeded to trial.following a one day bench trial,the district court held that guenther,as a limited partner in control,and his spouse,were liable for the entirety of shimko unpaid attorneys fees.
in its findings and conclusions,the district court found that shimko was retained to represent the corf entities as well as its individual principals.it found that the guenthers were personally represented by shimko,that they personally agreed to this representation,and that they were liable for legal services performed for them personally.the district court also found that guenther participated in the control of the corf entities as a general partner,along with his colleagues,and that due to his substantial involvement in the operations of the corf entities,it was reasonable for shimko to believe that he was dealing with a general partner.the court then found in favor of shimko on the action on account and contract causes of action and found the guenthers liable for all unpaid legal fees charged to the corf entities,mooting the claim for unjust enrichment.
though the court ultimately ruled only on the action on account and contract causes of action,it commented that had it ruled on the unjust enrichment claim,it would have found in favor of shimko because the guenthers benefitted from shimko legal services.however,it noted that the contract damages would have been reduced since the representation of guenther was only a part of the scope of the services rendered.had it ruled solely based upon unjust enrichment,it would have reduced damages by an allocation of work simply to guenther,and we would reduce the fee from the contracted amount of an hour to a lesser,more reasonable amount.
the guenthers filed a motion for reconsideration a new trial,which the district court denied.the guenthers now appeal both the judgment and the denial of their motion.

iii.discussion 
arizona revised statutes 
a states,in pertinent part 
a limited partner is not liable for the obligations of a limited partnership unless he is also a general partner or,in addition to the exercise of his rights and powers as a limited partner,he participates in the control of the business.however,if the limited partner participates in the control of the business,he is liable only to persons who transact business with the limited partnership reasonably believing,based on the limited partner conduct,that the limited partner is a general partner.
thus,a limited partner may be held liable to a third party for the debts of the partnership if the limited partner is either a general partner or a participant in the control of the business and the third party reasonably believes that the limited partner is a general partner.defines a general partner as a person who has been admitted to a limited partnership as a general partner in accordance with the partnership agreement and named in the certificate of limited partnership as a general partner.guenther was not a general partner,as defined by,of either corf entity.the district court found,however,that guenther participated in the control of the business.we review this factual finding for clear error,and we find none.
this determination,however,does not complete our inquiry.guenther can only be held liable as a general partner to persons who transact business with the limited partnership reasonably believing,based on the limited partner conduct,that the limited partner is a general partner.a emphasis added.this statute,derived from of the revised uniform limited partnership act rulpa,is related to the same legal principle as the agency concept of apparent authority.see,restatement third of ag
