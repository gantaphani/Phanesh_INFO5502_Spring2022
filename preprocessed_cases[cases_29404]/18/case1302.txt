defendants,brian kennedy and,as to skyline outdoor media llc only,david seyde,appeal from a may,order in favor of plaintiff,drake kennedy the may,order denied defendants motion to stay dissolution of a number of corporations and limited liability companies and appoint appraisers to permit a buyout to occur.defendants contend the trial court erred as a matter of law in refusing to order the stay,appraisal and buyout procedure in sections and.we affirm.
ii.background 
complaint and second amended cross complaint 
drake filed a complaint while brian operative pleading is the second amended.both pleadings allege extensive misconduct by the parties which are not directly pertinent to the controlling legal issues.given our resolution of the legal issues,we need not discuss the parties mutual allegations and evidence of corporate misconduct.
drake complaint was filed against defendants on september.in addition to brian,seyde and skyline outdoor media llc,named as defendants were regency outdoor advertising,corona outdoor,westminster outdoor,virtual media group,west hollywood properties llc and kennedy outdoor advertising llc.as can be noted,other than brian and seyde,some defendants are corporations and others are limited liability companies.according to the complaint,drake and brian each owned a percent interest in what we will refer to as the corporations regency outdoor advertising,corona outdoor advertising,westminster outdoor,and virtual media group.
in terms of the limited liability companies,skyline outdoor media llc and west hollywood properties llc,drake and brian held different interests.drake and brian held a percent interest in west hollywood properties llc.drake and brian each held a percent interest in skyline outdoor media llc.seyde held a percent interest in skyline outdoor media llc.west hollywood properties llc and skyline outdoor media llc will hereafter be referred to as the limited liability companies.collectively,the corporations and limited liability companies will be referred to as the companies.drake and brian were each a director,officer,and shareholder or member of each of the companies.seyde was a member of skyline outdoor media llc and held a senior management position in regency outdoor advertising.brian was the sole member of kennedy outdoor advertising llc.
the complaint alleges that brian stopped communicating with drake about most business matters restricted drake access to information and the books and records looted and diverted corporate assets refused to pay costs defending a lawsuit stole valuable real estate located at the intersection of sunset boulevard and queens road from west hollywood properties llp and,with the assistance of seyde,transferred the sunset boulevard and queens road property to kennedy outdoor advertising llc.kennedy outdoor advertising llc was an entity owned entirely by brian.it is alleged seyde,with brian assistance,directly competed with regency outdoor advertising,in the outdoor advertising business.further,it is alleged brian and seyde created kennedy outdoor advertising llc to compete with the corporations and west hollywood properties llc.
drake complaint alleges causes of action against defendants collectively or individually fiduciary duty breach fraudulent concealment aiding and abetting and conspiracy to commit fiduciary duty breach aiding and abetting and conspiracy to commit fraudulent concealment quiet title ejectment director removal inspection right violation accounting and declaratory relief.depending on the claims,they are brought as derivative or direct actions.drake complaint also contains a cause of action for involuntary dissolution of the corporations and the limited liability companies.the involuntary dissolution claim seeks the appointment of a receiver to take possession of all of the companies assets and an order requiring they be sold to a third party.all of defendants alleged misconduct occurred prior to september.none of the claims in the involuntary dissolution cause of action are derivative in nature.
on july,brian filed a second amended against regency outdoor advertising,drake and stephanie kennedy corona outdoor advertising,westminster outdoor inc virtual media group,west hollywood properties llc and skyline outdoor media,llc.the second amended contains causes of action for common counts conversion unjust enrichment fiduciary duty breach aiding and abetting and conspiracy to commit fiduciary duty breach constructive fraud imposition of a constructive trust director removal constructive trust imposition judicial dissociation of drake promissory estoppel and trade secret misappropriation.some of the claims are direct while others are derivative in nature.the second cause of action seeks damages,disgorgement for unjust enrichment,various judicial decrees and costs of suit and attorney fees.
motion to stay dissolution and appoint appraisers and the trial court ruling 
on january,defendants filed a motion to stay dissolution and appoint appraisers.the motion was brought pursuant to sections as to the corporations and,subdivision c as to the limited liability companies.this would allow defendants to avoid dissolution by purchasing drake ownership interests in the companies.seyde filed the motion to stay dissolution and appoint appraisers as to skyline outdoor media llc only.on february,drake dismissed with prejudice his involuntary dissolution cause of action.on may,defendants motion to stay dissolution and appoint appraisers was denied.the trial court disagreed with defendants contention that the invocation of their buyout rights was barred because of the dismissal of drake involuntary dissolution cause of action,t he court finds that as a result of drake dismissal of the dissolution claim,the court lacks jurisdiction to consider defendants motion for buyout under section s and.the trial court ruled section,subdivision c did not apply because it was not operative until after drake filed suit.
iii.discussion 
a.the dismissal of plaintiff cause of action for dissolution of the corporations renders the statutory buyout provision inapplicable 
defendants contend the trial court erred in denying their motion to stay dissolution and appoint appraisers under section,subdivision a.defendants reason the statutory buyout procedure supplanted the dissolution action.we disagree.
because this issue involves an issue of a statutory interpretation applied to undisputed facts,we exercise independent review.burden snowden cal th,panakosta,partners,lp hammer lane management,llc th,panakosta.our supreme court has explained when construing a statute,we look first to its words,because they generally provide the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.citation.we give the words their usual and ordinary meaning citation,while construing them in light of the statute as a whole and the statute purpose citation.pineda williams sonoma stores,cal th.accord,in re ethan cal th,hsu abbara cal th.according to our supreme court if there is no ambiguity in the language,we presume the legislature meant what it said and the plain meaning of the statute governs.citation.only when the statute language is ambiguous or susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation,may the court turn to extrinsic aids to assist in interpretation.citation.pineda williams sonoma stores,supra,cal th at see in re ethan,supra,cal th at.
section,subdivision a provides subject to any contrary provision in the articles,in any suit for involuntary dissolution,the holders of percent or more of the voting power of the corporation the purchasing parties may avoid the dissolution of the corporation and the appointment of any receiver by purchasing for cash the shares owned by the plaintiffs or by the shareholders so initiating the proceeding the moving parties at their fair value.the fair value shall be determined on the basis of the liquidation value as of the valuation date but taking into account the possibility,if any,of sale of the entire business as a going concern in a liquidation section,subdivision a expressly provides the right to purchase the shares of a plaintiff is an alternative to an involuntary dissolution of a corporation.section,subdivision a applies to any suit seeking an involuntary dissolution.under those circumstances,the purchasing shareholders may avoid the dissolution of the corporation and the appointment of any receiver by buying the plaintiff shares.nothing in section,subdivision a provides for a buyout independent of a pending involuntary dissolution suit.
here,drake involuntary dissolution claim was dismissed with prejudice.code of civil procedure section,subdivision c generally grants a plaintiff an unfettered right to dismiss a cause of action before commencement of trial.wells marina city properties,cal d,panakosta,partners,lp hammer lane management,llc,supra,th at.there is no issue in the case concerning a derivative shareholder claim.the language in section,subdivision a is unambiguous.upon dismissal of the dissolution cause of action,there is no dissolution to avoid and,thus,no right to buy out plaintiff interests.id.at cubalevic superior court d,cubalevic.
in panakosta,supra,th at pages,limited partners in a partnership filed an action.the plaintiffs filed suit against other limited partners and sought judicial dissolution of the partnership as well as declaratory and injunctive relief.id.at.while the suit was pending,one of the defendants filed a proceeding under a new case number.the new lawsuit sought to buy out the plaintiffs partnership interests the appointment of appraisers and a stay of the related dissolution proceeding.id.at.the plaintiffs then dismissed with prejudice their claim for dissolution of the partnership.ibid.the trial court denied the defendants motion for appointment of appraisers and stay of the related case.among other things,the trial court ruled that the request for dissolution,which was the condition precedent for the buyout,had been dismissed.ibid.
the court of appeal affirmed the trial court rulings.at issue was the application of section.section is substantially the same as the section.section,subdivision b provides,in any suit for judicial dissolution,the other partners may avoid the dissolution of the limited partnership by purchasing for cash the partnership interests owned by the partners so initiating the proceeding the moving parties at their fair market value.the court of appeal held t he right of buyout under section is dependent upon a cause of action for judicial dissolution.a request for buyout under section does not constitute a cause of action independent from a judicial dissolution action.instead,a buyout represents an alternative to winding up a business when it is not reasonably practicable to carry on the activities of the limited partnership in conformity with the partnership agreement,subd.a.without a pending judicial dissolution action,the trial court was without jurisdiction to allow the buyout petition to proceed.panakosta,supra,th at.
in cubalevic,supra,d at page,the plaintiff shareholder filed a lawsuit that included an involuntary dissolution cause of action against a corporate defendant.a shareholder defendant moved for a stay of the dissolution proceeding and an order appointing appraisers.id.at.but before the argument on the motion,the plaintiff dismissed with prejudice the involuntary dissolution cause of action.id.at.the trial court treated the buyout motion as a granted the buyout motion and appointed an appraiser to fix the value of the plaintiff shares.id.at.the shareholder defendant filed a prohibition petition seeking to set aside the foregoing orders.id.at.
the court of appeal granted the defendant prohibition petition.construing former section the court of appeal held there is no independent right on the part of one or more stockholders in a corporation to compel the sale to them of the shares of stock of another.there being no such independent right it must follow that there could be no cause of action stated to compel such a sale whether by way of a or counterclaim which would survive after dismissal of the action for involuntary dissolution of the corporation in which the remedy of purchase is given.it is apparent that the real parties in interest here could not bring or maintain a separate action against petitioner the purpose of which would be to compel him to sell his stock to them.under these circumstances,the remedy provided the real parties in interest under the provisions of section and section of the corporations code is ancillary to and is dependent upon the existence of the action to compel the involuntary dissolution of the corporation,and upon the dismissal of such action there is nothing left against which the ancillary remedy may be asserted or upon which it may be applied.in the case at bench,the action for involuntary dissolution having been dismissed with prejudice prior to a decision confirming an award as provided in section of the corporations code,there was left no basis upon which the trial court could make its order,the purpose of which was to ascertain the fair cash value of petitioner shares and to permit the real parties in interest to purchase them in order to avoid the involuntary dissolution of the corporation.the making of such an order constituted an act in excess of the jurisdiction of the respondent court.cubalevic,supra,d at.we agree with the trial court that the analysis in panakosta and cubalevic,coupled with the express language of section,subdivision a,required the buyout motion be denied.
defendants rely on go pacific health services,th,go.the facts in go are unrelated to the procedural scenario in our case.the following is the procedural scenario go sued defendants on september,seeking the involuntary dissolution of pacific health services,pursuant to section,subdivisions b and b.go also sought damages based on claims of breach of fiduciary duty and fraud as a shareholder derivative action,and as a direct action brought by a shareholder and director.vilma go pacific health services,et,los angeles super.court case no.on december,defendants filed a for breach of contract,misappropriation of corporate opportunities,and breach of the duty of loyalty.on april,defendants filed a motion pursuant to section for an order to stay the dissolution proceedings.they requested that the court set a valuation date of august,and fix the value of go shares.on may,the court issued an order staying the dissolution proceedings,and providing for the appointment of three appraisers.the parties were to each choose one appraiser,and the two appraisers would then choose the third appraiser.the court ordered the valuation date to be september,the date go filed suit and ordered the appraisal to be concluded by september.go,supra,th at,fns.omitted.after the appointment process was completed and the appraisals conducted,eventually,the trial court issued what the court of appeal characterized as an alternative decree.id.at.the court of appeal described the alternative decree thusly,on september,the trial court issued an order directing defendants to pay go,within days,and stating that if this payment is not made within such time the involuntary winding up and dissolution of defendant corporation shall proceed immediately.id.at.
on appeal,the court of appeal characterized the issue as follows defendants contend on appeal that the alternative decree the court issued on september,should be set aside because defendants have not yet had the opportunity to defend themselves against go claim for involuntary dissolution of phs,and that go has not proven that she is entitled to relief under that claim.defendants argue,as they did in the trial court,that once there has been a determination on the merits that go is entitled to commence the dissolution of phs,the entry of a decree with the effect of the alternative decree would be appropriate however,now is not the time for such an order,as the interests of equity and the desire for a determination on the merits justify a delay in the imposition of that relief.they request that we set aside the alternative decree and remand this matter with directions to the trial court to only enter such a decree after go has prevailed on her claims for involuntary dissolution.go,supra,th at.
go,supra,does not support defendants position.in go,the plaintiff did not dismiss her dissolution cause of action.the entire appraisal issue was litigated,orders were issued and the trial court issued an alternatively phrased decree which dissolved the corporation if the plaintiff remained unpaid.there was no discussion concerning how a dismissal by the plaintiff of the dissolution claim would have affected the defendants right to purchase her shares.here,drake dismissal of his involuntary dissolution claim rendered inapplicable the section buyout procedure.see panakosta,supra,th at,cubalevic,supra,d at.
one final note is in order concerning the dismissal of the involuntary dissolution cause of action.no party has asserted that drake is pursuing a derivative claim against defendants.dismissal of a derivative claim requires court approval.whitten dabney cal,see westwood temple emanuel center d.no party has asserted that court approval was necessary in this case for drake to dismiss his involuntary dissolution cause of action.any contention in that regard has been forfeited.tiernan trustees of cal.state university colleges cal d,fn.johnston board of supervisors cal d,disapproved on another point in bailey los angeles cal d.
defendants have no right to compel a buyout of plaintiff interest in the limited liability companies 
defendants contend they are entitled to buy out drake interests in the limited liability companies even though he dismissed his involuntary dissolution cause of action.defendants rely on section,subdivision c which,in the context of limited liability companies,states,a dismissal of any suit for judicial dissolution by a manager,member,or members shall not affect the other members rights to avoid dissolution pursuant to this section.section,subdivision c was enacted in.stats,ch.defendants argue that section,subdivision c can not be applied to this case because it was not operative when the conduct which allegedly permits dissolution occurred.
before analyzing the parties retroactivity contentions,it is appropriate to review the events leading up to the adoption of section,subdivision c.enacted in,the beverly killea limited liability company act was largely codified in former section et.stats,ch,see cb richard ellis,terra nostra consultants th,fn.former section et comprehensively governed the affairs of limited liability companies.nicholas laboratories,llc chen th,see people pacific landmark th,com.on judiciary,on bill reg.sess.as amended.former section et was codified in title of the corporations code.the beverly killea limited liability company act was replaced in by the california revised uniform limited liability company act.stats,ch,legis.counsel,bill see cb richard ellis,terra nostra consultants,supra,th at,fn.the california revised uniform limited liability company act enacted new corporations code title which consists of section et.new title,the california revised uniform limited liability company act,replaced former title of the corporations code.
we turn now to section.section,subdivision a allows for the dissolution of a limited liability company under specified circumstances those circumstances are specified in section,subdivision b.section,subdivisions c through describes how the buyout procedure is conducted.as noted,section,subdivision c permits the corporate buyout remedy to proceed even when a plaintiff seeking dissolution of a limited liability company dismisses his or her cause of action.there is no similar buyout provision in the general corporation law codified in section et.forming and operating california limited liability companies ed,forming and operating.also,no such comparable terms are present in the uniform limited partnership act of which is codified at section et.forming and operating,op.cit.the upshot of section,subdivision c is as follows in the context of limited liability companies o nce the buyout procedure is commenced,the moving party can not,by dismissing the judicial dissolution action,prevent the buyout procedure from going forward.the purchasing party has the right to pursue the buyout procedure by compelling a sale if the valuation is favorable or walking away if it is not.forming and operating,op.
defendants argue that section,subdivision c applies to this action which was commenced by the filing of drake complaint on september.drake argues though that the unique retroactivity and operative date provisions applicable to limited liability companies prevents section,subdivision c from applying here.drake has the better argument.
defendants first rely on california constitution,article iv,section,subdivision c which states,except as provided in paragraphs and of this subdivision,a statute enacted at a regular session shall go into effect on january next following a day period from the date of enactment of the statute next following a day period from the date of enactment of the statute,subd.a codifying cal,art.iv,subd.c.defendants argue that section,subdivision c was therefore effective on january.then,defendants cite to the savings clause for the california revised uniform limited liability company act which states,this title does not affect an action commenced,proceeding brought,or right accrued or accruing before this title takes effect.section is part of title of the corporations code and the california revised uniform limited liability company act.thus,defendants argue the legislature intended the buyout provisions for limited liability companies in section,subdivision c to apply to our action which was filed after january.further,defendants motion to stay the dissolution and appoint appraisers was filed on january.also,drake dismissal request was filed on february.since these events occurred after the effective date of the california revised uniform limited liability company act,defendants contend section,subdivision c applies here.by contrast,drake relies upon both sections,which we have discussed,and which states,this title shall become operative on january.
in our view,the statutory language concerning when the california revised uniform limited liability company act in general and section,subdivision c in particular is ambiguous.a sound argument can be made,as defendants do,that the limited liability company legislation applies to an action commenced prior to january.likewise,the operative date language in section supports drake thoughtful contention that section,subdivision c can not apply in our case.as we previously explained,when statutory language is ambiguous,it may be appropriate to resort to legislative history documents to determine what the legislature intended.our supreme court has held if the statutory language is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation,we must look to additional canons of statutory construction to determine the legislature purpose.olson automobile club of southern california cal th.both the legislative history of the statute and the wider historical circumstances of its enactment may be considered in ascertaining the legislative intent.dyna med,fair employment housing com.cal d.mccarther pacific telesis group cal th.we allowed the parties to address the desirability of judicially noticing the documents referenced in the remainder of this opinion,subd.a,subd.c see people preslie d.we cite them because they are relevant to discerning the legislature intentions.jankey lee cal th,people soto cal th.
in order to determine the legislature intent,we turn to documents largely prepared in including those contained in legislative files.to begin with,legislators were repeatedly advised that adoption of the california revised uniform limited liability company act would repeal the beverly killea limited liability company act.com.on judiciary,on bill as amended,rules,off.of floor analyses,reading analysis of bill as amended,assem.com.on judiciary,on bill as amended,assem.republican caucus,analysis on bill as amended,assem.com.on appropriations,on bill as amended,of finance analysis of bill as amended,reading analysis of bill as amended,republican policy office,on bill as amended,assem.republican caucus,analysis on bill as amended,assem.com.on judiciary,on bill as amended,republican policy office,on bill as amended,assem.republican bill analysis on bill as amended,rules,off.of floor analyses,unfinished business analysis of bill as amended,republican policy office,on bill as amended,assem.republican bill analysis on bill as amended.and senator juan vargas,the author of senate bill,advised the assembly committee on judiciary his legislation would repeal the beverly killea limited liability company act.assem.com.on judiciary,mandatory information worksheet concerning bill.
further,the legislature was aware that bill would create separate effective and operative dates for the california revised uniform limited liability company act.as originally proposed,there were two separate effective and operative dates.the initial senate judiciary committee report prepared for the january,hearing states typically,when large sections of the corporations code are repealed and a new act is enacted,the legislature provides at least years from the date of enactment of the bill for the repeal of the old laws to allow forms to be updated and provide sufficient notice to the public of the changes in the statutes.see,ab harman,c,stats.accordingly,if this bill moves forward,the inoperation and repeal dates of beverly killea should be modified,along with the operation date of this bill,and the author has agreed to take these amendments in committee.com.on judiciary,on bill as amended,reg.sess.this analysis is consistent with section of the revised uniform limited liability company act which serves as the basis of section et.section of the revised uniform limited liability company act recommends there be a date between when a new limited liability company statute is enacted and it becomes operative.revised uniform limited liability company act,legislative note.

from the foregoing,we deduce the following.the legislature intended that the beverly killea limited liability company act remain in effect until january.the beverly killea limited liability company act was repealed effective january.the beverly killea limited liability company act has no provisions similar to section,subdivision c which permits a buyout to occur if an involuntary dissolution claim is dismissed.the legislature did not intend that both the beverly killea limited liability company and california revised uniform limited liability company acts be operative at the exact same time.and,the legislature intended there be separate dates upon which the california revised uniform limited liability company act was enacted and when it actually went into effect.further,on occasion,the legislature has enacted statutes which have different effective and operative dates.in people alford cal th,footnote,our supreme court explained the effective date of a statute is the date upon which the statute came into being as an existing law.citation.t he operative date is the date upon which the directives of the statute may be actually implemented.citation.although the effective and operative dates of a statute are often the same,the legislature may postpone the operation of certain statutes until a later time.citation.preston state bd.of equalization cal th.
we now return to the language in section which states,this title does not affect an action commenced,proceeding brought,or right accrued or accruing before this title takes effect.the plain language of section provides that title,which includes section,subdivision c,may not affect a lawsuit under four circumstances where a lawsuit is filed before january,where a proceeding is brought before that date where a right accrues prior to that date or a right is accruing before january.as is clear,section is written in the disjunctive,which in its ordinary sense functions to mark an alternative meaning as either this or that in statutes.houge ford cal d,accord barker,los angeles cal d.the dispute at issue involves words takes effect in section.defendants contend it is the effective date of the statute.cal,art.iv,subd.c,subd.a.drake argues it is the date the statute became operative.the beverly killea limited liability company act,which was found in former title of the corporations code,remained in effect until january.see witkin,summary of cal.law supp.partnership.thus,title of the corporations code,which includes section,subdivision c,was not in effect,operative,until january.see ballantine sterling,california corporation laws ed.legislative alert to chapter,sa rel.as noted,the present action was commenced before january.because drake complaint was filed prior to january,title of the corporations code,which includes section,subdivision c does not apply to the present action.see cb richard ellis,terra nostra consultants,supra,th at,fn.thus,we agree with the trial court that the dismissal of the involuntary dissolution cause of action prevented defendants from invoking their buyout rights in the limited liability companies.

unpublished discussion 
first,defendants contend that section,subdivision c applies to all other claims,not merely those involving the limited liability companies.this contention has no merit.section,subdivision c only applies to limited liability companies.legis.counsel dig.bill,para.this bill would repeal the beverly killea limited liability company act as of january,and enact the california revised uniform limited liability company act,as of that date which would recast provisions governing the formation and operation of limited liability companies,subdivision c in any suit for judicial dissolution,the other members may avoid the dissolution of the limited liability company by purchasing for cash,italics added witkin,op.
second,defendants contend that other provisions of the corporations code reflect a legislative intent to allow a buyout to occur outside the context of limited liability companies.no such legislative intent is present.moreover,the legislature has never evinced an intent to modify the power of a plaintiff to unilaterally dismiss a cause of action.in the published portion of this opinion,we have previously discussed the effect of a dismissal of an involuntary dissolution claim.see,supra.apart from section,subdivision c,which applies to limited liability companies only,a dismissal of a corporate dissolution claim eliminates the need for a buyou
