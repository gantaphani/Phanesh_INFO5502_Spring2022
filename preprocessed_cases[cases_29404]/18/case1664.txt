the,peter feldman,appeals from a final judgment entered by the court of chancery following its issuance of a memorandum opinion and order.the court of chancery dismissed all fourteen counts of feldman third amended complaint finding that the claims therein were solely derivative in nature.applying this court holding in lewis anderson the court of chancery held that feldman lacked standing to pursue those derivative claims following a merger the merger in which all of his stock of the nominal defendant,the telx group,telx or the company,was cashed out.
in this appeal,feldman sole argument is that the court of chancery erred in dismissing count xiii of the third amended complaint.in that count,feldman alleges that he received inadequate consideration from the merger because of stock options previously issued to three of the.according to feldman,the allocation of the merger consideration to those stock options directly harmed him because he was paid less for his shares in the merger than he would have been if the options had not existed.
relying upon this court decision in tooley donaldson,lufkin jenrette,feldman contends that his claim in count xiii was an individual one and not derivative in nature.feldman submits that telx directors had an affirmative duty to reconsider the validity of the stock options at the time of the merger and their failure to do so gave rise to a separate and direct claim of harm.the appellees argue that,following this court landmark decision in tooley,except in the inapplicable limited circumstances involving controlling stockholders,described in gentile and gatz ponsoldt a claim that stock options have been wrongly issued to management states a claim for waste and is solely derivative in nature.
the court of chancery characterized feldman contention that count xiii states a direct claim as a bootstrap argument.the court of chancery concluded that the alleged diminution of feldman share of the merger proceeds in count xiii are the same damages that flow from the alleged harm under the predicate derivative claims in those counts of the third amended complaint that challenged the validity of the stock options.the court of chancery held that count xiii was a creative but unsuccessful attempt to recast a derivative claim as a direct claim.we have determined that the judgment of the court of chancery must be affirmed.
statement of facts 
feldman is a former stockholder,officer and board member of telx.when he left the company in,feldman owned shares of telx common stock.in june and august,after the company effected a reverse stock split,feldman sold more than of his telx shares,constituting of his equity position,to steven kumble,one of the defendants.in that arm length transaction,feldman received per share.following that sale,feldman retained shares of telx common stock.
the,with the exception of todd raymond,were,until the merger,members of the board of directors of telx.rory cutaia,jonathan lawrence and todd raymond were also members of the company management.cutaia founded telx,and served as its ceo,president and chairman of the board.todd raymond was the company general counsel.lawrence was the company cfo and coo.the remaining defendants served the company as outside directors.
challenged stock options 
the third amended complaint,inter alia,challenged certain stock options issued to three of the defendants under the company employee stock option plan the esop.the esop was adopted by the telx board on february.the stockholders approved it at the company annual meeting on april.feldman alleged that the options issued thereunder to cutaia,lawrence and todd raymond were invalid.although almost all of the company employees received stock options pursuant to the esop,feldman claims are limited to the options issued to cutaia,lawrence and todd raymond.those options are referred to in this opinion as the challenged stock options.
telx merger and dismissal motion 
in september,while this litigation was proceeding,telx closed the merger with gi partners fund ii,and gi partners side fund ii,together gi.the merger was approved by over of telx stockholders.in the merger,all of the outstanding shares of telx stock were acquired by gi for nearly per share.in addition,all the holders of telx options and warrants received the same per share consideration,minus the applicable strike price.in total,gi paid the telx security holders in excess of million in the merger.following the merger,the defendants moved to dismiss feldman complaint because,as a result of the merger,feldman ceased to own telx stock.the motion to dismiss asserted,based upon the continuous ownership rule of lewis anderson that feldman had lost standing to pursue derivative claims on behalf of telx.
count xiii dismissed 
after the defendants moved to dismiss on the grounds that the merger had extinguished feldman standing to prosecute this litigation,feldman filed a third amended complaint and added count xiii,the only count at issue in this appeal count xiii alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by not reconsidering the validity of the challenged stock options before approving the merger agreement.the court of chancery rejected feldman argument that count xiii stated a direct claim under tooley and held that count xiii is solely derivative in nature.
the court of chancery ruled that the alleged harm for which feldman seeks relief in count xiii is the same as the company would have suffered from the invalidity of the challenged stock options and,under tooley,is derivative in nature.the court of chancery concluded count xiii was an attempt by feldman to avoid dismissal for lack of standing after the merger by creatively attempting to recast a derivative claim by alleging the same fundamental harm in a slightly different way the court of chancery dismissed the entire proceeding,holding that the third amended complaint fourteen counts set forth only derivative claims.under this court decision in lewis anderson feldman lacked standing because derivative claims may be maintained only by stockholders who own shares throughout the litigation.
standard of review 
the decision of the court of chancery granting a motion to dismiss under court of chancery rule b is reviewed by this court de novo we must determine whether the trial judge erred as a matter of law in formulating or applying legal precepts.this court,like the court of chancery,is required to accept the allegations of the third amended complaint as true and draw reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff,feldman.nevertheless,conclusory allegations need not be treated as true,nor should inferences be drawn unless they truly are reasonable dismissal is appropriate only after a judicial determination with reasonable certainty that,under any set of facts that could be proven to support the claims asserted,the plaintiff would not be entitled to relief.
merger eliminates derivative standing 
years ago,in the seminal case of lewis anderson this court held that a corporate merger generally extinguishes a plaintiff standing to maintain a derivative suit.in lewis anderson,as in feldman case,while the plaintiff was litigating a derivative action,the corporate defendant merged with another company,and the plaintiff stock was exchanged for that of the corporate defendant new parent company in lewis anderson,this court held that title,section of the delaware code when read in pari materia with the court of chancery rule requires that a plaintiff not only be a stockholder at the time of the alleged wrongdoing,but that he maintain stockholder status in the corporate defendant throughout the litigation in lewis anderson,we held that since a derivative claim is a property right owned by the nominal corporate defendant,that right flows to the acquiring corporation by operation of a merger 
it is now well established that a plaintiff may avoid dismissal of his derivative claims following a merger in only two distinct circumstances where the claims asserted are direct,rather than derivative,or where one of the exceptions recognized in lewis anderson applies feldman ceased to be a telx stockholder followi
