introduction 
in october,platypus wear,pw industries,collectively platypus,alexandra ponce de leon,and sylvia offner caira,filed a complaint against luce forward hamilton scripps,and two of its attorneys,kevin cahill and timothy pestotnik collectively luce forward,baker mckenzie,and two of its attorneys,charles dick and peter ito,laurens offner laurens,and martin goldberg among other claims,platypus alleged that goldberg had acted illegitimately as platypus chief financial officer,and that he assisted laurens in taking a number of actions that had harmed platypus interests.in october,more than two years after platypus filed its complaint,goldberg filed an application for leave of court to file a late special motion to strike the complaint motion code civ,a party may not file an motion more than days after the filing of the complaint,unless the trial court affirmatively exercises its discretion to allow a late filing,subd.f.the trial court granted goldberg application to file a late motion.goldberg filed an motion,which the trial court denied on the merits.
in this interlocutory appeal,goldberg claims that the trial court erred in denying his motion.platypus claims that the trial court erred in granting goldberg application to file the motion,and that the court properly denied the motion on the merits.
while there are no published cases in which a court has considered whether a trial court abused its discretion in granting a party request to file a late motion,courts in several cases have discussed the purpose of the statutory period in affirming trial courts refusals to consider a late filed motion on the merits.see kunysz sandler th,d kunysz olsen harbison th,d olsen morin rosenthal th,d morin.for example,the olsen court emphasized that the availability of an interlocutory appeal from the denial of an motion is related to the requirement that most such motions will be filed within days of the filing of the complaint.olsen,supra,th at,d.such procedures facilitate the primary purpose of the statute,ensuring the prompt resolution of lawsuits that impinge on a defendant free speech rights.kunysz,supra,th at,d.in exercising its discretion in considering a party request to file an motion after the period,a trial court must carefully consider whether allowing such a filing is consistent with this purpose.
in the present case,goldberg failed to provide a compelling explanation for why he did not file an application for permission to file an motion earlier in the case.goldberg did not articulate any extenuating circumstances justifying a late filing.in particular,he did not explain why he did not file the application until after the parties had completed substantial discovery in the case.under these circumstances,we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in granting goldberg application to file his motion.we therefore reverse the trial court order granting goldberg application to file the motion and vacate the trial court ruling on the merits of the motion.
factual and procedural background 
in its october complaint,platypus alleged that goldberg illegitimately acted as platypus chief financial officer and as a member of platypus board of directors from april through june.platypus claimed that goldberg took a number of actions that were detrimental to platypus interests during this period,including receiving unauthorized compensation,causing platypus to pay laurens personal legal fees,and wasting corporate assets.in a complaint,platypus brought eight claims against goldberg,including breach of fiduciary duty,aiding and abetting breach of a fiduciary duty,conversion,intentional and negligent interference with contractual relations,intentional and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage,and unfair business practices.the complaint also contained numerous claims against luce forward arising out of its prior representation of platypus.
in december,goldberg answered the complaint.
on february,the trial court denied luce forward motion to compel arbitration and stay the litigation pending arbitration.on february,luce forward filed an interlocutory appeal of the trial court february order.on march,goldberg filed a motion to stay further trial proceedings pending resolution of luce forward appeal.on march,the trial court stayed all proceedings in the case,pending the outcome of luce forward appeal.
in february,this court affirmed the trial court denial of luce forward petition to compel arbitration.platypus wear,cahill february,wl nonpub.opn.in april,the remittitur issued in platypus wear,cahill,supra.also in april,the trial court lifted the stay of the trial court proceedings.in may,the trial court set a discovery date of september,and a trial date of october.
in june,luce forward filed a motion seeking a determination that a settlement agreement between platypus and luce forward had been entered into in good faith.in july,goldberg filed an opposition to luce forward motion.on july,the trial court granted luce forward motion.
also in july,goldberg requested a continuance of the trial date and the related discovery dates,and sought the appointment of a discovery referee.on august,the trial court granted goldberg request to continue the trial as a last continuance.the court set december,as the discovery date and january,as the date for trial.
on october,goldberg filed an ex parte application requesting that the court allow him to file an motion,and also asking that the trial date be continued for six months.goldberg advanced three primary reasons why the trial court should grant his application.first,goldberg argued that the public policy behind the statute supported granting the application.goldberg maintained that he was seeking to file a potentially meritorious motion,and that he would be denied the opportunity to litigate the issue if the court were to deny his application.second,goldberg claimed that judicial economy would be served by allowing the filing because his meritorious motion would likely dramatically pare down,if not entirely eliminate the issues to be resolved at trial.finally,goldberg claimed that he would be willing to agree to several conditions designed to eliminate any prejudice platypus might suffer as a result of the late filing.specifically,goldberg stated that he would agree to limit any attorney fees recoverable pursuant to the statute to those fees and costs directly related to the motion,and would also agree that platypus could offset any such recovery by the fees and costs platypus had directly incurred in prosecuting the action against goldberg after the initial period for filing an motion as of right.goldberg also stated that he would be willing to allow discovery to continue while his motion was pending.
in a footnote to his application,goldberg stated that the delay in this case is largely attributable to the manner in which this case proceeded.goldberg noted that his present counsel was not counsel of record during the initial period after the filing of the complaint.goldberg further stated that until the parties had conducted substantial discovery in the case,he had not appreciated that virtually all of plaintiffs claims against him involved privileged and constitutionally protected conduct on his part.goldberg claimed that discovery had been delayed for various procedural reasons,including the stay of the trial court proceedings that occurred between march and april.
platypus filed an opposition to goldberg ex parte application.in its opposition,platypus argued that the purpose of the,to foster the prompt resolution of be undermined by allowing the late filing,and that goldberg had offered no legitimate explanation for the approximately delay in filing the motion.platypus claimed that goldberg simultaneous request for a continuance of the trial date was telling,and reflected an attempted manipulation of the statute.platypus also requested that,to the extent the court was inclined to consider granting goldberg application,the parties be afforded the right to brief the issue of the timeliness of the request in a properly noticed motion.
on november,the trial court held a hearing on goldberg application.at the outset of the hearing,the court indicated that its tentative ruling was to grant the application.the court acknowledged that goldberg had filed the application very late in the game,and noted that he had previously requested a continuance of the trial date.however,the court observed that the case was fairly complex,and commented that goldberg prospective motion might provide a way of making the case more manageable.narrow ing the issues,the court stated,is probably in everyone best interests.
platypus counsel,who appeared telephonically at the hearing,argued that goldberg had failed to offer any explanation as to why he had not filed the application earlier and suggested that there was thus no basis for the court to exercise its discretion to allow the late filing.in addition,platypus counsel argued that goldberg could litigate the same defenses he sought to raise in the proposed motion by way of a motion for judgment on the pleadings,or a motion for summary judgment,instead.
goldberg counsel argued that one of the reasons goldberg wanted to bring an motion was because the trial court had greater discretion to parse causes of action,in ruling on such a motion,than the court would have in considering a motion for judgment on the pleadings.goldberg counsel explained that the delay in bringing the application was partially due to the fact that the case had been focused on other issues,and that counsel had not appreciate d the issue in the case until platypus deposition of goldberg in late july or august.goldberg counsel also noted that his firm had not been counsel of record during the window following platypus filing of the complaint.
the court granted goldberg application to allow the late filing of the motion,subject to most of the conditions goldberg proposed in his application the trial court denied goldberg request to continue the trial and case management dates.the court stated that it would consider continuing the trial readiness conference and the trial date at the hearing on the motion.after conferring with the parties,the court set a briefing schedule for the motion,and set january,as the date for a hearing on the motion.
on november,platypus filed an ex parte application,seeking to condition goldberg filing of an motion on a waiver of goldberg right to appeal the trial court ruling on the motion.platypus argued,the delay inherent in a direct appeal from an order denying goldberg proposed motion should not be permitted at this time in this case,any more than it would be permitted upon the denial of a routine motion for summary judgment.
goldberg opposed the application.in his opposition,goldberg argued that platypus application was really an improper motion for reconsideration,that the trial court could not deprive this court of its jurisdiction or insist on a waiver of goldberg right to appeal,and that platypus remedy for any potentially frivolous appeal of the denial of goldberg motion would be a motion to dismiss the appeal in this court.after holding a hearing,the trial court denied platypus application.
on november,goldberg filed an motion.on december,platypus filed an application to file an oversized opposition to the motion.that same day,goldberg opposed platypus application to file the oversized opposition,and requested,in the alternative,that if the court were to grant platypus application,goldberg be allowed additional time to reply.goldberg noted that granting him additional time to file a reply might necessitate rescheduling the hearing on the motion.on december,the trial court granted platypus request to file an oversized motion,and rescheduled both the date for goldberg filing of a reply and the date for the hearing on the motion.
on december,platypus filed an opposition to the motion.goldberg subsequently filed a reply.
on january,the trial court held a hearing on the motion.on january,the court reset the trial readiness conference date to february,and the trial date to february.
on january,the court denied goldberg motion in its entirety,ruling that goldberg failed to demonstrate that platypus lawsuit arose out of constitutionally protected activity.two days later,goldberg filed this interlocutory appeal,subd.i,subd.a.

reviewability 
section provides in relevant part 
a an appeal,other than in a limited civil case,is to the court of appeal.an appeal,other than in a limited civil case,may be taken from any of the following 
from an order granting or denying a special motion to strike under section.
section provides in relevant part 
upon an appeal pursuant to section the reviewing court may review the verdict or decision and any intermediate ruling,proceeding,order or decision which involves the merits or necessarily affects the judgment or order appealed from or which substantially affects the rights of a party and may affirm,reverse or modify any judgment or order appealed from and may direct the proper judgment or order to be entered,and may,if necessary or proper,direct a new trial or further proceedings to be had.the respondent,or party in whose favor the judgment was given,may,without appealing from such judgment,request the reviewing court to and it may review any of the foregoing matters for the purpose of determining whether or not the appellant was prejudiced by the error or errors upon which he relies for reversal or modification of the judgment from which the appeal is taken.the provisions of this section do not authorize the reviewing court to review any decision or order from which an appeal might have been taken.italics added.
goldberg filed an interlocutory appeal of the trial court denial of his motion,subd.i,subd.a.in its respondent brief,platypus sought review of the trial court november,order granting goldberg application to file a late motion.such review is authorized pursuant to the italicized portion of section quoted above 
goldberg maintains that platypus has waived any claim that the trial court erred in granting his application to file an motion goldberg advances two primary arguments in support of this claim.first,goldberg notes that i ssues are waived on appeal if not raised before the trial court,and argues that platypus never told the trial court that granting goldberg application would be an abuse of discretion.this argument is without merit.platypus filed a written opposition to goldberg application and orally urged the court not to grant goldberg application.in its opposition,platypus noted that goldberg was statutorily prohibited from filing his motion unless the trial court affirmatively exercis ed its discretion to permit such late filing,and argued that california law does not support granting such affirmative relief to goldberg.platypus plainly raised the issue in the trial court.
second,goldberg suggests that platypus act of participating in the setting of a briefing schedule for the motion,its failure to oppose the one week delay in rescheduling the hearing on the motion,and its opposing the motion on the merits,constitute a forfeiture of its right to contest the court granting of the application to file the motion.platypus participation in the setting of the briefing and hearing schedule on the motion and platypus filing an opposition to the motion on the merits occurred after platypus had fully contested goldberg application to allow the filing and after the court granted goldberg the right to file the motion.having adequately raised its objection to goldberg filing of the motion,platypus did not forfeit its right to oppose on appeal the filing of goldberg motion,through its later actions in responding to the motion.
accordingly,we reject goldberg claim that platypus has waived or forfeited review of the trial court ruling granting goldberg application to file an motion.
standard of review 
a trial court ruling on an application to file a late motion is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.see olsen,supra,th at,d.in olsen,the court described the meanin
