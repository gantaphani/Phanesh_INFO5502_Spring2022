ii.district court dismissal with prejudice under rule b 
we review the district court dismissal on the pleadings under federal rule of civil procedure b de novo.bovee coopers lybrand,cir.we must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,accept all the factual allegations as true,and determine whether the plaintiff can prove a set of facts in support of his claims that would entitle him to relief.id.when an allegation is capable of more than one inference,we must construe that allegation in the plaintiff favor.helwig,at.yet,we need not accept as true legal conclusions or unwarranted factual inferences.bovee,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
to succeed on a b rule claim,plaintiffs must establish a misrepresentation or omission,of a material fact,made with scienter,justifiably relied on by plaintiffs,and proximately causing them injury.helwig,at citation omitted.
adding to the federal rules of civil procedure b requirement that fraud must be stated with particularity,the pslra mandates that the complaint specify each statement alleged to have been misleading,the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading,and,if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief,the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.b.in addition,the complaint shall,with respect to each act or omission alleged to violate this chapter,state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b.the requisite state of mind is scienter,a mental state embracing intent to deceive,manipulate or defraud.in re comshare.sec,cir quoting ernst ernst hochfelder,d internal quotation marks omitted.in particular,this court has held that,concerning statements of present or historical fact,helwig,at,plaintiffs may satisfy the scienter pleading requirement by alleging facts giving rise to a strong inference of recklessness.in re comshare,at.r ecklessness is highly unreasonable conduct which is an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care.while the danger need not be known,it must at least be so obvious that any reasonable man would have known of it.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.however,a plaintiff can not satisfy the scienter pleading requirement by alleging facts merely establishing that a defendant had the motive and opportunity to commit securities fraud.id.at emphasis added noting that,although facts concerning motive and opportunity may be relevant to pleading circumstances from which one could infer a strong inference of fraudulent scienter and may,on occasion,rise to the level of creating a strong inference of reckless or knowing conduct,the bare pleading of motive and opportunity does not,standing alone,constitute the pleading of a strong inference of scienter.under the pslra strong inference requirement,plaintiffs need not foreclose all other characterizations of fact,but their factual allegations,in creating an inference of scienter that is strong,must rely on the most plausible of competing inferences.helwig,at strong inferences involve deductive reasoning their strength depends on how closely a conclusion of misconduct follows from a plaintiff proposition of fact.
plaintiffs allegations 
in ford designed the explorer to replace the bronco,a line of sports utility vehicles suv plaintiffs have alleged that the explorer was not thoroughly tested,and that it had problems with its suspension and of gravity.the explorer was sold with atx tires of c rating.while safe,this is the lowest rating of the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa uniform tire quality grading system.this rating has less ability to resist heat than a and b tires.ford recommended a tire inflation of psi.this was less than the tire pressure recommended by bridgestone for tires.low tire pressure decreases a tire ability to resist cause of tire separation.over explorers were sold by the end of the class period.
as of,five lawsuits had been filed against ford and bridgestone for tire separation failures of atx tires on explorers.by,fifteen suits were filed.by,the end of the class period,such lawsuits had been filed against ford for injuries or deaths from explorer crashes.ford and bridgestone,in settling suits,obtained secrecy agreements which required of discovery materials and return of any discovery documents.in addition,there were complaints due to tire failure made to bridgestone.in,bridgestone quietly replaced atx tires in arizona related to atx tire failure.
in,ford received a number of complaints about atx tires from drivers of explorers in saudi arabia.ford referred those to bridgestone,which posited that they were due to driving conditions speeds,driving,high not to the tires.
when complaints continued,ford replaced atx tires in saudi arabia and other persian gulf countries with c tires from another manufacturer which appeared to take care of the tire separation problems.at about the same time,similar complaints were made by drivers in venezuela.there,too,the problems were attributed to specific local conditions namely,driving at speeds of up to for stretches and to the heat.many of the tires in venezuela were manufactured by a bridgestone factory there.at ford direction,atx tires on vehicles in venezuela were replaced with atx tires with a nylon cap.additional strength permitted raising the recommendation for inflation pressure to psi.ford also made suspension changes and different shock absorbers for explorers being sold in venezuela.bridgestone refused to pay for the changes,blaming the explorer suspension system.plaintiffs allege that the failure of ford to reveal that it was experiencing these problems with its explorers with atx tires in the middle east and venezuela made all statements about the quality of ford products in general,false statements.the venezuelan government is now prosecuting ford and bridgestone for their alleged collusion in hiding the defective nature of the explorer equipped with atx tires.
actionable misrepresentation or omission 
the pslra mandates that,where plaintiffs allege that the defendant made an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in light of the circumstances in which they were made,not misleading,plaintiffs must specify each statement alleged to have been misleading,the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading,and,if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief,the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which the belief is formed.b.silence,absent a duty to disclose,is not misleading under rule.basic,levinson,d.yet,even absent a duty to speak,a party who discloses material facts in connection with securities transactions assume s a duty to speak fully and truthfully on those subjects.helwig,at quoting rubin schottenstein,cir.there is no general or independent duty to disclose soft information,information that is uncertain and not objectively verifiable such as predictions,matters of opinion,and asset appraisals.helwig,at.however,even with soft information,a defendant may choose silence or speech based on the factual basis,but it can not choose.helwig,at,holding that a company may remain silent regarding soft information until the fullness of time and additional detail permit confident disclosure,but it may not volunteer material,soft information despite its uncertainty and then escape liability for that information misleading or false nature.
plaintiffs allege,not that ford had an independent duty to disclose the dangerousness of atx equipped explorers or the possible loss contingency regarding it,but that ford made misrepresentations or statements that are misleading absent the disclosure of such material information.in their complaint,plaintiffs allege that ford made many statements about ford having experienced earnings improvement and the explorer having set various sales records that were misleading because ford knew that such profits and sales were due to its sale of a defective product and that the eventual public revelation of the defect would affect adversely ford financial status.however,we have held that t he disclosure of accurate historical data does not become misleading even if the company might predict less favorable results in the future.in re sofamor danek group,cir.because plaintiffs have not alleged the historical inaccuracy of ford financial and earnings statements,such statements are not misrepresentations.
a misrepresentation or an omission is material only if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would have viewed the misrepresentation or omission as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.in re sofamor,at quoting basic,at.we may properly dismiss a complaint on the ground that the alleged misrepresentations or omissions are immaterial only if they are so obviously unimportant to a reasonable investor that reasonable minds could not differ on the question of their unimportance.helwig,at internal quotation marks,citation and emphasis omitted.immaterial statements include vague,soft,puffing statements or obvious hyperbole upon which a reasonable investor would not rely.in re int l.sec,cir.statements that are mere puffing or corporate optimism may be or generalized statements of optimism that are not capable of objective verification.grossman novell,cir.in their complaint,plaintiffs allege that ford made many misleading statements regarding its commitment to quality,safety,and corporate citizenship,such as a t ford quality comes first.we aim to be the quality leader ford has its best quality ever ford is taking actions to improve its quality.ford has made quality a top priority ford is a worldwide leader in automotive safety ford has made quality a top priority ford is designing safety into its cars and trucks because it wants its customers to feel safe and secure in their vehicles at all times ford want s to make customers lives safer ford has dedicated itself to finding even better ways of delivering safer vehicles to the consumer ford want s to be clear leaders in corporate citizenship ford greatest asset is the trust and confidence it has earned from its customers ford is going to lead in corporate social responsibility.such statements are either mere corporate puffery or hyperbole that a reasonable investor would not view as significantly changing the general gist of available information,and thus,are not material,even if they were misleading.all public companies praise their products and their objectives.courts everywhere have demonstrated a willingness to find immaterial as a matter of law a certain kind of rosy affirmation commonly heard from corporate managers and numbingly familiar to the optimistic statements that are so vague,so lacking in specificity,or so clearly constituting the opinions of the speaker,that no reasonable investor could find them important to the total mix of information available.shaw digital equip,cir see also nathenson zonagen,cir broad,general statements about positive and statistically significant test results of a new drug were puffery lasker state gas,cir corporation about its business strategy is not considered seriously by the marketplace and investors in assessing a potential investment.
the same is true with respect to statements such as we want to ensure that all our vehicles have quality,developing cars and trucks that are and we also insisting our suppliers maintain ford stringent quality standards.what ford wants or is insisting its suppliers do would not be interpreted by an investor as a representation that its products achieve that objective or its suppliers maintain the quality standards it asks.yet,plaintiffs maintain that this statement was false because ford permitted bridgestone,its largest tire supplier for the explorer,ford most important product,to supply defectively designed improperly manufactured atx tires that utilized bad,or inappropriate raw materials,and had only a c rating.
plaintiffs allege only three affirmative statements relating specifically to the safety of ford explorers with atx tires.the first two are related.in february,in response to an inquiry from a houston,texas television station regarding three specific rollover accidents in
