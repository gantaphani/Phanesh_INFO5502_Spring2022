this securities fraud class action raises one type of question under the category of questions about whether plaintiff investors have pled facts supporting a strong inference that defendants acted with scienter under the private securities litigation reform act of pslra,stat.
the dispute here is not about whether the facts alleged support the inference that the defendants knew of certain undisclosed facts during the class period.we addressed that type of scienter question in new jersey carpenters pension annuity funds biogen idec,cir.rather,the question here is whether there is a strong inference that the defendants failure to disclose certain facts was a result of wrongful intent,or scienter,even assuming defendants knew of those facts.answering this question involves an inquiry into the relationship between scienter and the materiality of the undisclosed information.we affirm the district court dismissal of this action for failing to meet the strong inference of scienter standard set forth in the pslra.
to set the stage,we describe the complaint and theory of liability brought against waters corporation waters and two of its senior executives,douglas berthiaume and john ornell,under sections b and a of the securities exchange act of,b,and securities exchange commission rule.is pension fund.
the complaint alleges that during the class period of july,to january,defendants intentionally or recklessly failed to disclose a march change in japanese regulations that predictably reduced demand for waters products and services in japan,a significant market for the company.the omission of this government regulatory change was,plaintiff alleges,material and misleading,both in its own right and because disclosure was needed to ensure that defendants other statements about sales and the japanese market would not mislead investors.building on this,plaintiff contends that there is a strong inference of scienter,one which is further strengthened by the fact that berthiaume and ornell,along with other insiders,collectively sold shares of stock for gross proceeds in excess of million during the class period.when defendants eventually disclosed the change in japanese regulations with their fourth quarter results on january,the price of the stock dropped by approximately.

waters,a publicly traded company,designs,manufactures,sells,and services high performance liquid chromatography,ultra performance liquid chromatography,and mass spectrometry instrument systems,as well as support products.during the class period,defendant douglas berthiaume was the company chairman,ceo,and president,and defendant john ornell was the company cfo,principal accounting officer,and vice president of finance and administration.berthiaume and ornell are alleged to have been controlling persons within the meaning of section a of the securities exchange act of.
waters sells its products primarily in the united states,europe,and asia.in,sales to the japanese market accounted for approximately of the company global sales.these sales were,in part,generated by stringent japanese government water testing regulations that had,for the past several years,created a strong demand for waters products and services.
in march,japanese authorities issued amendments easing these regulations,which presumably reduced the demand for waters goods.plaintiff alleges that defendants were aware of this change,that the change was material to investors,and that defendants intentionally or recklessly misled investors by failing to disclose the change during the class period and by issuing statements that were misleading in light of this omission we identify and add emphasis to those statements made by defendants that are said to be misleading or otherwise indicative of defendants scienter.
on july,the first day of the class period,waters announced its second quarter results in a press release and held a conference call with analysts and investors.the press release included the following statement from berthiaume commenting on the quarter 
the generally growth that we experienced in the first quarter accelerated with continued rapid uptake of our new products and strengthening demand from life science customers,including our large pharmaceutical accounts.our first half results are very encouraging and we are optimistic that our new system offerings will continue to stimulate demand going forward.
in the conference call,ornell likewise stated that the company business prospects continue to look very positive with most of our end markets and geographies enjoying strong customer demand.plaintiff argues that these statements are false or misleading,alleging that in japan sales were already dwindling and that defendants knew that these sales would continue to do so.however,berthiaume did in fact acknowledge in the conference call that the company was seeing some finalization of investments in places like japan,where the drinking water regulations spurred a great deal of investment up through,and that the company was seeing that begin to tail itself off.other than this statement,the level of sales in japan was not specifically mentioned in the company earnings press release or conference call.in the conference call,ornell issued general guidance for the third quarter,forecasting quarterly sales growth of and earnings per share in the range of.
in the following months,before the release of the third quarter results,company insiders sold shares of waters common stock for just over million in proceeds.berthiaume sold shares.ornell sold shares.both had acquired the shares that they sold through the simultaneous exercise of options,and they sold these shares at a price of approximately.during this period,waters repurchased shares of its stock,at a cost of over million.
on october,waters announced its third quarter results,which exceeded the july forecasts as to both sales and earnings.waters reported sales growth of compared to the forecast of and earnings per share of compared to the forecast of.waters did not separate out sales in japan for the third quarter,but the topic came up in the quarterly conference call.during that call,berthiaume stated 
outside the united states,the only really major market where we saw some softness in demand was in japan.i think this weakness appeared related to general economic conditions and we are confident that our competitive position in japan remains strong and that our sales there are likely to pick up as general spending conditions improve.
plaintiff alleges that the failure to disclose the change in water testing regulations made it misleading for berthiaume to state that the softness in japan was related to general economic conditions and that sales would likely improve with better spending conditions.
in the same conference call,ornell issued guidance for the fourth quarter,forecasting sales growth of and earnings per share in a range of.following the company earnings announcement and forecasts,which were issued on the morning of october,the price of waters stock rose,closing at per share in the afternoon.
in the following months,before the release of fourth quarter results,company insiders at waters collectively sold shares of stock for more than million in gross proceeds.ornell sold shares at approximately a share.during this time period,waters repurchased shares of its stock,at a cost of over million.
on january,waters reported its fourth quarter results.it reported that sales were higher than had been expected,up for the quarter compared to the october forecast of and up for the full year compared to the july forecast of.indeed,the company reported record high yearly sales of billion.
reported earnings,however,were lower than had been forecast in october.earnings per share were for the fourth quarter compared to the forecasted range of and for the year compared to the forecasted range of.in a conference call the same day,berthiaume discussed these results.explaining why the company had not met its earnings predictions,he stated 
while our fourth quarter results reflect strong operating income performance,our earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter did not materialize quite as we had anticipated,as an unexpected increase in our annual tax rate,among other factors,adversely affected our performance.
on the earnings side,this statement identified increased costs,such as taxation,among other factors,as the cause of the earnings falling short of defendants forecast.berthiaume noted that sales growth was in line with our october outlook,but explained that 
foreign currency translation was a larger factor than we expected.in addition,our sales in japan were weaker than anticipated due to a combination of a sluggish economic condition and a change in the testing protocols for drinking water analysis in japan.
on the income side,though income was greater than forecast,this statement acknowledged the role of foreign currency translation and weaker japanese sales due to sluggish economic conditions and the regulatory change in japan.this was the first time that defendants expressly stated that there had been a change in japan drinking water regulations.
in response to a question regarding the slowdown in the japanese market,which amounted to a decline in sales for the quarter,berthiaume further discussed the regulatory change 
w hat happened last year is that the japanese government substantially reduced the sampling requirements and as a result we saw a reduction in our business.we had a leading share in this marketplace.and we saw a reduction in both the consumable side of the business because of the samples,as well as the instruments that were required to run it.
he stated that he needed to take a little bit of the blame,explaining 
we probably should have seen this a little earlier.we knew that the slope was going to be as strong forever in these applications,but the down turn came much faster than we anticipated.so the slope in the fourth quarter was a pretty significant one and that what caught us up by a little bit of a surprise.
plaintiff alleges these statements are an admission that the change in testing regulations was at least partly responsible for the decline in japanese sales,that the defendants had been aware of the regulatory change,and that they had known it would cause a decline in the japanese market.
after the release of these fourth quarter results,with waters report that earnings had failed to meet its predictions,the price of its stock dropped per share,or approximately.
however,defendants optimistic statements about waters future sales in the japanese market eventually proved to be well founded.in,waters sales in japan increased to about million,up from million in and million in.
we review de novo whether plaintiff complaint has met the pleading requirements imposed by the pslra.aca,at.a complaint must plead six elements to state a claim for securities fraud under section b and rule a material misrepresentation or omission scienter,or a wrongful state of mind a connection with the purchase or sale of a security reliance economic loss and loss causation.dura,broudo.this case turns on scienter,but we also set forth the requirements for materiality,which are relevant here.
a fact is material when there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would have viewed it as significantly alter ing the total mix of information made available.basic levinson,quoting tsc indus,northway,internal quotation mark omitted.a statement can be false or incomplete but not actionable if the misrepresented fact is otherwise insignificant.id.at.materiality is most often a mixed question of fact and law.tsc,at.
scienter is a mental state embracing intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud.ernst ernst hochfelder,see also aca,at.the scienter element may be satisfied by showing that the defendant engaged in intentional or willful conduct designed to deceive or defraud investors by controlling or artificially affecting the price of securities.hochfelder,at.a plaintiff can also demonstrate scienter by showing that defendants acted with a high degree of recklessness.aldridge cross,cir.under the recklessness standard,a defendant can be held liable for a highly unreasonable omission,involving not merely simple,or even inexcusable,negligence,but an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care,and which presents a danger of misleading buyers or sellers that is either known to the defendant or is so obvious the actor must have been aware of it.greebel ftp software,cir quoting sundstrand sun chem,cir internal quotation mark omitted see also sec fife,cir.
the pslra mandates a special standard for measuring whether allegations of scienter survive a motion to dismiss.greebel,at.a complaint alleging securities fraud must,with respect to each alleged act or omission,state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b emphasis added.a plaintiff must allege facts that make an inference of scienter more than merely plausible or must be cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference of nonfraudulent intent.tellabs,makor issues rights.when there are equally strong inferences for and against scienter,the draw is awarded to the plaintiff.aca,at.
the question of whether a plaintiff has pled facts supporting a strong inference of scienter has an obvious connection to the question of the extent to which the omitted information is material.a plaintiff must provide evidence showing not only that a statement or omission was false or misleading,but also that it was made in reference to a matter of material interest to investors.geffon micrion,cir see also jackvony riht financial,cir breyer,finding that the fact that a hospital received general expressions of interest in acquisition from time to time had no special significance.t he question of whether defendants recklessly failed to disclose a fact is intimately bound up with whether defendants either actually knew or recklessly ignored that the fact was material and nevertheless failed to disclose it.city of philadelphia fleming,cir.if it is questionable whether a fact is material or its materiality is marginal,that tends to undercut the argument that defendants acted with the requisite intent or extreme recklessness in not disclosing the fact.see in re,sec,cir 
defendants revenues and earnings statements 
plaintiff makes a argument.the first part is that the inferences drawn in its favor require the conclusion that defendants knew,during the class period,that japan had relaxed its water testing regulations and that this change would ultimately lead to less demand for waters products and services in japan.the second part is that the fact of this knowledge alone provides a sufficient basis for a cogent and compelling inference that defendants acted with scienter in failing to disclose earlier the regulatory change.
the first is based on berthiaume january statements that the japanese government substantially reduced the sampling requirements and as a result we saw a reduction in our business and that the company knew the slope was going to be as strong forever in these applications.these statements,plaintiff argues,establish that the decline in revenues in japan was in part attributable to the change in testing regulations and that defendants knew much earlier that there would likely be such a decline.this is a fair inference,and defendants do not themselves dispute that they had knowledge of the regulatory change at least at some time earlier in the class period.however,this is not sufficient to meet plaintiff burden on scienter.
plaintiff argument that defendants actual knowledge of the facts withheld amply establishes the necessary degree of scienter misconstrues the relevant inquiry.schlifke seafirst,cir.the key question in this case is not whether defendants had knowledge of certain undisclosed facts,but rather whether defendants knew or should have known that their failure to disclose those facts present ed a dange
