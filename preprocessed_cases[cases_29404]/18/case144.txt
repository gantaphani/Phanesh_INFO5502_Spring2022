background 
i.the facts 
the facts are largely undisputed and may be summarized as follows.
leadclick business model 
until ceasing operations in,leadclick operated an network to provide advertising in internet commerce.leadclick arranged for advertising for its merchant clients by connecting them to publishers affiliates who advertised the merchant products.the affiliates advertised products in a variety of ways,including email marketing,banner ads,placement,and creating advertising websites.leadclick managed the affiliate network through tracking software,referred to as hitpath,that would track the flow of traffic from each individual affiliate marketing website to the merchant website while remaining invisible to the consumer.app.at.
in,leadclick employed a staff of eight to ten people in its eadvertising division.some of those employees worked as affiliate managers,managing relationships with affiliate marketers,while others worked as account managers,managing relationships with merchants.affiliate managers were responsible for scouting and recruiting new affiliates,researching affiliates,and matching affiliates with particular merchant offers.leadclick would review and control which affiliates were selected to provide online advertising for each merchant offer.
independent from its eadvertising affiliate network business,leadclick engaged in media buying by purchasing advertisement space for banner advertisements from websites.after leadclick purchased media space,it would resell the space,sometimes to affiliate marketers,at a markup.
leadclick relationship with leanspa 
in august,an eadvertising account manager contacted leanspa to solicit business,suggesting that leanspa could be a great fit in the eads network.app.at.leanspa,an internet retail business,sold purported and products under various brand names.leanspa hired leadclick to provide online advertising through its affiliate network in september.
pursuant to their contractual arrangement,leanspa was to pay leadclick a set amount typically to each time a publisher advertisement directed an online consumer to leanspa landing page and that consumer enrolled in leanspa program referred to herein as an action this arrangement was commonly referred to in the affiliate marketing industry as a cost per action cpa agreement.leadclick was responsible for paying to percent of the amount it charged leanspa per action to the publisher under separate cpa agreements with its affiliate marketers.leadclick would retain the difference as compensation for its role connecting merchants with its affiliate network and managing those affiliates.
to keep track of individual actions,leadclick provided a unique link to its affiliate marketers for use in leanspa advertisements.when customers clicked on that link,they would unknowingly be routed through the hitpath server to the leanspa website.the hitpath server would record information on the customer,including the specific affiliate that directed the consumer to leanspa.the data was then used by leadclick to determine the total number of actions for which it could charge leanspa and its corresponding contractual liability to the individual affiliates responsible for those actions.because both leadclick and its affiliate marketers profited per action generated,they were incentivized to maximize consumer traffic to leanspa websites.
as the business relationship progressed,leadclick became leanspa primary marketing network,and leanspa became leadclick top customer.app.at.by,leanspa offers represented approximately percent of all eadvertising division sales.
in total,leadclick billed leanspa million over the course of their contractual agreement.leanspa was chronically behind on its payments to leadclick leanspa owed leadclick million by march and approximately million by june.leanspa ultimately paid leadclick million,approximately half of its outstanding bill.
in accordance with industry practice,leadclick paid its publishers before it received payment from leanspa.despite leanspa steep outstanding balance,leadclick continued to pay its affiliate marketers for advertising leanspa products online.in september of,leadclick terminated its business arrangement with leanspa.
leadclick involvement in the use of fake news sites to market leanspa products 
certain affiliates hired by leadclick used fake news sites to market leanspa products.these fake news sites,which were common in the industry at the time,looked like genuine news sites they had logos styled to look like news sites and included pictures of supposed reporters next to their articles.the articles generally represented that a reporter had performed independent tests that demonstrated the efficacy of the weight loss products.the websites also frequently included a consumer comment section,where purported consumers praised the products.but there were no consumers commenting this content was invented.
the vast majority of internet traffic to leanspa websites from leadclick affiliate network came from fake news sites.the ftc investigator who reviewed spreadsheets produced by leadclick,which documented traffic to leanspa website from leadclick affiliates,found that all of the identifiable affiliate websites that sent or more consumers through leadclick affiliate network were fake news sites.
while leadclick did not itself create fake news sites to advertise products,as discussed below,it knew that fake news sites were common in the affiliate marketing industry and that some of its affiliates were using fake news sites,approved of the use of these sites,and,on occasion,provided affiliates with content to use on their fake news pages.
leadclick knowledge of fake news sites 
first,leadclick knew that fake news sites were commonplace in the industry.for example,one eadvertising division employee noted that in the summer of,fake news sites were fairly common,app.at,while another testified in his deposition that during his time at leadclick,everyone was using,id.at.in conversations amongst themselves and with affiliates and merchants,leadclick employees occasionally discussed fake article pages,fake news pages,and news style pages.
second,leadclick knew of its own affiliates use of fake news sites to promote leanspa products.for the leanspa account,a leadclick employee created an affiliate scouting report which consisted exclusively of fake news site names like.com,and.one account manager testified that he saw fake news sites from leadclick affiliates that contained information that was not truthful or accurate,including websites advertising leanspa products.app.at.leadclick employees also discussed the content of their affiliates fake news sites,such as step and step,a typical fake news site product pairing system,demonstrating that their awareness extended beyond general knowledge.see app.at.
ii.leadclick approval of affiliates fake news sites 
leadclick employees also affirmatively approved of the use of fake news sites one leadclick employee told an affiliate interested in marketing leanspa offers that news style landers are totally fine followed by two punctuation marks commonly united to represent a smiley face.app.at.another employee told a potential new client that a ll of our traffic would be through display on fake article pages.id.at emphasis added.leadclick standard contract with affiliate marketers required affiliate marketers to submit their proposed marketing pages to leadclick for approval before they were used.
iii.leadclick requested edits to the content of fake news sites 
finally,on occasion,leadclick employees requested content edits to some of its affiliates using fake news sites.when leanspa informed leadclick of certain requirements for its advertisements,leadclick provided these requirements to affiliates and would review proposed advertisements for compliance with leanspa requirements.for example,when leanspa noticed that some of the affiliate marketers were pairing a leanspa step product with another merchant step on fake news sites,it informed leadclick of a new leanspa product that should be used for step and leadclick ordered its affiliates to implement that change in their fake news websites.app.at.
in one instance,after hearing of a state action against another network for false advertising,a leadclick employee reached out to an affiliate to make sure all his pages were set up good,like no crazy misleading info.app.at.the affiliate responded that he was removing references to his page being a news site and thinking of removing the reporter pics from the site to be safe.id.at.the leadclick employee advised him not to stop using the fake reporter picture,but to just add the term advertorial.app.at.in a later online conversation,the leadclick employee advised the affiliate to delete references to acai berry on his fake news site and instead use words like special ingredient,formula,secret,bla,bla,bla because we noticed a huge increase in actions with stuff that does s ay acai.app.at.
another employee sent an affiliate a list of ingredient information about a leanspa product,referring to it as good content that we can use for the page and stating if we get this inserted correctly and make the page look good we can blow this up.app.at.providing feedback on another affiliate page,that same employee stated that the site looks good except you cant say anything about a free trial sic i need that removed,id,and noted that i t is much more realistic if you say that someone lost lbs in weeks rather than saying anything more than that,id.at.
leadclick media buying on behalf of affiliates with fake news sites 
in addition to providing leanspa access to its affiliate network,leadclick occasionally purchased advertising space on genuine news sites for banner advertisements that would link to the fake news sites promoting leanspa products as part of its media buying business.when soliciting leanspa business,a leadclick account manager referred to the media buying as a way to generat e quality traffic in very lucrative placements.app.at.leadclick occasionally identified fake news sites as destination pages for the banner advertisements when negotiating with media sellers by emailing the media seller a compressed version of an affiliate page or providing the web address for the destination page.
in,corelogic predecessor,first american corporation,together with another public company,first advantage corporation first advantage,acquired a majority interest in leadclick in,corelogic and first advantage acquired the remaining interest in leadclick.later that year,corelogic purchased first advantage,and changed its name to corelogic,clusi.after the acquisition,corelogic wholly owned clusi directly,and indirectly owned leadclick through clusi.
in,corelogic reorganized its corporate structure,and leadclick became a direct subsidiary of corelogic,and a sister company to clusi.during the restructuring,corelogic transitioned leadclick and six of its sister subsidiaries into a shared services system to streamline and enhance back office functions across the subsidiaries.pl.ftc local rule a statement in response to corelogic,local rule a statement ftc a statement at,federal trade commission leanspa,llc,cv jch,ecf.
shared services programs allow related entities to consolidate some or all of their functions,such as accounting,legal and compliance,human resources,and information technology,into a single office.concentrating these functions allows the companies to operate more efficiently and reduce their administrative expenses.these programs are common in business today amici curiae estimate that more than eighty percent of fortune companies have implemented some form of shared services in their domestic operations.amici br.at.
as part of corelogic shared services system,corelogic back office began to handle accounts payable for leadclick and its sister subsidiaries in january.the accounts receivable process was transitioned several months later,beginning in july.after january of,when leadclick accrued a payable expense,corelogic would make the payment directly on its behalf,and track the payment as an advance to leadclick.both leadclick and corelogic intended that leadclick would later reimburse corelogic for those advances from its incoming revenue once corelogic transitioned leadclick accounts receivables process to the shared services program.pursuant to this agreement,corelogic advanced approximately million to pay leadclick expenses from january through august of,and recorded these expenses as an intercompany liability.t here was no agreed upon repayment schedule or repayment deadline,no security for those advances,no written loan agreement,and no interest due in connection with the funds corelogic provided leadclick in.app.at.
once leadclick accounts receivable system transitioned to corelogic as part of the shared services agreement,corelogic began to recoup its prior advances by executing daily sweeps of the revenues received by leadclick incoming funds deposited into leadclick account were automatically swept first into an account held by clusi,and then directed into an account held by corelogic.through these sweeps,leadclick repaid a total of million of its advance balance to corelogic.half of this amount was repaid in a single cash transfer on august,the august transfer,when leadclick,in transitioning its accounts receivable,withdrew million in customer receipts from a bank account,and deposited them into a shared service account,which was then automatically swept to clusi and then corelogic.this was leadclick final repayment when it ceased operations in september of,it still owed corelogic approximately million,and owed its sister subsidiary clusi approximately million under an old promissory note 
ii.the proceedings below 
on november,the ftc and the state filed a complaint in this action against leanspa,nutraslim,llc,nutraslim,and boris mizhen,leanspa owner,for unfair trade practices.the ftc and the state learned of leadclick involvement in leanspa business during discovery,and amended their complaint on july,to include leadclick and its former officer,richard chiang,as defendants and angelina strano,mizhen wife,as a relief defendant.the complaint was subsequently amended on august,by the ftc to add corelogic as a relief defendant.the state did not join the ftc in asserting a claim against corelogic.all claims except for those against leadclick and corelogic were resolved in stipulated orders before the district court.
leadclick and chiang moved to dismiss,claiming immunity under section of the cda.the district court denied the motion on january,concluding that leadclick had not established immunity.on may,plaintiffs moved for summary judgment against leadclick and corelogic.on the same day,leadclick and corelogic separately moved for summary judgment.
on march,the district court granted plaintiffs motion and denied defendants motions.as part of that decision,the district court required leadclick to disgorge all proceeds that it received from leanspa as payment for affiliate marketing and required corelogic to disgorge million,which was the amount that leadclick transferred to corelogic in august.the district court entered final judgment in favor of plaintiffs on march.leadclick and corelogic filed timely notices of appeal.
discussion 
defendants raise three issues on appeal leadclick liability under section of the ftc act and cutpa,leadclick purported immunity under section of the cda,and corelogic liability as a relief defendant.
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment,to determine whether the district court properly concluded that there was no genuine dispute as to any material fact,such that the moving party was entitled to judgment as a mater of law.myers patterson,cir.we address the claims against leadclick and corelogic separately below.
leadclick liability 
ftc act.applicable law 
section of the ftc act empower s and direct s the ftc to prevent persons,partnerships,or corporations from using unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce,and declares unlawful unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.a and a the ftc act is drafted broadly to include not only traditional violations but also practices that the commission determines are against public policy for other reasons.ftc indiana fed of dentists,d.it is important to note the generality of this standard of illegality the proscriptions in section are flexible,to be defined with particularity by the myriad of cases from the field of business.ftc colgate palmolive,d quoting ftc motion picture advert.serv.
the ftc and the state allege that leadclick is liable under section because it engaged in a deceptive act or practice to prove a deceptive act or practice under a,the ftc must show three elements a representation,omission,or practice,that is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances,and,the representation,omission,or practice is material.ftc verity int l,cir.quoting in re cliffdale.the deception need not be made with intent to deceive it is enough that the representations or practices were likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably.id.the deceptive acts or practices must be likely to cause substantial injury to consumers which is not reasonably avoidable by consumers themselves and not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition.n.
leadclick argues that a defendant may be held liable under section a for deceptive acts or practices only when a defendant creates the deceptive content or when that content is attributable to the defendant.according to leadclick,because it did not create the deceptive content appearing on the false news sites,nor was that content attributable to it,it can not be held liable under the ftc act.as discussed below,we disagree that the ftc act requires that a defendant create deceptive content to be liable.instead,we hold that under the ftc act,a defendant may be held liable for engaging in deceptive practices or acts if,with knowledge of the deception,it either directly participates in a deceptive scheme or has the authority to control the deceptive content at issue.
both the ninth and eleventh circuits have recognized that a defendant may be liable for deceptive content even if it was not solely responsible for a deceptive scheme.in ftc neovi,the ninth circuit held a check processing company liable under the ftc act for creating and delivering fraudulent checks drawn by its customers without proper verification,where the company had reason to believe that a vast number of checks were being drawn on unauthorized accounts,cir.the defendant argued that it could not be held liable,because its users,and not the defendant itself,created the deceptive checks.id.at.the ninth circuit rejected this argument,noting that a single violation of the ftc act may have more than one perpetrator,id.and businesses can cause direct consumer harm as contemplated by the ftc act in a variety of ways,id.at.the check processing company,through its own actions,engaged in a practice that facilitated and provided substantial assistance to a multitude of deceptive schemes.id.at.the court recognized that the creation and distribution of most any good is subject to a host of sequential steps and that while s ome of those steps involve the contribution of independent causal agents,those contributions do not magically erase the role of the aggregator and distributer of the goods.id.at.rather,because the check processing company engaged in behavior that was,itself,injurious to consumers,it was liable under the ftc act.id.at 
similarly,in ftc iab marketing associates,lp,the eleventh circuit considered the likelihood that the ftc would succeed in an action against a company selling trade association memberships.cir.the company hired telemarketers who misrepresented that the memberships were functionally equivalent to major medical insurance.id.at.the court found no merit in the argument that the company could not be held liable for misrepresentations made by various independent contractors it engaged to sell its products.id.at.
the defendants argued that they could not be held liable for the misrepresentations made by the telemarketers without direct participation in,knowledge of,and the ability to control the telemarketers behavior.id.at.this test had previously been applied by the eleventh and seventh circuits to determine when an individual employee may be held liable for the conduct of a corporation.see ftc gem merch,cir.holding an individual liable under the ftc act where he was aware that salespeople made material representations to consumers to induce sales,and he was in a position to control the salespeople behavior ftc amy travel,cir.holding individuals liable under the ftc act for deceptive practices of a corporation where those individuals had knowledge of the deceptive practices and participated directly in those practices or had authority to control them.
without deciding whether the standard for imposing liability was as demanding as to require both direct participation and authority to control,the iab marketing associates court determined that the company would be liable even under the knowledge,participation,and control test,because it directly participated in the scheme with knowledge and had the ability to control the telemarketers it employed to sell its trade association memberships.iab mktg.associates,at.while there was no evidence in the record that the defendants instructed the telemarketers to make material misrepresentations,the defendants hired the third party telemarketers to sell its products with knowledge that the telemarketers were making the misrepresentation.id.the defendants also had authority over those telemarketers,and could have,but did not,require them to cease making the misrepresentations.id.
we agree that a deceptive scheme violating the ftc act may have more than one perpetrator.we adopt the test applied by the eleventh circuit in the context of an individual liability for corporate deception to determine leadclick section liability under the ftc act a defendant may be held liable for deceptive practices that cause consumer harm if,with knowledge of the deceptive nature of the scheme,he either participate s directly in the practices or acts or ha s authority to control them.amy travel,at.a defendant directly participates in deception when it engages in deceptive acts or practices that are injurious to customers with at least some knowledge of the deception.a and n.similarly,a defendant who knows of another deceptive practices and has the authority to control those deceptive acts or practices,but allows the deception to proceed,may be held liable for engaging in a deceptive practice injurious to consumers.this is consistent with the ftc longstanding policy that an omission in certain circumstances may constitute a deceptive or unfair practice.see letter from federal trade commission to john dingell,chairman of the committee on energy and commerce october,appended to cliffdale,at the commission will find an act or practice deceptive if there is a misrepresentation,omission,or other practice,that misleads the consumer acting reasonably in the circumstances,to the consumer detriment.in the matter of int l harvester,finding defendant failure to warn consumers of a material risk of harm created by its product would be an unfair trade practice under section.
leadclick argues that applying a test that imposes liability based on direct participation in or authority to control deceptive practices conflates principal liability with aiding and abetting liability,which is foreclosed under the ftc act.we reject this argument.
we have not previously considered whether a defendant may be held liable under the ftc act for aiding and abetting another deceptive acts or practices.as leadclick notes,the ftc act does not expressly provide for aiding and abetting liability.central bank of denver,first interstate bank of denver,d noting that in securities fraud context that if congress intended to impose aiding and abetting liability it would have used the words aid and abet in the statutory text wright ernst young llp,cir.noting where section b liability is based on making material false representations,a nything short of such conduct is merely aiding and abetting,and no matter how substantial that aid may be,it is not enough to trigger liability.we need not decide this issue,however,because we conclude that a defendant acting with knowledge of deception who either directly participates in that deception or has the authority to control the deceptive practice of another,but allows the deception to proceed,engages,through its own actions,in a deceptive act or practice that causes harm to consumers.as the ninth circuit noted in neovi,
to be clear,none of this is to say that defendant is liable under a theory of aiding and abetting.defendant engaged in behavior that was,itself,injurious to consumers.defendant business practices might have served to assist others in illicit or deceptive schemes,but the liability under the ftc act that attached to defendant is not mediated by the actions of those third parties.defendant caused harm through its own deeds in this case creating and delivering unverified checks and thus of the ftc act easily extends to its conduct.
neovi,at.a defendant may be held liable for its own acts of deception under the ftc act,whether by directly participating in deception or by allowing deceptive acts or practices to occur that are within its control.this direct liability is distinguishable from liability for merely aiding and abetting the deceptive conduct of another.
application 
leadclick does not dispute on appeal that its affiliates engaged in false and deceptive advertising practices.instead,it argues that even assuming these statements were deceptive,such deception support s only imposition of liability against the publishers who created and made the deceptive statements not against a wholly separate entity,leadclick,that the ftc concedes did not make the challenged statements.leadclick br.at.as discussed below,we reject this argument and hold that leadclick is directly liable for its own deceptive conduct in the eadvertising scheme.leadclick knew that deceptive false news sites were prevalent in its affiliate marketing network,directly participated in the deception,and had the authority to control the deceptive content of these fake news sites,but allowed the deceptive content to be used in leanspa advertisements on its network.accordingly,leadclick is liable under section of the ftc act for engaging in deceptive acts or practices.
leadclick knew of the deception 
leadclick knew that the use of false news pages was prevalent in affiliate marketing,and its own affiliate marketers were using fake news sites to market leanspa products 
an eadvertising division employee noted that in the summer of,fake news sites were fairly common,app.at 
another employee testified in his deposition that during his time at leadclick,everyone was using,id.at 
leadclick employees occasionally discussed fake article pages,fake news pages,and news style pages among themselves and with affiliates and merchant clients 
a leadclick employee testified that he saw many false news sites from leadclick affiliates that contained false information,app.at,and 
leadclick was even familiar with the specific content of these sites,and employees occasionally referred to step and step pairing typical of fake news sites,see app.at.
ii.direct participation in the deceptive practices 
in addition to this knowledge,leadclick participated in the deceptive scheme through the following acts 
a leadclick employee scouted fake news websites to recruit potential affiliates for the leanspa account 
leadclick employees required alterations to the content of its affiliates fake news pages by instructing them to revise their pages to comply with explicit directives from leanspa 
a leadclick employee instructed an affiliate to check that his fake news site was not crazy misleading and advising him not to remove the reporter photograph,but to just add advertorial,app.at 
leadclick employees advised affiliates on the content to include in their pages to increase consumer traffic,see app.at telling an affiliate i t is much more realistic if you say that someone lost lbs.in weeks rather than saying anything more than that and 
leadclick purchased banner advertisement space on genuine news sites to resell that space to affiliates running fake news pages to generat e quality traffic in very lucrative placements.app.at.
considered together,this conduct clearly demonstrates leadclick direct participation in the deceptive advertising scheme.leadclick own actions recruiting and paying affiliates who used fake news sites for generating traffic,managing those affiliates,suggesting substantive edits to fake news pages,and purchasing banner space for fake news sites on legitimate news sources caused significant harm to consumers.
iii.leadclick authority to control the deceptive practices or acts 
leadclick was paid by leanspa to recruit and manage a network of affiliates who would advertise leanspa products.as established above,leadclick knew that some of its affiliates were using fake news sites to advertise leanspa products.as the manager and orchestrator of the affiliate marketing scheme,leadclick had the authority to control the deceptive practices of affiliates that joined its network 
leadclick had the ultimate authority to review and approve or disapprove of an affiliate using a fake news site 
leadclick permitted affiliates using fake news sites to join its network and refer customers to leanspa,and it paid its affiliates with fake news sites for generating actions and 
leadclick employees affirmatively approved the use of fake news sites by telling a potential affiliate that news style landers are totally fine,app.at,and explaining to a potential merchant client that a ll of its traffic would be through display on fake article pages,id.at emphasis added 
as the manager of the affiliate network,leadclick had a responsibility to ensure that the advertisements produced by its affiliate network were not deceptive or misleading.by failing to do so and allowing the use of fake news sites on its network,despite its knowledge of the deception,leadclick engaged in a deceptive practice for which it may be held directly liable under the ftc act.
as discussed above,leadclick is not liable here merely because it aided and abetted its affiliates deception.rather,its liability arises from its own deceptive practices directly participating in the deceptive scheme by recruiting,managing,and paying a network of affiliates to generate consumer traffic through the use of deceptive advertising and allowing the use of deceptive advertising where it had the authority to control the affiliates participating in its network.see neovi,at rejecting similar argument and noting that defendant actions caused consumer harm it did not merely aid or abet others who caused consumer harm.
moreover,leadclick is directly liable regardless of whether it intended to deceive consumers it is enough that it orchestrated a scheme that was likely to mislead reasonable consumers.see verity int l,at.and the scheme did just that the majority of traffic from leadclick affiliate network came from fake news sites,generating enough traffic to bill leanspa for approximately million and earn leanspa recognition as leadclick top customer.app.at.
accordingly,the district court did not err in concluding that leadclick is directly liable under section of the ftc act and cutpa.
immunity under the cda 
leadclick argues that,even if it would otherwise be liable under section of the ftc act and cutpa for its participation in the deceptive marketing scheme,it is immune under section of the cda.we conclude,however,that the district court correctly held that leadclick was not entitled to section immunity.
applicable law 
when it was introduced,the primary purpose of the cda was to protect children from sexually explicit internet content section,enacted through an amendment to the cda,had a different objective t o preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists for the internet and other interactive computer services,unfettered by federal or state regulation.b see also zeran america online,cir.congress recognized the threat that lawsuits pose to freedom of speech in the new and burgeoning internet medium.
the amendment assuaged congressional concern regarding the outcome of two inconsistent judicial decisions applying traditional defamation law to internet providers.cong.rec.daily ed,statement of cox.the first held that an interactive computer service provider could not be liable for a third party defamatory statement,cubby,compuserve,but the second imposed liability where a service provider filtered its content in an effort to block obscene material,stratton oakmont,prodigy servs,wl,at sup.may.the amendment was intended to overrule stratton and provide immunity for interactive computer service s that make good faith efforts to block and screen offensive content.c.
to accomplish that goal,section provides that n o provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.c.
we have had limited opportunity to interpret section.other circuits,however,have recognized that section immunity is broad.see,jones dirty world entm t recordings llc,cir.close cases must be resolved in favor of immunity quoting fair hous.council of san fernando valley,llc,cir.en banc almeida,cir.the majority of federal circuits have interpreted the cda to establish broad federal immunity to any cause of action that would make service providers liable for information originating with a user of the service.internal quotation marks omitted id.at collecting cases.in applying the statute,courts have broken it down into three component parts,finding that i t shields conduct if the defendant is a provider or user of an interactive computer service,the claim is based on information provided by another information content provider and the claim would treat the defendant as the publisher or speaker of that information.jane doe,llc,cir.quoting universal commc,lycos,cir.see also jones,at zeran,at.
on appeal,leadclick argues that it is immune under section because it meets these elements.we discuss each,in turn.
provider of an interactive computer service 
the term interactive computer service means any information service,system,or access software provider that provides or enables computer access by multiple users to a computer server,including specifically a service or system that provides access to the internet and such systems operated or services offered by libraries or educational institutions.f.
courts typically have held that internet service providers,website exchange systems,online message boards,and search engines fall within this definition.see,zango,kaspersky lab,cir.concluding that malware provider who blocked plaintiff software as potentially malicious was interactive computer service provider because it provided service to consumers by screening for malicious content chicago lawyers comm.for civil rights under law,craigslist,cir,as amended may,applying definition to craigslist,a classified advertisements website universal commc ns lycos,cir.applying definition to internet message board operator zeran,at aol is just such an interactive computer service.murawski pataki,d,concluding is an interactive service provider because it is a search engine.
ii.information content provider 
as noted above,the statute requires that the claim be based on content provided by another information content provider.this grant of immunity applies only if the interactive service provider is not also an information content provider of the content which gives rise to the underlying claim.information content provider is defined to include any person or entity that is responsible,in whole or in part,for the creation or development of information provided through the internet or any other interactive computer service.f.this definition cover s even those who are responsible for the development of content only in part.ftc accusearch,cir.quoting universal commc,lycos,cir.a defendant,however,will not be held responsible unless it assisted in the development of what made the content unlawful.id.at.for example,a defendant who paid researchers to uncover confidential phone records protected by law,and then provided that information to paying customers,fell within the definition because he did not merely act as a neutral intermediary,but instead specifically encourage d development of what was offensive about the content.id.at see also,at holding defendant liable for developing content by not merely augmenting the content generally,but materially contributing to its alleged unlawfulness when it required subscribers to provide information which enabled users of site to unlawfully discriminate in selecting a roommate.
iii.whether the claim treats the defendant as the publisher or speaker of content provided by another 
at its core,bars lawsuits seeking to hold a service provider liable for its exercise of a publisher traditional editorial functions such as deciding whether to publish,withdraw,postpone or alter content.dirty world entm t recordings llc,at quoting zeran,at.section c provides that no provider of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider but it does not define the terms publisher or speaker.c.
in barnes,the ninth circuit addressed how to determine when,for purposes of this statute,a plaintiff theory of liability would treat a defendant as a publisher or speaker of content,cir,as amended.the ninth circuit considered traditional dictionary definitions of publisher,including the reproducer of a work intended for public consumption and one whose business is publication.id.at quoting webster third new international dictionary philip babcock gove.in deciding whether the claim at issue sought to hold the defendant liable as a publisher or speaker,the court noted that what matters is whether the cause of action inherently requires the court to treat the defendant as the publisher or speaker of content provided by another.to put it another way,courts must ask whether the duty that the plaintiff alleges the defendant violated derives from the defendant status or conduct as a publisher or speaker.id.at.
in accusearch,the only other case considering the application of section immunity to liability arising under section of the ftc act,the tenth circuit concluded that the defendant could not be immune for its payment to researchers to uncover confidential phone records and subsequent publishing of that information because it was an information content provider of the offensive conduct.at.the majority concluded that the defendant was not immune because liability was based on the defendant own content rather than the content of another,while the concurrence was of the view that the defendant was not immune because liability was premised not on content but on its conduct.id.at
