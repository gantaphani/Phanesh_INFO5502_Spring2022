introduction 
may putative shareholders recover as damages the corporation future profits allegedly lost as a result of tortious conduct directed to the shareholders individually and occurring before the corporation was formed we conclude,under the facts of this case,any such lost profits belong to the corporation and can not be recovered as damages by individual shareholders in a nonderivative suit.
the jury returned a verdict against defendants petrominerals corporation petrominerals and daniel silverman in an amount in excess of million on causes of action for interference with contractual relations and interference with prospective economic advantage.plaintiffs contended petrominerals and silverman tortiously interfered in a transaction by which a corporation called sole energy company sole energy corporation was to acquire the stock and assets of a corporation called hillcrest beverly oil corporation hboc.two of the plaintiffs were to be shareholders of sole energy corporation,but it never issued stock.plaintiffs sought as damages the future profits sole energy corporation purportedly would have earned had the transaction been consummated.
the trial court granted a nonsuit in favor of silverman on the causes of action for fraud and conspiracy,granted some of the motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict jnov brought by petrominerals and silverman,denied other of their jnov motions,denied silverman motion for a new trial,and granted petrominerals motion for a new trial on any causes of action not covered by the rulings on the jnov motions.
we conclude none of the plaintiffs could recover sole energy corporation alleged lost profits in this nonderivative lawsuit plaintiffs failed to present evidence that silverman interfered with a contractual relationship and plaintiffs failed to present evidence that silverman interfered with a prospective economic relationship or engaged in conduct that was wrongful apart from the interference itself.we therefore affirm the granting of jnov motions,reverse the denial of jnov motions,and remand with directions to the trial court to strike the punitive damages awarded against petrominerals.plaintiffs do not challenge the nonsuit in silverman favor on the fraud and conspiracy causes of action,and we lack jurisdiction to address plaintiffs challenge to the order granting petrominerals a new trial.
thomas swaney is the sole owner and president of harwood capital corporation harwood,a subchapter s corporation.swaney,harwood,and richard borghese,a petroleum engineer,were the partners of sole energy company,an informal partnership referred to as sole energy partnership to distinguish it from sole energy corporation that was formed sometime in the spring of on december,sole energy corporation was incorporated in the state of texas.sole energy corporation never issued stock.
hboc is an oil and gas company.kaymor petroleum products kaymor owns a gas processing plant abutting hboc wells.morris hodges was the president of both hboc and kaymor.nevadacor energy,nevadacor is a nevada corporation and apparently owned hboc stock 
petrominerals is a california corporation engaged in the acquisition,development,and production of crude oil and natural gas.during the events that are the subject of this case,hodges was petrominerals president and chief executive officer.silverman worked as a consultant for hboc in the capacity of an independent contractor from april to august.silverman was petrominerals of business development and chief operating officer from september,through october.
while working as a consultant for hboc,silverman analyzed a potential joint venture between petrominerals and hboc.on july,silverman prepared a letter to hboc regarding share valuations resulting from such a joint venture,stating t here is good potential for petrominerals shareholders and the hboc shareholders to see significant appreciation.this should make the story more convincing for both boards as why this combination would benefit both entities.
in july,borghese and swaney met with hodges to discuss acquiring hboc stock and oil and assets from nevadacor.borghese and swaney had learned that hodges was a principal of petrominerals,that petrominerals had cash but no other assets,and that petrominerals intended to use its cash to buy oil and gas properties.so,when borghese and swaney met with hodges,they asked him whether petrominerals had plans to purchase hboc.hodges replied that petrominerals would not purchase hboc because there was a conflict of interest,and petrominerals did not have enough money to buy hboc.hodges told borghese and swaney to continue the negotiations with silverman.
borghese and silverman met on august.silverman told borghese that petrominerals had no interest in buying hboc due to a conflict of interest.silverman also said he did not know whether petrominerals had in the past been interested in buying hboc.but on the day before meeting with borghese,silverman had faxed a letter to hodges,stating not to belabor the point with petrominerals,but i do think it is possible for p etrominerals to purchase hboc if i can go out and bring in some of that mezzanine financing.according to silverman,he did not tell borghese about that potential transaction because borghese did not ask about it.
on december,borghese submitted a letter of intent to nevadacor.the letter of intent proposed an entity named sole energy company purchase hboc stock and oil and assets from nevadacor for million.although borghese signed the letter of intent on behalf of sole energy company,the letter was prepared on letterhead stationery with the name sole energy company,llc,an entity which never was formed.
the letter of intent stated it was and included the following language regarding expiration and termination except as provided in sections through,both inclusive,this letter shall represent a letter of intent between the parties.this letter of intent shall expire on december,cst.any party may terminate this letter of intent after january,upon written notice to the other parties,or at any time by all parties with their mutual written consent.the letter of intent concluded if the foregoing accurately represents your understanding of our agreement,please indicate by signing in the spaces provided below,and return a copy to us for our records.upon receipt of a signed copy of this letter of intent,we will instruct our attorneys to begin preparation of a definitive stock purchase agreement.
on december,hodges signed the letter of intent on behalf of hboc and kaymor.on december,william herder signed the letter of intent on behalf of nevadacor.sole energy corporation was incorporated on december.borghese intended sole energy corporation to assume sole energy company position in the letter of intent,and later drafts of an agreement to purchase hboc stock identify sole energy corporation as the buyer.
silverman was not involved in negotiating the terms of the letter of intent and,after the meeting with borghese in august,did not speak with borghese or swaney until february.on that date,silverman spoke with swaney at a trade show and congratulated him on obtaining mezzanine financing for the transaction contemplated by the letter of intent.neither borghese nor swaney had further contact with silverman.
on february,borghese and swaney received a formal commitment to provide financing for purchasing hboc.according to borghese,obtaining financing represent ed percent of putting the deal together.borghese telephoned hodges to tell him about the financing commitment.the conversation turned into an argument over deal points and ended with hodges hanging up.on the same day,an attorney for sole energy corporation wrote a letter to nevadacor attorney,stating i t seems to me that our clients are at opposite ends of the spectrum on this transaction if your clients have changed their minds and if the deal can only go forward on the basis of your comments,one of two things must there will be no transaction between the parties because of their failure to agree or our clients see the necessity for a very substantial reduction in the purchase price to reflect the increased risks they will have to take in the transaction,as well as increased due diligence costs and delay.
on february,swaney telephoned hodges to discuss the transaction.during their telephone conversation swaney and hodges reached an oral agreement for sole energy corporation to purchase hboc stock and oil and assets.swaney took notes of the conversation but swaney did not send his notes to hodges.the notes did not contain a purchase price or a closing date and did not include all the terms of the proposed sale.on february,lawyers for borghese and swaney prepared a draft stock purchase agreement that did not include a purchase price.
on february,nevadacor and kaymor informed sole energy corporation in writing they wish ed to terminate the negotiations and the letter of intent dated december.
also in late february,the chairman of petrominerals board of directors asked hodges if petrominerals at this juncture should consider making an offer for hboc.hodges replied,nothing can happen there until after march.on march,petrominerals and nevadacor entered into a nonbinding letter of intent,prepared by silverman,to sell hboc stock to petrominerals for million and shares of petrominerals stock.silverman tried to obtain financing for the transaction from the same bank that had provided sole energy corporation a financing commitment.the bank would not consider providing petrominerals financing unless it obtained a waiver from sole energy corporation and borghese.in march,hodges called borghese and offered him a job with petrominerals.borghese declined.
the transaction was terminated because petrominerals could not obtain the necessary financing.silverman contract with petrominerals expired about one month later.
procedural history 
i.the complaint 
on may,sole energy corporation filed a verified complaint alleging causes of action for intentional interference with contractual relations,intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,fraud,and breach of contract.defendants successfully moved for summary judgment on the ground sole energy corporation had not been incorporated when the letter of intent was signed and therefore lacked standing to sue.
sole energy corporation moved for reconsideration of the order granting summary judgment.the trial court deemed the motion for reconsideration to be a motion for a new trial and granted it.the order granting a new trial is the subject of our opinion in sole energy i,supra,th,d.
sole energy corporation also moved for leave to amend the complaint to add new plaintiffs with standing.the trial court granted the motion,and a first amended complaint was filed december.the first amended complaint added four new plaintiffs sole energy partnership,swaney,borghese,and harwood.
petrominerals,silverman,and nevadacor answered the first amended complaint,but hboc,hodges,and kaymor did not answer.defaults and a default judgment later were entered against hboc,hodges,kaymor,and nevadacor as a sanction for alleged discovery abuses.the appeals from the default judgment against hboc,hodges,kaymor,and nevadacor are the subject of our opinion in sole energy hodges,th,d,wl sole energy ii.
ii.the trial and jury verdict 
the trial court stayed the case as to sole energy corporation after defendants appealed from the order granting the motion for reconsideration.the case proceeded only on the claims of the newly added energy partnership,swaney,borghese,and was tried to a jury on their claims against petrominerals and silverman for interference with contractual relations,interference with prospective economic advantage,fraud,and conspiracy.during trial,the court granted silverman motion for a nonsuit on the fraud and conspiracy claims.
the jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiffs and against silverman and petrominerals in the total sum of,plus interest.the verdict did not differentiate between causes of action,but divided the damages as follows 
compensatory damages 
swaney petrominerals million 
swaney silverman million 
borghese petrominerals million 
borghese silverman 
harwood petrominerals 
harwood silverman 
sole energy partnership petrominerals 
sole energy partnership silverman 
punitive damages 
swaney petrominerals million 
swaney silverman 
borghese petrominerals million 
borghese silverman 
a judgment on the jury verdict was entered on october.
iii.posttrial motions 
on november,petrominerals and silverman filed a total of seven jnov motions and a notice of intention to move for a new trial listing grounds.petrominerals and silverman filed separate memoranda of points and authorities in support of the new trial motion.on january,the trial court entered a minute order with its rulings on the posttrial motions.the nature of and the trial court ruling on each motion are as follows 
jnov motion.motion by silverman as to all plaintiffs on the causes of action for interference with contractual relations and interference with prospective economic advantage.the trial court stated it appears that plaintiffs have offered evidence to support that silverman interfering conduct was wrongful independent of the alleged interference with prospective economic advantage,but not as to alleged interference with contractual relations,based upon the evidence offered by silverman that the contract ultimately was that which was created on and terminated on,as plaintiffs do not cite any evidence in their opp osition as to wrongful conduct by silverman during the short duration of said contract or,in the alternative,to confirm that said contract actually terminated after the time in which silverman allegedly wrongfully acted.the court granted the motion with respect to interference with contractual relations and denied the motion with respect to interference with prospective economic advantage.
jnov motion.motion by petrominerals and silverman as to swaney and borghese on all causes of action on the ground there was no evidence either swaney or borghese suffered any lost profits.the trial court ruled that swaney and borghese had no right to recover lost profits,stating it appears that the damages offered by plaintiff s own expert relate solely to damages suffered by sole energy,the corporation,and such damages are owed solely to the corporation,not its shareholders.the court,granting the motion,reduced the damages awarded to swaney by million and reduced the damages awarded to borghese by million.
jnov motion.motion by petrominerals and silverman as to swaney on all causes of action on the ground there was no evidence swaney suffered any lost profits.plaintiffs expert testified the lost profits were for borghese and harwood,swaney s corporation.based on the state of evidence and authority,the court concluded,it appears that the award of damages to swaney,the individual,rather than the corporate s is improper.the trial court granted the motion and declined to amend the judgment to award damages to harwood.
jnov motion.motion by petrominerals and silverman as to sole energy partnership on the ground there was no evidence of damages suffered by sole energy partnership.the court denied the motion.
jnov motion.motion by petrominerals and silverman as to sole energy partnership on the ground it never filed a fictitious business name statement as required by california law to maintain a lawsuit.petrominerals and silverman do not challenge the trial court denial of that motion.
jnov motion.motion by silverman as to all plaintiffs on the ground there was no evidence silverman actually disrupted or interfered with an alleged contract or prospective economic advantage.the trial court ruled plaintiffs have offered no evidence to support that silverman acted wrongfully during the short term of the contract or that the contract did not terminate until after the times of silverman alleged wrongful conduct occurring after its creation.the court granted the motion with respect to interference with contractual relations and denied the motion with respect to interference with prospective economic advantage.
jnov motion.motion by silverman to set aside the punitive damages awarded to swaney and borghese.the trial court granted the motion and struck the punitive damages on the ground the evidence was insufficient to establish silverman acted with oppression,fraud,or malice.
petrominerals motion for a new trial.the trial court granted petrominerals motion for a new trial on the ground the evidence was insufficient to support the jury verdict.the motion was denied on the other grounds.the trial court held no evidence was presented that petrominerals or silverman engaged in any wrongful conduct during the period in which the oral contract was in effect and any damages were suffered by sole energy corporation,which was not a party at trial.
silverman motion for a new trial.the trial court denied silverman motion for a new trial,holding there were no irregularities in the proceedings and no errors in law supporting a new trial.
iv.entry of judgments following the rulings on the posttrial motions 
following the ruling on these posttrial motions,the trial court ordered petrominerals and silverman to prepare a proposed statement of reasons and facts supporting the grant of the motions.on january,petrominerals and silverman served counsel with a proposed judgment and a statement of reasons supporting the grant of the new trial motion.the proposed statement of reasons was not prepared in the standard format of a proposed order with a blank line for the trial judge signature.no statement of reasons signed by the court appears in the record.
on january,plaintiffs filed objections to the proposed judgment,contending it did not accurately reflect the trial court rulings on the jnov and new trial motions.on january,the trial court entered as its judgment the proposed judgment prepared by petrominerals and silverman without ruling on the objections.that judgment the january judgment provides,in part plaintiffs thomas swaney and richard borghese shall take nothing from defendants petrominerals corporation and daniel silverman.notice of entry of the january judgment was served on february.
plaintiffs filed no postjudgment motions and on february,filed a notice of appeal from the january judgment.the notice of appeal does not mention the order granting petrominerals motion for a new trial.on february,petrominerals and silverman filed a notice of appeal entitled a notice of from the judgment based on jury verdict dated october,set aside on january,and the denial of any part of petrominerals and silverman jnov motions.the appeals filed february and february,are the subject of this opinion.
after filing the notice of appeal,plaintiffs applied ex parte asking the trial court to review their objections to the january judgment.on march,after the ex parte hearing,the trial court entered a judgment by court modifying judgment on jury verdict the march judgment awarding million in compensatory damages in favor of plaintiffs and against silverman,plus interest from the date of entry of judgment on the jury verdict.in a minute order dated april,the court expressed its belief the january judgment did not accurately reflect the court rulings on the posttrial motions.silverman has appealed from the march judgment,and silverman and petrominerals have appealed from the subsequent order granting plaintiffs motion to tax costs.in sole energy petrominerals,wl nonpub.opn.sole energy iv,we reversed the march judgment on the ground the trial court lacked jurisdiction to modify the january judgment.
standard of review 
the trial judge power to grant a judgment notwithstanding the verdict is identical to his power to grant a directed verdict citations.the trial judge can not reweigh the evidence citation,or judge the credibility of witnesses.citation.if the evidence is conflicting or if several reasonable inferences may be drawn,the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict should be denied.citations.a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict of a jury may properly be granted only if it appears from the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the party securing the verdict,that there is no substantial evidence to support the verdict.if there is any substantial evidence,or reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom,in support of the verdict,the motion should be denied.citation.clemmer hartford insurance cal d,italics added.
in passing upon the propriety of a judgment notwithstanding the verdict,appellate courts view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party who obtained the verdict and against the party to whom the judgment notwithstanding the verdict was awarded.citations.in other words,we apply the substantial evidence test to the jury verdict,ignoring the judgment.hasson ford motor cal d,overruled on other grounds in soule general motors cal th,d.
appeal of sole energy partnership,borghese,swaney,and harwooda.grant of jnov motion affirmed plaintiffs individually can not recover future corporate lost profits as damages.
the jury awarded swaney million and borghese million in compensatory damages against petrominerals.the jury verdict does not reveal the evidentiary basis for those awards.the compensatory damages awarded against petrominerals are the same as the amounts plaintiffs expert,townes pressler,opined was the amount sole energy corporation would have made in profit if the transaction for the purchase of hboc had been consummated,apportioned according to borghese and swaney respective shareholder interests in sole energy corporation 
the trial court granted petrominerals and silverman jnov motion on the ground the lost profit damages awarded by the jury belonged to sole energy corporation and could not be recovered by its shareholders.the court order reduced the amount of damages awarded to borghese and swaney by,respectively,million and million 
borghese and swaney argue the order granting jnov motion is erroneous because they,as putative shareholders of sole energy corporation,could recover its lost profits in making this argument,borghese and swaney rely primarily on sutter general petroleum cal d,sutter and nathanson murphy d,nathanson.petrominerals and silverman,relying primarily on nelson anderson th,d nelson,argue lost profit damages belong exclusively to the corporation and can not be recovered by individual shareholders,except through a derivative lawsuit.with respect to jnov motion,petrominerals and silverman do not challenge pressler testimony or contend lost profits were speculative.
the parties correctly frame the issue as whether sole energy corporation future lost profits were derivative belonging to the corporation alone or individual to the shareholders.whether a cause of action is derivative or can be asserted by an individual shareholder is determined by considering the wrong alleged.t he action is derivative,in the corporate right,if the gravamen of the complaint is injury to the corporation,or to the whole body of its stock and property without any severance or distribution among individual holders,or it seeks to recover assets for the corporation or to prevent the dissipation of its assets.citations.the stockholder individual suit,on the other hand,is a suit to enforce a right against the corporation which the stockholder possesses as an individual.citation.jones ahmanson cal d,see also vega jones,day,reavis pogue th,d.
shareholders do not own and have no right to receive corporate profits,except in limited circumstances it is fundamental,of course,that the corporation has a personality distinct from that of its shareholders,and that the latter neither own the corporate property nor the corporate earnings.miller mccolgan cal d.shareholders own stock in the corporation,from which they derive income only upon liquidation of the corporation or the declaration of a dividend by the corporate directors.ibid.
nelson,supra,th,d,illustrates and explains those principles.in that case,nelson formed a corporation with anderson to market a line of skin care products.id.at,d.nelson and anderson were the only two shareholders of the corporation,and both served as officers.ibid.the corporation made few sales and failed.nelson sued anderson for various torts,including interference with contractual relations and prospective economic advantage,alleging anderson made bad decisions and refused to assist in marketing the company products.at trial,nelson proof of damages included her proportionate share of the corporation lost profits.id.at,d.the jury awarded nelson in damages.id.at,d.
the court of appeal reversed,concluding nelson claims should have been pleaded as corporate derivative claims.nelson,supra,th at,d.the court explained the difference between an individual cause of action and a derivative cause of action a n individual cause of action exists only if the damages were not incidental to an injury to the corporation.citation.the cause of action is individual,not derivative,only where it appears that the injury resulted from the violation of some special duty owed the stockholder by the wrongdoer and having its origin in circumstances independent of the plaintiff status as a shareholder.citation.in other words,it is the gravamen of the wrong alleged in the pleadings,not simply the resulting injury,which determines whether an individual action lies.id.at,d.because all of the acts alleged to have caused nelson injury amount to alleged misfeasance or negligence in managing the corporation business,causing the business to be a total failure,any obligations so violated were duties owed directly and immediately to the corporation.citation.because the gravamen of the complaint is injury to the whole body of its stockholders,it was for the corporation to institute and maintain a remedial action.citation.a derivative action would have been appropriate if its responsible officials had refused or failed to act.citations.id.at,d.
the appellate court reasoned that nelson,as a shareholder,had no ownership interest in the corporation profits or assets and therefore could not have been deprived of them.nelson,supra,th at,d.the nature of nelson proof establishes that any injury was to the corporation and since she neither alleged nor proved the breach of a duty owing to her personally,her emotional distress and the loss of her investment were incidental to the injury to the corporation.ibid.the nelson court held the loss of corporate profits,revenues,or assets as a result of negligent or intentional wrongdoing by a corporation officers,directors,or majority shareholders results in corporate injury,for which only the corporation may sue to recover.ibid.
in sutter,supra,cal d,the plaintiff asserted a claim for damages resulting from a fraud committed directly on the plaintiff before the corporation inception.the california supreme court held the plaintiff lost investment in the corporation was both an individual and a derivative loss.id.at.the defendants in sutter owned an oil and gas lease and had constructed an offshore steel island and derrick on the leased property.id.at.the defendants knew sutter was interested in developing the site and misrepresented to him that the steel island had been constructed soundly.id.at.in reliance on the misrepresentations,sutter formed a development corporation to purchase the steel island and the derricks,rent the equipment on the steel island,and assume the defendants lease.id.at.sutter invested nearly and expended significant time and effort in the venture,for which he intended to be compensated from the development corporation profits.id.at.
the venture failed because the steel island collapsed and because the defendants could not obtain a lease assignment,refused to supply their expert assistance,and refused to rent the drilling equipment.sutter,supra,cal d at.sutter,as an individual,sued the defendants and sought as damages the money he had invested in the venture as well as lost wages in the amount of.id.at.at the close of sutter evidence,the trial court entered a judgment of dismissal on the ground sutter claims were derivative claims of the development corporation.id.at.
the supreme court reversed,concluding sutter claims arising out of the defendants fraud were both derivative and individual because the false promises ran both to sutter and to the development corporation.id.at.in the instant case the essence of plaintiff sutter charge is that by reason of the fraudulent representations of defendants,he was induced to do several things,namely,abandon his own oil development projects,devote his time to the project whereby the steel island and other facilities would be used and to form and invest in a corporation the development company to carry on the new oil production project the fraud was committed by defendants,and plaintiff sutter took steps in reliance upon the misrepresentations including the formation of the development company before that company was formed.the tort was completed except as to the injury suffered defendants,by their promises and representations induced plaintiff to form the corporation and invest his money therein,and then breached their duty of honest dealing with him.sutter,supra,cal d at.
the nature of the damages sutter could recover for the fraud perpetrated on him individually was significant to the sutter court conclusion by way of damages plaintiff sutter asserts that because of the false representations he invested in the venture and the rincon company,and that as the result of the fraud of defendants the stock in the rincon company became valueless.while ordinarily a stockholder may not sue individually for impairment of a corporation assets rendering the stock worthless,yet here that result is merely one method of ascertaining the amount of damages suffered by sutter.he lost his investment which was represented by the stock,and its reduction in value would be the extent of his loss.the damages all flowed from the tort of defendants.sutter,supra,cal d at.in addition,the court held sutter could recover the reasonable value of his services and time expended,even though he intended to be paid out of the development corporation profits,because those losses were proximately caused by the fraud.id.at.
in nathanson,supra,d,nathanson approached murphy about buying her ranch.murphy told nathanson the ranch was acres in size.ibid.in reliance on that representation,nathanson formed a corporation to buy the ranch and paid murphy out of his own pocket as a down payment.id.at.while the corporation solicited sales of its stock,it discovered the ranch had only acres.id.at.the corporation could not sell its stock,negotiations to reduce the purchase price were unsuccessful,and the deed of trust used to secure the balance of the purchase price was foreclosed.ibid.nathanson individually sued murphy for various damages arising out of the misrepresentation.ibid.
the trial court awarded the plaintiff nathanson estate in damages,representing the amount nathanson,on behalf of the corporation,had paid as the down payment on the ranch.nathanson,supra,d at.the court of appeal affirmed.describing sutter as similar,the court held the plaintiff could recover damages because the misrepresentation was made directly to nathanson,before the corporation was formed,to induce him to make the down payment.nathanson,supra,d at.although nathanson made the down payment on behalf of the corporation formed to acquire the ranch,nathanson could sue for individual recovery because the down payment constituted an investment in the corporation and nathanson was injured when he lost that investment as a consequence of murphy fraud.id.at.
unlike nelson,this case does not involve tortious conduct occurring after the corporation was fully formed and while the corporation was operating rather,as in sutter and nathanson,plaintiffs in this case contend they were injured by wrongs directed to them individually and occurring before sole energy corporation was formed.sutter and nathanson upheld recovery of the amount of the plaintiffs respective lost investments because in each case the plaintiff individually suffered injury as the proximate result of the defendants tortious conduct.those injuries included loss of investment in the corporation.but neither sutter nor nathanson addresses the issue presented here whether the putative shareholders can recover their proportionate shares of the corporation future lost profits.
we conclude borghese and swaney,as putative shareholders of sole energy corporation,could not recover their proportionate shares of the corporation lost profits.neither sutter nor nathanson alters the proposition that a shareholder does not have an ownership interest in corporate profits.sutter and nathanson are reconcilable with nelson,for a shareholder investment in the corporation is not the same as lost future corporate profits.because corporate profits belong to the corporation,and not to its shareholders individually,lost profits are an injury to the corporation,or to the whole body of its stock jones ahmanson,supra,cal d at,and therefore are derivative in nature.when corporate lost profits are sought as damages,the gravamen of the complaint is injury to the corporation,not injury to an individual shareholder.pressler opinion of damages was based on the premise the profits earned by the acquiring energy have been about million over years.thus,the gravamen of the injury derivative and could not be recovered by borghese and swaney individually.
sutter based its conclusion on the proposition a shareholder may recover damages for injuries the shareholder individually suffered as a proximate result of tortious conduct directed to the shareholder.as applied to this case,such a causation analysis confirms our conclusion that swaney and borghese can not recover sole energy corporation purported future lost profits.the measure of damages for intentional interference with contractual relations or prospective economic advantage is an amount that will reasonably compensate plaintiff for all loss or harm,providing that you find it was or will be suffered by plaintiff and caused by the defendant conduct.baji see also youst longo cal d,fn,damages for interference with prospective economic advantage are economic harm to the plaintiff proximately caused by the acts of the defendant.the amount of such harm or loss includes t he financial loss of the benefits of the contract or the prospective economic relationship.baji.
what would have been borghese and swaney benefits from the contract or the prospective economic relationship with hboc the benefit borghese and swaney via harwood would have received from the transaction was ownership of shares of sole energy corporation.under the terms of the letter of intent,the oral contract,and various drafts of the purchase agreement,sole energy corporation was to be the party to the contract to purchase hboc stock and oil and assets.borghese and harwood were to be shareholders of sole energy corporation.as shareholders,borghese and harwood would have had no right to receive those corporate profits.miller mccolgan,supra,cal d at.accordingly,the benefits gained by borghese and swaney from the transaction would have been the value of their shares in sole energy corporation,not sole energy corporation profits.
under sutter and nathanson,swaney and borghese might have been able to recover the loss in value of their shares or diminution of their ownership interest in sole energy corporation,but only if such losses were not part of an injury to the whole body of the corporation stock jones ahmanson,supra,cal d at,or merely incidental to the alleged harm suffered by the corporation and all of its shareholders avikian wtc financial th,d see also paclink communications,superior court th,d.regardless,the diminution in value of borghese and swaney shares in sole energy corporation was not the same as sole energy corporation purported lost profits.no evidence was presented of lost share value or loss in value of borghese and swaney ownership interest in sole energy corporation.pressler testified only as to sole energy corporation lost profits,a corporate loss.
swaney and borghese arguably lost their expenses and the salaries they would have earned as officers of sole energy corporation.the jury did not award swaney and borghese such damages but awarded swaney and borghese the same amounts as pressler opined were the amounts of their supposed lost profits.
plaintiffs argue the principle that lost corporate profits belong to the corporation does not apply here because the acquiring corporation,sole energy corporation,never issued stock and never went into operation.this point is irrelevant under plaintiffs theory of recovery,which was based on the premise sole energy corporation would or did issue stock and would function as a corporation for its intended purpose.pressler based his opinion of lost profits on those premises.if sole energy corporation never issued stock and never went into operation,then sole energy corporation never had lost profits and it never had shareholders to or their recovery.
plaintiffs,relying on elsbach mulligan d,elsbach,argue that barring borghese and swaney from individually recovering sole energy corporation lost profits would be unjust.petrominerals and silverman urge us to ignore that argument,along with several others,because plaintiffs first made those arguments in their reply brief in this appeal,reichardt hoffman th,d.we exercise our discretion to consider the arguments,but conclude they have no merit.
elsbach,supra,d,does not address whether shareholders may personally recover a corporation lost profits.in elsbach,elsbach and mulligan formed a joint venture,later incorporated,to import and sell alcoholic beverages by creating exclusive agencies with producers.id.at.the corporation was formed and issued shares of stock.id.at.mulligan made false representations to two producers to induce them to give him personally exclusive agencies intended for the corporation.id.at.elsbach,in his personal capacity,sued mulligan in tort and recovered damages.id.at.the court of appeal,affirming,concluded the evidence supported the findings the corporation was in reality a joint venture and elsbach and mulligan acted throughout as joint venturers.id.at.because one joint venturer may recover damages from another for breach of fiduciary duties,the court of appeal rejected the argument the action should have been brought by the corporation id.at,and held elsbach personally could recover damages from mulligan id.at.
elsbach does not support borghese and swaney recovery of sole energy corporation lost profits.borghese and swaney did not act as joint venturers with petrominerals or silverman and did not sue them as joint venturers.
plaintiffs argue in their reply brief that assertions petrominerals and silverman made in support of their motion for summary judgment against sole energy corporation judicially estop petrominerals and silverman from asserting only sole energy corporation may recover lost profits.judicial estoppel prevents a party from asserting a position in a legal proceeding that is contrary to a position previously taken in the same or some earlier proceeding.jackson county of los angeles th,d.the doctrine applies when the same party has taken two positions the positions were taken in judicial or administrative proceedings the party was successful in asserting the first position the court adopted the position or accepted it as true the two positions are totally inconsistent and the first position was not taken as a result of ignorance,fraud,or mistake.id.at,d.
in granting defendants motion for summary judgment against sole energy corporation,the trial court accepted defendants assertions that each cause of action asserted in sole energy corporation verified complaint was premised on the allegation sole energy corporation entered into the letter of intent sole energy company,llc,not sole energy corporation,entered into the letter of intent sole energy corporation was formed on december,after the letter of intent was signed sole energy corporation was not acting as a de facto corporation as of the date the letter of intent was signed sole energy company,llc,never assigned its rights under the letter of intent,and sole energy corporation never succeeded to those interests and sole energy corporation had no power to enter into the letter of intent,making the letter void from its inception.
petrominerals and silverman assertions in this appeal regarding sole energy corporation standing are not totally inconsistent with the assertions made in support of the summary judgment motion.at trial,plaintiffs proceeded on the theory an oral contract had been formed for sole energy corporation to purchase hboc stock.the oral contract was formed after the letter of intent was signed and after the date of sole energy corporation incorporation.draft agreements show sole energy corporation as the purchasing entity.plaintiffs also asserted sole energy partnership assigned whatever rights it had to sole energy corporation.neither the oral contract nor an assignment from sole energy partnership was the subject of defendants summary judgment motion,and the order granting summary judgment did not resolve the issue of sole energy corporation standing to recover under the oral contract theory.
in sole energy i,supra,th,d,we affirmed the trial court order deeming sole energy corporation motion for reconsideration of the summary judgment to be a motion for a new trial and granting it.in the opinion,we state,w hether the trial court was correct with respect to sole energy corporation standing is not an issue before us on this appeal.id.at,d the summary judgment against sole energy corporation was effectively vacated by the order granting a new trial.the matter of sole energy corporation standing under the letter of intent therefore remains an open issue on remand.
finally,plaintiffs argue that in granting jnov motion,the trial court erred by resolving two ambiguities against them.first,plaintiffs assert the trial court resolved a purported ambiguity in the jury verdict by concluding they had assigned their rights against defendants to sole energy corporation.the verdict is unambiguous.further,whether such an assignment occurred is irrelevant.as putative shareholders in sole energy corporation,borghese and swaney had no right to the corporate profits,and their lost financial benefit caused by the alleged interference could not have been lost corporate profits.
second,plaintiffs assert pressler testimony could be construed as referring either to sole energy corporation lost profits or to sole energy partnership lost profits.the trial court erred,plaintiffs argue,by resolving this ambiguity to conclude pressler testified only as to the corporation lost profits.we find no ambiguity in pressler testimony.pressler quite clearly testified to sole energy corporation lost profits only.he calculated damages based on borghese and harwood respective percentages of stock holdings in sole energy corporation and not on ownership interest in any other entity.further,borghese testified sole energy partnership is not a formal partnership,but an informal association by which he,swaney,and harwood conducted business.
grant of jnov motion affirmed swaney and harwood individually can not recover future corporate lost profits as damages.
the jury awarded swaney million in compensatory damages against petrominerals and million in compensatory damages against silverman.in jnov motion,petrominerals and silverman requested judgment in their favor against swaney on the ground swaney subchapter s corporation,not swaney,was a putative shareholder of sole energy corporation.the trial court granted jnov motion,stating it appears that the award of damages to swaney,the individual,rather than the corporate s is improper.
because neither swaney nor harwood,as a putative shareholder of sole energy corporation,can recover its future lost profits as damages,we need only address jnov motion in one respect.pressler testified that harwood proportionate share of lost profits would have been million.that testimony accounts for the verdict against petrominerals,but not the verdict of million in compensatory damages against silverman and in favor of swaney.neither side addresses the source of those compensatory damages against silverman.
it appears to us the million awarded in swaney favor against silverman represents percent of the million awarded in swaney favor against petrominerals for lost profits.the evidence swaney presented of compensatory damages was pressler lost profits testimony,swaney testimony of for lost salary,and in expenses for harwood which the jury awarded to harwood.while the million in compensatory damages awarded to swaney against silverman is far greater than the amount swaney claimed for lost salary,the damages do equal about percent of the million awarded for lost profits.the million in compensatory damages awarded against silverman must,therefore,fall with the lost profits damages.
grant of jnov motions and on the cause of action for interference with contractual relations affirmed plaintiffs failed to produce evidence that silverman interfered with a contract.
in jnov motion,silverman argued plaintiffs could not recover for interference with contractual relations or interference with prospective economic advantage because they failed to present evidence that silverman engaged in conduct that was wrongful apart from the interference itself.in jnov motion,silverman argued plaintiffs could not recover under those causes of action because they failed to present evidence he engaged in conduct that interfered with any contractual relations or prospective economic advantage.
plaintiffs appeal the trial court grant of jnov motions and on the interference with contractual relations cause of action.silverman appeals the trial court denial of jnov motions and on the interference with prospective economic advantage cause of action.silverman appeal is addressed in part.
the elements of a cause of action for interference with contractual relations are the existence of a valid contract between the plaintiff and a third party the defendant knowledge of this contract the defendant intentional acts designed to induce a breach or disruption of the contractual relationship actual breach or disruption of the contractual relationship and resulting damages.pmc,saban entertainment,th,d.proof the interfering conduct was wrongful,independent from the interference itself,is not required to recover for interference with contractual relations.limandri judkins th,d.
plaintiffs theory at trial was that an oral contract was formed during swaney telephone conversation with hodges on february.the contract terminated on february,when nevadacor and kaymor informed sole energy corporation in writing they wish ed to terminate the negotiations and the letter of intent dated december.
the record reveals no evidence that silverman engaged in any conduct to interfere with this oral contract during its brief life.evidence of silverman conduct before the oral contract was formed is irrelevant to the claim for interference with contractual relations,which requires the existence of a valid contract.pacific gas electric bear stearns cal d.hodge conduct,though relevant perhaps to petrominerals liability,is irrelevant to silverman liability for interference with contractual relations.thus,the order granting jnov motions and on the interference with contractual relations cause of action is affirmed.
grant of jnov motion affirmed plaintiffs can not recover punitive damages without an award of actual damages.
the jury awarded borghese and swaney each million in punitive damages against petrominerals and each in punitive damages against silverman.the trial court granted jnov motion and struck the jury award of punitive damages against silverman on the ground the evidence did not support imposition of punitive damages against him.petrominerals,though not a party to jnov motion,argues neither borghese nor swaney may recover punitive damages from it because the compensatory damages must be reversed.
an award of actual damages,even if nominal,is required to recover punitive damages,kizer county of san mateo cal d,actual damages are an absolute predicate for an award of exemplary or punitive damages mother cobb chicken,fox cal d,jackson johnson th,d.
neither borghese nor swaney can recover actual damages from petrominerals or silverman and,therefore,neither borghese nor swaney can recover punitive damages.we affirm the order granting jnov motion and remand with directions to strike the punitive damages against petrominerals.
grant of petrominerals motion for a new trial the court lacks jurisdiction because plaintiffs failed to appeal from the order granting a new trial.
we lack jurisdiction to consider plaintiffs challenge to the order granting petrominerals motion for a new trial because plaintiffs failed to appeal from that order.
an order granting a motion for a new trial is an appealable order.code civ,subd.a.if an order is appealable,an aggrieved party must file a timely notice of appeal from the order to obtain appellate review.norman krug real estate investments,praszker d.a notice of appeal from a judgment alone does not encompass other judgments and separately appealable orders the law of this state does not allow,on an appeal from a judgment,a review of any decision or order from which an appeal might previously have been taken.in re marriage of weiss th,d.
the notice of appeal is sufficient if it identifies the particular judgment or order being appealed.cal.rules of court,rule a.w here several judgments orders occurring close in time are separately appealable,judgment and order awarding attorney fees,each appealable judgment and order must be expressly either a single notice of appeal or multiple notices of order to be reviewable on appeal.dezerega meggs th,d,quoting eisenberg et,cal.practice guide civil appeals and writs the rutter group,italics omitted.
in the notice of appeal filed february,plaintiffs stated they were appealing from the judgment entered on january,in department of the court.the notice of appeal does not mention the order granting petrominerals a new trial,entered on january,or the notice of entry of the new trial order,served on the same day.the notice of appeal neither specifies the new trial order nor makes it reasonably clear plaintiffs were trying to appeal from it.anderson th,d.although notices of appeal must be liberally construed cal.rules of court,rule a,we can not liberally construe the february,notice of appeal to include the new trial order,which was directly and independently appealable.
plaintiffs suggest they did not have to file a notice of appeal to challenge the new trial order because it is void on the ground the trial court failed to timely file a signed specification of reasons pursuant to code of civil procedure section.however,a failure to specify reasons is not,as such,a jurisdictional defect.by omitting to act in that connection a court does not render its new trial order void,it merely restricts the scope of appellate review to the other grounds,if any,listed in the motion for a new trial.mercer perez cal d.
the recent decision in walker los angeles county metropolitan transportation authority cal th,d,does not support construing the notice of appeal to confer jurisdiction over the order granting petrominerals a new trial.in that case,the supreme court held a reviewing court should construe a notice of appeal from an order denying a new trial to be an appeal from the underlying judgment when it is reasonably clear the appellant intended to appeal from the judgment and the respondent would not be misled or prejudiced.id.at,d,fn.omitted,italics added.an order denying a motion for a new trial is nonappealable and must be reviewed on appeal from the underlying judgment.id.at,d.in contrast,an order granting a new trial is appealable.code civ,subd.a.a notice of appeal mentioning only the underlying judgment would not make it reasonably clear the appellant also intended to appeal from a separate and directly appealable order granting a new trial.
because plaintiffs did not appeal from the order granting petrominerals a new trial,we have no jurisdiction to review that order.code civ,see also norman krug real estate investments,praszker,supra,d at.
plaintiffs do not challenge the order granting a nonsuit on the fraud and conspiracy claims against silverman.
the trial court granted a nonsuit on the fraud and conspiracy claims against silverman.the nonsuit was reviewable on appeal from the final judgment because the order granting nonsuit was not in writing,signed by the court,and filed.santa barbara pistachio ranch chowchilla water dist.th,fn,d.plaintiffs do not challenge the nonsuit in their briefs on appeal and therefore have waived any claim of error.founding members of the newport beach country club newport beach country club,th,d.
ii.appeal of petrominerals and silverman 
denial of jnov motions and on interference with prospective economic advantage cause of action reversed plaintiffs failed to produce evidence silverman interfered with an existing economic relationship or engaged in conduct wrongful apart from the interference itself.
as stated above,the trial court denied silverman jnov motions and on the cause of action for interference with prospective economic advantage.the elements of a cause of action for interference with prospective economic advantage are an economic relationship between the plaintiff and a third party,with the probability of future economic benefit to the plaintiff the defendant knowledge of the relationship the defendant intentional and wrongful conduct designed to interfere with or disrupt this relationship interference with or disruption of this relationship and economic harm to the plaintiff proximately caused by the defendant wrongful conduct.korea supply lockheed martin cal th,d.
to establish intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,a plaintiff must plead and prove the defendant interference was wrongful by some legal measure other than the fact of interference itself.della penna toyota motor sales,cal th,d.an act is independently wrongful if it is unlawful,that is,if it is proscribed by some constitutional,statutory,regulatory,common law,or other determinable legal standard.korea supply lockheed martin,supra,cal th at,d.
in korea supply lockheed martin,supra,cal th at page,d,the california supreme court concluded the plaintiff had pleaded independent wrongfulness by alleging the defendant engaged in bribery and offered sexual favors to obtain a contract from the korean government,which acts violated the foreign corrupt practices act,united states code section et.in reeves hanlon cal th,d,it was undisputed the defendants engaged in unlawful and unethical conduct in disrupting the plaintiffs relationships with key employees by,among other things,destroying computer records,misappropriating confidential information,and improperly soliciting clients.
in this case,the parties disagree over the time frame to use in analyzing silverman conduct.silverman argues the relevant time frame is february through,the period between the formation and termination of the oral contract.silverman argues his conduct before february is irrelevant because any attempt to interfere with plaintiffs prospective economic relationship with hboc,nevadacor,or kaymor was unsuccessful in preventing the creation of a binding oral contract.plaintiffs argue for a broader time frame plaintiffs cause of action for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage is based upon the economic relationship established on december,by the letter of intent between plaintiffs and hboc,et.thus,any disrupting conduct that occurred after this relationship was established should be relevant to this tort.plaintiffs also argue the relevant time frame should extend back to july,when hodges first represented to borghese and swaney that petrominerals could not purchase hboc.
under any proposed time frame,the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,does not support the verdict based on interference with prospective economic advantage.as explained above,the record does not reveal any interfering conduct by silverman from february through february,the brief life span of the oral contract.according to the record,the only thing silverman did between december,and february,was to congratulate swaney at a trade show on february,for obtaining financing.such conduct was neither interfering nor wrongful.
one has to go back to august to find evidence in the record of any other conduct by silverman relating to the purchase of hboc stock and assets.on august,silverman faxed a letter to hodges stating petrominerals might be able to purchase hboc.the letter concluded,let talk more
