background 
ais is a close corporation organized under colorado law.it has never had more than six shareholders.in,combs became a minority shareholder of ais and began working there.at all times relevant to this appeal,bennett,the majority shareholder of ais,has been the president,chairman of the board,and sole other employee of ais.
in the late summer of,pricewaterhousecoopers acquired all the assets of ais,although ais remains an extant corporate entity.as part of this transaction,both bennett and combs became employees of pricewaterhousecoopers.approximately four months after this transaction,pricewaterhousecoopers terminated combs employment.
after his discharge,combs brought numerous causes of action against both pricewaterhousecoopers and bennett in colorado state court,including an age discrimination suit against pricewaterhousecoopers under et.adea.the adea claim enabled pricewaterhousecoopers and bennett to remove the case to federal court,see c,where the district court took supplemental jurisdiction over combs numerous state law claims,see a.having subsequently reached a settlement agreement with combs,pricewaterhousecoopers is not before us on appeal.we therefore turn our focus to the claims against bennett.
combs rested his sole action against bennett,breach of fiduciary duty,on six alleged instances of her misconduct.much of the factual basis for these claims arise out of an august audit of ais.although combs invited the other minority shareholders to participate in the audit,they declined,thus leaving him with the entire financial burden of the audit.
in the district court,bennett filed a motion for summary judgment,offering three supporting arguments.first,she contended that combs lacked standing to bring these claims in his individual capacity,asserting that he must bring this suit as a derivative action on behalf of the corporation.second,bennett presented a statute of limitations argument.third,she argued that combs could not carry his burden of proof as a matter of law.on january,the district court,relying solely on bennett first ground,granted summary judgment and discharged all claims against bennett.on february,combs appealed the summary judgment ruling.
on february,combs filed a motion to amend his complaint to state a derivative action.see.a.on april,based on its previous summary judgment ruling,the district court denied the motion as moot.combs challenges this ruling in a separately filed appeal motion to amend appeal.in september,bennett moved to consolidate the two appeals,which was granted.she also moved this court,pursuant to cir.a,to dismiss the motion to amend appeal,arguing that mootness and lack of appellate jurisdiction preclude review of the district court decision.we consider this argument,along with the merits of combs appeal,below.
ii.summary judgment 
combs presents two arguments against the necessity of a derivative action in this case.first,he asserts that he may sue in his individual capacity because bennett cause d him injury as a stockholder,unique to himself and not suffered by the other stockholders.nicholson ash.second,he urges that,because ais is a close corporation,filing this suit in a derivative capacity would not further the policies served by the derivative action procedure.applying colorado law,we disagree.
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standards used by the district court.byers city of albuquerque,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.we view the evidence,and draw reasonable inferences therefrom,in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.byers,at.
standing as a unique shareholder 
to escape summary judgment on his breach of fiduciary duty claim,combs must put forth evidence of the elements of a breach of fiduciary duty,see graphic directions,bush,providing elements,and also establish that he has standing,see river mgmt.lodge props,accordingly,the district court based the summary judgment order on its finding that combs lacked standing as a matter of law.
combs contends that he suffered a breach of fiduciary duty from the fact that bennett paid herself a salary in excess of what had been approved by ais board of directors paid for personal expenses out of ais funds failed to disclose the pending sale of ais to the shareholders in a timely manner pursued business opportunities for herself instead of for ais falsely promised him continued employment with pricewaterhousecooper and negotiated a lucrative salary from pricewaterhouse for herself without similarly providing for combs.
absent an exception to the general rule,combs lacks standing to bring these claims in an individual capacity.under colorado law,a stockholder can not maintain a personal action against a director or other third party whose action causes harm to the corporation.generally,it is the corporation,or a stockholder in a derivative action,who must pursue such a claim.nicholson,at.moreover,colorado law states expressly that combs first and second waste and mismanagement of corporate be brought as a derivative action,even in close corporations having but one minority shareholder.river mgmt,at see also casey,filing of derivative action is proper for claims regarding excessive salaries ireland wynkoop,same for suits alleging wrongful use.as to his third contention,although close corporation shareholders reasonably can expect to be informed of all listings in a timely manner and have a right to expect that offers to purchase will be pursued and negotiated in good faith,colt princeton trout club,such a claim is properly pursued as a derivative action,id.at.such is also the case with combs fourth contention regarding.ireland,at.as the district court noted,the fifth and sixth grounds,as they allege injuries to combs as an employee,simply fail on the merits as a matter of law 
combs argues that this general prohibition against individual standing does not apply because bennett cause d him injury as a stockholder,unique to himself and not suffered by the other stockholders.nicholson,at.if he can satisfy this exception to the general rule,then combs may pursue his fiduciary duty claims in his individual capacity.see also in re int l,cir applying colorado corporate law.
combs offers four reasons why his fiduciary duty claims fall within the nicholson exception bennett misuse of funds deprived ais of money to pay him a higher salary he was the only shareholder to perform an audit bennett untimely disclosure of the pending sale of ais inhibited his ability to negotiate a lucrative salary from pricewaterhousecoopers and bennett promise of continued employment with pricewaterhousecoopers affected him disproportionately.
as the district court noted,combs first,third,and fourth claims of uniqueness are injuries in his status as an employee,not a stockholder.as such,the district court held that they failed to establish a unique injury to combs in his status as a shareholder.citing many cases,combs argues on appeal that this distinction between the status as a shareholder and status as an employee is not meaningful in the close corporation context because t he denial of employment to the minority shareholder at the hands of the majority is especially pernicious in some instances.a guaranty of employment with the corporation may have
