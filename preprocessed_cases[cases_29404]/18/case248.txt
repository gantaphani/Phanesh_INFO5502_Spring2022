operating local annuity trust fund local appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york pauley,dismissing claims alleging securities fraud in violation of b of the securities exchange act of and rule,and breaches of fiduciary duty in violation of b of the investment company act of see b b.the claims were asserted in a class action brought on behalf of investors,including local,the lead plaintiff,who purchased shares in the mutual funds that are part of the smith barney family of funds funds between september,and may.
various affiliates of citigroup sponsored and managed the funds.smith barney asset management,llc smith barney and citigroup global markets,global markets or cgmi served as investment advisers.both smith barney and global markets were part of citigroup asset management cam,a business unit of citigroup that provides investment advisory and management services to funds.during the class period,thomas jones served as the chief executive officer of cam,while lewis daidone served as its senior vice president.
according to local complaint,whose allegations we accept for the purposes of this appeal,smith barney negotiated a contract for transfer agent services that saddled the funds with excessive,misleadingly disclosed fees,a significant portion of which were,in essence,kicked back to a smith barney affiliate.specifically,the scheme unfolded as follows from through september,an outside contractor,first data investor services group first data,provided transfer agent services for the funds.transfer agents do a number of things.they process transactions in funds shares,calculate daily net asset values,compute sales charges and commissions,distribute proxy and other materials,operate customer service centers and perform various accounting functions.as is customary,cam paid first data transfer agent fees using fund assets,an expense that cam publicly disclosed,in accordance with securities and exchange commission sec rules,under the heading other expenses.
in,cam initiated a formal study of the transfer agent function in anticipation of the expiration of the existing contracts between the funds and first data.to assist with the study,cam retained deloitte touche consulting deloitte.looking to save money,cam asked deloitte to research and report on whether cam could take over the transfer agent functions,rather than continue to contract with an outside agency such as first data.ultimately,deloitte proposed that cam create a subsidiary that would provide transfer agent services to the funds using technology purchased from a first data competitor.
cam rejected deloitte recommendation.instead,it renegotiated the terms of its contract with first data cam proposed that the funds continue to pay the same transfer agent fees to first data,with the exception that smith barney would assume the limited function of running a customer service call center at minimal cost.first data would receive the same fees as before,but would rebate a substantial portion of the fee to smith barney.
deloitte expressed doubts to cam as to the legality of the arrangement,questioning,among other things,whether the anticipated savings belonged to the funds as opposed to the investment adviser and whether the fund boards would ever approve such an arrangement.at that point,cam changed course and created a transfer agent subsidiary called citicorp trust banks ctb which,in place of first data,then contracted with the funds to provide transfer agent services.at the same time,ctb contracted with first data to provide most of the same transfer agent services it had previously provided but at a much lower rate.because of this subcontract,ctb role as a transfer agent was a circumscribed one the company operated a call center.ctb memorialized its subcontract with first data in a side letter.the side letter allegedly guaranteed cam millions of dollars in additional revenue,without providing commensurate benefit to the funds.despite the fact that first data substantially reduced the rate it charged for transfer agent services,and despite the fact that ctb circumscribed role was confined to operating the call center,ctb charged the funds substantially more in transfer agent fees than it paid first data.thus,according to local,cam,through ctb,essentially pocketed money belonging to the funds.
local further alleges that cam concealed critical aspects of its scheme from the funds boards of directors,which were responsible for approving the investment adviser fee.during presentations to the funds boards between march and june,senior vice president daidone recommended that the boards enter into the proposed contract with ctb but failed to inform the boards about the details of the side letter.these presentations were accompanied by a memorandum,authored by daidone,which represented that the goals of the new contract with ctb were to reduce fees and promote future growth.daidone efforts to persuade the funds boards to adopt the contract with ctb proved successful.each of the boards approved his recommendation.
according to local,cam then concealed its scheme from investors.on may,a smith barney affiliate issued a prospectus,updating them about the state of the funds and subsequently issued an amended prospectus on september,the first day of the class period.that amended prospectus and prospectuses that followed on april,march,and june,all disclosed,with varying levels of detail,the existence of the contract between the funds and ctb.these prospectuses also disclosed the subcontract between ctb and first data.cam did not initially disclose in these prospectuses,however,that first data continued to perform the same services it had previously performed at a substantially reduced rate.nor did cam disclose that the nominal transfer agent,ctb,would perform only minimal functions but would then pocket the difference between what it charged the funds and what it paid first data.
in september,a whistleblower reported to the sec about cam failure adequately to disclose the arrangement to the fund boards.three months later,cam issued written supplements to the fund prospectuses disclosing the existence of the side letter,and disclosing that cam had not informed the funds boards of the side letter at the time that they approved the transfer agent contracts.
in,the sec investigated smith barney and cgmi for violations of the investment advisers act of alleging that they induced the funds to enter into a contract that resulted in unnecessarily high expenses to the funds and undisclosed profits to cam.specifically,according to the sec,the cumulative effect of the scheme was to provide ctb with pretax revenues of approximately million off set by total operating expenses of million and to funnel to cam and its affiliates approximately million in additional revenue based on revenue guarantee arrangements in the side letter.in may,the sec settled with smith barney and cgmi,who agreed to pay more than million in fines and disgorge the profits generated by the scheme.based on these allegations,investors filed a series of civil suits in the southern district of new york seeking damages for defendants violations of,among other provisions,b of the securities exchange act of,rule,and b of the investment company act of.these suits were subsequently consolidated with local serving as lead plaintiff and filing the amended complaint that is the subject of this appeal.
in september the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss the complaint,holding that the mischaracterization of the fees paid to ctb as transfer agent fees was not a false material representation under b.the district court also dismissed local b claims on the ground that they could only be brought derivatively on behalf of the funds.the court granted local leave to replead its b claims as derivative,rather than direct claims.after plaintiff elected to stand on its complaint,the district court entered final judgment.this appeal followed.
discussion 
we review a district court dismissal of a complaint pursuant to rule b de novo.the court accepts all allegations in the complaint as true,drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor.in order to survive a motion to dismiss under rule b,a complaint must allege a plausible set of facts sufficient to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.bell atl.twombly,accord ashcroft iqbal.
the materiality of a misleading statement or omission for b purposes is a mixed question of law and fact,and a complaint may not be dismissed under rule b on the ground that the alleged misstatements or omissions are not material unless they are so obviously unimportant to a reasonable investor that reasonable minds could not differ on the question of their importance.eca,local ibew joint pension trust of chi.jp morgan chase,cir quotation marks omitted.
the district court dismissed local b claims because it concluded that when an investment adviser discloses the total amount of fees paid by a fund for various services,neither the fees allocation nor the transfer agent profit margin is material.finding that only the amount of fees is relevant to the price and value of the funds,the court reasoned that an investor who knows the amount of fees a fund pays can,when deciding to invest,compare the fees to those of its competitors.because it was not disputed that appellees had disclosed the gross amount of the fees paid by the funds,the court concluded that plaintiffs were in possession of all material information,they knew the value of the funds.the district court further reasoned that it is the amount of fees,not their allocation or a transfer agent profit margin,that is relevant to the price and value of the funds,and the gross amount of each of the fees was disclosed.
section b of the securities exchange act and rule make it unlawful for any person 
a to employ any device,scheme,or artifice to defraud,b to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading,or c to engage in any act,practice,or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.
to state a claim under these provisions,a plaintiff must allege that in connection with the purchase or sale of securities,the defendant,acting with scienter,made a false material representation or omitted to disclose material information and that plaintiff reliance on defendant conduct caused plaintiff injury.caiola citibank,f d,cir internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.
the veracity of a statement or omission is measured not by its literal truth,but by its ability to accurately inform rather than mislead prospective buyers.greenapple detroit edison,cir beecher able,a statement which is literally true,if susceptible to quite another interpretation by the reasonable investor may properly be considered a material misrepresentation.quoting sec first am.bank trust,cir.some literally accurate statements can,through their context and manner of presentation,become devices which mislead investors.mcmahan wherehouse entm t,cir.in light of these principles,we have little difficulty concluding that the defendants disclosures concerning the transfer fee arrangements were inadequate.
materiality 
to determine whether a misrepresentation is material,we look to whether there is a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.basic levinson,quoting tsc,northway,acito imcera group,cir.put another way,a fact is to be considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable person would consider it important in deciding whether to buy or sell shares of stock.azrielli cohen law offices,cir.
local contends that the defendants misrepresented the services that ctb performed because investors were not told that ctb would limit its role to operating a small call center that first data would,in practice,provide the vast majority of transfer agent services or that first data would charge only a fraction of the fees that would be drained from the funds.further,in the fund prospectuses,defendants categorized the fees that cam pocketed as other fees,when in fact,they were far more akin to management fees a category that,under sec rules,was required to be separately stated.
we agree with local that cam misrepresentations were material.a substantial likelihood exists that a reasonable investor would view them as significant alterations of the total mix of information made available.basic,at.first and foremost,what the fund investors could not divine from the disclosures was that they were at the mercy of a faithless fiduciary.as the supreme court has admonished t he relationship between investment advisers and mutual funds is fraught with potential conflicts of interest.burks lasker,quoting kamen kemper fin.servs,observing the potential conflicts of interest inherent in mutual fund arrangements.for a comprehensive analysis of this problem,see david swensen,unconventional success a fundamental approach to personal investing.
cam,acting through investment adviser smith barney,owed a duty of uncompromising fidelity and undivided loyalty to the funds shareholders.galfand chestnutt,see also daily income fund,fox.any rational mutual fund investor would be highly leery of dealing with a fiduciary such as cam and its affiliates who,in violation of the law,lined their pockets at the expense of investors whose interests they were obligated to protect.the district court analysis did not engage this reality.
under the circumstances alleged in the complaint,the defendants had an obligation to negotiate the best possible arrangement for the funds.in addition,they were obligated to disclose candidly to shareholders the material features of the arrangements they crafted.see generally overton todman,cir.these obligations required the defendants to make clear to both the board and the funds shareholders that cam was assuming nearly the full benefit of the discounts generated by first data.we conclude that the facts that shareholders were being grossly overcharged for transfer agent services and that cam was reaping the benefits were ones that would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.tsc,at.
the sec disclosure rules support this analysis.in connection with the distribution of securities,a mutual fund is required to file with the sec a registration statement and prospectus containing fee tables summarizing the expenses deducted from fund assets.see,form registration form for management investment companies,general instructions to item,last visited.the prospectus is considered by the sec to be the most complete source of information about a fund and serves as a fund primary disclosure document.registration form used by management investment companies securities act,at.for example,in the context of a typical mutual fund,sec regulations require that the prospectus contain only information that is necessary for an average or typical investor to make an investment decision,and focus its contents on information that is essential to an investment in the fund.id.at.the fee tables within the prospectuses carry special significance because they reflect the commission strongly held belief in the importance of fees and expenses in a typical investor decision to invest in a fund.the fee table is designed to help investors understand the costs of investing in a fund and to compare those costs with the costs of other funds.id.at.
the sec requires investment advisers to distinguish management fees from other expenses in a fee table placed at the front of a prospectus.see,sec form,supra a form shall be used as the registration statement to be filed pursuant to section b of the investment company act of by management investment companies.specifically,the sec requires mutual funds to break out and disclose separately three categories of fund expenses in the front of every fund prospectus management fees distribution or fee
