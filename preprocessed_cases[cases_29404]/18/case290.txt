first capital asset management,fcam and willem collectively,plaintiffs,appeal from a final judgment entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york kaplan,dismissing plaintiffs rico conspiracy and substantive rico claims and declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs remaining,claims.on appeal,plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in concluding that plaintiffs failed to plead a pattern of racketeering activity and in various other respects.in their protective,satinwood,satinwood,sphinx rock,sphinx rock,ahmed vahabzadeh ahmed,sohrab vahabzadeh sohrab,afiwa,afiwa,afsar vahabzadeh afsar,savco,savco,and the estate of soleyman vahabzadeh soleyman estate collectively,defendants,assert that the district court erred in making certain determinations relating to plaintiffs substantive rico claims and in holding that pendent party jurisdiction existed over certain defendants.
we agree with the district court that plaintiffs failed to plead a racketeering pattern,and thus we conclude that their substantive rico claims were properly dismissed.and because plaintiffs rico conspiracy claims are entirely dependent on their substantive rico claims,we also concur in the district court dismissal of the rico conspiracy claims.further,we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claims.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court in all respects.
background 
familiarity with the facts giving rise to this appeal is assumed,as those facts are set forth in the district court comprehensive published opinions.see first capital asset,brickelbush,d hereinafter fcam i first capital asset,brickellbush,d hereinafter fcam ii first capital asset,brickellbush,d hereinafter fcam iii.we relate below only those facts and proceedings that are relevant to the present appeals.
state court proceedings 
in october,fcam entered into a agreement the spa with sohrab and his companies,north american consortium,naci and partners,nap.sohrab was to pay fcam million in return for an interest in a new delaware corporation called first capital.the spa also provided that would become first capital first ceo.based on that agreement,resigned from his position as president of abn amro securities.
shortly thereafter,sohrab,naci,and nap breached the spa,leaving fcam without the promised million and without a job.fcam sued sohrab,naci,and nap in texas for breach of contract.the action was commenced in december,dismissed on the ground of forum non conveniens,and subsequently recommenced in new york.in february,the new york state supreme court granted summary judgment for fcam against naci and nap and awarded damages of million plus interest,but found that sohrab himself was not personally liable naci and nap were shell companies,however,with no discernible assets to satisfy the judgment.fcam therefore commenced a proceeding in new york state supreme court,petitioning the court,pursuant to article,to enforce against soleyman estate and sohrab under alter ego theories the prior judgment against naci and nap the state court dismissed the petition,but that dismissal was reversed as against sohrab by the appellate division in june,the new york supreme court entered judgment in favor of fcam and against sohrab for more than million 
too,sued sohrab,naci,and nap in federal breach of the employment agreement incorporated in the spa the action eventually,without a trial,the defendants in that action stipulated to damages,and judgment was entered in favor.
ii.federal proceedings 
sohrab bankruptcy 
in july,a few weeks before trial in the action was scheduled to begin,sohrab filed a chapter bankruptcy petition.fcam and filed an adversary proceeding objecting to sohrab discharge under of the bankruptcy code on the grounds of bankruptcy fraud and fraudulent conveyance the adversary proceeding.in december,after a trial,the bankruptcy court denied sohrab chapter petition for discharge on grounds of bankruptcy fraud 
in july,plaintiffs filed a complaint the complaint in the district court alleging ten causes of action,two under rico and the others under state law.the rico substantive and one for brought against sohrab,his mother,his uncle ahmed,and the vahabzadeh family swiss lawyer,jens schlegelmilch schlegelmilch.the rico claims arose from the allegedly unlawful actions of those four individuals and of numerous other vahabzadeh family members and related satinwood,sphinx rock,and controlled by the family certain members of it.the civil rico claims were the sole bases for federal jurisdiction.
plaintiffs specifically alleged that defendants rico violations and violations prevented plaintiffs from satisfying the outstanding judgments against sohrab and his related companies.in particular,plaintiffs alleged the following rico predicate acts,which were primarily bankruptcy and mail frauds 
in august,sohrab and peninsula appreciation,peninsula,allegedly sohrab alter ego,fraudulently conveyed their interests in a partnership to defendant brickellbush,in contemplation of bankruptcy.
in early,sohrab transferred property inherited from soleyman to other family members,including afsar.schlegelmilch prepared the documents that effected the transfer.
on july,sohrab filed a materially false bankruptcy petition.
on september,sohrab made false statements under oath at the bankruptcy rule examination by his creditors.
ahmed and schlegelmilch directed soleyman estate attorney to submit declarations to the bankruptcy court in february and march containing false statements about the contents of soleyman estate and,in june,afsar and soleyman estate directed the same attorney to submit a similar declaration.
in march,afsar and schlegelmilch submitted affidavits to the bankruptcy court making false claims about soleyman citizenship.
on june,sohrab submitted an affidavit to the bankruptcy court in which he falsely stated that he had searched for a complete copy of a trust agreement.
in september,ahmed,afiwa at the direction of ahmed,afsar,and schlegelmilch committed mail fraud by sending sohrab correspondence claiming that they had no documents relevant to soleyman estate.
sohrab gave false testimony about his inheritance at his bankruptcy trial in october.
from september to december,afsar accessed sohrab overseas accounts,transferring approximately per month from those accounts first into her accounts and then into sohrab domestic accounts.ahmed also transferred money to sohrab at least once,on october.schlegelmilch,too,transferred money to sohrab on at least two and november.and finally,schlegelmilch and ahmed paid sohrab legal fees including one payment in the amount of either or in september.
satinwood,sphinx rock,ahmed,savco,and soleyman estate collectively,the moving defendants moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to.b,for failure to state a claim.b,on the ground that the predicate acts were not pleaded with sufficient particularity and.b,for lack of standing and subject matter jurisdiction.the moving defendants also moved to dismiss all claims against afsar,ahmed,and afiwa under.b,for lack of personal jurisdiction.defendants brickellbush,brickellbush,manou failly,and youssef vahabzadeh collectively,the failly defendants moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,failure to plead fraud with specificity,and failure to state a claim.
on july,in a,published memorandum opinion,the district court held that plaintiffs had not sufficiently pled a pattern of racketeering activity.fcam i,d at.the court analyzed the alleged predicate acts chronologically,first examin ing the sufficiency of the chronologic outliers,specifically the august conveyances and the transfers of funds to sohrab in and.id.at.
as to the first outlier predicate act,plaintiffs alleged that,in august,sohrab and an alter ego had transferred their interests in a partnership for inadequate consideration and no consideration,respectively,in contemplation of bankruptcy.id.at.plaintiffs claimed that the transfer constituted fraud on sohrab part and,thus,was a rico predicate.in the court view,however,n ot only was there a dearth of facts supporting such an inference,but several allegations undermine d it.the transfer predated the bankruptcy filing by two years and occurred before judgments were entered against sohrab and his companies moreover,other allegations that sohrab made fraudulent conveyances in the same period did not allege that he made these in contemplation of bankruptcy,despite being contemporaneous.id.at.consequently,the court found that the c omplaint offer ed no rational basis upon which to ground an inference that the august transfer was made in contemplation of bankruptcy,and contain ed only conclusory allegations of scienter without the necessary minimum factual basis.id.
and as to the last outlier predicate act,plaintiffs alleged that ahmed,afsar,and schlegelmilch at various times in and violated by receiving assets from sohrab,a debtor intending to defeat the purpose of the bankruptcy code.id.the court found those allegations,as well,to be vague and unpersuasive.the court noted that plaintiffs had not alleged with any specificity when assets were transferred from sohrab although the c omplaint detail ed when the money was transferred to sohrab from the family members and schlegelmilch,it was silent on when the money was received from the essence of the predicate act.id.at emphasis added.the court noted that soleyman other children routinely had received gifts amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars per year,and found that this tended to undermine an y inference of fraudulent intent underlying the and transfers.id.at.thus,the court concluded that plaintiffs had failed to plead with sufficient particularity the predicate acts that were alleged to have occurred in and,which constituted the chronological endpoints in the alleged pattern.id.
having eliminated all of the alleged predicate acts at the temporal extremes,the district court proceeded to analyze the remaining alleged predicate acts to determine if they constituted a pattern.examining continuity first,the court,in a relatively straightforward,inherently fact bound inquiry,found that plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate that the predicate acts were the regular way of operating the alleged enterprise,or that the nature of the predicate acts themselves implie d a threat of continued criminal activity.id.at footnotes and internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,the court determined that the remaining alleged predicates did not constitute a pattern of continuity.
next,focusing primarily on the length of time over which the remaining alleged predicate acts had occurred,the court examined whether the purported pattern expressed continuity.the court found that schlegelmilch and afsar activities all revolved around a single scheme to avoid sohrab bankruptcy creditors,and that these acts were limited in duration,variety,and schlegelmilch acts essentially amount ing to drafting and submitting documents and affidavits in the various legal actions and afsar acts amounting to making false statements and accept ing the inheritance.id.at.further,the court noted that,once the chronological outlier acts were eliminated for deficiencies in pleading,as detailed above,all of the remaining alleged predicate acts of ahmed,afsar,and schlegelmilch were performed over less than a span of time.id.this was a critical finding in light of the district court interpretation of the law of this predicate acts occurring over less than a period may not be deemed a pattern.see id.at.accordingly,with respect to afsar,ahmed,and schlegelmilch,the district court held that plaintiffs had failed to allege a pattern of continuity.id.at.
the court then examined the predicate acts allegedly committed by sohrab.examining the totality of the circumstances surrounding these acts,the court found that sohrab had allegedly taken part in a single scheme through acts limited essentially to false statements to the bankruptcy court and transfer of his inheritance.id.at.the district court took note of our teaching that courts must take care to ensure that plaintiff s do not artificially fragment a singular act into multiple acts simply to invoke rico.id.internal quotation marks omitted citing schlaifer nance estate of andy warhol,cir.mindful of this admonition,the district court held that,i n the circumstances,taking the allegations of the c omplaint as true,p laintiffs have not alleged facts sufficient to establish a pattern.id.
in light of these findings,the district court dismissed the substantive rico claims in the complaint,holding that the alleged acts did not rise to the level of a pattern of racketeering activity.id.at.the court also found that b ecause p laintiffs substantive rico claims were infirm,there was no basis for a claim of rico conspiracy.fcam i,d at.and finally,the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the claims in the absence of federal jurisdiction.in sum,the complaint was dismissed in its entirety as against all defendants.
in august,the district court granted plaintiffs leave to amend the complaint and,in september,plaintiffs filed an amended complaint the amended complaint,asserting eight claims for relief 
counts one through four were new york law fraudulent conveyance claims against sohrab,ahmed,afsar,soleyman estate,sphinx rock,satinwood,peninsula,and john does.count five was a substantive rico claim under c against sohrab and afsar.count six was a rico conspiracy claim under d against sohrab,ahmed,and afsar.count seven was a reverse corporate veil piercing and alter ego liability claim against afiwa.count eight was a successor liability,common corporate enterprise,and alter ego liability claim against savco.
fcam ii,d at.
by the time of the filing of the amended complaint,certain parties to the original action were no longer involved in the case of the remaining defendants,all but,afsar and the moving for an order dismissing the amended complaint against the moving defendants for failure to state a claim pursuant to rule b or,in the alternative,pursuant to rule b for lack of standing and subject matter jurisdiction and all claims against afsar,ahmed,and afiwa,pursuant to rule b for lack of personal jurisdiction.id.at.on july,the district court issued a,published memorandum this motion.
the district court first analyzed whether plaintiffs had standing to assert a civil rico claim.the court determined that plaintiffs allegations of injury could be broken down into two inability to collect the judgments they had secured against sohrab and his companies the lost debt injuries,and the cost of pursuing their objections to sohrab bankruptcy discharge the legal fees injuries id.at.with respect to the lost debt injuries,the court found that p laintiffs ha d commenced and prosecuted to judgment or settlement five lawsuits against transferees of sohrab allegedly fraudulently conveyed assets.id.at.the court concluded that,because plaintiffs efforts,as evidenced by the state law claims in this case,were continuing and had been met with varying degrees of success,that plaintiffs had neither alleged nor offered any proof that the collection of the debt ha d been frustrated as a proximate consequence of any of the d efendants alleged predicate acts.id.accordingly,the court held that plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue a rico claim for lost debt injuries see id.
with respect to plaintiffs alleged legal fees injuries,the court found that,a mong the scores of predicate acts allegedly committed by sohrab,the following were particularly relevant 
on july,sohrab filed a materially false bankruptcy petition in violation of on july,sohrab transferred he held in an account at bank of new york in the name of vahabzadeh to an account at credit suisse in zurich controlled by his wife ninni brother,ali ladjevardi,in violation of and on may,sohrab and ninni executed a separation agreement in which sohrab,without consideration,ostensibly waived a claim to an equitable distribution of marital property,in violation of and on september,sohrab made false statements concerning his family financial affairs and his interest in soleyman estate and in the vahabzadeh family business at a meeting of his creditors,in violation of and on september,sohrab made similar false statements under oath during an examination by his creditors conducted under bankruptcy rule,in violation of.
id.at footnotes omitted.the court found that there was at least a genuine issue of fact regarding whether these predicate acts proximately caused p laintiffs to incur legal fees and other expenses in prosecuting their objections to sohrab bankruptcy petition in the a dversary p roceeding.id.at.thus,the court concluded,plaintiffs had standing to pursue their substantive rico claim against sohrab for legal fees injuries.
with regard to afsar,the court noted that plaintiffs had alleged that afsar had committed the following predicate acts 
at an unspecified time in early,she received assets from sohrab,which he purportedly inherited from soleyman estate and transferred to her overseas,all in violation of on september,she falsely stated in a letter sent to sohrab and intended for the bankruptcy court that she had no documents in her possession relating to soleyman estate or the financial affairs of her late husband on march,as part of the a dversary p roceeding,she submitted an affidavit stating falsely that soleyman had been an iranian citizen and not a swiss citizen,presumably in violation of she caused russell mcrory,in his capacity as her attorney,to submit a declaration to the bankruptcy court,dated march,in which he stated that soleyman,at the time of his death,owned no bank,brokerage,investment,or other type of account,presumably in violation of she caused mcrory,in his capacity as her attorney,to submit a declaration to the bankruptcy court,dated june,in which he stated that schlegelmilch had informed him that there were no assets in soleyman estate at the time of his death beyond personal effects,furnishings in his home,and two automobiles,both over twenty years old,presumably in violation of and on various dates between and,she sent money to sohrab,allegedly out of assets unlawfully transferred to her in by sohrab,in violation.
id.at footnotes omitted.in analyzing the predicate acts,the court divided them into two groups the adversary proceeding predicate acts including predicate acts through and the transfer predicate acts including predicate acts and.id.at.
with regard to the adversary proceeding predicate acts,the court found that plaintiffs had failed to show any injury thereby.the court noted that plaintiffs had been charged a flat fee by their attorneys for the adversary proceeding and that all of the alleged acts associated with it were committed well after the commencement of that proceeding.therefore,the court reasoned,any efforts on afsar part to delay or obstruct the adversary proceeding could not possibly have increased plaintiffs legal fees associated with that proceeding.id.the court further found that the transfer predicate acts had not been pled with sufficient particularity.the court noted that neither the complaint nor the amended its having added a mountain of new allegations asserting,on information and belief,that soleyman had owned assets at the time of his death and that sohrab had received an inheritance provided any detail as to when money had been received from sohrab,or when or how any transfer s to afsar had been accomplished.id.at.the court,finding t hese omissions to be particularly glaring because afsar receipt of sohrab assets in contemplation of his bankruptcy was the gravamen of the alleged predicate act,concluded that plaintiffs did not have standing to seek legal fees injuries from afsar in a substantive rico claim.id.at.
the court found,however,that plaintiffs did have standing to assert a rico conspiracy claim against afsar,sohrab,and ahmed for legal fees injuries.the court found that there was at least an issue of fact regarding whether the predicate acts attributed to sohrab were taken in furtherance of a conspiracy formed by sohrab,ahmed,afsar,and schlegelmilch in geneva,which had as its object to transfer and conceal assets of sohrab in contemplation of and during sohrab bankruptcy case.id.at.thus,concluded the court,the legal fees injury flowing from sohrab predicate acts conferred standing on plaintiffs to pursue not only their substantive rico claims for legal fees injuries against sohrab,but a rico conspiracy claim against ahmed and afsar arising from the alleged legal fees injuries as well.id.
the district court next performed a detailed analysis of whether it could exercise personal jurisdiction over afsar,ahmed,and afiwa.based on the amended complaint,affidavits,and documentary exhibits submitted by the parties,the court determined that it could not exercise personal jurisdiction over afsar,ahmed,or afiwa with respect to either the substantive rico claims or the rico conspiracy claims.the court found,however,that pendent party jurisdiction existed over ahmed and soleyman estate on the fraudulent conveyance claims.id.at.
notably,in fcam ii,the district court declined to address the moving defendants argument that the amended complaint should be dismissed as against them for failure to state a claim,pursuant to.b,and for failure to comply with.b.the court reasoned that,as the entirety of those arguments revolved around plaintiffs rico claims,and all of the rico claims against the moving defendants had been dismissed,their rule b and b arguments were moot.id.at.ultimately,the district court in fcam ii dismissed i all claims against afsar for lack of standing and lack of personal jurisdiction,ii all claims against afiwa for lack of personal jurisdiction,and iii the rico conspiracy claim against ahmed for lack of personal jurisdiction.id.at.
plaintiffs and defendants filed dueling motions for reconsideration of the district court fcam ii decision.plaintiffs challenged the court earlier dismissal of certain claims on grounds of standing and ripeness defendants,on the other hand,argued that the district court should have considered their rule b and b arguments,as it had in the fcam i decision and that,to spare defendants the effort of defending state law claims in federal court solely by virtue of the continued pendency of the rico claims against sohrab,the court should have dismissed the amended complaint in its entirety.fcam iii,d at.the district court agreed with defendants.on september,the court issued a page,published memorandum decision.reconsidering its earlier decision not to reach the moving defendants rule b and b arguments,and adher ing to its prior ruling that p laintiffs alleged l ost d ebt injury did not provide them with rico standing,the court,upon reconsideration,determined all of plaintiffs rico claims to be legally insufficient.id.at.
the district court initially focused on the sufficiency of plaintiffs allegations with respect to certain alleged fraudulent transfers by sohrab in tiburon and timberland transfers.plaintiffs had attempted to cure the deficiencies in the complaint by alleging the following additional facts in the amended complaint 
a sohrab wife,ninni,revealed in a conversation on july,that one of sohrab companies would file for bankruptcy and that sohrab might file for bankruptcy if first capital was successful in its state court action b sohrab was considering filing for bankruptcy at the time he transferred approximately to soleyman in august and c in an amended counterclaim that sohrab filed in the state court action on october,he revealed that he sold the timberland and tiburon interests because of first capital lawsuit and liquidated these interests for less than fair value.
id.at footnotes omitted.the court was not persuaded.it held that p laintiffs conclusory allegations of scienter without a coherent factual basis were insufficient to meet rule b requirements,and,therefore,that the tiburon and timberland transfers could not be considered in evaluating sohrab pattern of racketeering activity.id.at.
next,the district court analyzed in detail the patterns of rico conduct that plaintiffs had alleged on the parts of sohrab and afsar.the court acknowledged that plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged a pattern involving a single scheme of modest scope consisting of approximately ten predicate acts that spanned well over two years.id.at.the court found,however,that the chronology of events suggest ed sporadic bursts of activity at key points in time,such as in the months immediately preceding and following sohrab bankruptcy petition and certain hot spots during the adversary proceeding,rather than sustained and continuous criminal activity over the whole time period.id.ultimately,the court was not prepared to conclude that the specific racketeering activities alleged by plaintiffs constitute d the sort of criminal conduct that congress sought to target in rico.id.
accordingly,the court dismissed plaintiffs substantive rico claims on the ground that the alleged patterns of racketeering activity exhibit ed neither nor continuity.id.at.and because the district court found that plaintiffs alleged no actionable violation of rico,the court dismissed the rico conspiracy claims as well.id.at.finally,the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the and claims or over the defendants not named in the rico counts.id.
thus,the amended complaint was dismissed in its entirety as against all defendants,and a judgment to that effect was entered on september.for reasons not relevant to this appeal,however,that judgment was not rendered final until august.this timely appeal and followed.
discussion 
standard of review 
the district court dismissed plaintiffs rico claims after finding that certain allegations had not been pled with sufficient particularity and that,disregarding those allegations,plaintiffs had failed to state a claim.see generally fcam iii,d at.this court applies a de novo standard of review to such a dismissal,accepting as true the amended complaint factual allegations and drawing all inferences in plaintiffs favor.demuria hawkes,cir see scutti,llc park place entm t,cir.
ii.substantive rico and rico conspiracy claims 
rico enterprise 
the rico statute makes it unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise to conduct or participate,directly or indirectly,in the conduct of such enterprise affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.c see also united states indelicato,cir en banc.enterprise is defined to include any individual,partnership,corporation,association,or other legal entity,and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.bankers trust rhoades,cir quoting.the supreme court has explained that a rico enterprise is a group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct,the existence of which is proven by evidence of an ongoing organization,formal or informal,and by evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit.united states turkette,d 
in addition to individuals associated in fact,any legal entity may qualify as a rico enterprise.see,c.the enterprise must be separate from the pattern of racketeering activity,turkette,at,and distinct from the person conducting the affairs of the enterprise,see cedric kushner promotions,king,d riverwoods chappaqua marine midland bank,cir accord anatian coutts bank switzerland,cir.thus,rico requirements are most easily satisfied when the enterprise is a formal legal entity.see bennett berg,cir,adopted on reh g en banc,cir see also united states blinder,cir.but legitimacy is by no means a prerequisite to a rico enterprise.in perhaps its least developed form,an enterprise may be found where there is simply a discrete economic association existing separately from the racketeering activity.united states anderson,cir see turkette,at.
this court,however,further requires that a nexus exist between the enterprise and the racketeering activity that is being conducted.see indelicato,at.and f or an association of individuals to constitute an enterprise,the individuals must share a common purpose to engage in a particular fraudulent course of conduct and work together to achieve such purposes.first nationwide bank gelt funding,internal quotation marks omitted,aff,cir see also moll life title ins.of,citing cases.
in the amended complaint,plaintiffs alleged three enterprises.the first is the soleyman entities enterprise,allegedly consisting of soleyman,as succeeded by soleyman estate sohrab chapter bankruptcy estate the bankruptcy estate afiwa savco wastwater,wastwater defendant cimbalo investments,cimbalo,as succeeded by defendant sotar investments,sotar zanda management,zanda and brinslen invest,brinslen.the second purported enterprise is the vahabzadeh family enterprise,allegedly consisting of soleyman,as succeeded by soleyman estate afiwa brinslen sohrab the bankruptcy estate afsar ahmed and schlegelmilch.the third purported enterprise is the bankruptcy estate enterprise described in detail below.
we note that the amended complaint fails to make out any real distinction between the soleyman entities enterprise and the vahabzadeh family enterprise.there is considerable overlap between the members of these two purported include soleyman,soleyman estate,the bankruptcy estate,afiwa,and brinslen.the only distinction between the two enterprises seems to be that the soleyman estate enterprise also include several entities allegedly owned by soleyman at one time or another,cimbalo,zanda,wastwater,and savco whereas the vahabzadeh family enterprise also includes several individuals,sohrab,afsar,ahmed,and schelgelmilch.further,the amended complaint essentially treats the two enterprises as example,plaintiffs allege that the two enterprises had the same background,structure,and composition.in any event,we discern no reason not to treat these two alleged enterprises as one and,therefore,in this opinion refer to them,collectively,as the vahabzadeh enterprise.
the vahabzadeh enterprise 
the alleged illegal purpose of the vahabzadeh enterprise was to conceal sohrab assets from his creditors,the bankruptcy court,and sohrab chapter trustee.the amended complaint fails,however,to detail any course of fraudulent or illegal conduct separate and distinct from the alleged predicate racketeering acts requirement in this circuit.see first nationwide.at.plaintiffs certainly have not advanced any factual allegations that the vahabzadeh enterprise was an ongoing organization,formal or informal,or any evidence that the various associates of the alleged enterprise functioned as a continuing unit.turkette,at.moreover,plaintiffs have failed to provide us with any solid information regarding the hierarchy,organization,and activities of this alleged enterprise,united states coonan,cir,from which we could fairly conclude that its members functioned as a unit,nasik breeding research farm merck,d.thus,there is no basis to support the conclusion that the supposed constituent entities of the vahabzadeh enterprise were associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct.turkette,at.
moreover,plaintiffs have both failed to allege a nexus between the vahabzadeh enterprise and the alleged rico predicates and failed to explain each participant role in the alleged course of fraudulent or illegal conduct.see bernstein misk,the indifferent attempts to plead the existence of an enterprise fall short of their goal in that they frustrate assiduous efforts to identify its membership,its structure formal or informal,or its functional unity.plaintiffs conclusory naming of a string of entities does not adequately allege an enterprise.moy terranova,wl,at,internal quotation marks omitted see first nationwide.at accord burton white,beer,see also richmond nationwide cassel,cir affirming dismissal of complaint.accordingly,we conclude that plaintiffs have failed to allege adequately that the vahabzadeh enterprise was indeed a rico enterprise.
the bankruptcy estate enterprise 
the bankruptcy estate enterprise allegedly consisted of sohrab vahabzadeh,the bankruptcy estate the law firm of fischoff associates robert fisher,and robert herzog.plaintiffs alleged that,while t he legitimate purpose of the bankruptcy estate enterprise was to liquidate sohrab assets,to pay off his debts to the extent possible,and to obtain relief from his creditors,sohrab in fact manipulated the bankruptcy estate so that it functioned as a vehicle for defrauding p laintiffs and other creditors.
as an initial matter,we note that it is a question of first impression in this circuit whether a bankruptcy estate may,itself,be deemed a rico enterprise.in the only published decision thus far identified as having addressed whether a bankruptcy estate could be deemed such an enterprise,however,the eighth circuit had no difficulty concluding that it could.see handeen lemaire,cir gunther dinger,holding that a probate estate qualified as rico enterprise we agree that,under certain circumstances,a bankruptcy estate may qualify as a rico enterprise.here,because we conclude that plaintiffs have failed to plead adequately that defendants conducted or participated in the conduct of the affairs of the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity,see discussion infra part c,we assume without deciding that plaintiffs have adequately pled the existence of the bankruptcy estate enterprise.
conducting the enterprise affairs 
for rico purposes,simply establishing the presence of an enterprise is not enough.plaintiffs must also allege that the defendants conduct ed or participate d,directly or indirectly,in the conduct of such enterprise affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.c see reves ernst young,d.in reves,the supreme court explained this to mean that the defendant must have had some part in directing the enterprise affairs.at.of course,the word participate makes clear that rico liability is not limited to those with primary responsibility for the enterprise affairs,just as the phrase directly or indirectly makes clear that rico liability is not limited to those with a formal position in the enterprise but some part in directing the enterprise affairs is required.id.footnote omitted.
the operation or management test expresses this requirement in a formulation that is easy to apply.id.simply put,one is liable under rico only if he participated in the operation or management of the enterprise itself.azrielli cohen law offices,cir.in this circuit,the operation or management test typically has proven to be a relatively low hurdle for plaintiffs to clear,see,baisch gallina,cir de falco bernas,cir,especially at the pleading stage,united states allen,cir holding the question whether defendant operated or managed the affairs of an enterprise to be essentially one of fact ultimately,however,it is clear that the rico defendant must have played some part in directing the enterprise affairs.de falco,at see reves,at.with these precedents in mind,we turn to an examination of plaintiffs allegations with regard to afsar and sohrab respective roles in the conduct of the affairs of the bankruptcy estate enterprise 
we note as a preliminary matter that the distinction between the level of control afforded the bankruptcy debtor under chapter,as distinguished from that afforded under chapter,may be relevant to the rico analysis in some cases in contrast to the defendants in handeen,at,and int l,fed.appx.at,both of whom filed petitions under chapter,sohrab filed his bankruptcy petition under chapter.nonetheless,we think it fairly that,even in the chapter context,a debtor wields a significant degree of control over the conduct of the affairs of the estate.notably,in handeen,the eighth circuit found that navigat ing the estate through the bankruptcy system,creating sham debts to dilute the estate,preparing filings and schedules containing erroneous information,and participat ing in devising a scheme to conceal sources of income from the bankruptcy trustee all amounted to conducting or participating in the affairs of a chapter bankruptcy estate enterprise.at.many of these activities are analogous to actions that a chapter debtor would typically be involved in,at least to the extent of furnishing the necessary information to the trustee.in any event,here,the chapter dichotomy presents a distinction without a difference,at least with respect to sohrab,given the degree to which he sought to manipulate the estate,conceal assets,and misrepresent information to the trustee 
plaintiffs allege that sohrab participated in the conduct of the affairs of the bankruptcy estate enterprise through the following predicate acts 
transfer of his interests in tiburon and timberland to sphinx rock and satinwood 
transfer of his inheritance to afsar and to his brother,iradj 
july filing of a materially false bankruptcy petition 
assorted perjuries occurring at a creditors meeting,during rule examinations,and at a bankruptcy discharge proceeding and 
transfers,in relation to the bankruptcy estate enterprise,to his wife,and.
we find that plaintiffs have adequately alleged that sohrab conducted or participated in the conduct of the affairs of the bankruptcy estate enterprise.indeed,this conclusion seems almost unavoidable,given that even where the trustee must subpoena the debtor records,it is still the debtor who is the primary source of the most relevant information pertaining to the affairs of the estate.see,in re hyde.moreover,we find it difficult to envision a scenario in which a debtor such as sohrab,who was denied a discharge for bankruptcy fraud,could not be deemed to have played at least some part in directing the affairs of the bankruptcy estate.
with respect to afsar,plaintiffs alleged that she conducted or participated in the conduct of the affairs of the bankruptcy estate enterprise through the following acts 
monthly wire transfers to sohrab the money coming from the inheritance sohrab had previously transferred to afsar 
afsar receipt of assets from sohrab,a debtor who was allegedly intending to defeat the purpose of the bankruptcy code 
letter in response to a request by the bankruptcy court in which afsar falsely stated that she did not have in her possession,and would not turn over,any documents relating to soleyman estate 
affidavit in which afsar allegedly misrepresented soleyman as an iranian citizen and 
declarations made by afsar attorney russell mcrory that soleyman died without owning any assets.
it is clear that afsar was an outsider to the estate.nonetheless,outsiders who associate with an enterprise will be liable if they participate in the operation or management of the enterprise itself.to put it another way,outsiders,like all other people,will be liable under rico if their actions satisfy the operation or management test.handeen,at quoting reves,at.
here,plaintiffs as true,as they must a picture of a mother helping her son to defraud the bankruptcy court and trustee.we have concluded that where a bankruptcy estate is a rico enterprise,a debtor who engages in bankruptcy fraud conducts or participates in the conduct of the affairs of the enterprise thus,it is no great leap to find that one who assists in the fraud also conducts or participates in the conduct of the affairs of the enterprise.whoever commits an offense against the united states or aids,abets,counsels,commands,induces or procures its commission,is punishable as a principal.
in any event,because afsar liability is also premised on a rico conspiracy theory under count six,the standard we apply to her is even more relaxed t he requirements for rico conspiracy charges under d are less demanding a conspirator must intend to further an endeavor which,if completed,would satisfy all of the elements of a substantive criminal offense,but it suffices that she has adopted the goal of furthering or facilitating the criminal endeavor.baisch gallina,at cir quoting salinas united states,d.accordingly,we find that plaintiffs have afsar conducted or participated in the conduct of the affairs of the bankruptcy estate enterprise.
rico pattern 
next,we examine whether plaintiffs have adequately alleged a rico pattern.to survive defendants motion to dismiss the substantive rico count of the amended complaint count five,alleging a violation of c,plaintiffs must have alleged that they were injured by defendants conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.cofacredit,windsor plumbing supply,cir.for these purposes,a pattern of racketeering activity consists of at least two predicate acts of racketeering activity committed in a period,which amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity,cofacredit,at quoting,northwestern bell,d.here,as the district court concluded,the alleged predicate acts at the temporal extremes of the pattern alleged in the amended complaint were not pled with sufficient particularity,and,without those acts,the amended complaint fails to allege the requisite continuity to sustain a rico claim.
allegations of bankruptcy fraud,like all allegations of fraudulent predicate acts,are subject to the heightened pleading requirements of federal rule of civil procedure b.see moore painewebber,cir first nationwide bank gelt funding,cir.in addition to alleging the particular details of a fraud,the plaintiffs must allege facts that give rise to a strong inference of fraudulent intent,moore painewebber,at emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted accord acito imcera group,cir shields citytrust bancorp,cir.
here,plaintiffs have failed to allege facts that yield a strong inference that,in,sohrab transferred his interests in timberland and tiburon in contemplation of bankruptcy,as requires.those transfers,as well as the alleged transfers of cash from sohrab to soleyman,occurred nearly two years before sohrab filed for bankruptcy and before the judgments were entered against sohrab that would motivate him to conceal his assets.thus,these acts do not support the required strong inference of fraudulent intent.
in contrast,a debtor who has deliberately transferred assets a year and a day prior to filing a petition has clearly engaged in a attempt to avoid the preference rule.see,united states dandy,cir.similarly,a debtor who has followed a course of conduct that inevitably leads to bankruptcy is fairly presumed to have perpetrated a fraudulent scheme.see,united states tashjian,cir united states ciampaglia,cir.a review of these and other representative cases in which intent was properly inferred,however,makes clear that the conduct of the bankruptcy debtors in those cases is plainly distinguishable from the alleged fraudulent acts of sohrab in.in sum,the amended complaint,read as a whole,fails to provide support for a strong inference that sohrab intended to defeat the provisions of the bankruptcy code in,and,therefore,the allegations concerning the transfers do not adequately plead a predicate act of bankruptcy fraud.
as to the alleged predicate acts at the other temporal transfer of his inheritance to afsar in early,and her transfer of funds back to him over the next two have failed to plead with sufficient particularity the circumstances constituting bankruptcy fraud.see.b.the amended complaint fails to explain either how or when sohrab received assets from soleyman,what those assets were,or how or when sohrab conveyed or concealed assets in contemplation of bankruptcy.moreover,there is nothing in the record to support the allegation that when afsar wired monies to sohrab,she was sending him his own assets in an effort to help him conceal them,rather than sending him gifts of money like those that she routinely sent to sohrab siblings during the same period.
in seeking to excuse these deficiencies,plaintiffs misconstrue the exceptions to rule b.although it is true that matters peculiarly within a defendant knowledge may be pled on information and belief,this does not mean that those matters may be pled lacking any detail at all see divittorio equidyne extractive,cir t he allegations must be accompanied by a statement of the facts upon which the belief is based.nor do allegations of motive and opportunity alone suffice.while the requisite intent of the alleged perpetrator of the fraud need not be alleged with great specificity,the actual fraud alleged must be stated with particularity.wight bankamerica,cir internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,we are hindered in our efforts to draw reasonable inferences in plaintiffs favor,because we can not understand why sohrab relatives would secretly agree to disclaim their interest in soleyman estate only so that was supposedly contemplating bankruptcy at the then convey the assets back to afsar,who would then transfer money back to sohrab.lacking both particularity and rationality,these allegations likewise fail to allege predicate acts adequately.
thus,the only remaining alleged predicate acts are those allegedly committed by sohrab between april and october 
t he properly pled predicate acts allegedly committed by sohrab consist of a handful of transfers in contemplation of bankruptcy in a period immediately prior to the filing of his petition on july,the filing of a materially false bankruptcy petition,perjuring himself at a september,meeting of his creditors and a bankruptcy rule examination on september,submitting a false affidavit regarding certain trust property on june,during the course of discovery in the adversary proceeding,and perjuring himself at trial in the a dversary p roceeding in october.
and those allegedly committed by afsar between march and september,
t he properly pled predicate acts allegedly committed by afsar allegedly were committed between march and september,solely in connection with the adversary proceeding.they consisted of acts of mail fraud and misrepresentations to the bankruptcy court,purportedly designed to stonewall p laintiffs discovery efforts.
fcam iii,d at footnotes omitted.we agree with the district court that these acts do not amount to a pattern of racketeering activity.
a plaintiff in a rico action must allege either an pattern of racketeering activity,past criminal conduct coupled with a threat of future criminal conduct or a pattern of racketeering activity,past criminal conduct extending over a substantial period of time.gicc capital tech.fin.group,cir internal quotation marks omitted.to satisfy continuity,the plaintiff need not show that the predicates extended over a substantial period of time but must show that there was a threat of continuing criminal activity beyond the period during which the predicate acts were performed.cofacredit,at.in analyzing the issue of continuity,assuming arguendo that the alleged predicate acts constituting the pattern were adequately pled,we evaluate the rico allegations with respect to each defendant individually.see de falco bernas,at,cir united states persico,cir.
here,the nature of sohrab and afsar alleged scheme to defraud sohrab creditors does not impl y a threat of continued criminal activity.cofacredit,at.unlike,for example,organized crime,see,united states minicone,cir indelicato,at,sohrab and afsar alleged bankruptcy fraud was inherently terminable,gicc,at emphasis omitted once sohrab had fraudulently conveyed his assets,which he allegedly accomplished by july,when he filed for bankruptcy,the scheme essentially came to its conclusion.see cofacredit,at.thus,here,as in gicc,it defies logic to suggest that a threat of continued looting activity exists when,as plaintiffs admit,there is nothing left to loot.at.
notwithstanding the fact that sohrab bankruptcy case appears to remains open,see fcam iii,d at,and that predicate acts of perjury and mail fraud continued for some time after sohrab filed his bankruptcy petition,no predicate acts have occurred since december,which suggests that the scheme has wound to a close.in any event,even if it has not,continued silent concealment of assets is not a predicate act.see thai airways int l united aviation leasing,aff,cir per curiam.thus,assuming arguendo that the alleged predicate acts set forth above were adequately pled,and evaluating the rico allegations with respect to each defendant individually,see de falco,at,persico,at,we conclude that the alleged predicate acts do not amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity,at,and,accordingly,that the amended complaint fails to allege an pattern of racketeering activity.
a pattern of racketeering activity involves predicate acts extending over a substantial period of time.gicc,at internal quotation marks omitted.notably,this court has never found a pattern where the predicate acts spanned fewer than two years.see fcam i,d at nn.mason tenders dist.council pension fund messera,wl at,dist.lex
