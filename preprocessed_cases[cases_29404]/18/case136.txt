this commercial dispute concerns a failed attempt by the plaintiff,interstate litho corporation,to acquire printing presses from a broker,defendant marc brown,doing business as integra technical services.trial resulted in a jury verdict against interstate on its claims for return of a portion of its deposit from the seller of one press,defendant freidel manufacturing,and for brown on his counterclaims seeking lost profits on the deal.on appeal,interstate argues that brown lacked the capacity to sue because integra had been dissolved at the time of the transactions at issue the purported contract with brown for purchase of the presses was invalid its deposit to secure the presses was refundable and the award of lost profits resulted from flawed jury instructions and was not supported by the evidence.we affirm the judgment,and we grant freidel motion,but deny brown motion,for attorney fees and double costs against interstate.
in,interstate litho corporation engaged in negotiations with marc brown,a broker in used printing equipment,and his company,integra technical services,concerning interstate potential acquisition of two used printing presses.one press,an eight color press,was owned by freidel manufacturing,of illinois the other,a four color press,was owned by graphic engineering and located in malaysia.the two presses were to be refurbished in rhode island by smith associates to interstate specifications.
several proposals were prepared,and finally a proposal reflecting a million price was signed by henry becker,interstate president,on august.at brown instructions,interstate advanced a deposit to ensure that the presses would be held.fifty thousand dollars of the deposit was wired to freidel on august,to secure the eight color press the remaining was sent to brown in his capacity as integra principal of which was forwarded to john dulla,a broker assisting brown with the purchase of a second press,the remainder staying with brown.freidel pulled the eight color press off the market,turning away other prospective buyers.on september,brown signed a contract to buy the eight color press from freidel.however,brown never purchased the press from freidel because the deal with interstate fell apart.freidel retained the deposit and eventually sold the press for less than it would have received from brown 
interstate then sued brown,integra,and freidel,seeking the return of its deposit.integra counterclaimed for its lost commissions and profits on the deal,asserting claims against interstate for breach of contract,fraud,and violation of.laws ch.for summary judgment were filed by the parties.brown argued that interstate had failed to provide evidence to allow a jury to pierce the corporate veil and hold him personally liable as an officer of integra.brown asserted that at all times he had acted in his representative capacity as an agent of integra and that nothing in the record indicated otherwise.interstate initially opposed brown summary judgment motion on the grounds that there was sufficient evidence that brown,as integra only shareholder,officer,and director,had pervasive control over the corporation,and that brown maintained no separation between the corporation and his home,where the corporation exclusively operated.
interstate subsequently learned that integra had been dissolved by the state of new hampshire as of november,for failure to file reports and pay necessary fees.interstate argued that because brown had held himself out and solicited business under integra name after the corporation had been dissolved,brown was personally liable as to interstate claims against integra.interstate also maintained that integra had no capacity to assert any counterclaims against it.
in response,brown sought leave to amend his counterclaims and substitute himself personally for integra as the real party in interest brown recalled receiving letters from the corporate division of new hampshire department of state,but believed he had taken the necessary steps to prevent dissolution.he said that he was not aware of integra dissolution at the time of the transactions at issue and did not learn about the dissolution until interstate raised the issue on summary judgment.
the district court denied all the summary judgment motions as well as brown motion to amend and substitute himself personally for integra.however,upon motion for reconsideration,the court allowed brown motion to amend and substitute himself as the real party in interest.
at trial,interstate principal claim was that becker had not signed the purported contract for the sale of the presses.there was a battle of handwriting experts,and the jury rejected interstate suggestion that becker signature had been forged.answering three special interrogatories,the jury rejected interstate claim for the return of the deposit and awarded brown on his counterclaim the portion of the deposit thus remained with freidel.specifically,the jury determined that marc brown integra and interstate litho did not form a contract providing that monies paid by interstate as a deposit were refundable freidel did not have money in its hands belonging to interstate that in equity and good conscience it ought to pay back to interstate and interstate was in breach of its contract with brown for the sale of two printing presses.interstate motion for a new trial was denied.
interstate appeals,raising a plethora of arguments,many addressed to the district court and rulings most of those issues are subsumed into the contract questions submitted to the jury interstate initially makes related arguments as to capacity to sue that brown should not have been substituted for integra as a counterclaim plaintiff and that there was no valid and enforceable contract between brown and interstate because integra dissolution rendered any subsequent contract with interstate void.interstate also argues that there was no enforceable contract because the purported august,proposal signed by not contain the contract essential terms,failed to comply with the statute of frauds,and could not have been performed by brown.in addition,interstate maintains that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to reject its claim for return of its deposit.
as to damages,interstate argues that brown damage award can not stand because it was based on speculation,not facts in evidence,and because the district court failed to properly instruct the jury in this regard.
freidel has filed a motion for attorney fees and double costs on the ground that interstate appeal was frivolous.brown has filed a similar motion.interstate has filed oppositions to both motions.
the parties agree that massachusetts law applies.
capacity to sue 
interstate on appeal makes a series of arguments about capacity to sue.in doing so,it confuses two issues.the first issue is whether the district court abused its discretion by allowing the motion to amend in order to substitute brown for integra.the second issue is whether,given that the amendment was allowed,brown properly stood in integra shoes as a matter of fact.as to the second issue,it has been waived because interstate failed to make it an issue before the jury.
on the first issue,we review the allowance or denial of motions to amend the pleadings for abuse of discretion.see ruiz posadas de san juan,cir resolution trust gold,cir motions for leave to amend shall be freely given when justice so requires.a see also resolution trust,at leave to amend is to be freely given,unless it would be futile,or reward,inter alia,undue or intended delay.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.here,brown sought to substitute himself personally for integra on the ground that he was the real party in interest,integra having been dissolved by operation of law before the events in issue.see.a every action shall be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest.brown maintained that at all times relevant he was integra sole officer,employee,and shareholder,and that he participated personally and directly in all transactions with interstate.
the district court had before it conflicting accounts of the events surrounding integra dissolution.interstate said brown knew or should have known that integra had already been dissolved for almost two years when it entered into discussions about the presses brown claimed that he believed integra had complied with new hampshire requirements on reporting and filing fees,and that he was a real party in interest.the court could easily have concluded that brown had more than a colorable claim,and it had evidentiary support for that conclusion.as a counterclaim plaintiff,brown appeared to have the requisite stake.see seckler star,cir in order for plaintiff to demonstrate that he is a real party in interest,he must allege facts sufficient to reveal that he suffered an injury,that the injury was caused by the defendant illegal conduct,and that his injury could be redressed by a favorable outcome to the lawsuit.
brown also was substituted as a defendant,and this benefitted interstate interstate now had a live person,and not a defunct corporation,to answer for any judgment it obtained.interstate attacks the allowance of the substitution motion,but it does not identify any prejudice resulting from that decision.indeed,interstate trial preparation on the merits issues could hardly have been much different given its view,expressed in its opposition to brown motion for summary judgment,that brown was integra alter ego.the trial court properly concluded that it was in the interests of justice for brown to be substituted as the formal party in the pleadings.see.advisory committee note amendment modern decisions are inclined to be lenient when an honest mistake has been made in choosing the party in whose name the action is to be filed.
following the district court decision to allow brown motion to amend and substitute,any questions as to whether brown was indeed a proper party to the purported contract with interstate were questions of fact for the jury.see assocs.discount haynes garage,question of who contracting parties were is question of fact citing lunn sweet wolfman.if,after the substitution,interstate wanted to challenge brown capacity to sue or raise any issue of fraudulent concealment by brown of integra dissolved status,it should have done so before the jury.interstate did not.rather,its focus at trial was solely on other matters contesting brown claim that becker had signed the august,proposal trying to prove the deposit was refundable and challenging brown own claims for damages interstate may not now pursue these claims about capacity to sue on appeal.
brown counterclaim for breach of contract 
interstate challenges the jury verdict on brown counterclaims for breach of contract to purchase the two presses.there could be no contract between interstate and brown integra as a matter of law,interstate argues because 
the essential terms were missing from the purported august,proposal.
the proposal did not satisfy the statute of frauds.
the proposal was invalid because brown was incapable of delivering the two presses.
interstate also seeks the return of its deposit,arguing that there was an express oral agreement with brown that the deposit was refundable.in addition,interstate argues that freidel should return the portion of the deposit it retained under the law of equity and unjust enrichment.the trial court erred,interstate says,in not granting it judgment as a matter of law at the close of evidence and after the jury verdict.see.b 
this court reviews de novo the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law using the same standard applied by the trial court.andrade jamestown hous,cir.such motion may be granted only if the evidence,viewed from the perspective most favorable to the,is so that the movant is plainly entitled to judgment,for reasonable minds could not differ as to the outcome.fhs props.bc,cir quoting gibson city of cranston,cir.
essential terms of contract were provided 
the evidence was such that whether the august,proposal contained the essential terms of a contract was an issue of fact for the jury.the writing between the parties identified in detail the two presses being purchased,identified a total price for purchasing and reworking the presses million,with of this amount allocated to acquiring the two presses,and set forth a detailed delivery and payment schedule.
interstate argues,inter alia,that the proposal neither states that it is a final agreement for purchase of the two presses by interstate from integra nor provides in specific terms the completion date for refurbishment of the presses.however,i t is not required that all terms of the agreement be precisely specified,and the presence of undefined or unspecified terms will not necessarily preclude the formation of a binding contract.situation mgmt.malouf.here,the terms of the include nine pages of detail on matters such as rollers and hangers,plate and blanket cylinders,and ink sufficient for the jury to find that interstate had agreed to purchase the two presses.that interstate wired to freidel and to brown to hold the presses on august,just a few days after signing the proposal,further supports the existence of a firm agreement between the parties.we can not conclude as a matter of law that this contract lacked essential terms.
statute of frauds 
interstate argues that the proposal does not satisfy the massachusetts statute of frauds.laws ch,because the august,proposal,though a writing,describes only the remanufacturing portion of the deal,and not the terms of the actual purchase of the two presses by integra,for subsequent sale to interstate.there was,however,no reason the proposal had to describe the details of brown own purchase of the eight color press from freidel or the four color press from malaysia.indeed,the important questions for a buyer like interstate would,presumably,have centered on whether the refurbished presses met its needs and specifications,and not on the background details of how the broker brown obtained those presses from third parties.as brown himself testified,his initial acquisition of the presses was accomplished through transactions separate and distinct from the sale of the refurbished presses to interstate.thus the issue,properly presented to the jury,was whether the august,proposal constituted an agreement by interstate to purchase the two presses from brown.the jury found that it did,and so the proposal was a writing in satisfaction of the statute of frauds.
brown could have delivered the two presses 
interstate also challenges the validity of the contract on the ground that brown was incapable of delivering the two presses when interstate signed the august,proposal.see doyle hasbro,cir plaintiff must be ready,willing,and able to perform to sustain breach of contract claim singarella city of boston.again,this issue was for the jury.
interstate argues that there was no evidence of any agreement to purchase the four color press from malaysia,that integra had not yet entered into an agreement to purchase the eight color press from freidel,and that integra had not entered into any agreement with smith for refurbishing the two presses.in fact,there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that a deal was in the works and that brown could have delivered the two refurbished presses to interstate.brown testified to his extensive efforts to locate and hold the presses,one of which had already been secured from freidel hence the need for the deposit.dulla testified about his efforts to obtain a second press in malaysia,which was corroborated by his correspondence with the owner of the malaysian press about price,shipping arrangements,and the like.brown also testified that he had a verbal agreement with smith to refurbish the two presses to interstate specifications,based on discussions and meetings with representatives of smith and interstate.brown did not need fully executed written contracts with each of the parties he was dealing with on the interstate project.indeed,there was evidence that it was customary not to have such contracts in these types of deals.whether brown could have performed under the contract was for the jury to decide.
whether the deposit was refundable 
interstate seeks the return of its deposit,arguing
