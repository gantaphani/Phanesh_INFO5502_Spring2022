in compliance therewith,cook provided with both a verbal and written notice of her intent to renew her franchise rights in august.did not immediately advise cook that renewal would be forthcoming,but on april,provided cook with a copy of the franchise offering circular.shortly after receiving the circular,cook tendered to a check in the amount of,twice the amount required to renew her franchise agreement.on may,responded with a letter to cook expressing its concerns about the renewal of cook subfranchise rights due to her failure to meet the sales associate quota required in the agreement.under the agreement cook had been required to retain a minimum of five sales associates in her office by may.cook,however,was the only sales associate operating out of that location throughout the term of the agreement.despite these concerns,nevertheless offered to extend the term of the agreement for six months in order that it might ascertain whether cook was willing and able to comply with the sales associate quota.
on november,issued cook a notice of default because she had failed to hire the requisite number of sales associates under the agreement.in the notice of default,expressed its intention not to re new her agreement unless she cured her default by expanding her office and hiring the requisite number of sales associates before january.in order that she might comply with the sales associate quota,cook hired several family members though none of them had ever been a member of the milwaukee metro multiple listing service despite cook questionable hires,accepted her identification of the sales associates and began the renewal process.because had not yet completed its franchise offering circular it allowed cook to operate her franchise on a basis under the terms of the franchise agreement until had completed the circular.

shortly after and cook concluded their negotiations,provided cook with copies of the franchise agreement for her to execute.by november,more than six weeks after the agreement had been forwarded to cook,cook still had not signed it.inquired of cook in writing,asking her if her delay in signing the franchise renewal agreement meant that she did not wish to renew her franchise rights.cook responded to inquiry by returning the agreement on or about november.but instead of executing the negotiated agreement forwarded to her,cook unilaterally altered the term dealing with the required number of sales associates.even though the parties had previously agreed that the agreement would require cook to employ five sales associates,cook instead suggested that she only be required to retain two,a suggestion that had previously rejected during negotiations.declined to accept cook proposed changes,and informed her that,unless she executed the agreement by december,as the parties had negotiated it,it would be forced to conclude that she was not interested in renewing her franchise.
on january,still awaiting a response from cook,placed cook franchise agreement in default,provided her with days notice of termination.the notice of termination gave cook a day period,beginning on january,within which to cure the default by completing the renewal requirements.in the letter,explained that the agreement expired on march,and would be replaced with the agreement.provided cook with two options to cure her her franchise rights under the agreement by signing and returning it before march or renew her franchise rights under the agreement if she chose to do so after march.
