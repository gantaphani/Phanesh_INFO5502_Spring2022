plaintiffs claim they were fraudulently induced to sell their ownership interests in a company they with one of the defendants,and to release defendants from claims arising out of that ownership.we affirm the appellate division determination that this action is barred by the release.
plaintiffs centro empresarial cempresa centro and conecel holding limited chl allege they once owned substantial shares of an ecuadorian telecommunications company,defendant consorcio ecuatoriano de telecomunicaciones conecel conecel.the complaint alleges that,in,they approached defendant carlos slim helú slim,the moving force behind defendant teléfonos de méxico,de telmex méxico,which owned defendant amx ecuador llc,then known as telmex wireless llc telmex,about the possibility of telmex investing in conecel.
through a master agreement executed in march,telmex obtained a indirect interest in conecel,while plaintiffs each retained a minority interest,all held through a new entity,defendant telmex wireless ecuador llc twe.in exchange for its interest,telmex contributed million to twe and paid chl million to cancel conecel debts.the parties simultaneously entered into various other agreements.under the llc agreement,the members of twe agreed that telmex would manage accounting,tax,and for twe,and that twe would provide quarterly financial statements to all its members.in the agreement among members,the members of twe agreed that if telmex ever consolidated or rolled up its latin american telecommunications interests into a single entity for purposes of selling the equity securities of such entity in international capital markets at a time when plaintiffs owned or more of twe,plaintiffs could negotiate in good faith for a period not to exceed days to exchange their twe units for equity shares in the new company at a mutually satisfactory rate of exchange.the agreement also stated that,prior to any,telmex and twe would provide financial,accounting and legal information with respect to conecel and twe as may reasonably be requested.a fourth agreement,the put agreement,gave plaintiffs the right to require telmex to purchase plaintiffs twe units at a set floor price during three separate day periods between march and march.plaintiffs could exercise these put options for up to percent of their units during the period up to percent during the period and up to percent during the period.
in september,telmex mexico formed defendant américa móvil,de américa móvil,which became the holding company for several entities,including twe.plaintiffs allege that,under the agreement among members,this triggered their right to negotiate an exchange of their twe units for shares in américa móvil.they allege that in march they asked defendant daniel hajj aboumrad hajj,slim and ceo of américa móvil,for financial information about conecel and twe for use in the contemplated negotiations.plaintiffs assert that they never received the information,despite repeated requests.they also allege that throughout hajj falsely represented that conecel was financially weak and had not generated any profits to distribute to twe.
at this point,the complaint states,plaintiffs were,wary of the threat that defendants would never negotiate in good faith and would never distribute the conecel profits as agreed.thus left with no practical alternative,plaintiffs exercised the first put option in march and sold telmex percent of their twe units,the maximum number allowed in the first day period,for which the put agreement entitled them to over million.over the next year,plaintiffs allege that they repeatedly attempted to open exchange negotiations,but defendants refused to negotiate.in,defendants provided conecel balance sheet,which indicated that the company was not doing well,and made further representations to that effect.
in,telmex offered to purchase plaintiffs remaining units at the floor price,and plaintiffs allegedly relying on the false financial information agreed,entitling them to additional substantial consideration.in july,plaintiffs entered a purchase agreement with américa móvil,am wireless,llc formerly telmex,and wireless equador,llc formerly twe.the parties executed various releases in connection with the sale.in the release for agreement among members members release,the sellers released telmex and its affiliates,shareholders,and agents from,
all manner of actions,causes of action,suits,debts,dues,sums of money,accounts,reckonings,bonds,bills,specialties,covenants,contracts,controversies,agreements,promises,variances,trespasses,damages,judgments,extents,executions,claims and demands,liability,whatsoever,in law or equity,whether past,present or future,actual or contingent,arising under or in connection with the agreement among members arising out of,based upon,attributable to or resulting from the ownership of membership interests in twe or having taken or failed to take any action in any capacity on behalf of twe or in connection with the business of twe.
a second release,the release for master agreement master release,employed nearly identical language,but added a proviso.it released the parties from claims,
relating to a the ownership by the telmex released parties of the twe units,or b any matter arising under or in connection with the master agreement,or any other document,agreement,instrument related thereto or executed in connection therewith provided that the foregoing release shall not release any claims involving fraud.
in june,plaintiffs commenced this action against telmex mexico and several of its affiliates américa móvil,amx ecuador formerly telmex,wireless ecuador llc formerly twe,conecel,slim,and hajj.the complaint asserts causes of action for,among other things,breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,fraud,and unjust enrichment.the crux of plaintiffs claim is that defendants failed to provide them with accurate tax and financial statements for conecel and were unwilling to negotiate in good faith for a share exchange.plaintiffs allege that they only discovered that defendants supplied them with fraudulent information in,after the ecuadorean government audited conecel and released the results.they seek a minimum of in damages the amount they claim they would have made if a good faith share exchange had been accomplished under the terms of the members agreement plus interest.
defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on several grounds,including that a defense is founded on documentary evidence see cplr a and the action is barred by a release see cplr a.supreme court,ruling from the bench,denied the motion.
the appellate division reversed and granted the motion to dismiss,holding that plaintiffs claims,are barred by the general release they granted defendants in connection with the sale of their interest centro américa móvil,dept.after finding that the release includes any claim possibly to be discovered in the future that defendants had misrepresented the value of conecel id.at,the court concluded that the release was not fraudulently induced,since plaintiffs failed to allege any fraud separate and distinct from that contemplated by the release id.at.that telmex,as the majority shareholder,owed plaintiffs a fiduciary duty did not alter the court analysis.further,the court noted,plaintiffs were allegedly aware that they lacked a full picture of conecel internal finances and that the relationship between the parties had become adversarial,yet they failed to condition the release on the truth of the information supplied by defendants,obtain representations or warranties to that effect,or insist on viewing additional information.
two justices dissented on the ground that the release was fraudulently induced,since plaintiffs did not realize the depths of the alleged fraud and a fiduciary can not be released from liability unless it has fully disclosed its tortious conduct see id.at catterson,dissenting.the dissent emphasized that the complaint does not allege that plaintiffs had knowledge of defendants fraud,and plaintiffs were reasonably justified in their expectations that the defendants,as fiduciaries,would disclose any information in their possession that might affect plaintiffs decision on their best course of action id.at.moreover,in the dissent view,the release did not mention or contemplate fraud claims id.at.plaintiffs appealed as of right pursuant to cplr a.
plaintiffs argue that,as the appellate division dissent found,the members release was not intended to reach fraud claims.they further contend that the release itself was fraudulently induced,particularly in light of the parties fiduciary relationship,and that their reliance on defendants financial disclosures was justified.
generally,a valid release constitutes a complete bar to an action on a claim which is the subject of the release global minerals holme,dept.if the language of a release is clear and unambiguous,the signing of a release is a jural act binding on the parties booth delaware,quoting mangini mcclurg.a release should never be converted into a starting point for litigation except under circumstances and under rules which would render any other result a grave injustice mangini,at.a release may be invalidated,however,for any of the the traditional bases for setting aside written agreements,namely,duress,illegality,fraud,or mutual mistake id.
although a defendant has the initial burden of establishing that it has been released from any claims,a signed release shifts the burden of going forward to the plaintiff to show that there has been fraud,duress or some other fact which will be sufficient to void the release fleming ponziani.a plaintiff seeking to invalidate a release due to fraudulent inducement must establish the basic elements of fraud,namely a representation of material fact,the falsity of that representation,knowledge by the party who made the representation that it was false when made,justifiable reliance by the plaintiff,and resulting injury global minerals,at.
notably,a release may encompass unknown claims,including unknown fraud claims,if the parties so intend and the agreement is fairly and knowingly made mangini,at alleghany kirby.as the appellate division majority explained below centro,at,a party that releases a fraud claim may later challenge that release as fraudulently induced only if it can identify a separate fraud from the subject of the release see bellefonte reinsurance v argonaut ins.were this not the case,no party could ever settle a fraud claim with any finality.
as a preliminary matter,the parties here debate whether the members release encompasses unknown fraud claims.we find that it does.the broad language of the release reaches,all manner of actions whatsoever whether past,present or future,actual or contingent,arising under or in connection with the agreement among members arising out of the ownership of membership interests in twe.the phrase all manner of actions,in conjunction with the reference to future and contingent actions indicates an intent to release defendants from fraud claims,like this one,unknown at the time of contract see ingram v ray mcdermott,consorcio prodipe,de v cinci,f supp,sd.
plaintiffs note that the master release,executed at the same time as the members release,is substantially similar but expressly excludes fraud claims.they argue apparently for the first time in their briefs before us that the fraud exception in the master release should be read into the members release.even assuming we can reach this argument see soho alliance v new york city bd.of stds.and appeals,courts should be extremely reluctant to interpret an agreement as impliedly stating something which the parties have neglected to specifically include rowe great atl.pac.tea.we see no reason to import the master release express statement into the members release.if anything,the explicit exclusion of fraud claims from the master release suggests that the members release is not so limited.plaintiffs claims are either brought under the agreement among members,under which telmex agreed to negotiate in good faith and provide conecel and twe financial information,or otherwise arise out of their ownership of membership interests in twe.they therefore fall under the members release.
having executed this release,plaintiffs can not now claim that defendants fraudulently misled them regarding the value of their ownership interests in twe unless the release was itself induced by a separate fraud.the fraud described in the complaint,however,falls squarely within the scope of the release plaintiffs allege that defendants supplied them with false financial information regarding the value of conecel and twe,and that,based on this false information,plaintiffs sold their interests in twe and released defendants from claims in connection with that sale.thus,as the appellate division observed plaintiffs seek to convert the release into a starting point for new litigation,essentially asking to be relieved of the release on the ground that they did not realize the true value of the claims they were giving up centro,at.
that the parties had a fiduciary relationship does not alter our conclusion.it is true that telmex,as a majority shareholder in a closely held corporation,owed a fiduciary duty to plaintiffs,minority shareholders see fender prescott.telmex was therefore required to disclose any information that could reasonably bear on plaintiffs consideration of its purchase offer dubbs stribling.
a sophisticated principal is able to release its fiduciary from claims at least where,as here,the fiduciary relationship is no longer one of unquestioning trust so long as the principal understands that the fiduciary is acting in its own interest and the release is knowingly entered into see alleghany,at there is no prerequisite to the settlement of a fraud case that the fiduciary defendant must come forward and confess to all his wrongful acts in connection with the subject matter consorcio prodipe,de,f supp at.to the extent that appellate division decisions such as littman magee,dept,blue chip emerald allied partners,dept,and collections kolber,dept suggest otherwise,they misapprehend our case law.plaintiffs here are large corporations engaged in complex transactions in which they were advised by counsel.as sophisticated entities,they negotiated and executed an extraordinarily broad release with their eyes wide open.they can not now invalidate that release by claiming ignorance of the depth of their fiduciary misconduct.
in addition to failing to allege that the release was induced by a separate fraud,plaintiffs have failed to allege that they justifiably relied on defendants fraudulent statements in executing the release.as we recently reiterated 
if the facts represented are not matters peculiarly within the party knowledge,and the other party has the means available to him of knowing,by the exercise of ordinary intelligence,the truth or the real quality of the subject of the representation,he must make use of those means,or he will not be heard to complain that he was induced to enter into the transaction by misrepresentations ddj,llc rhone group,quoting schumaker mather.
here,according to the facts alleged in the complaint,plaintiffs knew that defendants had not supplied them with the financial information necessary to properly value the twe units,and that they were entitled to that information.yet they chose to cash out their interests and release defendants from fraud claims without demanding either access to the information or assurances as to its accuracy in the form of representations and warranties.in short,this is an instance where plaintiffs have been so lax in protecting themselves that they can not fairly ask for the law protection id.at.
in certain circumstances,a fiduciary disclosure obligations might effectively operate like a written representation that no material facts are undisclosed,and this might satisfy a principal obligation to investigate further see id.at.where a principal and fiduciary are sophisticated parties engaged in negotiations to terminate their relationship,however,the principal can not blindly trust the fiduciary assertions.this is particularly true where,as alleged here,the principal has actual knowledge that its fiduciary is not being entirely forthright w hen the party to whom a mi
