appellant,mark willis willis,brought this appeal asking this court to reverse the district court granting of summary judgment in favor of appellee,national union fire insurance company of pittsburgh,pa national union.the district court found that willis was not entitled to coverage under a directors,officers,and corporate liability insurance policy issued by national union to equalnet communications corporation equalnet of which willis was an officer.we affirm.
background 
national union brought an action against willis,who was an officer and director of equalnet,seeking a declaratory judgment that willis was not entitled to coverage under any of three directors,officers,and corporate liability insurance policies issued by national union to equalnet.the first policy covered the time period of march,to march,policy.the second policy covered the time period of march,to march,policy.the third policy covered the time period of march,to march,policy.equalnet intervened.
a united states magistrate judge granted summary judgment in favor of national union.furthermore,the district court granted national union motion to dismiss willis counterclaims for liability.thereafter,equalnet dismissed its intervention and is not a party to the present appeal.
this appeal stems from a cause of action brought by cyberserve,wshs enterprises,and william stuart collectively cyberserve on september,against equalnet,netco acquisition,willis,and willis group in the district court of harris county,texas.the action asserted claims against willis for fraud,fraud in the inducement,statutory fraud in a stock transaction,tortious interference with a contract,and conspiracy.in addition,claims for breach of contract and quantum meruit were alleged against equalnet and the willis group.the plaintiffs filed their fourth amended petition in march,adding a claim for negligent misrepresentation against willis,the willis group,and equalnet.the added negligent misrepresentation claim was based on the same alleged misrepresentations underlying the fraud,fraudulent inducement,and statutory fraud claims.furthermore,the factual basis of the fourth amended petition was the same as that used in the original petition.
notably,national union was first notified of the lawsuit by equalnet on february.the first time willis notified national union of the lawsuit was by letter dated may.national union denied coverage and declined to advance defense costs to willis because,in accordance with paragraph of the policies,the claims were not timely reported.willis and equalnet did not dispute that they failed to notify national union of the cyberserve lawsuit during the policy period.willis,however,argued that he was not required to give notice of a lawsuit unless a claim asserted against him was covered by the terms of the policy.
therefore,willis asserted that he was not required to notify national union until after the fourth amended petition was filed in march.the three previously amended petitions,according to willis,asserted intentional torts that fell within the policy exclusion for claims arising out of,based upon,or attributable to the committing in fact of any criminal or deliberate fraudulent act.as a result,willis claimed that his may,notification to national union was timely to provide coverage under the policy.
the district court determined that willis was not entitled to coverage under any of the three policies and granted summary judgment in favor of national union.the court concluded that willis should have given notice to national union in when he was first made aware of circumstances that could reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim against him.national fire ins.willis,d.in addition,the court concluded that the claims made in the fourth amended petition were expressly excluded from the coverage of the policy because they allege,arise out of,are based upon,or are attributable to a pending or prior litigation or allege or derive from the same or essentially the same facts as alleged in such pending litigation.id.willis now appeals the district court decision.

discussion 
the issue before this court is whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of national union having found that willis failed to provide timely notice of the claims or potential claims asserted against him as required by his insurance policy.this court has clearly identified that texas law requires an insurance policy to be construed against the insurer and in favor of the insured.see lubbock county hosp.dist.national union fire ins.co,cir national union fire ins.hudson energy,blaylock american guarantee bank liab.ins.as a result,an insurance policy exceptions and limitations are construed in favor of the insured in order to avoid exclusion of coverage.puckett fire ins.furthermore,when interpreting an insurance policy,courts must consider that the primary goal is to give effect to the written expression of the parties intent.balandran safeco ins.of.in so doing,courts are to ensure the policy is interpreted in such a way as to give effect to each term in the contract so that none will be rendered meaningless.lynch props.potomac ins,cir,highlands ins.in addition,all provisions of the policy should be considered with reference to the whole contract so that no provision is controlling.state farm life ins.beaston.

willis contentions 
willis argues that he is entitled to coverage under the policy for the negligent misrepresentation claim made against him in april when cyberserve and the other plaintiffs in the underlying lawsuit filed their fourth amended petition.willis first complains that the district court ruling was erroneous because it misconstrued the applicable notice provisions under section c of the policy.see willis,d at.section c provides 
c if during the policy period or during the discovery period if applicable the company or the insureds shall become aware of any circumstances which may reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim being made against the insureds and shall give written notice to the insurer of the circumstances and the reasons for anticipating such a claim,with full particulars as to dates,persons,and entities invoked,then any claim which is subsequently made against the insureds and reported to the insurer alleging,arising out of,based upon or attributable to such circumstances or alleging any wrongful act which is the same as or related to any wrongful act alleged or contained in such circumstances,shall be considered made at the time such notice of such circumstances was given.
according to willis,requiring the insured to give notice of circumstances likely to give rise to a claim ignores the plain language of the insurance policy notice requirement.willis contends that the applicable provision permitted but did not require willis to give notice of any circumstances which might reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim being made against him that had not yet resulted in a claim that is covered by the policies.
second,willis argues that the district court misconstrued the scope of the policy exclusions concerning pending litigation.the district court held that the negligent misrepresentation claims asserted in
