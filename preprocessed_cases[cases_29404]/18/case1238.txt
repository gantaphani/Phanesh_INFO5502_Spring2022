the government appeals the court of federal claims judgment that the internal revenue service irs administrative adjustment of plaintiffs partnership return was.grapevine imports,united states,fed.cl.the question is whether administrative adjustments in these circumstances are governed by the normal statute of limitations,or whether they are controlled by a special limitations period.
the tax code gives the irs six years instead of three to adjust a return when the return omits some item that should have been included in gross income.here,the plaintiffs are accused of overstating their basis in certain capital assets via a tax shelter,and thus understating income from those assets sale.the government argues that basis overstatement is an omission from gross income sufficient to trigger the extended limitations period.plaintiffs contend that it is not.
the court of federal claims judgment relied on the supreme court opinion in colony,commissioner of internal revenue.in colony,the supreme court reviewed the precursor limitations statute and held that overstatement of basis was not an omission from gross income,and so did not trigger the extended limitations period.following that precedent,the court of federal claims granted judgment to plaintiffs.in a separate case on similar facts,another panel of this court reached the same conclusion.salman ranch united states.
in the months following,the department of the treasury issued new regulations disputing the reasoning applied by the court of federal claims,stating that the colony decision did not conclusively resolve the statute interpretation,and holding that the limitations the government six years to bring claims of this type.
because we hold that the new treasury regulations are entitled to deference in interpreting the statutory language,and because we hold that,under the regulations interpretation,the government case is not,we reverse the court of federal claims judgment.
background 
grapevine and the tigues 
this is a tax case.the story,for our purposes,begins in late.plaintiff grapevine imports,grapevine was a limited liability partnership with three partners.taxpayers joseph tigue and virginia tigue,limited partners,each owned partnership shares.plaintiff,owned the remaining as a general partner,and was also the partnership tax matters partner,in turn,was wholly owned by tigue.
the tigues purportedly arranged to sell grapevine which owned an auto dealership for upwards of million.the government contends that the tigues collective tax basis in grapevine at that time was about million,so the sale would have resulted in significant taxable capital gains for the tigues.from that starting point,a series of transactions took place that changed the tax picture significantly.
on december,the tigues each sold short million in treasury notes in a short sale,the seller sells some security that he does not actually own,normally by working with a lender to borrow securities at a set fee or rate for some period of time.the seller sells the borrowed securities time passes.then,just before he is due to return the securities to the lender,the seller buys equivalent securities using funds received from the earlier sale.he gives the equivalent securities to the lender,and the transaction is closed.see zlotnick tie commc ns,cir describing short sales.
in this case,the initial phase of the tigues short sales brought in.before the sales were closed,the tigues conveyed these proceeds and the obligation to close the short sales to grapevine.
in order to close the sales,grapevine purchased treasury notes on the open market having face value of.grapevine then conveyed the notes to the lender,closing the short sale.because grapevine paid more for the treasury notes than it received from the tigues,grapevine recorded a loss on the transaction.
shortly thereafter,on december,the tigues sold grapevine for,and the proceeds were delivered to the tigues and according to their partnership interests.
grapevine filed its partnership tax return on april,showing a net loss of attributable to the short sale.on or about april,the tigues filed a joint federal income tax return in which they reported a long term cap ital loss of from their sale of grapevine.the tigues return claimed a basis in grapevine of.
the government contends that grapevine and the tigues returns were improper.it contends that the tigues reported capital loss stemmed from an unlawful overstatement of the tigues basis in grapevine.by treating the conveyance of the short sale proceeds the as increasing basis,but failing to apply a corresponding basis reduction to account for grapevine new obligation to close the short sales,the tigues managed to dramatically increase their basis in the so reduce their capital economically meaningless transactions.in other words,the government accuses the tigues,through grapevine,of using a son of boss basis and options sales strategy tax shelter.see kornman assocs.united states,cir describing son of boss tax shelters,further describing such shelters,and identifying them as improper listed transactions.
on december,the irs issued a final partnership administrative adjustment fpaa to that administratively reduced the tigues basis in grapevine by million for,thus requiring recomputation of the partners tax liability.
judgment of the court of federal claims 
grapevine challenged the fpaa in the court of federal claims as untimely it argued that the internal revenue code statute of limitations for such adjustments was three years,and the irs adjustment was two years too late.see a setting forth a general rule that the irs may not assess tax more than three years after the taxpayer return id.a reflecting the rule for tax attributable to partnership items the government disagreed,contending that grapevine overstatement of led to understatement of gain,and so underpayment of an extended statue of limitations.see e a,c.
the court of federal claims sided with grapevine and ruled the government attempt at adjustment.the court noted that the supreme court had analyzed the question of whether overstatement of basis would lead to an extended limitations period under the precursor statute.see colony,comm r of internal revenue.
colony was a fairly straightforward statutory interpretation case.the taxpayer was a corporation in the business of land sales.see colony,comm r of internal revenue,rev.the corporation and tax returns overstated basis in certain land sales,and so understated the corporation profits.the question was whether the irs could assess deficiencies on those returns more than three but less than five years later the extended limitations period was then five years.colony,at.
the limitations statute interpreted in colony resembled the law at issue here 
period of limitation upon assessment and collection.
except as provided in section 
a general amount of income taxes imposed by this chapter shall be assessed within three years after the return was filed,and no proceeding in court without assessment for the collection of such taxes shall be begun after the expiration of such period.
c omission from gross the taxpayer omits from gross income an amount properly includible therein which is in excess of per centum of the amount of gross income stated in the return,the tax may be assessed,or a proceeding in court for the collection of such tax may be begun without assessment,at any time within years after the return was filed.
internal revenue code of,stat.
in determining whether the phrase omits from gross income encompasses an overstated basis,the supreme court noted,i t can not be said that the language is unambiguous.in these circumstances we turn to the legislative history of c.colony,at.
turning to that history,colony found in the legislative reports a number of statements indicating that congress merely had in mind failures to report particular income receipts and accruals,and did not intend the limitation to apply whenever gross income was understated.id.at.the court concluded that the purpose of the extended limitations period was to give the government extra time to discover items that had been entirely omitted from to recover for items that,though included,were misstated.id.at.on that basis,the court held for the taxpayer and ruled that overstatement of basis was not an omission from gross income.
returning to this case time before the court of federal claims,grapevine argued that colony controlled,and the government case was.the government tried to resist colony application.it argued that colony properly applied only to income from the sale of goods and services by a trade or business,and not other income the basis of this argument was that the modern tax code differs from the statute analyzed in colony.notably,the updated code sets forth a test similar to that in explicitly limits that test to the trade or business context.e a i.
the government argued that colony should be similarly limited to the trade or business context.it urged that this was congress intent,and pointed out that the taxpayer in colony was in the business of land sales.the court of federal claims disagreed,noting several reasons why colony still controlled even outside the trade or business context.see grapevine,fed.cl.at.the court also noted that the supreme court had e a in the colony opinion 
and without doing more than noting the speculative debate between the parties as to whether congress manifested an intention to clarify or to change the code,we observe that the conclusion we reach is in harmony with the unambiguous language of e a of the internal revenue code of.
colony,at.the revision to e a brought the language to essentially its modern posture.consistent with the supreme court note,the court of federal claims went on to determine that congress enactment of e a did not operate to limit colony holding.
accordingly,on april,the court entered judgment dismissing the government claims concerning the tax return as.the government timely appealed.
salman ranch and the new regulations 
before briefing began,grapevine moved to consolidate this appeal with another son of boss case then pending before another panel,salman ranch united states.the government opposed consolidation,but asked for this case to be held in abeyance until the salman ranch case was decided on the possibility that salman ranch would conclusively resolve the time bar question.we agreed with the government and stayed briefing in this case.
the salman ranch opinion ably sets forth that case progress before the court.briefly put,the government again argued that the colony decision should be limited to the context of income from the sale of goods or services by a trade or business.id.at.the salman ranch panel disagreed.it concluded that the colony decision did not turn on the taxpayer trade or business,and that enactment of e a did not mandate any different result.id.at.thus,the panel held for the taxpayer and ruled the government claims.
shortly after salman ranch issued,the treasury department issued temporary regulations implementing the department own interpretation of the statute of limitations and the statute interaction with colony.regs.c t,e t.the department subsequently issued final regulations replacing the temporary regulations.regs.c,e.
the preamble to the final regulations states the treasury department and the internal revenue service disagree that the supreme court reading of the predecessor to section e in colony applies to sections e and c.at.the regulations go on to set forth the department view that,outside the context of income from sale of goods or services by a trade or business,an understatement of gross income resulting from an overstatement of unrecovered cost or other basis constitutes an omission from gross income for purposes of e a.reg.c a iii see also reg.e a.in other words,the new treasury regulations set forth the view of colony that the government urged before both the court of federal claims in this case,and before the salman ranch panel.they state that colony did not conclusively resolve the statutory interpretation issue,and that overstatement of basis outside the trade or business context can trigger the extended limitations period.
the government contends that the new treasury regulations should control the outcome of the present appeal.grapevine resists,arguing that the new regulations can not change this court interpretation of the limitations statutes,and,even if they can,they do not apply in this case.

presence of intervening authority 
the essential issue on appeal is whether this case is governed by our decision in salman ranch.a panel of this court is ordinarily bound to follow a prior precedential decision unless there are intervening circumstances,such as new controlling authority.am.oil dep t of energy,en banc this court applies the rule that earlier decisions prevail unless overruled by the court en banc,or by other controlling authority such as intervening statutory change or supreme court decision.
the new treasury regulations can not,of course,change the tax code.but they may reflect the treasury department exercise of authority granted by congress to interpret an ambiguity in that code.where an executive department,entrusted with interpretive authority,promulgates statutory interpretations that are reasonable within the circumstances established by congress,then the courts must defer to that interpretation.chevron,natural res.def.council.
there is at this point little doubt that the treasury department has a congressional mandate to interpret ambiguities in the tax code,and that treasury regulations,when promulgated,are to be interpreted under the standards set forth in chevron.mayo found.for med.educ.research united states,slip op.at,see also mead united states.our task,therefore,is to examine the statute and the regulations to determine the deference,if any,owed to the treasury department in this appeal.in other words,we undertake chevron review of the new treasury regulations.if the treasury regulations are entitled to chevron deference,then they are new intervening authority and may require us to depart from salman ranch.
applying chevron 
the chevron analysis has two steps.first,we must determine if there is an ambiguity in the statute such that an agency has room to interpret.second,we must determine whether the agency action is a reasonable interpretation of congress intent.chevron,at.
chevron step one congress intent was not so clear as to foreclose reinterpretation 
where a court,applying the traditional tools of statutory construction,is unable to identify a clear intent by congress as to how a given question should be resolved,that opens the door to an agency filling in the gap by regulation.chevron,at.the search for congress intent begins with the plain statutory text.id.at cable telecomm.ass brand x internet servs.hereinafter brand x,at the first step,we ask whether the statute plain terms directly address the precise question at issue.quotation marks omitted torrington united states,f d.if,even after consulting the plain text,there is still some question as to congress intent concerning the given question,we turn to the traditional tools of statutory construction,legislative history,to see if they show a clear intent that is unclear from the text alone.chevron,at see also torrington,at.
the tax code provision for an extended limitations period when a return reflects a s ubstantial omission of items reads 
e substantial omission of as otherwise provided in subsection c 
income the case of any tax imposed by subtitle a 
a general the taxpayer omits from gross income an amount properly includible therein which is in excess of percent of the amount of gross income stated in the return,the tax may be assessed,or a proceeding in court for the collection of such tax may be begun without assessment,at any time within years after the return was filed.for purposes of this subparagraph 
i in the case of a trade or business,the term gross income means the total of the amounts received or accrued from the sale of goods or services if such amounts are required to be shown on the return prior to diminution by the cost of such sales or services and 
ii in determining the amount omitted from gross income,there shall not be taken into account any amount which is omitted from gross income stated in the return if such amount is disclosed in the return,or in a statement attached to the return,in a manner adequate to apprise the secretary of the nature and amount of such item.
the tax code includes similar language clarifying that,where the substantial omission of income is attributable to a partnership item,the limitations period for the taxpayer should not expire before six years after the relevant date for the partnership return 
a general as otherwise provided in this section,the period for assessing any tax imposed by subtitle a with respect to any person which is attributable to any partnership item or affected item for a partnership taxable year shall not expire before the date which is years after the later of 
the date on which the partnership return for such taxable year was filed,or 
the last day for filing such return for such year determined without regard to extensions.
c special rule in case of fraud.
substantial omission of any partnership omits from gross income an amount properly includible therein which is in excess of percent of the amount of gross income stated in its return,subsection a shall be applied by substituting years for years.
grapevine contends that,under colony and salman ranch,these statutes meaning is clear overstatement of basis does not constitute an omission from gross income.the government disagrees and argues that those cases do not control this one.we think the government is correct.those cases,while instructive,do not resolve the question for purposes of chevron step one.
both colony and salman ranch preceded the issuance of treasury regulations interpreting this statute.the task of those courts was therefore different from ours.their task was to weigh the evidence of the statute meaning and to determine whether that evidence better favored the taxpayer or the government.the goal was to find the best in each court view interpretation of the statute in light of the evidence.and in that inquiry,both reached the same held the taxpayers arguments against including overstated basis as an omission stronger than the government argument in favor,and interpreted the statute accordingly.
we face a different task in light of chevron and brand x.the objective of chevron step one is not to interpret and apply the statute to resolve a claim,but to determine whether congress intent in enacting it was so clear as to foreclose any other interpretation.see brand x,at only a judicial precedent holding that the statute unambiguously forecloses the agency interpretation,and therefore contains no gap for the agency to fill,displaces a conflicting agency construction.if room exists for more than one reasonable interpretation of congress intent,then the agency,not the judiciary,has the interpretive mandate.the courts role is thereby reduced to ensuring that the agency takes no action that is unreasonably inconsistent with the statute.see also chevron,at.
looking at the relevant text of and,we find them ambiguous as to congress intent concerning treatment of a taxpayer overstated basis.chevron,at see also brand x,at.this is consistent with the analysis of both colony and salman ranch.in colony,as noted supra,the supreme court expressly found the predecessor statute ambiguous,and turned to the legislative history to resolve the question.at i t can not be said that the language of the statute is unambiguous.and while it is true that the court later referred to the updated e a as unambiguous,it did not rely or elaborate on that statement,nor was the updated statute at issue in that case.id.at.further,in colony the taxpayer was in the business of land sales,so e a i test for income in the case of a trade or business expressly applied.that is not the case here.the ambiguity concerns what to do outside the trade and business context,and the only language in e a applicable outside the trade or business context is the same language from the predecessor statute,omits from gross income an amount.the supreme court previously noted that this term was ambiguous as to whether it encompassed an overstated basis.we therefore find colony no bar to our finding that the text of the relevant statutes,standing alone,is ambiguous as to the disposition of this issue 
nor does salman ranch mandate any different conclusion.this court there closely analyzed both the updated statute and its legislative history to determine whether divergence from colony was warranted.at.it made no separate holding that the statute was unambiguous for purposes of chevron step one,and indeed the panel resort to legislative history strongly suggests that the statutory interpretation could not be resolved on the statutory text alone.
we thus conclude that the plain statutory text of e a and c,standing alone,is subject to multiple interpretations.as this court noted in salman ranch,the tax code use of the term omits suggests that the section is primarily addressed to the return where the taxpayer has fail ed to include or mention or le ft out some item rather than misrepresenting it as by an overstatement of basis.at quoting am.heritage dictionary of the english language ed.but without looking beyond the text itself,we can not say that the statute forecloses the possibility that a taxpayer overstated basis might constitute an omission from gross income.
having concluded that the text,standing alone,does not resolve congress intended treatment of basis overstatement,we next must look to see if there are any other indications of congressional intent so clear that we perceive no room for an agency to add anything.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter,for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.chevron,at brand x,at.
even incorporating the legislative history into our analysis of the statutory text,we do not think congress intent was so clear that no reasonable interpretation could differ.colony reviewed much of the relevant congressional debate and committee reports for the revenue act.at.of the excerpts analyzed by the supreme court,none explicitly discussed application of the limitations period to cases involving overstatement of basis.the cited excerpts discuss the situation of taxpayers who,whether negligent,forgetful,or by honest mistake,overstate the basis on their return.id.the court found these excerpts persuasive to support its holding.id.at.the court did not find that there was no other reasonable interpretation of the history than its own,and neither do we.
salman ranch review of the more recent legislative history of also can not resolve the issue beyond question.at.this court concluded from the legislative history that congress amendments were primarily directed to the related issue of whether omitted gross income exceeded of stated gross income,not whether basis overstatement was an omission.id.at.while persuasive support of salman ranch holding,the cited text can not remove all reasonable dispute about congress meaning.
accepting the soundness of the judicial reasoning in colony and salman ranch,it is not judicial clarity that matters for step one of chevron,but legislative clarity.if the tax code lacks legislative clarity,and we hold that it does,then there is room for agency interpretation.that the supreme court and this court have strongly reasoned for a certain interpretation of these statutes does not mean their inherent ambiguity has been wiped away.brand x,at a court prior judicial construction of a statute trumps an agency construction otherwise entitled to chevron deference only if the prior court decision holds that its construction follows from the unambiguous terms of the statute and thus leaves no room for agency discretion.emphasis added.
we conclude that e a and c are ambiguous as to congress intent for treatment of basis overstatement outside the trade or business context.we therefore conclude that the treasury department is entitled to promulgate its own interpretation of these statutes,and to have that interpretation given deference by the courts so long as it is within the bounds of reason.
chevron step two the treasury regulations are a reasonable interpretation of the limitations period 
the second step of the chevron analysis asks whether the newly issued treasury regulations constitute a reasonable policy choice for the agency to make.chevron,at.review of the treasury regulations reveals that they are reasonable,even though they depart from the judicial interpretation of colony and salman ranch.
as it did before this court in salman ranch,the treasury department justified its statutory interpretation with two basic arguments.first,the department viewed congress addition of a special gross receipts definition in the internal revenue code as a response to disagreement among the courts that existed at the time regarding the proper scope of section c of the internal revenue code.preamble to temp,see also preamble to,adopting the reasons set forth in the preamble to the temporary regulations.by emphasizing the effect of the gross receipts definition,the regulations purport to better reflect congress intention when compared to colony.second,the department argues that to apply colony outside the trade or business context risks rendering the gross receipts definition meaningless.it asks,why would congress enact a new definition for gross receipts in the trade or business context if it had already established as colony held that that same definition would apply in all contexts preamble to temp.at.
salman ranch discussed these justifications and found them,at,but we are unable to say that they,or the policy they support,are ipso facto unreasonable.it is beyond question that in congress added provisions for computing gross income in the trade and business context without expressly stating whether those provisions would also apply to other contexts.one could,and in this case the treasury department did,reasonably argue that this was evidence of an intent to treat or business income according to a different rule.
grapevine opposes this conclusion,reasoning first that an interpretation that departs from colony can not be reasonable.appellees br.for the reasons already set forth,we disagree.colony holding does not foreclose reasonable disagreement in agency rules under chevron.neither that case nor salman ranch found congress intent was so clear as to support no reasonable interpretation other than the taxpayer.
in its response brief,grapevine also argues that the temporary treasury regulations should not receive chevron deference because of purported procedural shortcomings in their issuance.now that the regulations have issued in final form,these arguments are moot.there can be little doubt that the final regulations of the treasury department are entitled to chevron review and,where appropriate,deference.mayo,slip op.at we believe chevron and mead,rather than national muffler and rowan,provide the appropriate framework for evaluating the employee rule a treasury regulation promulgated after procedures.united states cleveland indians baseball,fed.mortg.ass united states.
because the treasury regulations are a reasonable interpretation of e a,they must receive our deference.chevron and salman ranch notwithstanding,we will defer to the treasury department interpretation in applying e a.
d.the present appeal 
grapevine contends that,even if the treasury regulations control application of the limitations period prospectively,they should not control the present appeal.grapevine presents three arguments,which we address in turn.
the new treasury regulations apply to previous tax years 
grapevine first contends that even if the new regulations control assessments for future tax years,they do not meet the legal requirements for retroactive application to tax assessments.
the tax code empowers the treasury department to promulgate retroactive regulations 
b retroactivity of regulations or secretary may prescribe the extent,if any,to which any ruling or regulation,relating to the internal revenue laws,shall be applied without retroactive effect.b see also redhouse comm r of internal revenue,
grapevine claims that there is a strong presumption against retroactive application of certain statutes and regulations,citing supreme court cases from the context as support.appellees br.see also landgraf usi film,bowen georgetown.grapevine urges us to undertake the various tests set forth in those cases to review the tax code and the new regulations,presumably out of due process and fairness concerns.
the government,on the other hand,points out that the supreme court has long upheld the retroactivity of tax legislation.see,united states carlton,this court repeatedly has upheld retroactive tax legislation against a due process challenge.moreover,the supreme court specifically endorsed the treasury department power to apply rules and regulations retroactively under b,on an abuse of discretion standard 
i t is clear from the language of the section precursor to b and its legislative history that congress thereby confirmed the authority of the commissioner to correct any ruling,regulation or treasury decision retroactively.
auto.club of comm r of internal,footnote omitted see also id.at applying abuse of discretion standard redhouse,at applying abuse of discretion standard to retroactive rule.further,we read landgraf as emphasizing a requirement of clear congressional intent for retroactive application.at a requirement that congress first make its intention clear helps ensure that congress itself has determined that the benefits of retroactivity outweigh the potential for disruption or unfairness.such an intent was manifest here,by b straightforward endorsement of retroactive regulation.
we therefore must determine whether it was an abuse of discretion for the treasury department to state that the new regulations would apply to preceding tax years.we conclude that it was not.as we have already set forth above,the new regulations are a reasonable interpretation of the limitations statutes.by their terms,the new regulations will apply only to those taxpayers who are within the limitations period as computed under the new regulation,so there is no opportunity for these regulations to reach into the distant past.and while we recognize that some taxpayers whose past returns bear evidence of overstated basis may find themselves facing adjustments when they thought the limitations period had lapsed,we can not say that the burden on those taxpayers is so great as to be an abuse of the treasury department discretion.we therefore conclude that the new regulations may properly be applied to returns from past tax years whose limitations periods as recomputed has not yet expired.
the period for assessing grapevine return remains open until the close of litigation 
grapevine next argues that the treasury regulations,by their terms,do not apply to its return because the regulations appl y to taxable years with respect to which the period for assessing tax was open on or after september.regs.c b,e e.grapevine urges that the period for assessing grapevine tax closed on april,pursuant to the judgment of the court of federal claims and this court subsequent decision in salman ranch.grapevine repeatedly describes the court of federal claims decision as a final judgment,and contends that it is not within the treasury department power to contravene such a judgment.
the government responds that the tax code expressly extends the period of assessment being litigated until the decision of the court becomes final.d.final,according to the government,means for tax assessment purposes that all appeals have been exhausted.id.stating that a decision of th
