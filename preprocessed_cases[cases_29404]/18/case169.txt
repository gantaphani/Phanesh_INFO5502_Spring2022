this case requires us to decide whether,for purposes of administering the firm related bankruptcy,new york law treats a dissolved law firm pending hourly fee matters as its property.because we conclude that we can not definitively answer that question without the guidance of the new york court of appeals,we certify controlling questions of law to that court.
background 
on october,the partners of the law firm thelen llp thelen,a registered limited liability partnership governed by california law,voted to dissolve the firm,which was insolvent.in effectuating the dissolution,thelen partners adopted the fourth amended and restated limited liability partnership agreement the fourth partnership agreement and a written plan of dissolution.the fourth partnership agreement provided that it was governed by california law.
unlike thelen previous partnership agreements,the fourth partnership agreement contained an unfinished business waiver,which provides 
neither the partners nor the partnership shall have any claim or entitlement to clients,cases or matters ongoing at the time of the dissolution of the partnership other than the entitlement for collection of amounts due for work performed by the partners and other partnership personnel prior to their departure from the partnership.the provisions of this section are intended to expressly waive,opt out of and be in lieu of any rights any partner or the partnership may have to unfinished business of the partnership,as the term is defined in jewel boxer,d.dist,or as otherwise might be provided in the absence of this provision through the interpretation of the california uniform partnership act of,as amended.
the partnership adopted the waiver with the 
hope that it would serve as an inducement to encourage partners to move their clients to other law firms and to move associates and staff with them,the effect of which will be to reduce expenses to the partnership,and to assure that client matters are attended to in the most efficient and effective manner possible,and to help ensure collection of existing accounts receivable and unbilled time with respect to such clients.
following thelen dissolution,eleven thelen partners joined seyfarth shaw llp seyfarth,ten in its new york office and one in california.the former partners transferred to seyfarth unfinished matters from thelen,and seyfarth billed clients for their services.
ii.prior proceedings 
thelen filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york allan gropper,judge.at that time,thelen stated in its petition that it has been domiciled or has had a residence,principal place of business,or principal assets in the southern district of new york.following his appointment as the chapter trustee of thelen bankruptcy estate,yann geron the trustee commenced an adversary proceeding against seyfarth the trustee sought to avoid the unfinished business waiver as a constructive fraudulent transfer under and a b and california state law,and to recover the value of thelen unfinished business for the benefit of the estate creditors.see a.proceeding from the assumption that pending hourly matters were among a law firm assets,the trustee contended that thelen fraudulently transferred those assets to individual partners without consideration when its partners adopted the unfinished business waiver on the eve of dissolution,when the firm was insolvent 
seyfarth moved for judgment on the pleadings under.c.seyfarth argued,and the district court found,that new york law governed the dispute.the district court noted that under new york law,it is well settled that a bsent an agreement to the contrary,pending contingent fee cases of a dissolved partnership are assets subject to distribution.geron robinson cole llp,emphasis in geron,quoting santalucia sebright,cir.the district court correctly noted,however,that new york courts have not authoritatively resolved whether the unfinished business doctrine applies to pending hourly fee matters.the court held that recognizing a property right in unfinished hourly fee matters would conflict with new york strong public policy in favor of client autonomy and attorney mobility,id.at,and that applying the unfinished business doctrine to pending hourly fee matters would result in an unjust windfall for the thelen estate,as compensating a former partner out of that fee would reduce the compensation of the attorneys performing the work,id.at,quoting sheresky sheresky aronson mayefsky sloan,llp,misc d a,wl,at.
in reaching this conclusion,the district court expressly disagreed with the decision of another court in the same district in development specialists,akin gump strauss hauer feld llp coudert brothers,which had held that pending hourly matters were law firm assets,in part,because the method by which the client matters were billed does not alter the nature of a law firm property interest in them,the district court therefore granted seyfarth motion for judgment on the pleadings,finding that the trustee complaint was deficient because it fail ed to distinguish between pending contingency fee matters and hourly fee matters.geron,at.the district court withdrew the reference to the bankruptcy court,and entered a final judgment dismissing the trustee claims.the trustee timely appealed.

ii.analysis 
choice of law 
as a threshold matter,we must determine whether new york or california law governs this dispute.w here no significant federal policy,calling for the imposition of a federal conflicts rule,exists,bianco erkins in regaston snow,cir,a bankruptcy court must apply the choice of law rules of the forum state,statek dev.specialists,in re coudert.llp,cir.under new york law,the first step in any case presenting a potential choice of law issue is to determine whether there is an actual conflict between the laws of the jurisdictions involved.globalnet,inc frank crystal,cir internal quotation marks omitted.of course,we can not determine at this juncture whether there is an actual conflict,because new york law is unresolved on the relevant question.for purposes of our choice of law analysis,then,we assume there to be a conflict,and we look simply to new york applicable choice of law principles to determine which state law governs.the parties do not dispute that a fraudulent conveyance is a tort,see cruden bank of new york,cir,and therefore agree that we should apply new york test.see globalnet,at the relevant analytical approach to choice of law in tort actions in new york is the interest analysis.internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.
new york interest analysis requires that the law of the jurisdiction having the greatest interest in the litigation will be applied and the only facts or contacts which obtain significance in defining state interests are those which relate to the purpose of the particular law in conflict,quoting schultz boy scouts of,alterations in schultz.under this formulation,the significant contacts are,almost exclusively,the parties domiciles and the locus of the tort.schultz,at.
under the test,torts are divided into two types,rules,such as rules of the road,and rules,such as those limiting damages in wrongful death actions,vicarious liability rules,or immunities from suit.globalnet,at internal quotation marks omitted.if conflicting laws are at issue,the law of the jurisdiction where the tort occurred will generally apply because that jurisdiction has the greatest interest in regulating behavior within its borders.cooney osgood.if the conflict involves lossallocation rules,the site of the tort is less important,and the parties domiciles are more important.globalnet,at.here,the parties do not dispute that a fraudulent conveyance statute is rather than.
we conclude that new york has a greater interest in regulating this conduct than california,because the most significant contacts in this case are with new york.first,the majority of the former thelen partners who moved to seyfarth are licensed to practice in new york,and joined seyfarth new york office second,in its chapter petition in the southern district of new york,thelen stated that it has been domiciled or has had a residence,principal place of business,or principal assets in the southern district of new york.although the parties domicile is less important for rules than for rules,globalnet,at,the location of the firm principal place of business is certainly relevant in deciding the law applicable to actions taken in the course of that business third,for claims based on fraud,the locus of the tort is generally deemed to be the place where the injury was inflicted,rather than where the fraudulent act originated in this case,that is new york.the fact that thelen was a registered partnership under california law is not by itself sufficient to overcome the significance of those contacts.accordingly,we conclude that new york law governs this dispute.
unfinished business under new york law 
new york law of partnerships is codified in the new york partnership law,itself a codification of the uniform partnership act,see law mckinney.the partnership law,which applies to every trade,occupation or profession,id,sets default requirements that come into play in the absence of an agreement,ederer gursky.these default rules define partnership property,law,and define the rights and duties of partners,id.the parties do not dispute that new york lower courts have uniformly read these provisions to mean that,in the absence of an agreement to the contrary,pending contingent fee cases of a dissolved partnership are firm assets subject to distribution 
we explored this rule,generally known as the unfinished business doctrine,in santalucia sebright transportation,cir.there,following the settlement of a wrongful death action,the plaintiff sought an order apportioning the contingent fee award between himself and his former law firm.id.at.prior to its dissolution,the firm had been retained as counsel in the action.we surveyed the new york cases and determined it beyond cavil that a member of a law firm owes a fiduciary duty to other members of the firm.id.at see also graubard mollen dannett horowitz moskovitz,l aw partners,no less than any other business or professional partners,are bound by a fiduciary duty requiring the punctilio of an honor the most sensitive.internal quotation marks omitted.we concluded,therefore,that where a lawyer departs from a dissolved partnership and takes with him a contingent fee case which he then litigates to settlement,the dissolved firm is entitled only to the value of the case at the date of dissolution,with interest.id.at.
we acknowledged,however,that the new york court of appeals had not addressed the application of the unfinished business doctrine to a law firm contingent fee matters.id.at.while the unanimous view of new york intermediate appellate courts that the unfinished business rule applies to such matters enabled us confidently to predict that the court of appeals would take a similar view,the absence of binding authority from that court counsels caution in determining whether the rationale of those decisions extends to hourly fee matters.
in sharp contrast to the uniform view of new york appellate courts that the unfinished business doctrine applies to contingent fee matters,there is scant new york authority with respect to whether the rule also applies to hourly fee matters.no new york appellate court appears to have addressed the issue,and the one new york trial court to address whether the doctrine applies to a firm pending hourly fee matters concluded that it does not.see sheresky,wl,at it is logical to distinguish between contingency fee arrangements and cases which are billed on the basis of hourly work.in light of this doctrinal uncertainty,it is unsurprising that courts in the southern district of new york have split on whether the unfinished business doctrine applies to a law firm pending hourly fee matters 
there are strong legal and policy arguments on both sides of the issue.several considerations favor application of the rule to hourly fee cases.first,the new york partnership law,which,to reiterate,sets only default rules,makes no distinction between types of partnerships.law.in applying these default rules,the new york court of appeals has determined that executory contracts to perform professional services are partnership assets unless a contrary intention appears,even where such a contract is terminable at will.see stem warren,see also scholastic,harris,cir u nder stem,if an executory contract with a third party contemplates that it should survive dissolution,it remains a joint venture asset and the have an obligation to perform with the concomitant right to its benefits.arguably,therefore,the unfinished business rule applies to all partnerships including law firms,and to all types of business conducted by such firms.
second,the partnership law instructs new york courts to adopt interpretations of its provisions that conform to those of other uniform partnership act states.law.a substantial majority of cases from such jurisdictions have applied the unfinished business doctrine to hourly rate cases those cases suggest that the new york court of appeals would decline to create an exception to the usual partnership rule for lawyers who bill their clients on an hourly basis.
third,it can be argued that sound policy reasons counsel against such an exception.to the extent that the unfinished business doctrine applies in contingent fee matters,creating a different rule for hourly fee matters might mean that a law partner fiduciary obligations to his firm would vary based on the manner in which clients are billed.such a rule would undoubtedly encourage the view,now prevailing among many,that an individual partner book of business is not an asset of the firm,but instead a piece of personal property to be guarded with a ferociousness 
but substantial arguments may be made for the opposite view.first,the new york court of appeals has suggested that the relationship is different from those tying customers to other business partnerships.see demov,morris,levin shein glantz,recognizing unique relationship between attorney and client as one of the most sensitive and confidential relationships in our society.because the client has an unassailable right to discharge an attorney at any time,with or without cause,it is clear that clients are not merchandise.cohen lord,day lord,internal quotation marks omitted.reco
