opinion of the court 
the trustees of the mafco litigation trust plaintiffs appeal an order denying their motion for partial summary judgment against defendant ronald perelman and granting for summary judgment in favor of defendants perelman,mafco holdings,macandrews forbes holdings,andrews group,incorporated,william bevins,and donald drapkin.the district court held that plaintiffs had failed to tender sufficient evidence to support a finding of a breach of fiduciary duty on the part of defendants.we will reverse in part,affirm in part,and remand for further proceedings.
background 
a.the players 
financier ronald perelman perelman was at all relevant times a director of marvel entertainment,marvel,and chairman of marvel board.through a chain of corporations the marvel holding companies,perelman also owned a controlling interest in marvel.the marvel holding companies consisted of mafco holdings mafco,which owned of macandrews forbes holdings macandrews forbes,which in turn owned of marvel iii holdings marvel iii,which owned of marvel parent holdings marvel parent,which owned of marvel holdings marvel holdings.marvel parent and marvel holdings together held to of marvel publicly traded,outstanding shares during the relevant period.
bevins was a director and ceo of marvel,a director of each of the marvel holding companies,and of macandrews forbes.drapkin was a director of marvel,a director of each of the marvel holding companies,and of macandrews forbes.perelman,bevins and drapkin were three of the four members of the executive committee of the marvel board.perelman,bevins and drapkin also together comprised the entire board of each of the marvel holding companies.because the individual defendants hold these positions and perelman control of the marvel holding companies is acknowledged,perelman,bevins,drapkin and the marvel holding companies in most instances are referred to collectively as the defendants in the following discussion.
b.the notes 
during and,the defendants caused the marvel holding companies to issue three tranches of notes.the first tranche was issued by marvel holdings in april the marvel holdings notes.the second tranche was issued by marvel parent in october marvel parent notes.the third tranche was issued by marvel iii in february the marvel iii notes,and collectively with the marvel holdings notes and the marvel parent notes,the notes.all of the defendants stock in marvel was pledged as collateral for the notes.the notes were debt.
the defendants received million from the three issuances.none of the proceeds went to marvel or were used for marvel benefit.the defendants used marvel resources to market and sell the notes.they caused marvel senior management,for example,to participate in road shows to market the notes to potential investors.app.at.
c.the restrictions in the note indentures 
in each of the note indentures,the issuing company commits itself to prevent marvel from taking certain actions the restrictions 
restriction on issuing debt section of each indenture provides that,with the exception of seven categories of debt listed in the section,the issuing company shall not permit marvel or any subsidiary of marvel to issue,directly or indirectly,any debt,unless a certain financial ratio is met.
restriction on issuing equity section c of each indenture provides that the issuing company shall not permit marvel to issue any preferred stock,except under specified circumstances 
restriction on share ownership section a of each indenture provides that the marvel holding companies shall continue to hold a majority of marvel voting shares,restricting marvel ability to issue stock that might dilute perelman stake and 
restriction on making restricted payments section of each indenture provides that the issuing company shall not permit any of its subsidiaries including,marvel to make restricted payments as defined by the indenture including dividends and stock buybacks.
the defendants underwriter advised that these restrictions were necessary to market the notes.app.at.
marvel bankruptcy 
marvel filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code on december.the note holders have not been repaid.
e.the district court proceedings 
plaintiffs brought this action,claiming that the defendants breached their fiduciary duty to marvel by agreeing to impose the restrictions of the notes on marvel.they sought disgorgement of the million obtained by the defendants in the notes transactions as well as damages.
the district court referred this action to a magistrate judge under b.the plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment against defendant perelman,and the defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims against them.the magistrate judge issued a memorandum and order the report recommending that the district court deny plaintiffs motion and grant summary judgment to the defendants on all of plaintiffs claims.
in her report,the magistrate judge found that 
a the marvel holding companies were acting at the direction of perelman when they issued the notes 
b in the indentures,the marvel holding companies agreed to impose restrictions on certain corporate actions of marvel,including limitations on marvel ability to engage in debt and equity financing 
c marvel did not receive any of the proceeds of the note transactions and 
d perelman at all relevant times owed a fiduciary duty to marvel and its minority stockholders.
the magistrate judge nevertheless concluded that the defendants did not breach their duty of loyalty.relying on bragger budacz,wl,the magistrate judge accepted the defendants contention that the note transactions merely amounted to potential conflicting loyalties and that an actual conflict never materialized because marvel did not attempt to perform or refrain from one of the prohibited acts.app.at.
the district court adopted the magistrate judge report in all respects.app.at.relying upon sinclair oil levien,the district court agreed with the magistrate judge that under delaware law it was the plaintiff burden to show that perelman had caused marvel to act in such a way that he benefitted at marvel expense,app.at,and that perelman potential conflicting loyalties between marvel and the holding companies never materialized and can not form the basis for a breach of fiduciary duty.app.at 
ii.the district court summary judgments in favor of defendants 
a.the unjust enrichment claim 
applying delaware law,the district court held that to succeed plaintiffs must show that perelman caused marvel to act in such a way that he benefitted at marvel expense.app.at,citing sinclair oil,at.we agree that such a showing would justify an award for breach of fiduciary duty,but this is an unduly restrictive view of the duty of loyalty imposed by the delaware corporation law where,as here,the record will support a finding that the defendants exploited their fiduciary position for personal gain,summary judgment is inappropriate.such exploitation would constitute a breach of fiduciary duty and that breach would justify an unjust enrichment award without regard to whether the fiduciary caused the beneficiary to act to its detriment.
the record before us would support a finding that perelman companies received million in financing they would not otherwise have been able to secure by committing to prevent marvel from taking certain actions and by utilizing marvel corporate resources to market that financing.and,given the nature of the restrictions imposed,the commitment was one that could be effectuated only by exercising the defendants control of marvel board of directors.this is thus not a case in which a fiduciary allegedly sold stockholder votes that it was entitled to cast in its own interest.this is a case involving an alleged sale of director votes.
a corporate fiduciary receiving a personal benefit not received by the shareholders generally is a classic example of a breach of the duty of loyalty.cede technicolor.as the supreme court of delaware explained in a similar situation in thorpe by castleman cerbco,
delaware law dictates that the scope of recovery for a breach of the duty of loyalty is not to be determined narrowly.although this court in in re pictures.was addressing disclosure violations,we reasoned from a more general standard concerning the duty of loyalty 
t he absence of specific damage to a beneficiary is not the sole test for determining disloyalty by one occupying a fiduciary position.it is an act of disloyalty for a fiduciary to profit personally from the use of information secured in a confidential relationship,even if such profit or advantage is not gained at the expense of the fiduciary.the result is nonetheless one of unjust enrichment which will not be countenanced by a court of equity.oberly kirby.
the strict imposition of penalties under delaware law are designed to discourage disloyalty.
the rule,inveterate and uncompromising in its rigidity,does not rest upon the narrow ground of injury or damage to the corporation resulting from a betrayal of confidence,but upon a broader foundation of a wise public policy that,for the purpose of removing all temptation,extinguishes all possibility of profit flowing from a breach of the confidence imposed by the fiduciary relation.
defendants insistence that marvel was not a party to the indentures and,accordingly,was not bound by their terms,is not a full answer to plaintiffs claims.in the prospectuses necessary to market the notes,the defendants not only described the restrictions,which are said to limit marvel,but also stressed that perelman was able to direct and control the policies of marvel.see,app.at.a trier of fact could well view this as a recognition by the defendants that their promises to prevent marvel from taking the actions in the restrictive covenants were credible and would be relied upon by note purchasers only because perelman had the power to carry out those promises and had committed himself to do so.based on the fact that defendants were advised by their underwriters that the restrictions were necessary to the success of the issuances and the fact that the notes were successfully marketed,a trier of fact could further conclude that the defendants were successful in convincing the marketplace that they would in fact prevent marvel from taking the forbidden actions.the success of these offerings tends to show that it was not necessary to the financing for marvel to be a party to the indentures or for note holders to be able to sue marvel for specific performance of the restrictions.
for much the same reason,it is also no answer for the defendants to say that there was never a proposal before the board to take action contrary to the restrictions and that they would have taken measures to deal with the conflict of interest problem had such an occasion arisen.a trier of fact could well conclude on this record that the restrictions began to affect marvel when the notes were issued,that measures to deal with the conflict of interest should have been taken before the restrictions were proposed,and that the restrictions were responsible for the fact that no proposal for their violation ever came before the marvel board.
having concluded that plaintiffs may be able to require the defendants to account for their unjust enrichment at the time of the issuance of the respective notes,we do not suggest,as plaintiffs contend,that defendants should necessarily be required to pay million.they received their financing in return for a commitment to repay in the future and pledges of stock which they themselves owned.as a result,an unjust enrichment award of million could result in a windfall.the defendants did not contend in support of their motions for summary judgment that the plaintiffs were not able to submit evidence of unjust enrichment and the issue of the extent of any unjust enrichment is,accordingly,not before us.for that reason,it would not be appropriate for us to restrict plaintiffs proof on remand.we note only that plaintiffs should at least have the opportunity to establish through expert testimony what the defendants would have had to pay marvel,after arm length bargaining,for the restrictions defendants secured without compensation.see boyer wilmington materials,
b.the damage claims 
in addition,the district court erred in concluding that there is no material dispute of fact as to whether the note restrictions caused marvel injury.
the defendants insist that the restriction in marvel own credit agreements during the period from through to the fall of were more constraining than those found in the note indentures.their expert,professor holthausen,so opined.there is also evidence that marvel was able to raise million during this period to finance an aggressive acquisition campaign.
on the other hand,there is evidence in the record from which a trier of fact could conclude that,but for the indenture restrictions,a marvel management acting in its best interest would have had a different and more favorable capital structure.as plaintiffs expert investment banker,william purcell,points out,holthausen reached his conclusion that marvel was not injured by the indentures restrictions by comparing the coverage ratios there set forth to those in marvel bank credit agreements.this analysis assumes that marvel capital structure would have remained the same in the absence of the indenture restrictions.purcell provided an alternative analysis,however,which would provide a basis for concluding that marvel did suffer injury from those restrictions.he expressed the following opinions,for example 
i t is my opinion that the economic harm to marvel caused by the restrictions in the indentures can not be assessed without considering the effect of those restrictive covenants on marvel capital structure,and marvel likely capital structure in the absence of those restrictions.
based upon my experience as an investment banker,in the absence of the holding company debt made possible by section and other restrictions relating to marvel,it would have been extremely unlikely that marvel would have financed its aggressive acquisition program almost entirely with commercial bank debt.rather,marvel probably would have financed its acquisition program with a combination of debt and equity,which would have afforded significant advantages over bank debt.
it is my opinion that marvel could have received an,bbb or baa rating for a debt financing in and the first half of,and that such a financing would have been well received in the market moreover,the terms available in the public market for debt during and were very favorable,and such an issue would have benefited marvel greatly from both a liquidity and a restrictive covenant point of view.
it is my opinion that,in the absence of the restrictive covenants and the holding company debt made possible thereby,the issuance of common stock would have been another attractive financing alternative for marvel during the period that would have been by the markets.the cost of money to marvel would have been very low,there would have been little or no dilution in reported earnings per share,marvel could have retired bank debt which would thus be available for future acquisitions and contingencies,and its stated stockholders equity per share could have increased.
app.at,footnotes omitted.
we do not suggest that these portions of the record reflect the only material disputes of fact regarding the issue of whether marvel was injured by the restrictions.we hold,however,that they are sufficient to preclude summary judgment for the defendants on their damage claim.
timeliness of suit 
the defendants insist that all of plaintiffs claims are barred by ann.a statute of limitations,and urge us,if necessary,to affirm their summary judgments on this alternative basis.plaintiffs response is laches,rather than limitations,should govern the timeliness of their unjust enrichment claim and,in any event,the statute of limitations was tolled until they knew or should have known of the defendants breaches of fiduciary duty.

the supreme court of delaware explained the relationship of laches and limitations as follows in laventhol,krekstein,horwath horwath tuckman,
