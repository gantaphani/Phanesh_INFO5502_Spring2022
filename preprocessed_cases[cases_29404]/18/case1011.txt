western filter corporation western filter appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of argan,argan.the district court had jurisdiction under,and we have jurisdiction under.we are asked to decide an issue of first impression under california law,whether a provision within a stock purchase agreement spa permitting the representations and warranties of the parties to survive closing,also serves as a contractual statute of limitation that reduces a longer period otherwise provided by california law.because the provision at issue does not unambiguously state the parties intent to contractually reduce the applicable california statute of limitation to one year,we reverse and remand.
puroflow,puroflow designs,manufactures,and sells industrial aerospace and automotive filtration products.puroflow is a wholly owned subsidiary of argan.
western filter competed with puroflow in the filter business.it decided to buy its competitor.on october,western filter executed the spa with argan,acquiring all of puroflow stock for million the parties dispute whether argan conditioned the sale of puroflow on an october closing date.
both parties made several representations and warranties,which are set forth in article iii of the spa.the portion of the contract at issue is found in section.section survival clause provides that t he representations and warranties of western filter and argan in this agreement shall survive the closing for a period of one year,except the representations and warranties contained in section a,b,c,and f and a and b shall survive indefinitely.
the spa also provides for an escrow agreement,which required western filter to pay in cash at closing to an escrow agent.the escrow funds are intended to cover any claims brought by western filter for indemnification under article vi of the spa.section provides that argan agrees to indemnify western filter for a ny and all loss resulting from any misrepresentation or breach of warranty by argan under section,or for a ny and all loss resulting from any non fulfillment of any covenant or agreement on the part of argan under section of this agreement.section sets forth the procedures for asserting a right to indemnification 
except as otherwise provided in sections and,subject to the limitations imposed by section,promptly after receipt by an indemnified party pursuant to the provisions of this article vi of notice of the commencement of any action,claim or proceeding involving the subject matter of the foregoing indemnity provisions,such indemnified party shall,if a claim thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party pursuant to the provisions of this article vi,promptly notify such indemnifying party of the commencement thereof 
after acquiring puroflow,western filter discovered that puroflow inventory was allegedly worth significantly less than what argan represented.on september,western filter sent written notice to argan,claiming that the management of puroflow and argan grossly misrepresented the financial condition of puroflow.western filter claimed damages of and asserted that it ha d a claim against argan not only for breach of representations and warranties,but also for fraud in the inducement.nevertheless,while fully prepared to assert its claims in court,if necessary,western filter stated that it would prefer to avoid protracted litigation,provided the matter c ould be settled immediately for the sum of.in the event argan was unwilling to settle,western filter stated that it would have no choice but to take such actions as may be necessary to protect its interest in this matter.
rainer bosselmann responded to western filter notice letter on september.he said that he was disappointed,but felt that they could work through a lot of the issues without involving the lawyers again.in late october,western filter confirmed with argan that the escrow funds would be retained pending resolution of the dispute between western filter and argan.
six months later,western filter filed suit in the los angeles county superior court against argan and its officers for breach of contract,intentional misrepresentation,concealment and nondisclosure,negligent misrepresentation,false promise,negligence,and declaratory relief.argan removed the matter to federal court 
on march,the district court granted argan motion for summary judgment,concluding that western filter claims were barred by the limitation set forth in the survival clause it concluded that t he plain meaning of section provisions clearly indicate that,if argan breached certain representations and warranties,then for a period after the closing western filter could file a claim against defendants for such breach,be it a suit for indemnification subject to the monetary cap or a suit in law not subject to the monetary cap in the case of intentional misrepresentations.this interpretation was best exemplified by the fact that the parties themselves distinguished between those representations and warranties that were by the spa and those that were not.
in support of its decision,the district court noted that the indemnification provision expressly provides that an indemnity claim is subject to the limitation imposed by section.the court also noted that other courts have interpreted materially indistinguishable language as creating a contractual statute of limitation period,that discovery has developed no evidence suggesting that the parties had a contrary understanding of the plain meaning of the survival clause,and that the demand letter to argan was not sufficient to toll the statute of limitation.
to address western filter remaining arguments,the court accept ed and adopt ed as its own judge james lorenz decision in herring teradyne,d.in herring,as in this case,the sole issue was whether a survival clause constituted a contractual statute of limitation or set forth the period of time during which a breach could occur.d at.judge lorenz concluded that the following survival clause was sufficient under california law to limit the applicable commercial statute of limitation t he covenants,agreements,representations and warranties of the parties hereto contained in this agreement or in any certificate or other writing delivered pursuant hereto or in connection herewith shall survive the closing until the first anniversary of the closing date.see the statute of limitation for an action brought for breach of a written contract is four years id.d the statute of limitation for an action for relief on grounds of fraud is three years.
in an unpublished memorandum disposition,a panel of our court reversed the decision in herring.see herring teradyne.cir.we stated 
we also disagree with the district court conclusion that the survival clauses contained in the merger agreements clearly and unambiguously reduced the statute of limitations from four years to one year.parties may contractually reduce the statute of limitations,but any reduction is construed with strictness against the party seeking to enforce it.see lewis hopper,d.here,we find no clear and unequivocal language in the survival clauses that permits the conclusion that the parties have unambiguously expressed a desire to reduce the statute of limitations.
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.soldano united states,cir.
western filter argues that the survival clause limitation serves only to set forth the time period for which a breach may occur or be discovered,whereas argan maintains that the survival clause serves as a contractual limitation on the applicable statute of limitation in california,the statute of limitation for a contract claim is four years,three years for a fraud or intentional misrepresentation claim,and two years for a negligent misrepresentation claim.see,d,hayward,tilton rolapp ins,th,d.
it is a proposition of law in california that the parties to a contract may stipulate therein for a period of limitation,shorter than that fixed by the statute of limitations,and that such stipulation violates no principle of public policy,provided the period fixed be not so unreasonable as to show imposition or undue advantage in some way.moreno sanch
