in this appeal plaintiff theresa daly challenges a summary judgment entered in favor of her former employer,staffing industry analysts,sia,and three directors on its board.plaintiff contends that triable issues of fact existed on her derivative and individual claims,in which she asserted breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,dilution of her minority interest,and diversion of corporate assets.we find no error and affirm the judgment.
background 
sia provides business intelligence,market data,news,and analysis to industries that use contingent or temporary staff.defendant peter yessne,sia founder and president,served in various executive capacities,including officer and director,from the inception of the company in through the present litigation.peter yessne wife,defendant gail bates yessne,also served as a director of the company and,at various times,as its secretary.plaintiff served on the board of directors from february,through march.
when it was incorporated in,sia issued shares of stock to the yessnes.on two subsequent occasions in and,the yessnes received additional shares in consideration of loans made to the company.the board of directors also authorized stock option grants to peter yessne on two occasions and to two other employees,including plaintiff.
plaintiff began working for sia as a temporary employee in december.in april she was offered the position of associate editor,along with an incentive stock option plan that allowed her to purchase up to shares of sia stock at per share.plaintiff signed the accompanying incentive stock option agreement and stock repurchase agreement.the former specifically provided for a vesting of shares after each year of employment,vesting fully after five years.any unexercised and unvested options would expire within years april or within days after she left the company.upon termination of employment,the stock repurchase agreement required her to sell and the company to buy all the shares she then owned.the purchase price for these shares was to be determined by the fair market value for a share of common stock as last determined by the corporations sic board of directors prior to the termination date.
plaintiff stock options fully vested in april.she did not purchase any shares,however,until december,when she acquired all.
plaintiff resigned from the company effective august.on august,the board of directors met to determine the fair market value of sia stock in order to comply with its obligation under the stock repurchase agreement.using the same general method as he had in the past,peter yessne determined the fair market value to be per share.accordingly,on september,sia offered to pay plaintiff for her shares.plaintiff,however,rejected the offer and retained the shares.on december,she filed suit against sia.
plaintiff third amended complaint asserted both individual and derivative claims for breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,negligent misrepresentation,and various forms of fraud.she requested declaratory relief,damages,and an accounting.the four claims for fraud and misrepresentation were dismissed with prejudice after defendants demurrer was sustained without further amendment by plaintiff.
in their demurrer to the contract cause of action defendants had asserted that plaintiff had not alleged a failure to purchase her shares in accordance with the contract terms,which defined the fair market value of her stock as the amount determined by the board of directors before her termination date.plaintiff resisted this ground for demurrer by arguing that this claim encompassed an allegation that defendants had breached an implied promise to determine the value of her stock fairly and in good faith.the court interpreted plaintiff argument as an assertion of breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing and overruled the demurrer on this ground.
another source of controversy reflected in plaintiff lawsuit was a loan from sia to the yessnes in february.plaintiff alleged that the yessnes had used the money to buy a building for their own benefit and then avoided repaying the loan.she also asserted unauthorized issuances of stock to the yessnes that diluted her own interest the rejection of offers to purchase sia,thereby avoiding payment to her of the value of her shares and excessive payments to the yessnes of stock options,salary,bonuses,and other gratuities.these acts,according to plaintiff,diluted and devalued the stock and constituted a waste and diversion of the corporate assets to the detriment of sia and its shareholders.
on december,defendants moved for summary judgment or,alternatively,summary adjudication of the remaining causes of action.defendants argued,inter alia,that plaintiff had no standing to bring derivative claims,they owed her no fiduciary duty,the business judgment rule protected defendants decisions,and plaintiff could not establish a factual basis for breach of contract or breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
on march,after a thorough review of the parties moving and responsive papers,the trial court granted the motion.the court found that the first cause of action,which alleged a derivative claim against the individual directors,could not be sustained because most of the challenged transactions had taken place before plaintiff acquired title to her shares,and she could not be said to be a beneficial shareholder.the one transaction that did occur after she became a directors failure to accept a third party offer to buy the subject to the business judgment rule.
as to the second cause of action for breach of contract,the court examined the promise set forth in the stock repurchase agreement and determined that it unambiguously allowed the board to determine the repurchase price without resort to any particular formula for ascertaining fair market value.plaintiff also had failed to present evidence that the board had acted in bad faith in selecting a valuation method or that its formula was unfair or objectively unreasonable.consequently,the court ruled that plaintiff had failed to state a claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,which it found to be the more appropriate label for plaintiff second cause of action.
plaintiff fourth cause of action for declaratory relief alleged a dispute regarding the percentage of ownership plaintiff was entitled to hold.according to the complaint,defendants attributed percent of the stock ownership to plaintiff,whereas she should own percent.the court rejected plaintiff position because the undisputed facts showed that plaintiff held of the outstanding shares moreover,plaintiff had conceded that the issue of percentage ownership ha d not yet resulted in any damages because sia ha d not been sold.because that event had not yet occurred,there was no actual controversy to be resolved by declaratory relief.
finally,the court addressed the fifth cause of action for breach of the directors fiduciary duty toward her as an individual.plaintiff had argued that the harm she had suffered was unique to her because the defendant directors had used their power and control as majority shareholders to undervalue the stock so as to benefit themselves and harm her as minority shareholder.the trial court stated that plaintiff had failed to provide any evidence to support this position.
finally,the court rejected the sixth cause of action for an accounting because this claim was based on the first cause of action,which the court had already summarily adjudicated.on april,having disposed of all substantive claims,the court entered judgment for defendants.
discussion 
standard and scope of review 
summary judgment is appropriate if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.a defendant who moves for summary judgment or summary adjudication bears the initial burden to show that the action or cause of action has no is,that one or more elements of the cause of action,even if not separately pleaded,can not be established,or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.code civ,subds.a,p.a defendant can meet that burden by presenting affirmative evidence that negates an essential element of plaintiff claim or by submitting evidence that the plaintiff does not possess,and can not reasonably obtain,needed evidence supporting an essential element of its claim.guz bechtel national,cal th,d,aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.
once the defendant has met that burden,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.the plaintiff may not rely upon the mere allegations or denials of its pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists,but,instead,shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.code civ,subd.p.
on appeal,we conduct a de novo review of the record to determine with respect to each cause of action whether the defendant seeking summary judgment has conclusively negated a necessary element of the plaintiff case,or has demonstrated that under no hypothesis is there a material issue of fact that requires the process of trial,such that the defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.guz bechtel national,supra,cal th at,d.we apply the same analysis as that of the trial court identification of issues framed by the pleadings determination of whether the moving party has established facts that negate the opponent claim and justify a judgment in movant favor and determination of whether the opponent demonstrates the existence of a triable,material factual issue.varni.wine world,th,d see also knapp doherty th,d.we need not defer to the trial court and are not bound by the reasons for the summary judgment ruling we review the ruling of the trial court,not its rationale.knapp doherty,supra,th at,d.
breach of contract 
in the second cause of action for breach of contract plaintiff pleaded the following facts.before she exercised her option to buy the shares of sia,the yessnes told her that when the time came for her shares to be bought back by the company she would receive the actual fair market value for her shares.thus,when she bought the stock she reasonably believed that when she sold it back to the company,its fair market value would be determined by the board objectively and fairly and would reflect its actual value.she would not have purchased the shares if she had known that the valuation was going to be based on some arbitrary method not consistent with a determination of actual fair market value.plaintiff thus alleged that defendants had breached the stock repurchase agreement,including the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,by failing to repurchase her shares at their actual fair market value.
defendants met their initial burden by showing that plaintiff was unable to establish any obligation to calculate fair market value by any particular formula other than what was set forth in the stock repurchase agreement.it was undisputed that the valuation formula used in august consisted of the fair market value for a share of common stock as last determined by the corporations sic board of directors prior to the termination date.
plaintiff admitted in discovery that she understood this provision and that she had had no concerns about the formula or its lack of specificity when she signed the agreement.she did not allege in her complaint that the board had set the price for her stock by a different method than had been provided for in the agreement.the trial court correctly determined that the stock repurchase agreement was unambiguous on its face and did not mandate that the board use any particular formula to calculate the fair market value.
because plaintiff could not show a violation of the terms of the stock repurchase agreement,the trial court considered an alternative of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,which had been indirectly asserted in the complaint and which plaintiff had previously argued in her opposition to the demurrer.the court concluded that there was no evidence or legal authority tending to show that the board valuation of the stock had been made in bad faith or was objectively unreasonable.
plaintiff,however,now repudiates that approach,maintaining that she was in fact asserting only breach of contract,which did not require her to prove a bad faith or objectively unreasonable valuation method.as noted above,however,the court did consider the allegation that sia had breached the contract terms by failing to calculate actual fair market value.it correctly concluded that a breach would have entailed a failure to set a price for plaintiff stock in accordance with the fair market value as last determined by the board of directors prior to the termination date.as it was undisputed that the board had complied with this provision,the question of which party valuation method better reflects the actual fair market value is not a material issue requiring trial.the court correctly granted summary adjudication of the breach of contract claim.
derivative claim 
contemporaneous ownership rule 
plaintiff first cause of action alleged on behalf of sia that the directors had diluted her interest in the company and had wasted and diverted corporate assets by carrying out unauthorized stock transactions for their own benefit allowing themselves to receive excessive bonuses,salary,stock options,and other payments declining offers by third parties to purchase sia,thereby avoiding payment for plaintiff shares and loaning to the yessnes for the purchase of a building,thereby diverting money that could have been used to benefit the company.
defendants assert that plaintiff lacks standing to bring a shareholder derivative action because it is undisputed that all but one of the listed acts took place before she acquired her shares on december.plaintiff concedes this fact,but she maintains that from the time she signed the stock repurchase agreement in april she held a vested beneficial interest in the stock,an interest that increased each year until april,when her option allowed her to buy shares.the parties disagree over the application of the contemporaneous ownership rule,the basis of the court determination that plaintiff lacked standing to challenge these transactions.
the contemporaneous ownership rule is reflected in corporations code section,subdivision b hereafter section b,which requires with specified exceptions not before us that a plaintiff in a derivative action be a shareholder,of record or beneficially at the time of the challenged transaction.the parties dispute focuses on the word beneficially.citing the fourth edition of black law dictionary ed,plaintiff contends that the statute should be construed liberally to include an advantage resulting from a contract.plaintiff also relies on pearce superior court d,where the court construed section b and specifically,the term beneficially to confer standing on a beneficiary of a trust,which was invested almost exclusively in the defendant corporation 
we can not extend the pearce holding to the facts before us.the plaintiff in pearce received substantial current income from the trust as well as being a contingent beneficiary of its corpus.she therefore had an actual and contemporaneous interest in the of the corporation.here,however,plaintiff had no current investment,direct or through a third party,in sia when most of the challenged events occurred.her interest before december,was only a contractual arrangement that permitted her to buy stock in the company like a holder of a warrant or convertible debenture,she had not assumed the risks and benefits of stock ownership.helvering southwest consol.warrant holder,whose rights are wholly contractual,is not a stockholder,either in law or in equity simons cogan,convertible debenture confers no equity interest in issuing corporation until converted into stock.thus,although equitable ownership may confer standing upon a plaintiff to sue derivatively,t he holder of an option to purchase stock is not an equitable stockholder of the corporation.harff kerkorian,revd.in part on another g
