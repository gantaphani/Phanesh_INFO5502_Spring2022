this case concerns the protective scope of the discharge injunction created by a,which bars efforts to collect personal debts from debtors after they have been discharged in bankruptcy in an adversary proceeding brought by former debtors rudy and carol paul,the bankruptcy court held that tammy iglehart violated the discharge injunction when,in state court litigation against a corporate business she jointly owned with rudy paul,she sought discovery from the pauls regarding the assets and operation of the business and obtained sanctions when they did not comply,and supplemented her pleadings to allege claims for wrongdoing by rudy paul in connection with the of the business.iglehart contends that she did nothing to violate the discharge injunction,since the discovery was for the entirely legitimate purpose of obtaining information in support of her recovery against the corporation which never filed bankruptcy itself and was not part of the pauls bankruptcy estate,and expressly excluded inquiry into any discharged claims against the pauls,and the claims she later added against rudy paul were unaffected by the discharge injunction,which does not reach claims arising.we conclude that neither the bankruptcy court findings,nor the facts of record on which they are based,demonstrate that iglehart facially permissible actions violated the discharge injunction.we therefore reverse.
factual background 
in,iglehart filed suit in state colorado court asserting several claims arising out of her connection with peak sports spine physical therapy,peak sports,of which she had been an owner,officer,and employee.some of these claims were asserted against peak sports itself,while others were asserted against individuals,including rudy paul.sometime later,iglehart added a claim against carol paul for defamation.in may,the pauls jointly filed for bankruptcy under chapter,staying proceedings against them in the state suit,which had stalled for various reasons.in september,iglehart obtained an entry of default against peak sports in the state suit,with damages left to be determined.a month later,the pauls bankruptcy proceeding was favorably terminated with an order discharging them from their debts,which included the claims iglehart had asserted against them in state court.rudy paul continued to oversee the of peak sports,which was dissolved the next year.
in,iglehart sent notices of colorado depositions to the pauls who had moved to wisconsin in the state suit,which proceeded in substance against peak sports with the pauls left as nominal defendants she contended that the pauls still had to comply with discovery obligations,including traveling to colorado for deposition.at the same time,however,she acknowledged,with a specific reference to a on the face of the deposition notices,that her discovery efforts could not involve the pauls own discharged liabilities.when the pauls failed to appear,she moved to enforce their discovery obligations through sanctions.the state court imposed penalties of on each of the pauls and another on rudy paul as president of peak sports,all of which would be voided if they appeared for a deposition.the court also imposed a similar penalty on rudy paul for failing to respond to requests for documents relating to peak sports.
the pauls sought reconsideration of the sanctions,arguing that their personal immunity from liability on the claims asserted in the litigation,by virtue of the discharge injunction,nullified their formal status as parties for purposes of discovery obligations.the state court ultimately agreed,holding that discovery could be obtained from them only in a manner appropriate for.as iglehart had not proceeded in this manner,the court vacated the sanctions it had previously imposed.nothing in the record,however,suggests that the state court found any impropriety in the substance of the discovery iglehart sought from the she has consistently maintained,with inherent legitimacy,was directed toward her claims against peak sports and,for a time,other,in particular to obtain information about corporate assets that might be traced to satisfy those claims.indeed,the state court plainly countenanced further efforts for such discovery from the pauls,limited solely as to the procedure to be followed.
the pauls also brought this adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court,alleging that iglehart conduct in the state case violated the discharge injunction.in the meantime,iglehart supplemented her state pleadings to add claims against rudy paul for wrongdoing in connection with the of peak sports.liabilities for conduct are not discharged and thus do not implicate the discharge injunction.nevertheless,the bankruptcy court inquired into the new claims,as well as iglehart discovery efforts,at a hearing on the pauls adversary complaint,and ruled from the bench that the discharge injunction had been violated in both respects.at the court request,its lengthy oral ruling was summarized in an order prepared by the pauls counsel.as for prospective relief,the court enjoined any further pursuit of the pauls in the state court matter,app.vol.at,including,unqualifiedly,any further efforts to depose them or submit to them requests for production of corporate documents,id.vol.at.as for sanctions,the court conducted additional proceedings and ultimately ordered iglehart personally to pay the pauls over in fees and costs.on reconsideration,the bankruptcy court held to its decision,which the district court later affirmed.this appeal followed.
governing key principles 
we turn now to the law governing enforcement of discharge injunctions.there are three basic principles that together point to the problem raised by this appeal.
a.the terms of a control 
under a,bankruptcy courts have the equitable power to enforce and remedy violations of substantive provisions of the bankruptcy code,including in particular the discharge injunction in a.walls wells fargo bank,cir discussing bessette avco fin,cir see cox zale,cir see also mountain am.credit union skinner in re skinner,cir same holding as to bankruptcy court powers to sanction violation of automatic stay.but that equitable power can not be exercised contrary to or in excess of the terms of the substantive code provision being enforced.norton bankruptcy law practice ed see,alderete educ.credit mgmt.in re alderete,cir landsing diversified first bank trust in re real estate fund,cir,op.modified on other grounds,cir.thus,a bankruptcy court may sanction a party for violating the discharge injunction only if the party took some action prohibited by a,an action to collect,recover or offset any discharged debt of the debtor.
this may seem an obvious point when stated in the abstract,yet it can easily be overlooked in the course of a bankruptcy court practical effort to support a debtor fresh start following discharge.a host of circumstances can affect a former debtor financial comeback.but the concept of fresh start is just a general gloss on the purpose of a it is not a license for courts to go beyond the particular prohibitions specified in the statute to shield debtors from adverse contingencies.however the effort in trying to facilitate a debtor fresh start,a bankruptcy court may not enjoin and sanction a creditor with respect to conduct that does not violate a.
a permits suits in which debtors are nominal defendants and debtors may be required to comply with discovery 
although a prohibits actions brought to collect a discharged debt from the debtor,it permits those brought to collect on debts a debtor has formally name the debtor as a defendant but are brought to collect from a third party.in re real estate fund,at accord houston edgeworth in re edgeworth,cir citing cases hendrix page in re hendrix,cir same.and requiring a debtor to bear such collateral burdens of litigation as those relating to discovery as opposed to the actual defense of the action and potential liability for the judgment,does not run afoul of a.walker wilde in re walker,cir in re edgeworth,at simpson rodgers in re rodgers,citing cases in re doar,same.as one court succinctly put it the debtor,whether she has received a discharge or not,is not relieved of the responsibility she has,as do all citizens,to testify at trial participate in discovery as a witness.in re doar,at reject ing the debtor argument that requiring her to participate in discovery in collateral state court litigation will impermissibly interfere with her fresh start.it is worth adding,since much of the criticism our bankruptcy court leveled at iglehart concerned what it saw as the inept and burdensome manner in which she sought discovery in her state suit,that if a creditor pursues discovery against a debtor in a suit otherwise permitted by a,the court hearing that suit is the appropriate authority to address the manner in which discovery is conducted as the state proceedings here illustrate.as a general matter,it is both inappropriate and unnecessary for a bankruptcy court to oversee the conduct of litigation in other courts.
this third principle operates as an overarching exception to what we have said so far.notwithstanding the facial permissibility of a lawsuit or some other action taken by a creditor vis a vis a discharged debtor,a violation of a may still be found if the debtor proves the creditor acted in such a way as to coerce or harass the debtor improperly,so as to obtain payment of the discharged debt.pratt motors acceptance in re pratt,cir see in re schlichtmann,applying pratt with extensive discussion see also in re jones,norton bankruptcy law practice,at noting that discharge injunction precludes otherwise permissible actions against third parties if designed to collect the debt from the discharged debtor.the inquiry is objective the question is whether the creditor conduct had the practical,concrete effect of coercing payment of a discharged debt,and bad faith is not required.in re pratt,at in re schlichtmann,at.by the same token,the presence of some other procedural impropriety or error in connection with the creditor action will not give rise to a violation of the discharge injunction if the objective effect is not to coerce payment of a discharged debt 
t he discharge prohibits prepetition creditors only from collecting their prepetition debts.it is not a lifelong shield against other assertions of claims,and those same creditors,even where these other acts are undertaken wrongfully and in bad faith.if an act is not in fact one to collect or enforce a prepetition debt,then whatever its faults,it is not a violation of the discharge,even though undertaken by the holder of a discharged debt.
in re schlichtmann,at emphasis added.accordingly,a debtor may establish that a creditor who has taken an action not overtly prohibited by a nevertheless violated the discharge injunction,but to do so the debtor must prove not merely that the creditor act is not what it appears to be,but that the act in question is one to collect a discharged debt in personam.id.
to flesh out this principle we discuss two examples one case pratt in which objective coercion was found,and another schlichtmann in which it was not.in pratt,a creditor held a lien on the debtors car for the purchase loan.the lien remained enforceable in rem following discharge of the underlying debt in bankruptcy state law allowed the creditor to refuse to release the lien absent payment of the loan,which prevented debtors from junking the worthless car.the creditor also legitimately refused to accept a surrender of the car under bankruptcy law.neither act violated a,but the combined effect coerced the debtors into the loan debt they had previously discharged confronted with the grim prospect of retaining indefinite possession of a worthless vehicle and incurring attendant costs of possessing,maintaining,insuring garaging the vehicle,debtors had no choice but to reaffirm the discharged debt so that the creditor would release its lien and thereby enable them to dispose of the car.in re pratt,at.in finding a violation of a,the court did not look for bad faith,but its objective inquiry did take into account the lack of any reason other than coercion for the creditor action the court noted there was no reasonable prospect that the automobile would generate future sale proceeds to which the creditor lien automatically would have attached and hence the legitimate raison for the creditor continuation of the lien no longer obtained.id.at.the court concluded that the creditor refusal to release its valueless lien so that the vehicle could be presumably not made in bad coercive in its effect,and thus willfully violated the discharge injunction.id.
in schlichtmann,the court likewise reviewed a creditor enforcement of a security interest in a debtor collateral,there proceeds held in escrow.unlike the car in pratt,the escrow fund had a substantial value and thus the creditor facially permissible actions with respect to the collateral were not undercut by the evident lack of any legitimate economic creditor desire to enforce its rights in the collateral suffice d to explain its actions.in re schlichtmann,at.under these circumstances,one would need very damning evidence indeed to justify a finding that the creditor was attempting not merely to enforce its in rem rights but also,or instead,to obtain payment from the debtor in personam on the prepetition debt.id.such evidence was lacking,and the debtor claim for sanctions was denied.significantly,the court rejected the debtor allegations of tangential misconduct by the creditor the creditor had failed to disclose a third party interest in the matter as immaterial,illustrating the point that the discharge injunction is limited to violations of and does not give bankruptcy courts a broader authority to intervene on the basis of other objections regarding a creditor actions toward a discharged debtor a t worst,the creditor was enforcing the in rem rights incorrectly.but the rights being enforced were still rights that were outside the scope of the discharge,and the creditor actions would no more have been a violation of the discharge for this impropriety.id.
analysis of creditor conduct in state suit 
in light of the foregoing legal principles,iglehart continuation of the state litigation against peak sports,even with the pauls nominally remaining in the case as defendants,did not violate a and,thus,was not a basis for imposing sanctions against her.nor was a violated merely because she pursued discovery and sought sanctions for noncompliance against the pauls,or because she supplemented her complaint to allege wrongdoing by rudy paul.she could,however,still be held in violation of a if it were determined,on a factually sufficient record,that the effect of the state litigation was nevertheless to harass and coerce the pauls into paying discharged debts.
but the bankruptcy court did not make such a determination.rather,its findings related to matters outside the scope of the a inquiry.indeed,considered within the confines of the proper inquiry,the facts of record would not support a finding of objective coercion justifying the sanction imposed here.

written sanction order issued after hearing 
in its written order,drafted by the pauls counsel,the bankruptcy court found that iglehart pursuit of discovery regarding peak sports in the state suit was not undertaken at the earliest opportunity or even within a reasonable time after the default was entered against peak sports was oppressively tardy and unjustified and has been a misplaced effort intended to obtain documents from the corporation that has resulted in eviscerating the pauls fresh start and an opportunity to get on with their lives.app.vol.at bankruptcy court order filed.in the same vein,the order criticized iglehart for not tak ing advantage of the opportunities in the pauls bankruptcy to require information from the bankruptcy trustee or to examine the books in the trustee possession,adding that t he pauls fresh start was impeded and severely hindered mostly because of what has been done postpetition and should have been done much earlier when the books were in the trustee control.id.
whether or not this criticism of iglehart conduct is justified,none of it goes to the critical point,whether her conduct had a coercive effect on the pauls,pressuring them to pay off any discharged claims.the two references to the pauls fresh start come closest,but even they just speak in terms of circumstantial effect any discovery expense or burden,regardless of connection to debt,would have,and which the case law discussed above holds do not tie iglehart conduct to any specific prohibition in a.more generally,these objections to the manner in which discovery was conducted in the state suit were for the state court to address.and,in fact,the state court did ultimately limit iglehart to discovery procedures and vacate the sanctions it previously imposed on the pauls for noncompliance with iglehart initial discovery requests.
as for the supplemental pleading of claims against rudy paul regarding the of peak sports,the court order said only that it finds little evidence of postpetition wrongdoing by the pauls,which would give rise to new claims against them.app.vol.at.this analysis is problematic for two reasons.first,the limited question for the bankruptcy court in this contempt proceeding under a is whether the claims asserted in the state case fall within the discharge injunction,allege or conduct.whether the claims can be proven up is a question for the state court in which they are litigated.in essence,the bankruptcy court made a summary judgment ruling on the merits of matters outside its jurisdiction.we understand what the court was getting at if the claims are indeed baseless,it might be concluded that the only possible function they serve is to coerce the pauls into satisfying claims iglehart can no longer press directly assuming baseless claims can have such coercive effect.but the merits of the state claims should be determined by the court in which they are asserted.if that court finds them groundless,then the bankruptcy court could,based on that disposition,properly do a coercion analysis for purposes of a sanctions.deciding the merits of the claims as part of the a analysis,and then enjoining iglehart from proceeding on them in the state suit,resulted in the bankruptcy court effectively usurping the adjudicative role of the state court 
second,iglehart explained at the sanctions hearing that she needed discovery to make her case on the claims,but the bankruptcy court never addressed this in a proper summary judgment proceeding in the state case would have implicated the protections of colorado version of rule f.see.civ.f.and if the bankruptcy court discounted this point because of its view that such discovery would violate the discharge injunction,it was,for reasons already discussed,doubly wrong.
bench ruling at sanctions hearing 
the bankruptcy court bench ruling was more lengthy but to the same effect.these passages give a good account of the essence of its rationale for sanctioning iglehart for her discovery efforts in the state suit 
now,let me address why i feel that continuing this effort and some of the past efforts have or constitute a violation of the injunction.there is an effort to get information relevant to the unresolved damages issue in the state suit against peak sports,which frankly i understand,is an effort to get information by iglehart.but that effort to get information has been delayed,complicated,ignored,evaded,or badly handled for about eight years and certainly for the first three or four years and during the bankruptcy.
moreover,a default was entered against peak sports in the year and that could and should have been the trigger to undertake a vigorous,effective search for the information either through the bankruptcy or through the trustee or getting relief from stay to pursue matters in state court or going at peak directly but instead,it dragged on.
and the discovery,especially in the relatively recent past,to today,has become burdensome,oppressive,costly,too tardy,and unjustified under the circumstances which have come to pass.
i think the fresh start has been impeded and severely hindered,and i think it mostly because of what been done postpetition.there were many avenues,many opportunities up until the discharge was entered in this bankruptcy case and shortly after the default was entered but the judgment was not.
i can not understand,and i say this somewhat as a finding but part of my puzzlement,why there was never a vigorous effort to request production of documents from peak or the pauls prepetition why interrogatories were not submitted to them either as officers of peak or as individuals prepetition or other requests for admissions or an ability to inspect the books and records prepetition.why discovery was undertaken while the pauls were in colorado,i can not understand because everything might have been avoided or the misunderstanding that seems to have mushroomed over the years might have been avoided if that had been undertaken.
i going to rule in favor of the pauls.i am going to make a specific finding that,as best as i can determine,especially after this ruling and the findings and conclusions on the record,further efforts to depose and paul or submit to them requests for production of corporate documents would be or constitute a violation of the injunction an impingement on their fresh start from bankruptcy an improper litigation strategy to discharged or against discharged debtors.
app.vol.at.nothing in that rationale suffices as a basis for imposing a a sanction under the principles we have discussed.there is not a single finding that iglehart discovery efforts were just a means to coerce some payment from the pauls on discharged claims.
indeed,the record made at the hearing before the bankruptcy court would not support such a finding.the discovery sought from the pauls served the plainly legitimate purpose of scrutinizing the conduct of peak sports to locate assets of the business to satisfy iglehart significant damages claim against it,and possibly in that regard also uncovering wrongdoing by rudy paul in connection with the corporate.there was no raison gap as there was in pratt to fill by inferring a covert agenda implicating a prohibitions.and such an agenda was explicitly disavowed by iglehart and counsel,not just after the fact at the bankruptcy hearing,but contemporaneously with the discovery sought in the state the face of the deposition notices sent to the pauls.moreover,rudy paul admitted at the hearing that neither iglehart nor her counsel ever suggested that they would drop her discovery effort in the state suit in exchange for any monetary consideration from the pauls.
in sum,iglehart pursued discovery from the pauls relating to claims that did not concern their liabilities.as such,her conduct did not violate any prohibition in a.clearly it imposed incidental burdens,as discovery does on anyone.but,notwithstanding the fresh start gloss on the statute,discharged debtors are not broadly free from any inconvenience and expense that otherwise permissible litigation may impose on them.their special protection has been delimited by congress in a,and a creditor can not be sanctioned for conduct that does not fall within its terms.of course,conduct that facially appears permissible may still violate a if its objective effect is prohibited,if it really serves to pressure the debtor to pay a discharged debt.the bankruptcy court made no such finding here indeed,the record would not have supported such a finding.the thrust of the bankruptcy court criticism concerned,rather,iglehart practical management of discovery in the state suit,which is not a matter put under bankruptcy court oversight by a or any other provision of the code.fin
