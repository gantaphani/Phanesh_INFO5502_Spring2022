introduction 
this case involves proposition,an initiative measure passed in the november general election that enacted the substance abuse and crime prevention act of hereafter the act.in general,the act mandates drug treatment,rather than incarceration,for defendants,probationers,and parolees who commit qualifying offenses or violate qualifying conditions of probation or parole,see historical and statutory notes,west ann.supp.foll.
in this case,we hold that when a probationer commits both qualifying and nonqualifying offenses or probation violations,the act does not apply.
ii.statement of the case 
in,defendant kenneth lawrence campbell was convicted of possessing heroin and placed on probation.in july,the court revoked probation,finding defendant not amenable to drug treatment,and sentenced him to prison.on appeal from the judgment,defendant claims that in basing the revocation on nonamenability,the court violated a statutory provision of proposition.we disagree and affirm the judgment.
iii.background 
in november,defendant pleaded guilty to possession of heroin,and the court placed him on probation for three years.in march,the santa clara county probation department filed a petition to modify defendant probation,alleging that he had failed to report,regularly used marijuana,and failed to complete a program.thereafter,when defendant did not appear at the probation hearing,the court summarily revoked probation and issued a bench warrant.defendant was arrested in april.in june,the probation department amended its petition,adding an allegation that defendant had recently been convicted of driving under the influence dui,subd.a.
on july,the act became effective,see historical and statutory notes,west ann.supp.foll.thereafter,on july,defendant probation hearing was held.at that time,defense counsel argued for continued probation under the act because defendant was not violent or dangerous and all of his probation violations were all drug related.the prosecutor opposed continuing probation.she noted that defendant had a history of chronic substance abuse,he had previously failed drug treatment,and he had recently been convicted of dui.under the circumstances,she argued that defendant was not amenable to further drug treatment.defense counsel pointed out,however,that under the act,amenability was not an issue because the alleged violations of probation were defendant first.the court responded,well,if the person is not amenable to treatment,he not going to go.
after argument,the court found all of the alleged violations true and that defendant was not amenable to treatment.it revoked probation and imposed a prison term for the underlying conviction for possessing heroin.
iv.overview of proposition 
uncodified sections of proposition explain the purpose of the act.section states,the people of the state of california hereby find and declare all of the following a substance abuse treatment is a proven public safety and health measure.nonviolent,criminal offenders who receive drug treatment are much less likely to abuse drugs and commit future crimes,and are likelier to live healthier,more stable and more productive lives.b community safety and health are promoted,and taxpayer dollars are saved,when nonviolent persons convicted of drug possession or drug use are provided appropriate treatment instead of incarceration.c in,arizona voters by a margin passed the drug medicalization,prevention,and control act,which diverted nonviolent drug offenders into drug treatment and education services rather than incarceration.according to a report card prepared by the arizona supreme court,the arizona law is resulting in safer communities and more substance abusing probationers in recovery,has already saved state taxpayers millions of dollars,and is helping more than percent of program participants to remain drug free,see historical and statutory notes,west ann,supra,foll.
section states that the purpose and intent of the act are a to divert from incarceration into substance abuse treatment programs nonviolent defendants,probationers and parolees charged with simple drug possession or drug use offenses b to halt the wasteful expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars each year on the nonviolent drug users who would be better served by treatment and c to enhance public safety by reducing crime and preserving jails and prison cells for serious and violent offenders,and to improve public health by reducing drug abuse and drug dependence through proven and effective drug treatment strategies,see historical and statutory notes,west ann,supra,foll.
proposition added penal code sections,and and health and safety code sections through.generally,section defines certain terms used in the act,section deals with newly convicted nonviolent drug offenders and those on probation for nonviolent drug possession offenses,and section deals with parolees 
section,subdivision a provides that,except as set forth in subdivision b,any person convicted of a nonviolent drug possession offense shall receive probation for mandatory drug treatment.italics added.section,subdivision b excludes those defendants who,in addition to such a drug conviction,have committed serious or violent offenses within the last five years are convicted in the same proceeding of a felony or misdemeanor not related to the use of drugs possessed or were under the influence of a specified drug while using a firearm refuse drug treatment as a condition of probation or have twice failed drug treatment as a condition of probation and been found not to be amenable to drug treatment,subd.b.
section,subdivision e governs violations and the revocation of probation.it has separate provisions for those who were placed on probation under the act,subd.e e a,b,c and those who were already on probation for a nonviolent drug possession offense when the act became effective,subd.e d,e f 
defendant was placed on probation in for simple possession of heroin,which is a nonviolent drug possession offense.the current revocation proceedings were based on defendant first violations of probation.given these circumstances,both parties agree that the pertinent provision of the act is section,subdivision e d.this subdivision provides,if a defendant on probation at the effective date of this act for a nonviolent drug possession offense violates that probation either by being arrested for a nonviolent drug possession offense,or a misdemeanor for simple possession or use of drugs or drug paraphernalia,being present where drugs are used,or failure to register as a drug offender,or any activity similar to those listed in paragraph of subdivision d of section or by violating a condition of probation,and the state moves to revoke probation,the court shall conduct a hearing to determine whether probation shall be revoked.the trial court shall revoke probation if the alleged probation violation is proved and the state proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant poses a danger to the safety of others.if the court does not revoke probation,it may modify probation and impose as an additional condition participation in a drug treatment program.italics added.
discussion 
defendant contends that the court erred in revoking probation based on a finding that he was not amenable to further drug treatment.defendant again argues that under section,subdivision e d,amenability is not a relevant consideration for probation violations rather,probation may be revoked only if the court finds that the probationer poses a danger to others,a finding the court below did not make.see people davis th,d revocation for first violation error absent finding of dangerousness.
the people argue,however,that defendant dui conviction rendered section,subdivision e d inapplicable.thus,a finding of dangerousness was not a prerequisite for revocation,and the court properly exercised its general sentencing discretion and revoked probation.we agree.
as noted,section,subdivision e d applies when the defendant commits a qualifying violation of probation.qualifying violations are commission of a nonviolent drug possession offense commission of a misdemeanor for simple possession or use of drugs or drug paraphernalia,being present where drugs are used,or failure to register as a drug offender,or any activity similar to those listed in paragraph of subdivision d of section or a violation of a condition of probation,subd.e d.
we first consider whether defendant dui conviction is a nonviolent drug possession offense.we conclude that it is not.
section,subdivision a provides that the term nonviolent drug possession offense means the unlawful possession,use,or transportation for personal use of any controlled substance identified in section,or of the health and safety code,or the offense of being under the influence of a controlled substance in violation of section of the health and safety code.the term nonviolent drug possession offense does not include the possession for sale,production,or manufacturing of any controlled substance and does not include violations of section or.italics added.
when we give this the word means its ordinary meaning see people birkett cal th,d,we find this definition to be clear and unambiguous nonviolent drug possession offenses are possession,use,transportation,and being under the influence of a controlled substance.
here,defendant violated vehicle code section,subdivision a,which provides,it is unlawful for any person who is under the influence of any alcoholic beverage or drug,or under the combined influence of any alcoholic beverage and drug,to drive a vehicle.the gravamen of this crime is driving under the influence.see wilkoff superior court cal d.because driving under the influence is conduct that goes beyond mere possession,use,transportation,and being under the influence of a controlled substance see people mcguire th,d being under the influence and dui are distinct offenses and separately punishable and because driving under the influence is not among the crimes expressly listed in section,subdivision a,we conclude that dui is not a nonviolent drug possession offense.see people anzalone cal th,d,the expression of one thing is the exclusion of another.
the legislative history of the act supports our conclusion the analysis in the ballot pamphlet by the legislative analyst informed voters that the act defines a nonviolent drug possession offense as a felony or misdemeanor criminal charge for being under the influence of illegal drugs or for possessing,using,or transporting illegal drugs for personal use.ballot,analysis of by legislative analyst,italics added.moreover,proponents of proposition assured the voters it was strictly limited and only affects those guilty of simple drug possession.no other criminal laws are changed.ballot,supra,argument in favor of,italics added.
defendant cites nothing in the act or its legislative history that shows it was intended to apply to intoxicated drivers.moreover,we discern a contrary intent.
we note that the offenses listed in the statutory possession,use,transportation of controlled conduct that is,in general,more dangerous and harmful to the perpetrator than to others.thus,by limiting the term nonviolent drug possession offense to the listed offenses,the act provides drug treatment for those whose conduct did not pose a serious threat to others and whose release on probation is not likely to diminish public safety.see,quoted above,at.moreover,the exclusions in section,subdivision b for those who have serious or violent felony convictions within five years,or who also committed related offenses and for those used a firearm,subd.b,reflect an intent to target for treatment only nonviolent,offenders and exclude those who may pose a danger to others.in our view,the inclusion of intoxicated drivers would be inconsistent with this intent because,unlike simple drug offenders,intoxicated drivers pose a substantial danger to the health and safety of others.see burg municipal court cal d,people schofield th,d.indeed,the purpose of vehicle code section,subdivision a is to protect members of the public who use the highways from those who have impaired their ability to drive as the result of substance use.people davalos,d supp,people woodard,d supp,see people bransford cal th,d,people malvitz d,th supp.
next,we note that the act applies to simple drug offenses involving controlled substances.vehicle code section,subdivision a proscribes driving under the influence of not only controlled substances but also alcohol or any drug.for example,one can violate the statute by driving under the influence of a lawfully possessed prescription or nonprescription medication or any lawful substance which could so affect the nervous system,brain,or muscles of a person as to impair,to an appreciable degree,his ability to drive a vehicle in the manner that an ordinarily prudent and cautious man,in full possession of his faculties,using reasonable care,would drive a similar vehicle under like conditions,defining drug as used in the statute,people olive d,th supp.conviction for driving under the influence of kava people keith,d supp,insulin.thus,although driving under the influence of noncontrolled substances like alcohol or a decongestant could not qualify as a nonviolent drug possession offense,driving under the influence of a controlled substance such as opium could theoretically qualify.however,nothing in the act indicates that it was designed for both simple drug offenders and that subgroup of intoxicated drivers who were under the influence of controlled substances 
last,we note that in the ballot pamphlet,the proponents of proposition asserted that it only affects simple drug possession.no other criminal laws are changed.ballot,supra,argument in favor of,italics added.however,the inclusion of one type of dui offender within the definition of nonviolent drug possession offenses would change the law by creating an anomalous exception to the statutory scheme for dealing with repeat dui offenders.see.this scheme reflects a legislative intent to punish multiple dui offenders with mandatory and increasingly more severe,from to jail terms,depending on the number of convictions.however,if those convicted of driving under the influence of a controlled substance were eligible under the act,then,after completing drug treatment,they could have their dui convictions expunged.see,subdivision d.thus,a second,third,or fourth conviction would be treated as a first offense however,those with multiple convictions of driving under the influence of alcohol or a noncontrolled substance would still be subject to the scheme of mandatory and increased punishment.as the people persuasively argue,it makes no sense to prohibit incarceration for those convicted of driving under the influence of controlled substances and thereby treat them more leniently than those convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol or lawfully possessed drugs and medications because an intoxicated driver poses a danger regardless of the substance he or she ingests.
in sum,we conclude that dui does not come within,and was not intended to come within,the statutory definition of a nonviolent drug possession offense.defense counsel conceded as much at the revocation hearing.moreover,our conclusion is consistent with cases holding that defendants charged with driving under the influence are not eligible for diversion under section,people covarrubias th,d people duncan d.it is also consistent with arizona proposition,upon which the act was patterned.see wozniak galati dui conviction rendered defendant ineligible under.
the next question we address is whether defendant dui conviction constitutes a qualifying probation violation as a misdemeanor for simple possession or use of drugs or drug paraphernalia,being present where drugs are used,or failure to register as a drug offender,or any activity similar to those listed in paragraph of subdivision d of section,subd.e d see fn,ante.even though a violation of vehicle code section,subdivision a is,by itself,a misdemeanor see,it is a misdemeanor for driving under the influence and not the specified conduct.moreover,given the focus of the act on nonviolent,drug offenders and the danger posed by intoxicated drivers,we consider dui to be fundamentally differen
