in,fannie mae announced one of the largest corporate earnings restatements in history.numerous investigations and official reports followed.the story of fannie mae told by these reports is disturbing.it thus comes as no surprise that the fannie mae accounting debacle has generated a wave of lawsuits.in this case,certain fannie mae shareholders filed a derivative suit on behalf of fannie mae against the company directors.the complaint targets the directors failure to prevent the accounting irregularities.the complaint also challenges the directors decision to approve severance arrangements for two fannie mae officers,franklin raines and timothy howard.
the parties agree that delaware law provides the substantive standards for evaluating plaintiffs complaint.shareholders ordinarily must make a demand on the company board of directors in order to bring a derivative suit.although these shareholders did not make such a demand,the law does not require demand when it would be futile.but consistent with the principle that directors and not shareholders manage a corporation,the delaware precedents on demand futility make clear that the bar is high,the standards are stringent,and the situations where demand will be excused are rare.
carefully applying the delaware precedents,the district court found that plaintiffs complaint failed to meet the test for demand futility and dismissed the case.we affirm.
fannie mae is a federally chartered corporation authorized by congress in and created in.initially established as a public entity,fannie mae was privatized in.fannie mae thus has shareholders,directors,and officers like other corporations.
fannie mae mission is to increase affordable housing for moderate and families.it purchases mortgages originated by other lenders and helps lenders convert their home loans into securities.the goal is to provide stability and liquidity to the mortgage market.this allows mortgage lenders to provide more loans,thereby increasing the rate of homeownership in america.
during the summer of,fannie mae sister organization freddie mac disclosed accounting irregularities.shortly thereafter,the office of federal housing enterprise oversight,an executive branch agency,reviewed fannie mae accounting.in september,ofheo released an interim report that highlighted deficiencies in fannie mae accounting policies,internal controls,and financial reporting.ofheo interim report led to an investigation by the securities and exchange commission.on december,the sec announced that it would require a billion earnings restatement by fannie mae.
six days after the sec announcement,two fannie mae officers ceo franklin raines and cfo timothy howard resigned.the board did not fire raines or howard for cause as a result,they were able to leave the company with approximately million in severance benefits.
in late,shareholders filed multiple derivative suits on behalf of fannie mae against fannie mae directors.see in re fed.mortgage ass,d.as relevant here,plaintiffs allege that fannie mae board of directors failed to exercise sufficient oversight to prevent the accounting violations.plaintiffs also contend that the outside directors on the board should have i terminated raines and howard for cause,thereby denying them severance benefits,and ii sued to obtain disgorgement of previous compensation raines and howard received.
shareholders bringing a derivative suit first must make a demand on the board,in effect asking the board to have the corporation pursue the claims itself.the shareholders here did not do so.they assert that demand is excused in this case because a majority of the directors could not render a disinterested and independent decision whether to pursue those claims the district court found that demand was not excused and dismissed the suit 
before turning to the merits of this appeal,we address jurisdiction.the parties all agree there is federal jurisdiction based on a,which authorizes fannie mae to sue and to be sued,and to complain and to defend,in any court of competent jurisdiction,state or federal.based on an independent assessment,we also conclude that this provision establishes federal jurisdiction.
in american national red cross,the supreme court considered a statute providing that the red cross could sue and be sued in courts of law and equity,state or federal,within the jurisdiction of the united states,d quoting now codified as amended at a.the court held that this clause conferred federal jurisdiction over cases in which the red cross was a party.red cross,at.in so ruling,the court articulated the general principle that a congressional charter sue and be sued provision may be read to confer federal court jurisdiction if,but only if,it specifically mentions the federal courts.id.at.emphasis added.the red cross court stated that express reference to federal courts in a federally chartered entity clause was necessary and sufficient to confer jurisdiction.id.at.emphasis added.
the red cross majority repeatedly characterized this principle as a rule,see id.at,noting that it had been established in the early century by osborn bank of united states,wheat,and subsequently confirmed in bankers trust texas pacific railway,and,duhme fdic.and the red cross dissenters similarly understood the rule clarity,although they disagreed with the rule content the court today concludes that whenever a statute granting a federally chartered corporation the power to sue and be sued specifically mentions the federal courts as opposed to merely embracing them within general language,the law will be deemed to confer on federal district courts jurisdiction over any and all controversies to which that corporation is a party.at.scalia,dissenting emphasis omitted.
applying the red cross rule to the present case,we find that there is federal jurisdiction because the fannie mae sue and be sued provision expressly refers to the federal courts in a manner similar to the red cross statute.to be sure,the fannie mae clause differs from the red cross statute in one respect it refers to any court of competent jurisdiction,state or federal,whereas the red cross statute refers to courts of law and equity,state or federal.compare a,with a.we agree,however,with the majority of district courts that have confronted the question since red cross section a provides federal jurisdiction in fannie mae cases.see,grun countrywide home loans,wl,at.july,connelly fed.mortgage ass n,d,port,mortgage,aff,cir peoples mortgage fed.mortgage ass n.
it is true that two district courts have reached the contrary conclusion,reasoning that applying the red cross rule to fannie mae is problematic because doing so,in their view,renders superfluous the words of competent jurisdiction in the fannie mae statute.see knuckles rbmg,d,fed.mortgage ass sealed,d.we disagree with the knuckles and sealed district court opinions.applying the red cross rule to the fannie mae statute does not render the words of competent jurisdiction superfluous.the words of competent jurisdiction help clarify that i litigants in state courts of limited jurisdiction must satisfy the appropriate jurisdictional requirements,see osborn,wheat.at finding federal jurisdiction because of statute empowering a federal corporation to sue and be sued in all state courts having competent jurisdiction,and in any circuit court of the united states internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added ii litigants,whether in federal or state court,must establish that court personal jurisdiction over the parties,see blackmar guerre.noting that a court of competent jurisdiction for the purpose of hearing suits against civil service commissioners must be one that possessed personal jurisdiction over those commissioners see also united states morton,d iii litigants relying on the provision can sue in federal district courts but not necessarily in all federal courts,see red cross,at.id.at.scalia,dissenting brief of at,am.red cross,d it is obvious that the district courts are intended to receive the jurisdiction conferred in clauses and iv where the tucker act otherwise might funnel cases to the court of federal claims,the federal district courts still possess jurisdiction,see ferguson union bank,cir applying of competent jurisdiction language in it could hardly have been intended by congress that suits for over against the administrator could be brought in any state court of general jurisdiction,but in the federal jurisdiction only in the court of claims.applying the red cross rule to the fannie mae statute thus does not render the words of competent jurisdiction meaningless 
the supreme court unanimous decision in breuer jim concrete of brevard,is consistent with our conclusion.see,d.there,the court held that the fair labor standards act clause did not bar removal of suits from state to federal court.id.at.b.in so holding,the court stated that there was no question that breuer could have begun his action in the district court given the language in the flsa to the fannie mae that an action may be maintained in any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction.at.quoting b alteration in original emphasis added.therefore,despite the presence of an of competent jurisdiction phrase,the court found no reason to doubt that the flsa clause conferred federal jurisdiction.
judge brown separate opinion appears to acknowledge that the original fannie mae clause in place from to conferred automatic federal jurisdiction in fannie mae cases,but says that congress eliminated this jurisdictional grant in by adding the words of competent jurisdiction.we disagree.after the statutory change,the jurisdictional provision of the fannie mae statute continues to refer to federal courts,thus still falling within the red cross rule we are bound to follow.moreover,we disagree with the separate opinion about the meaning and effect of that statutory change.
under the original statute,fannie mae was a governmental entity that could sue and be sued,complain and defend,in any court of law or equity,state or federal,c,stat.the housing act of maintained fannie mae governmental status,but completely revamped the legislation the addition of the phrase of competent jurisdiction to the clause was one of numerous changes.see,tit.ii,stat.unlike judge brown,we see no plausible reason that congress in would have continued to refer to federal courts in the understood since the osborn case in to confer federal jurisdiction in cases involving federally chartered then used the words of competent jurisdiction in an attempt to negate automatic federal jurisdiction.if congress in did not want to continue to confer federal jurisdiction in fannie mae cases,it logically would have omitted the word federal from the statute,not attempted a bank shot by adding the words of competent jurisdiction.
this analysis finds support from the fact that in same year that congress redrafted fannie mae also revised the provision of the federal savings and loan insurance corporation statute by deleting federal from the original fslic law.the fslic statute as amended read t o sue and be sued in any court of competent jurisdiction in the united states,stat,amending,c,stat,t o sue and be sued in any court of law or equity,state or federal.in other words,in congress established two substantially identical provisions,one for fannie mae and one for the fslic.and in,congress dropped the word federal from the fslic statute while keeping the word federal in the fannie mae statute.we must assume that congress knew the jurisdictional consequences of what it was doing in.the fact that congress chose to keep that word in the fannie mae statute but to delete it from the fslic statute is compelling evidence that fannie mae provision was meant to ensure continuing federal jurisdiction in fannie mae cases.
the separate opinion analysis of the of competent jurisdiction language also does not account for the congressional expectations associated with provisions during the middle of the century when this statutory change was made.a number of cases relevant to this issue had been decided in the years before.to begin with,since,the courts had concluded that express reference to federal courts in a clause of a federally chartered entity would ensure federal jurisdiction.see osborn,wheat.at red cross,at.earlier cases placed congress on prospective notice of the language necessary and sufficient to confer jurisdiction.in,moreover,the supreme court decision in blackmar guerre made clear that using the phrase of competent jurisdiction would serve the objective of requiring a plaintiff to establish personal jurisdiction in cases involving corporate entities like fannie mae.see blackmar,at.because of blackmar,congress might have thought the textual formula approved in in,duhme in any court of law or equity,state or federal did not suffice to require a showing of personal jurisdiction.in addition,as of,congress would not have thought that using the phrase of competent jurisdiction could negate federal jurisdiction in fannie mae cases several recent circuit precedents had interpreted clauses that included the phrase of competent jurisdiction and found federal jurisdiction.see george evans united states,cir seven oaks fed.hous,cir ferguson union bank,cir.the evans and ferguson cases specifically relied on the of competent jurisdiction language,moreover,to hold that federal district courts had jurisdiction over cases involving federal entities that otherwise might be considered subject to the tucker act and shoehorned into the court of claims.therefore,we think it abundantly clear that congress in would not have thought or intended the words of competent jurisdiction to negate automatic federal jurisdiction for fannie mae cases 
in sum,in interpreting the fannie mae statute,we see no need to muddy the waters by departing from red cross clear rule for interpreting the text of a federally chartered entity clause.and even if we were to go beyond that rule in this case,the legislative background to congress statutory amendment strongly supports automatic federal jurisdiction in fannie mae cases.we therefore hold that fannie mae clause confers federal jurisdiction.
the jurisdictional issue resolved,we turn to the merits of the complaint.
plaintiffs concede that they did not attempt to make a demand on the board as is ordinarily required for shareholder derivative suits.rather,plaintiffs allege that a demand on the board would have been futile because a majority of the board was not disinterested and independent.
when plaintiffs filed the relevant complaint,there were directors on fannie mae board.this included three corporate officers franklin raines,timothy howard,and daniel mudd.it also included outside directors stephen ashley,kenneth duberstein,thomas gerrity,ann korologos,frederic malek,donald marron,anne mulcahy,joe pickett,leslie rahl,and patrick swygert.to prove demand futility,plaintiffs must prove that a majority of the board at the time of the,at least seven the necessary disinterestedness and independence to evaluate the suit.for purposes of this appeal only,it is conceded that raines,howard,and mudd were not disinterested and independent.so for demand to be excused,the complaint must create a reasonable doubt about the disinterestedness or independence of at least four of the outside directors.see aronson lewis.
federal rule of civil procedure mandates that a complaint in a shareholder derivative suit state with particularity the reasons for not making the effort to make a demand.fed.civ.b.plaintiffs state three main reasons to support their argument of demand futility.
first,plaintiffs allege that demand is excused on their claims.they argue that there was a reasonable doubt about the directors disinterestedness to consider a demand because,in plaintiffs view,there is a substantial likelihood that a majority of the directors would be liable on the claims for failure to exercise proper oversight.see rales blasband,internal quotation marks omitted.
second,plaintiffs allege that demand is excused on their claims.they allege that there was a reasonable doubt about the board disinterestedness to consider a demand because,in plaintiffs view,the directors did not exercise valid business judgment in approving the severance arrangements for raines and howard.see aronson,at.
third,plaintiffs allege that demand is excused on both sets of claims because there was a reasonable doubt about a majority of the board independence to consider a demand in light of the various professional,charitable,and personal entanglements among board members.see beam stewart.
with respect to the claims,plaintiffs contend that demand is excused because there was a reasonable doubt about the disinterestedness of a majority of the directors they claim that a majority of the directors face a substantial likelihood of personal liability as a result of their failure to exercise sufficient oversight.see rales,at.
liability predicated on a board failure to exercise oversight is possibly the most difficult theory in corporation law upon which a plaintiff might hope to win a judgment.in re caremark int l.derivative,see also stone ritter.the standard requires conduct that is qualitatively different from,and more culpable than,the conduct giving rise to a violation of the fiduciary duty of care,gross negligence.stone,at.as relevant here,plaintiffs must allege particularized facts demonstrating that the directors knew that they were not discharging their fiduciary obligations and failed to act in the face of a known duty to act,thereby demonstrating a conscious disregard for their responsibilities.id.at.
according to plaintiffs,the complaint alleges that the directors crossed that line by failing to adequately respond to several red flags a million audit difference originating in a whistleblower complaints that fannie mae was improperly manipulating earnings signs that fannie mae management was using improper hedge accounting practices and sister company freddie mac disclosure in that it had understated profits.plaintiffs br.at.we disagree that these allegations create a substantial likelihood of personal liability for the directors.on each claim,the board or its relevant committee looked into the matter and relied on internal or external accounting experts and officials responsible for those matters.as the district court correctly stated,plaintiffs own allegations demonstrate that the directors actually responded to each of the red flags cited by plaintiffs.in re fed.mortgage ass,d,emphasis omitted.under delaware law,a board of directors is not a board of accountants.although the allegations if true may show negligence by the board,they do not meet the very high standards set by delaware law for director oversight liability.
first,plaintiffs claim that the directors ignored a million audit difference originating in.second am.comp.at.that year,fannie mae incurred million of expenses on its mortgage holdings.id.at.instead of adjusting its income by million,fannie mae adjusted its income by million and deferred the remaining expenses to subsequent years.id.at.deferring the expenses and engaging in other manipulative accounting practices enabled fannie mae to meet its performance target and thus increased the company executives compensation.id.at.
plaintiffs claim that the directors ignored the audit difference.but plaintiffs own allegations demonstrate that the directors did in fact address the issue.second am.comp.at.the complaint states that the audit standing committee of the board of with kpmg,fannie mae outside auditor,to discuss the audit difference.and kpmg agreed with fannie mae treatment of the expenses.id.
under delaware law,directors are insulated from liability when they rely in good faith on the opinions of outside experts who are acting within their expertise.see ann.tit.e brehm eisner.the complaint shows that the audit committee relied on kpmg opinions with respect to the audit difference,which turned this allegedly red flag into a green flag.
second,according to plaintiffs,the directors ignored whistleblower roger barnes complaints that fannie mae was improperly manipulating earnings.second am.comp.at.barnes was a accountant in,he wrote a detailed memorandum to internal auditors regarding what he considered to be improper accounting practices at fannie mae.id.at.the complaint alleges that the audit committee of the board learned about the memorandum but deliberately dismissed barnes revelations,letting them lie without further investigation and permitting the accounting violations to continue.
but again,the complaint shows that the audit committee responded.id.at.shortly after learning of the memo,the audit committee,company executives,and kpmg convened to review and discuss barnes allegations.ofheo final report,joint appendix.at this meeting,the audit committee expressed satisfaction with the results of the review and commended company officers for working quickly to address the concerns.second am.comp.at internal quotation marks omitted.
as explained above,directors are insulated from liability when they rely in good faith on the opinions of outside experts who are acting within their expertise.directors also are fully protected in relying in good faith upon the opinions,reports or statements presented to the corporation by any of the corporation officers or employees,so long as the board reasonably believes that such matters are within such other person professional or expert competence.code ann.tit.e.with respect to the barnes memorandum,plaintiffs have not put forth particularized facts undermining the audit committee reliance on officials who were responsible for these issues and who assured the committee that the situation had been resolved.it is not as if the audit committee took the barnes memo from the and put it in the without taking any action.
third,plaintiffs allege that the assets and liabilities policy standing committee of the board of have known that management was using improper hedge accounting practices.according to plaintiffs,fannie mae executives improperly applied hedge accounting principles to derivatives,thereby spreading the company losses on derivatives over a number of years rather than booking them immediately.but the complaint alleges only that the directors should have known about the accounting violations even though kpmg assessed the implementation of this accounting policy.second am.comp.at.again,therefore,this allegation does not create a substantial likelihood of personal liability under the standards of delaware law for director oversight claims.
fourth,plaintiffs assert that the directors failed to sufficiently react after fannie mae sister organization freddie mac disclosed in that it had understated profits in an effort to smooth earnings and maintain its image on wall street as a steady performer.second am.comp.at.plaintiffs allege that the similarities between fannie mae and freddie mac and the common issues that were the focus of the freddie mac violations should have serve d as red flags alerting the directors to fannie mae financial manipulations.id.at.the problem for plaintiffs is that the board of directors responded to the news about freddie mac.the directors met multiple times to discuss the freddie mac situation.second am.comp.at.at those meetings,the company financial officers contrasted freddie mac practices with fannie mae and assured the board that fannie mae accounting was sound.see ofheo final report.again,because the outside directors relied on representations of internal financial experts,they are protected against personal liability.
in sum,the complaint fails to establish a substantial likelihood of personal liability for the outside directors on the claims.therefore,under delaware law,the allegations do not create a reasonable doubt about the disinterestedness of the board to consider a demand with respect to those claims 
on the claims,plaintiffs allege that the directors decisions to allow raines and howard to resign or retire with more than million in severance benefits and to absolve the executives of their legal obligation to disgorge compensation that they had procured via accounting manipulations and insider trading create a reasonable doubt that they were the product of a valid business judgment by the directors.plaintiffs br.at aronson,at 
the business judgment rule establishes a presumption that in making a business decision the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis,in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company.aronson,at.as plaintiffs acknowledge,the business judgment rule protects decisions unless no reasonable business person would have made the decision.plaintiffs br.at internal quotation marks omitted.under this principle,courts rarely directors compensation and severance decisions because the size and structure of executive compensation are inherently matters of judgment.brehm,at.plaintiffs thus must allege particularized facts sufficient to raise a reason to doubt that the action was taken honestly and in good faith or a reason to doubt that the board was adequately informed in making the decision.see in re walt disney.derivative,disney ii.
to support their claim that the directors severance decision was not a valid business judgment,plaintiffs rely on the disney ii case.there,the delaware chancery court found that the board decision not to seek a termination based on fault or to inquire into the terms and conditions of the termination agreement was not entitled to the protection of the business judgment rule.see disney ii,at.as the disney ii court described it,the complaint demonstrated that the defendant directors consciously and intentionally disregarded their responsibilities,adopting a we do care about the risks attitude concerning a material corporate decision.id.at emphasis omitted.the court accordingly concluded that plaintiffs sufficiently alleged that the directors breached their obligation to act honestly and in good faith in the corporation best interests and thus their decision fell outside the protection of the business judgment rule.id.
but plaintiffs here fail to allege particularized facts that demonstrate that the process was similarly flawed or that the directors acted without adequate information or deliberation.the complaint itself acknowledges that the termination decision was made in a series of board meetings held over several days.second am.comp.at termination decision discussed in board meetings on december,and.
the complaint alleges that the issue was not discussed by the compensation committee,which had no meetings during this timeframe.id.but that is a red herring because the compensation committee is a standing committee of the board of directors.the individuals who sat on the compensation committee also sat on the board of directors,and the full board met at length to discuss the severance issue.
plaintiffs also point to the fact that the directors made the decision without the assistance of any compensation consultants.but that is irrelevant the question in this case is not about an initial compensation package but instead a judgment about termination and what kind of severance was best for the short and interests of the company.
plaintiffs allege that even if procedurally sound,the severance decision was substantively flawed because raines and howard fraudulent acts constituted grounds to terminate them for cause.but in the analogous case of brehm eisner,the supreme court of delaware dismissed a similar claim because the complaint failed to allege that the directors did not act within their discretion in awarding an underperforming executive a severance package.the court found two business reasons that could support the directors decision first,the company would likely have to litigate any dispute over the reasons for termination and persuade a trier of fact and law that the decision was warranted under the contract.id.at.second,that process of persuasion could involve expensive litigation,distraction of executive time and company resources,lost opportunity costs,more bad publicity and an outcome that was uncertain at best and,at worst,could have resulted in damages against the company.id.
so too here.even if the directors had grounds to invoke the for cause termination provisions,the directors reasonably could have decided not to invoke those provisions because fannie mae likely would have had to spend enormous time and resources over many years litigating the decision.the board reasonably may have decided that going forward,it was more important to cut ties and dedicate the company resources to righting the ship.
plaintiffs also contest the directors decision not to sue raines and howard for disgorgement under of the act of.a.that statutory provision establishes that the sec may sue the ceo and cfo of a company when the company has been required to restate its earnings due to noncompliance with securities laws.id.
the problem is that does not create a private right of action.and contrary to the suggestion in plaintiffs brief,which relies on cases,courts today rarely create implied private rights of action courts generally deem it congress prerogative to make that decision.see stoneridge inv.partners,d kogan robinson,d,holding that does not create private remedy in re whitehall jewellers.derivative,wl,at same in re bisys group.derivative action,d,same neer pelino,d,same.as a result,the directors decision not to devote corporate assets to pursue such an uncertain cause of action was certainly a reasonable one.
in sum on the claims,the complaint fails to create a reasonable doubt about the board disinterestedness to consider a demand because it fails to create a reasonable doubt whether the board exercised a valid business judgment 
finally,plaintiffs argue that nearly all of the outside directors lacked the necessary independence to evaluate the demand because the fannie mae foundation made charitable donations to organizations affiliated with individual board members,the directors had other conflicting business and personal relationships with each other,and raines otherwise controlled and dominated the directors.see rales,at aronson,at.independence means that a director decision is based on the corporate merits of the subject before the board rather than extraneous considerations or influences.aronson,at.
the brief for the directors dismisses those allegations as plainly insufficient under delaware law.yet in their reply brief,plaintiffs make no mention of this independence argument.although not a waiver,the reply brief silence on the subject is a telling indication of this argument lack of weight under delaware law.
the basic hurdle for plaintiffs stems from the fact that the kinds of relationships alleged in the complaint exist at many companies.directors tend to be experienced and accomplished business persons those individuals also tend to be comparatively wealthy and have a wide range of professional and charitable affiliations and relationships.it is usually considered in the interests of corporations and their shareholders to attract experienced and accomplished business leaders as directors.so as not to preclude service by such persons,delaware law creates a very high bar for using the kinds of relationships alleged here as a basis for finding a lack of independence and thereby excusing demand in a derivative suit.
first,the complaint alleges that outside directors duberstein,gerrity,malek,marron,swygert,and korologos are beholden to raines because he was chairman of the board of the fannie mae foundation,which made charitable grants to organizations with which the directors were affiliated.second am.comp.at.for those donations to be relevant,plaintiffs must allege that raines has the unilateral power to decide whether the challenged director continues to receive a benefit orman cullman.but the complaint does not allege any particularized facts showing that raines controlled who received donations or determined the size of grants.we thus conclude that the contributions to charities and organizations provide no basis for us to question the independence of the directors for purposes of delaware law.
second,plaintiffs allege that outside directors duberstein,pickett,korologos,malek,marron,ashley,and swygert have business personal relationships with each other,or with immediate families of other defendants,that would conflict with their ability to objectively determine whether it would be appropriate to bring suit against other fannie mae current and former officers directors.second am.comp.at.but allegations of mere personal friendship or a mere outside business relationship,standing alone,are insufficient to raise a reasonable doubt about a director independence.stewart,at.only professional or personal friendships that border on or even exceed familial loyalty and closeness may raise a reasonable doubt whether a director can appropriately consider demand.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the delaware supreme court has instructed that n ot all friendships,or even most of them,rise to this level and the court can not make a reasonable inference that a particular friendship does so without specific factual allegations to support such a conclusion.id.internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted.we need not dally long on this allegation the commonplace business,professional,and personal relationships alleged in this case are not remotely sufficient under delaware law to disqualify the challenged directors from evaluating demand in an independent manner.
third,plaintiffs allege that the directors lacked independence because raines controlled a majority of the board.but the complaint cites no particularized facts to support this charge other than that the board often approved raines proposed decisions.this does not suffice under delaware law to demonstrate that raines so controlled the directors decisionmaking as to mean they lacked independence to consider a demand.as the delaware courts have stated,the shorthand shibboleth of dominated and controlled directors is insufficient.aronson,at internal quotation marks omitted.
in sum,under the standards set forth by delaware law,the complaint allegations do not create a reasonable doubt about the board independence to consider a demand.
we affirm the district court judgment dismissing the complaint.
so ordered.
after pages of briefing by attorneys who have strained to squeeze this case into their preferred courtroom,i after reading the majority t heard a decent argument for federal jurisdiction.all parties in this litigation teamed up to manufacture jurisdiction,but,needless to say,parties can not create jurisdiction,see kline burke constr.neither can judges,for doing so misappropriates congress role,and invalidly scoops cases out of state court.and these principles are especially important in a case where congress amended the supposedly jurisdictional statute to make clear fannie mae may only sue or be sued in courts that have competent jurisdiction that is,jurisdiction.the majority misreading of supreme court precedent and disregard for statutory text lead it to erroneously conclude we have jurisdiction.
fannie mae clause does not,as the majority contends,create automatic federal jurisdiction,see op.at.most of the majority mistakes flow from its misinterpretation of american national red cross,d.
in red cross,the court declared a congressional charter sue and be sued provision may be read to confer federal court jurisdiction if,but only if,it specifically mentions the federal courts.at.emphasis added.based on this language,the majority concludes fannie mae clause creates jurisdiction simply because it mentions the federal courts.i would apply this silly test if red cross actually created it.but red cross did no such thing.rather,red cross stands for the unremarkable rule that mentioning federal courts is necessary,but not always sufficient,to confer jurisdiction.three key rationales support this commonsense interpretation.
first,the majority reading of red cross is implausible.consider this hypothetical statutory provision fannie mae may sue and be sued in federal court only if another statute independently confers jurisdiction.under the majority test,this hypothetical provision would create automatic federal jurisdiction simply because it mentions federal though the text evinces a contrary meaning.but that can not be a mere mention of federal courts can not justify disregarding statutory barriers to federal jurisdiction.in short,the phrase federal courts is a talisman.
second,the majority mis interpretation of red cross is belied by red cross itself.after all,if a mere textual mention of federal courts was sufficient,then the red cross court wasted many pages articulating other rationales and examining the jurisprudential backdrop against which congress enacted the red cross charter.certainly a brief discussion would have sufficed to create the talismanic i see the phrase federal courts so it must be jurisdictional test.instead,red cross substantially relied on the timing of an amendment to red cross charter by applying the canon that congress is presumed to intend the judicially settled meaning of terms.red cross,at.see mart united food commercial workers int l union,local,cir per curiam red cross is premised on this canon.red cross also discussed numerous sources of legislative history.at.but the majority interpretation would render these portions of red cross entirely meaningless,and i am reluctant to reach that conclusion about supreme court decisions.agri processor,nlrb,kavanaugh,dissenting.
third,red cross use of the word may is significant.red cross announced that a clause mentioning federal courts may be read to confer federal court jurisdiction.id.at.emphasis added.importantly,the word may is generally employed to imply permissive,optional or discretional,and not mandatory action.black law dictionary deluxe ed see,united states lexington mill elevator.thus,when a clause mentions federal courts,a court is permitted to interpret the clause as conferring jurisdiction,and it should do so only when the statutory text and amendment history support such a reading.red cross did not command federal courts to shirk their responsibility to examine the ordinary sense of the language used and basic canons of statutory construction,at,in reaching an ultimate conclusion about the clause meaning 
in sum,under red cross,a clause mentioning federal courts may or may not be mentioning federal courts is necessary but not always sufficient to confer jurisdiction.and even if red cross flirted with a test by emphasizing federal courts and ignoring other aspects of the red cross charter text,the court could not have intended to apply this test where congress specifically amended the charter to add a jurisdictional limitation,as congress did here.
interpreting fannie mae clause according to the ordinary sense of the language used and basic canons of statutory construction,red cross,at,demonstrates the clause does not create jurisdiction.according to the majority,a charter provision authorizing fannie mae to sue and be sued in any court of competent jurisdiction is a declaration that all federal district courts have competent jurisdiction.see emphasis added op.at.because competent jurisdiction a phrase not present in the red cross to jurisdiction,fannie mae may only sue or be sued in any court that has an independent source of jurisdiction.
in congress amended fannie mae charter by inserting the words in any court of competent jurisdiction.compare,c,stat,authorizing fannie mae t o sue and be sued,complain and defend,in any court of law or equity,state or federal emphasis added,with,stat,authorizing fannie mae to sue and to be sued,and to complain and to defend,in any court of competent jurisdiction,state or federal emphasis added.red cross explained that such a change in language should be read,if possible,to have some effect.at.see also fund for animals,kempthorne,c ourts presume that congress has used its scarce legislative time to enact statutes that have some legal consequence.
our task is to determine what congress accomplished by adding the phrase court of competent jurisdiction.as the supreme court has repeatedly emphasized,the phrase competent jurisdiction almost always refers to jurisdiction.see,wachovia bank,ass schmidt,d united states morton,d califano sanders,d suggesting a statute required an independent jurisdictional foundation largely because it limited judicial review to a court of competent jurisdiction,which seem ed to look to outside sources of jurisdictional authority kontrick ryan,d.just two years ago,the court unambiguously declared jurisdiction concerns a court competence to adjudicate a particular category of cases.wachovia bank,at.emphasis added see kontrick,at.treating what cases courts are competent to adjudicate as an issue of jurisdiction.competent jurisdiction rarely refers to personal jurisdiction.indeed,a s far back as pennoyer neff,courts drew a clear distinction between a court competence and its jurisdiction over the parties.morton,at.leading commentators likewise treat a court competence to hear a case as an issue of jurisdiction.see charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure jurisdiction ed.so does black law dictionary.black law dictionary,ed defining court of competent jurisdiction as one having power and authority of law to do the particular act,and explaining the term competent authority,a s applied to courts,means legal authority to deal with the particular matter in question id,ed same.
the majority contends the supreme court overruled this meaning of competent jurisdiction in one vague in breuer jim concrete of brevard,d.see op.at.but c ourts do not normally overturn a long line of earlier cases without mentioning the matter,john sand gravel united states,d,and they especially do not do so in equivocal.perhaps this is why the have not exactly been shy about making jurisdictional arguments that stretch the bounds of to place much reliance on breuer,even when specifically prompted to do so at oral argument 
flailing to find some meaning for the statute competent jurisdiction limitation,the majority claims congress inserted this phrase to clarify that litigants in state courts of limited jurisdiction must satisfy the appropriate jurisdictional requirements.see op.at.i disagree.for if authorization to sue and be sued in any court of competent jurisdiction,state or federal,clarifies that there must be a separate source of state jurisdiction,why does it not also clarify that there must be an independent source of federal jurisdiction see a.surely competent jurisdiction modifies both state and federal in fannie mae charter.see id.in addition,the majority citation of the statute construed in osborn bank of the united states is ironic,because the competent jurisdiction phrase in that statute only referred to state courts but not federal courts.see wheat.authorizing suit in all state courts having competent jurisdiction,and in any circuit court of the united states.if,as the majority asserts,congress added competent jurisdiction to fannie mae charter to clarify that an independent jurisdictional grant is required in state but not federal courts,one would expect the verbal formulation to look something like the statute in osborn.it does not.
in another effort to give competent jurisdiction some meaning,appellees imply the phrase might refer to personal jurisdiction.although this interpretation is contrary to the phrase ordinary meaning,morton,at,the majority embraces this interpretation,see op.at.however,appellees argument is quite telling,because the furthest they will go is to argue personal jurisdiction occasionally represents one component of a court competent jurisdiction.rule j letter,emphasis added blackmar guerre.interpreting competent jurisdiction to require personal jurisdiction,but giving no indication that an independent source of jurisdiction was not also required.there are two types of jurisdiction personal jurisdiction and jurisdiction.kontrick,at.robert casad william richman,jurisdiction in civil actions ed.if,as appellees argue,personal jurisdiction is one of the components of a court competent jurisdiction,then the other component must be jurisdiction.thus,appellees best argument is that the clause requires personal jurisdiction and an independent source of jurisdiction.if that is the case,the clause does not create jurisdiction.
the majority also suggests the words competent jurisdiction clarify that litigants relying on the provision can sue in federal district courts but not necessarily in all federal courts.op.at.but the authority cited by the majority directly undercuts this proposition.the majority cites the supreme court conclusion that red cross authorization to sue and be sued in federal court only includes district all federal courts.see op.at citing red cross,at.id.at.scalia,dissenting.but if that is the case,congress would have no need to clarify this point by adding the competent jurisdiction language.
at bottom,the majority provides no convincing reason to give the statute words anything other than their ordinary meaning.because competent jurisdiction refers to jurisdiction,fannie mae clause is functionally equivalent to the hypothetical statute described at the beginning of this opinion fannie mae may sue and be sued in any court of competent jurisdiction,meaning it may only sue in a court with an independent basis of jurisdiction.yet the majority presses its conclusion that this clause creates jurisdiction.i disagree,and the additional interpretive principles to which i now turn support my textual analysis.
red cross relied on the canon that congress is presumed to intend the judicially settled meaning of terms,at,but that canon undercuts the majority position here.in,the court held the fdic charter was jurisdictional.see id.at.just five years later,in,congress amended the red cross charter,making its language in all relevant respects identical to the fdic charter.id.at.the red cross court found this significant,explaining congress may well have relied on the court holding to infer that amending the red cross charter in this way would make it jurisdictional.id.at.see id.at.mart,at red cross is premised on this principle.but red cross rationale cuts exactly the opposite way here.fannie mae charter had contained text virtually identical to that already deemed jurisdictional by the court,but then congress decided to add a phrase that functions as a jurisdictional restriction.thus,unlike red cross,where the amendment tug ged hard toward a jurisdictional reading,id.at,here congress inserted a phrase that militates against such a reading.
in addition,congress placed the competent jurisdiction limitation in fannie mae not freddie mac clause,which is almost the same in every other respect.compare a authorizing fannie mae to sue and to be sued,and to complain and to defend,in any court of competent jurisdiction,state or federal emphasis added,with c authorizing freddie mac to sue and be sued,complain and defend,in any state,federal,or other court.we should be reluctant to disregard this important difference in when the two provisions containing the disparate language appear in the same title of the code and involve such interrelated organizations as fannie mae and freddie mac.see,branch smith,d plurality noting it is,of course,the most rudimentary rule of statutory construction that courts do not interpret statutes in isolation,but in the context of the corpus juris of which they are a part.
in sum,each interpretive tool utilized by the red cross text,the amendment timeline of the charter juxtaposed against relevant supreme court decisions,interpretive canons,and other statutory fannie mae clause does not create jurisdiction.
at first blush,it might seem reasonable for jurisdiction to exist in all cases where a federally chartered entity such as fannie mae is a party.however,a federal court can not declare it has power jurisdiction over a case simply by declaring it would be good policy for it to have that power.see pub.citizen highway trafic safety,t his court simply is not at liberty to displace,or to improve upon,the jurisdictional choices of congress,and d iscretionary considerations of fairness or efficiency do not authorize us to disregard plain statutory terms assigning a different court initial jurisdiction over a suit.i can not employ such a approach,because it is not courts job to make less when that policy inflates the judicial role at the expense of congress and the states.see kline,at.holding the lower federal courts derive their jurisdiction wholly from the authority of congress wright,miller,cooper,supra,i f the federal courts entertain cases not within their jurisdiction,an unconstitutional invasion
