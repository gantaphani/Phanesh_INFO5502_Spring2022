southern california painters allied trades,district council the union brought suit,alleging that rodin,rodin and southern california painting,scp were alter egos,and that rodin was therefore bound by the master labor agreement signed by scp.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the district court judgment in favor of rodin and scp.
background 
rodin is a commercial painting contractor in los angeles.it has been in business for over eighteen years,employs more than seventy people,and completes more than one thousand commercial painting jobs each year.fred rodin is the sole shareholder of rodin and is responsible for its daily operations.rodin is not a party to any union collective bargaining agreements.ron benveniste and fred rodin have been friends since the.benveniste established a residential painting business in.in,he wanted to expand his business to include commercial painting services,so he consulted with fred,who already had experience in the commercial painting market.he told benveniste that there were painting jobs rodin could not perform as a contractor,and recommended that benveniste create a union company.fred also advised that starting a union company would allow benveniste to call the union when he needed painters rather than maintain a standing workforce.
on september,benveniste formed scp.in march,benveniste signed the union master labor agreement mla on behalf of scp,which allowed scp to bid on union projects and required scp to meet certain obligations,such as paying union wages on all of its projects.the mla prohibited scp from,that is,running both union and painting businesses.when the first mla expired in,scp signed a second mla,which was in effect from until june.
scp rented office space separate from benveniste residential painting business,and bought furniture,purchased supplies,and installed telephone and fax lines at its office.fred introduced benveniste to contractors who performed union jobs.he asked some rodin employees to provide startup help to scp,and calls and faxes to scp were often forwarded to rodin offices.fred also informally asked one of his employees,candace weisz,to help benveniste set up his bookkeeping.weisz set up payroll,payables and receivables,and helped benveniste complete union paperwork,for which she was not compensated.rodin employees were not asked to track the time they spent on scp matters they believed that the time they spent handling scp matters was trivial and would last only until scp had sufficient capital to hire its own staff.the parties dispute whether fred rodin also contributed several thousand dollars in money for scp.neither fred nor rodin,however,had an ownership interest in or received any benefits from scp.
aside from this assistance,the union alleged that rodin and scp worked together or overlapped on several jobs.one was the ticketmaster job.scp had been hired to paint ticketmaster offices and needed to use a specific product to complete the job according to the contract.scp contacted the union several times over a period,but the union was unable to provide anyone familiar with the product.to finish the contract,scp hired four painters who were familiar with the product.some of the workers scp hired also had worked for rodin,although rodin played no role in hiring these painters and received no compensation for their work.benveniste does not recall if he paid the painters the prevailing union wage.after a hearing,the union fined scp for hiring painters.scp paid the fine.
the second job in which scp and rodin both were involved was the bank of america job.rodin had received an invitation to bid on the job,but could not because it was a union job.scp,however,successfully bid on the job and executed a contract on september.a year later,in september,the contractor issued a change order specifying that rodin would complete some work.in october,rodin entered a subcontract to perform additional work on the bank of america project.
from to,scp performed only seventeen jobs.during the same period rodin performed over jobs.in mid,benveniste concluded that it was not profitable to run scp,and scp ceased operations.
procedural history 
the union brought suit against rodin and scp seeking a declaratory judgment that rodin and scp were a single employer alter egos,monetary damages and other relief for breach of the collective bargaining agreement and violations of california law.the union alleged that as a single employer or alter egos,rodin and scp were both bound by the mla.the union further alleged that rodin formed scp to avoid rodin obligations under the mla.finally,the union alleged that rodin and scp breached the mla by running a dual shop and that rodin failed to abide by the mla in a variety of ways.
rodin,joined by scp,and the union filed for summary judgment.the district court ruled only on the federal claims for declaratory relief and breach of the mla.it found that scp and rodin were not alter egos,and therefore granted summary judgment in favor of rodin and scp on those claims.
in response to the district court order,the union filed another motion for summary judgment,focusing on the single employer theory of liability against scp only.in july,the district court requested a status report addressing whether scp was still a signatory to any mla.in response,scp contended that it was no longer bound by the mla because it had given notice to the union of its cessation of operations and the mla had expired june.the union claimed that because scp had not given proper notice of its inactive status,the mla had automatically renewed and scp was bound by the successor mla.on august,the district court found that scp was no longer a signatory to any mla still in effect and had not conducted business since.it then denied as moot the remaining claims because the union failed to show it was entitled to any damages or declaratory relief.the district court entered judgment in favor of rodin and scp on all federal claims and dismissed the state law claims.the union timely appealed.
ii.analysis 
there are two related but distinct theories,the alter ego and single employer doctrines,that prevent contractors from using operations to avoid collective bargaining obligations ua local plumbing,cir.both theories,which overlap substantially,require the district court first to determine whether the two entities are a single employer.id.at dariano sons,dist.council of painters,cir.this determination entails examining the degree of common ownership,management,operations,and labor relations.plumbing,at.if the threshold single employer requirement is met,the next step depends on the theory of liability pursued.id.
the district court assumed without deciding that rodin and scp met the single employer requirement we also assume without deciding that rodin and scp were a single employer.with that assumption,we address below the alter ego and single employer doctrines.we then turn to whether the union claim for declaratory relief against scp is moot.finally,we address whether the district court properly dismissed the remaining state law claims.
alter ego and single employer liability of rodin and scp 
alter ego liability 
the alter ego doctrine is designed to prevent employers from escaping their collective bargaining obligations by shifting work to firms they also own.plumbing,at.employers may not create alter egos for the fraudulent purpose of shifting union work to a company and thereby engaging in a sham to avoid their collective bargaining obligations.id.at see also howard johnson,detroit local joint executive,d describing an alter ego as a paper transaction without any meaningful impact on the ownership or operation of the enterprise for the purpose of avoiding a unionized company collective bargaining agreements brick masons pension trust indus.fence supply,cir.
the alter ego doctrine applies if two entities function as a single employer and the entity is being used in a sham effort to avoid collective bargaining obligations,rather than for the pursuit of legitimate business objectives untainted by union animus.plumbing,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the plaintiff has the bu
