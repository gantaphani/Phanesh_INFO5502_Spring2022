when is a new employer a successor in interest to a former employer under the family and medical leave act of fmla,the answer matters because an employee is not eligible for the protections of the fmla until he or she has worked for a particular employer for at least months,and the term employer includes any successor in interest of an employer.a ii.today we adopt the persuasive reasoning of grace uscar,cir,and apply the regulations promulgated by the united states department of labor dol at.after doing so,we conclude that plaintiff christina sullivan is not entitled to fmla benefits because her new employer,defendant dollar tree stores,dollar tree,for whom she worked for less than months,is not a successor in interest of her former employer,factory.accordingly,we affirm the summary judgment in dollar tree favor.
factual and procedural history 
factory was a retail store that sold discount clothing.at its height,factory operated more than stores in the western united states and employed more than people.seven stores were located in the area of southeastern washington kennewick,richland,and pasco,and each of those stores had about employees.plaintiff christina sullivan was the store manager of the pasco factory store.
by,however,factory had filed for chapter bankruptcy.in september,the bankruptcy court approved the sale of factory existing leasehold on the pasco store and other store leaseholds to dollar tree.dollar tree is a chain retail store that sells a variety of items,including clothing,for one dollar.apart from the leaseholds,dollar tree purchased no other assets of factory.others purchased the remainder of factory assets.at the end of september,the factory store in pasco closed its doors.
dollar tree opened for business at the pasco location four weeks later.during those four weeks,dollar tree reconfigured the store.first,a construction crew remodeled the interior to support a dollar tree store,in accordance with dollar tree specifications.second,a setup team prepared the inventory,stocked the shelves with dollar tree merchandise,and performed other preparatory work.finally,on october,dollar tree opened for business in the former location of factory,with to dollar tree employees.
in september,plaintiff filled out an application for employment with dollar tree.dollar tree hired her as an assistant manager of the dollar tree store at the same pasco location.even though the store was closed for four weeks,plaintiff employment was continuous.during the first two weeks of the renovations in pasco,plaintiff trained at a dollar tree store in nearby richland.after her training,plaintiff then assisted with the preparatory work at the pasco store.when the pasco store opened,plaintiff began work at that store as an assistant manager.only one other former factory employee worked at the new dollar tree store in pasco after its opening 
from september until may,plaintiff worked as assistant manager at the pasco dollar tree without incident.in may,plaintiff mother experienced serious health problems,and plaintiff provided assistance and care for her.dollar tree granted plaintiff some amount of unpaid leave but less than plaintiff requested.plaintiff either quit or was fired in late may or june.
plaintiff eventually contacted the dol,which initiated an investigation of whether dollar tree had violated the fmla.the dol concluded that dollar tree actions had violated the fmla and informed the parties of its conclusion.during the negotiations that followed,dollar tree offered plaintiff reinstatement to her former position at the pasco store,a partial payment of toward lost wages,and certain other benefits such as accrued sick leave.although plaintiff had sought more than in lost wages,she accepted the and began work again on april.
after her reinstatement,plaintiff continued working at the pasco dollar tree store until she quit voluntarily in december.soon thereafter,plaintiff filed this action in federal court seeking the full amount of her lost wages.the district court held that dollar tree was not a successor in interest under the fmla and granted summary judgment to dollar tree.plaintiff timely appeals.

discussion 
preliminary questions 
plaintiff submitted many documents in support of her case,two of which are relevant here.first,plaintiff submitted a report prepared by the dol during or after its investigation of plaintiff complaints dol report.second,she submitted her own affidavit.plaintiff argues that the district court erred by disregarding certain statements in the two documents 
dol report 
plaintiff argues that the district court erred when it held that the dol report was inadmissible hearsay not exempted by federal rule of evidence c,which provides 
the following are not excluded by the hearsay rule,even though the declarant is available as a witness 
public records and reports.records,reports,statements,or data compilations,in any form,of public offices or agencies,setting forth c in civil actions and proceedings factual findings resulting from an investigation made pursuant to authority granted by law,unless the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.
the disputed portion of the dol report states 
dollar tree stores,a covered employer,is considered a successor in interest to the covered employer factory stores.the circumstances of the transition that occurred between the two companies coincide with six out of eight factors that determine a successor in interest.these factors are the same retail business operation continued the same rental space was used most of the same personnel continued to work the store continued to employ retail salespeople who worked during regular hours the same supervisory personnel continued with the opening of the dollar tree store and the products continued to include clothing along with other personal,gift and household items exhibit.
legal conclusions as factual findings 
some portions of the dol report,including the first sentence in particular,state legal conclusions.the district court ruled that,because rule c applies to factual findings,legal conclusions are inadmissible.this seemingly straightforward holding uncovers an open question of law in this circuit does rule c cover an investigative report legal conclusions as well as its factual findings 
in beech aircraft rainey,the supreme court rejected the argument that the term factual findings in rule c encompassed only facts and not opinions and conclusions.the court held that factually based conclusions or opinions are not on that account excluded from the scope of rule c.id.at.particularly relevant here,the court cabined its decision 
we emphasize that the issue in this litigation is whether rule c recognizes any difference between statements of fact and opinion.there is no question here of any distinction between fact and law.we thus express no opinion on whether legal conclusions contained in an official report are admissible as findings of fact under rule c.
only one circuit court has addressed that open question at any length.in hines brandon steel decks,cir,the eleventh circuit held that rule c does not provide for the admissibility of the legal conclusions contained within an otherwise admissible public report.legal conclusions are inadmissible because the jury would have no way of knowing whether the preparer of the report was cognizant of the requirements underlying the legal conclusion and,if not,whether the preparer might have a higher or lower standard than the law requires.id.at.that court caution ed,however,that the amorphous line between factual and legal conclusions may obscure a practical analysis under this rubric.id.the fourth circuit has agreed,albeit without analysis.see zeus,alphin aircraft,cir the ntsb order involved no factual determinations and was strictly a legal ruling.as such,the ntsb order was not admissible under rule c.
we agree with the eleventh and fourth circuits.pure legal conclusions are not admissible as factual findings.in the context of a summary judgment motion,a conclusion of law by a investigator does not,by itself,create a genuine issue of material fact for the obvious reason that a legal conclusion is not a factual statement and for the reasons explained by the eleventh circuit.accordingly,the district court properly held that the dol report legal conclusion that dollar tree is a successor in interest under the fmla does not create a genuine issue of material fact.
trustworthy requirement 
the district court held that the remainder of the dol report,to the extent that it contains factual findings,is inadmissible as not trustworthy.in beech aircraft,at,the supreme court emphasized that,although a broad range of factual findings are potentially admissible under rule c,the district court retains the discretion to exclude findings that are not trustworthy.see id.at thus,a trial judge has the discretion,and indeed the obligation,to exclude an entire report or portions thereof that she determines to be untrustworthy.relevant factors include the timeliness of the investigation the investigator skill or experience whether a hearing was held and possible bias when reports are prepared with a view to possible litigation.id.at citation omitted.a party opposing the introduction of a public record bears the burden of coming forward with enough negative factors to persuade a court that a report should not be admitted.johnson city of pleasanton,cir.
the district court acted within its discretion when it held that the dol report is not trustworthy.the report is incomplete because its exhibits are not attached.its author is unidentified and unknown,making it impossible to assess the author skill or experience.no hearing was held.the document does not appear even to be a final report,as distinct from an internal draft it is recommended that this case be administratively closed as a partial agreement to pay.dol report at emphases added.the dol did not issue the report or send it to either party at any time before this litigation rather,it became available only because plaintiff filed a request pursuant to the freedom of information act.accordingly,the district not consider the disputed portion of the dol report as evidence in our analysis of the successorship issue.
plaintiff affidavit 
next,plaintiff contends that the district court improperly rejected some of the factual assertions in her affidavit as being too vague and.we review de novo and note the following relevant statements in the affidavit 
dollar tree stores continued in the same retail business operation as factory.dollar tree stores used the same rental space as the factory store they took over,so i kept working in the same store i had been in for over four years.most of the same personnel continued to work when dollar tree took factory over at my store.we continued to employ retail sales people who worked during regular store hours.the same supervisory personnel continued with the opening of dollar tree store,such as three named individuals.the products continued to include clothing along with other personal,gift and household items.
we find it unnecessary to quibble with most of plaintiff statements.although her statements are indeed vague,we find little reason to reject her characterization,for instance,that dollar tree took over the rental space,as distinct from merely purchasing the leasehold from factory.similarly,whether one characterizes the merchandise,as plaintiff does,as clothing along with other personal,gift and household items or,as dollar tree does,as items including some clothing matters little to the ultimate analysis of successor in interest.although the district court is probably correct that plaintiff characterizations are exaggerations,we nevertheless will adopt plaintiff characterizations for purposes of our analysis.
plaintiff assertion concerning the number of employees is a different issue.dollar tree provided detailed factual assertions about which employees it hired and for what purposes.according to dollar tree,it hired a small number of employees to help with the remodeling and transition period,and it hired only two and one continue working after the pasco dollar tree opened its doors for regular business.
by contrast,plaintiff supplied only the vaguest conclusion most of the same personnel continued to work when dollar tree took factory over.is plaintiff counting all persons who worked on the transition team does she intend to dispute the otherwise undisputed evidence that only two persons worked at the store when it opened at the end of october those questions matter,because continuity of the is a relevant factor.
federal rule of civil procedure e requires a party to set out specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial.emphasis added.in lujan national wildlife federation,the supreme court explained that,unlike when ruling on a motion to dismiss,when the court presumes that general allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to support the claim,rule e requires that the party opposing a motion for summary judgment set out specific is,the court will not presume that general allegations embrace more specific facts to support the claim.id.at.the court acknowledged that a t the margins there is some room for debate as to how specific must be the specific facts that rule e requires in a particular case.id.but it found the general allegations in that case to be too vague.id.at.there,the plaintiffs were required to present facts supporting their allegation that they had been adversely affected or aggrieved.id.at.their general assertions were insufficient rule e is assuredly not satisfied by averments which state only that one of respondent members uses unspecified portions of an immense tract of territory,on some portions of which mining activity has occurred or probably will occur by virtue of the governmental action.id.the court explained 
it will not do to presume the missing facts because without them the affidavits would not establish the injury that they generally allege.that converts the operation of rule to a circular promenade plaintiff complaint makes general allegation of injury defendant contests through rule existence of specific facts to support injury plaintiff responds with affidavit containing general allegation of injury,which must be deemed to constitute averment of requisite specific facts since otherwise allegation of injury would be unsupported which is precisely what defendant claims it is.
here,we hold that,in light of the specific facts presented by dollar tree regarding the number of employees retained,plaintiff assertion that most employees were rehired by dollar tree is too vague to satisfy rule e requirement of specificity.in support of its motion for summary judgment,dollar tree carefully explained exactly which employees,by name,had been rehired and for what purposes.at that point,i t became plaintiff burden,in order to defeat the motion,to set out specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial.gerlinger,f d,cir quoting.e.plaintiff assertion of most employees appears to conflict with dollar tree evidence but,as described above,her vague assertion leaves entirely unclear the nature of that conflict,if any we therefore hold that the district court properly disregarded plaintiff unsupported and unexplained assertion.likewise,in our analysis of the successor in interest issue,we will disregard plaintiff assertion.
successor in interest 
the fmla entitles an eligible employee to take family or medical leave for several enumerated reasons,including to care for a close relative.a.the term eligible employee means an employee who has been employed i for at least months by the employer with respect to whom leave is requested id.a.that is,an employee is not eligible for family or medical leave until he or she has worked for an employer for months.the term employer generally means a person or entity engaged in commerce with a minimum number of employees.id.a i.additionally,however,the term employer includes any successor in interest of an employer.id.a ii ii.
here,plaintiff challenges a denial of leave that occurred several months shy of her anniversary of employment with dollar tree.the fmla covers the purpose of that leave,to care for a seriously ill parent.but,without the successor in interest provision,plaintiff was not an eligible employee.the dispositive question,then,is whether dollar tree is a successor in interest to factory.
the fmla does not define the term successor in interest.the department of labor has issued the following regulation 
a for purposes of fmla,in determining whether an employer is covered because it is a successor in interest to a covered employer,the factors used under title vii of the civil rights act and the vietnam era veterans adjustment act will be considered.however,unlike title vii,whether the successor has notice of the employee claim is not a consideration.notice may be relevant,however,in determining successor liability for violations of the predecessor.the factors to be considered include substantial continuity of the same business operations 
use of the same plant 
continuity of the work force 
similarity of jobs and working conditions 
similarity of supervisory personnel 
similarity in machinery,equipment,and production methods 
similarity of products or services and 
the ability of the predecessor to provide relief.
b a determination of whether or not a successor in interest exists is not determined by the application of any single criterion,but rather the entire circumstances are to be viewed in their totality.
as the regulation itself acknowledges and incorporates,the successor in interest inquiry has arisen in many contexts and has a long history in case law.see cobb contract,inc,cir recounting the history in some detail.briefly,the successor in interest doctrine arose initially in traditional cases involving disputes between a new employer and the union recognized by the former employer.see,john wiley sons,livingston,holding that the new employer must arbitrate under the old collective bargaining agreement nlrb burns int l sec,holding that the new employer must negotiate with the former union,but the new employer is not bound by the old collective bargaining agreement howard johnson detroit local joint exec,holding that the new employer is not required to arbitrate under the old collective bargaining agreement and distinguishing wiley fall river dyeing finishing nlrb,holding that the new employer must bargain with the old union,if the new employer is a true successor,and discussing factors.courts later adopted and applied the same considerations in title vii cases.see,bates pac.ass n,cir different policy considerations and enforcement mechanisms are incorporated in title vii than in the context nonetheless,we have held the successorship doctrine to apply to title vii obligations.citing cases eeoc macmillan bloedel containers,cir we are of the view that the considerations set forth by the supreme court in these cases as justifying a successor doctrine to remedy unfair labor practices are applicable equally to remedy unfair employment practices in violation of title vii.see also steinbach hubbard,cir holding that the doctrine also applies to the fair labor and standards act.
the factors that appear in the fmla regulation,quoted above,are nearly verbatim the factors developed by this and other circuits in the and title vii contexts.see,nlrb jeffries lithograph,cir listing the factors macmillan,at same.those factors elaborated on an earlier formulation querying whether the new employer conducts essentially the same business that the old employer conducted.jeffries,at.in other words,the general thrust of the inquiry is whether the new business is essentially the same as the old business.
the inquiry is not merely whether the new employer is a successor in the strict sense of the term.the successorship inquiry in the context is much broader.golden state bottling nlrb.the refusal to adhere to the strict definition is attributable to the fact that,so long as there is a continuity in the employing industry,the public policies underlying the doctrine will be served by its broad application.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
because the origins of successor liability are equitable,fairness is a prime consideration in its application.criswell delta air lines,cir see also bates,at holding that fairness and necessity are inherent considerations in successorship analysis.courts have stressed the intensely nature of the inquiry.see,fall river,at holding that the successor inquiry is primarily factual in nature and is based upon the totality of the circumstances of a given situation howard johnson,at particularly in light of the difficulty of the successorship question,the myriad factual circumstances and legal contexts in which it can arise,and the absence of congressional guidance as to its resolution,emphasis on the facts of each case as it arises is especially appropriate.burns,at resolution turns to a great extent on the precise facts involved here.see also haw.carpenters trust funds waiola carpenter shop,cir the inquiry we undertake is more functional than formal.
the inquiry depends not only on the facts related to the new and old employers,but also on the nature of the legal obligation at issue.as the supreme court has stated 
t he real question in each of these successorship cases is,on the particular facts,what are the legal obligations of the new employer to the employees of the former owner or their representative the answer to this inquiry requires analysis of the interests of the new employer and the employees and of the policies of the labor laws in light of the facts of each case and the particular legal obligation which is at issue,whether it be the duty to recognize and bargain with the union,the duty to remedy unfair labor practices,the duty to arbitrate.there is,and can be,no single definition of successor which is applicable in every legal context.a new employer,in other words,may be a successor for some purposes and not for others.
howard johnson,at.adhering to that explanation,we have stated that d ecisions on successorship must balance,inter alia,the national policies underlying the statute at issue and the interests of the affected parties.steinbach,at see also cobb,at the ultimate inquiry always remains whether the imposition of the particular legal obligation at issue would be equitable and in keeping with federal policy.finally,the supreme court has held that courts must examine the successorship question from the viewpoint of the employee in conducting the analysis,the court keeps in mind the question whether those employees who have been retained will understandably view their job situations as essentially unaltered.fall river,at quoting golden state bottling,at jeffries,at.
only the sixth circuit and a handful of district courts have analyzed the successorship inquiry under the fmla.grace,cobb,finnerty wireless retail,inc,d,aff on other grounds,wl cir,unpublished cobain destination hotels resorts,wl cal.june,unpublished lombardo air prods,wl.july,unpublished miller level commc ns,llc,wl june,unpublished carlson,d slaughter am.maint.of,d barrilleaux thayer lodging group,wl.unpublished vanderhoof life extension.jolliffe mitchell.rhoads fdic,rev in other part,cir.those courts generally have adopted the same considerations applied in other contexts the inquiry is,fairness is a primary consideration,and courts must balance the interests of the parties with the federal policy underlying the fmla.
with respect to balancing the equities,the sixth circuit has taken a broad approach toward finding successorship.grace,at cobb,at.a stated purpose of the fmla is to entitle employees to take reasonable leave for medical reasons.cobb,at quoting b.when the eight factors listed in the dol regulation support a finding of successorship,that important purpose is fulfilled.id.at.similarly,a new employer who hires its employees from the
