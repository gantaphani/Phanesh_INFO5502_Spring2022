plaintiff joseph coronado,a disabled man who is,decided to rent a particular apartment at cobblestone village,a complex owned and operated by defendants cobblestone village community rentals,and equity residential properties management corporation a barrier to wheelchair access existed on the path outside the apartment.specifically,the concrete sidewalk leading from plaintiff apartment to the parking area ended in a raised curb with no access ramp for wheelchairs.plaintiff was subsequently injured when his wheelchair toppled over while his wife tried to maneuver it off of the raised curb.plaintiff sued defendants for violation of the unruh civil rights act,and the disabled persons act et.after plaintiff case was presented at trial,the trial court ruled that the above causes of action would not go to the jury because the statutory provisions were inapplicable to private residential apartments.plaintiff appeals from that nonsuit order.we will affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
cobblestone village is an apartment complex located in the city of fresno along both sides of fruit avenue.it was constructed in to using exclusively private funds.no substantial structural modifications or additions that would require a building permit have occurred since the original construction.the complex is owned managed by defendants.
the leasing office for cobblestone village is open to the general public and a wheelchair access ramp is provided at that location the apartments and common areas around the apartments are reserved for use by tenants and guests of tenants only,although other persons might enter the complex since defendants employees do not patrol the grounds.vehicles are able to enter the apartment complex by means of a private driveway that connects with fruit avenue and winds through the interior of the complex.
plaintiff is a quadriplegic.he has some use of his arms and can push his manual wheelchair to some extent,but a certain balance must always be maintained because he lacks upper torso control.he is able to get up a curb ramp in his wheelchair,but with no ramp a raised curb is an access barrier.
cobblestone village has apartment units that are fully accessible to disabled persons however,such units were already rented at the time plaintiff and his wife,krystal coronado,were looking for an apartment.plaintiff and his wife were shown apartment number the apartment by one of the defendants leasing agents.the apartment was not designed for disability access,but the interior was adequate for plaintiff needs.there is a concrete path or sidewalk leading from the front door of the apartment to a common use parking area.this path or sidewalk ends at a raised curb next to plaintiff assigned parking spot.when plaintiff observed the raised curb at the time he was first shown the apartment,he informed defendants leasing agent that a wheelchair ramp would be needed.the agent indicated he would have to check with management,but he did not think it would be a problem.
at the time plaintiff and his wife moved into the apartment in october of a temporary wooden ramp had been placed in the parking lot at the location of the raised curb at the end of the path leading to the apartment.the wooden ramp was placed there at the instruction of defendants apartment manager.it was constructed out of plywood and by defendants maintenance employee,who also repaired or replaced it on at least one occasion.
plaintiff asserted at trial that defendants made numerous promises to put in a concrete wheelchair ramp at the curb.plaintiff,his wife and a paralegal testified that assurances were given by several of defendants employees that a concrete ramp would in fact be built at defendants expense.plaintiff and his wife also testified that they were ready and willing at all times to pay the expense themselves of putting in the concrete ramp,and made this fact known to defendants.
defendants leasing agents who dealt with plaintiff and his wife denied ever promising a permanent concrete ramp.linda kelley,the apartment manager,testified that she told plaintiff and his wife that they had the option of putting in a permanent ramp at their own expense.according to kelley,plaintiff his wife never came forward and said yes,we want to put a ramp in.eventually the wooden ramp,which was put in as a temporary convenience only,had to be removed.thus,defendants position was that plaintiff simply failed to take advantage of the option of putting in a concrete ramp at plaintiff expense.
in spring of,for reasons that are not entirely clear the wooden ramp was removed by defendant equity residential properties management corporation.on june,plaintiff wife was helping plaintiff get down the curb to the parking area in his wheelchair.in the process,the wheelchair tipped over and plaintiff and his wife were injured.
plaintiff complaint was filed on february.a first amended complaint set forth the following causes of action premises liability,constructive eviction,violation of the unruh civil rights act,violation of the disabled persons act,and injunctive relief under the disabled persons act.
on the eighth day of trial and shortly before it would be time to instruct the jury,the trial court ruled on its own motion that the unruh civil rights act and the disabled persons act were inapplicable in the circumstances of this case and therefore the statutory causes of action would not go to the jury as explained by the trial court from the bench,even though the defendants leasing office was a public accommodation and hence subject to the disability access provisions,that fact did not convert the entirety of the apartment residential a public accommodation for purposes of the relevant statutes.the minute order stated as follows 
the court determines,given the law,the research the court has conducted and the authorities that have been provided for the court consideration it does not appear,given the law,nor does there appear to be any facts that would cause an interpretation of the law that would cause or allow the plaintiff causes of action under any of the disabled persons statutes or discriminatory behavior statutes to go to the jury a nd so,i do not intend to give instructions that pertain to those statutes.the court advises the parties a determination has been made that the corporate entity or partnership of cobblestone village is a business,they maintain a business office on the premises and the office is located on the opposite side of the street from the plaintiff unit in a different section of the apartment complex.the business office is a public accommodation,but the private apartments are not public accommodations within the meaning of any of the statutes cited.
after the conclusion of the trial,the jury returned a defense verdict on the premises liability and constructive eviction causes of action.judgment in favor of defendants was entered on july.plaintiff timely appealed from the trial court order of dismissal or nonsuit of the causes of action under the unruh civil rights act and the disabled persons act.
discussion 
standard of review 
plaintiff appeals from the equivalent of a nonsuit order entered after the presentation of plaintiff evidence.code civ.thus,we review whether the trial court was correct in concluding that the evidence,when viewed most favorably toward plaintiff case,afforded no basis for a cause of action under either the unruh civil rights act or disabled persons act as a matter of law.see pinero specialty restaurants th,d.we will not sustain the judgment unless interpreting the evidence most favorably to plaintiff case and most strongly against the defendant and resolving all presumptions,inferences and doubts in favor of the plaintiff a judgment for the defendant is required as a matter of law.citations.nally grace community church cal d.
the substance of plaintiff appeal is that the trial court erred because defendants had a statutory duty to install a wheelchair ramp at the location of the raised curb so that plaintiff would have access on the only path of travel between the apartment and the parking area and beyond.the interpretation and application of statutes present a question of law that we review de novo.sutco construction modesto high school dist.d.witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.similarly,the issue of whether a statutory scheme such as the unruh civil rights act is applicable in a particular context is a question of law that is reviewed de novo.warfield peninsula golf country club cal th,fn,d,question of whether private club was business enterprise under statute was one of law.
we consider questions of statutory interpretation in accordance with principles of statutory construction.c ourts must begin with the language of a given statute as the purest expression of legislative intent.gunther lin th,d.our task is to ascertain the legislature intent so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citation.toward this end,we must accord a reasonable and commonsense interpretation consistent with the legislature purpose.citation.donald cafe royale,d.moreover,every statute should be construed with reference to the whole system of law of which it is a part,so that all may be harmonized and have effect.citation.statutes relating to the same subject matter are to be read together insofar as reasonably possible.citation.donald sacramento valley bank d.
ii.causes of action based on structural barrier under unruh civil rights act and disabled persons act 
as noted,plaintiff contends that the existence of the particular structural barrier,lack of a curb ramp on the pathway outside the apartment denied his right to full and equal access to a public accommodation,which was therefore actionable under the unruh civil rights act and the disabled persons act.defendants counter that the trial court properly granted nonsuit because the barrier did not constitute a violation of any structural access standard applicable to residential facilities.we now address these respective arguments by considering the statutes in question.
unruh civil rights act 
section,also known as the unruh civil rights act,provides in part all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal,and no matter what their sex,race,color,religion,ancestry,national origin,disability are entitled to the full and equal accommodations,advantages,facilities,privileges,or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever,subd.b,italics added.this section shall not be construed to confer any right or privilege on a person that is conditioned or limited by law or that is applicable alike to all persons,subd.c.section,subdivision a,authorizes recovery of damages to persons denied the rights that are protected under section.however,a plaintiff seeking to establish a cause of action for damages under the unruh civil rights act must plead and prove intentional discrimination in public accommodations in violation of the terms of the act.harris capital growth investors xiv cal d,italics added see hankins el torito restaurants,th,d damages under require intentional violation of gunther lin,supra,th at,d same.
the provisions of the unruh civil rights act,in light of its broad application to all business establishments,have been held to apply with full force to the business of renting housing accommodations.marina point,wolfson cal d.thus,the residential apartment complex in marina point correctly conceded that like other business establishments that deal with the public,its freedom or authority to exclude customers,prospective tenants,from the goods and services it offers,rental units,is limited by the provisions of the unruh act,fn.omitted village green owners cal d,private condominium association was a business establishment covered by the unruh act.it is clear from marina point and that section is fully applicable to defendants apartment complex business in the present case,cobblestone village.the question then is not whether section applies to the business enterprise of renting apartments it does,but whether a cause of action for violation of section may be established in this case under plaintiff evidence presented at trial.
we therefore consider whether section may have been violated by the existence of the structural barrier,no curb ramp a theory that depends on a conclusion that defendants were required to make a structural modification to the property.subdivision d of section states nothing in this section shall be construed to require any construction,alteration,repair,structural or otherwise,or modification of any sort whatsoever,beyond that construction,alteration,repair,or modification that is otherwise required by other provisions of law,to any new or existing establishment,facility,building,improvement,or any other structure italics added.subdivision e of section further declares that a violation of the right of any individual under the americans with disabilities act of public law ada shall also constitute a violation of this section.thus,on the question of whether a particular structural modification such as a wheelchair ramp is required in a given context,section by its own terms looks to other provisions of law.
it follows from the above discussion that a cause of action in which a plaintiff seeks damages for disability discrimination under section based on a structural or architectural barrier requires a showing that the barrier existed due to an intentional violation of an applicable law relating to disability access standards.see gunther lin,supra,th at,d violation may be founded on structural and architectural barriers that are intentional violation of ada.plaintiff contends that defendants were required to construct a wheelchair ramp in the present case under the following provisions of law government code section et and health and safety code section et,and the ada.we will shortly turn our attention to these statutory schemes to determine if plaintiff is correct.at this point,we emphasize that plaintiff cause of action under section premised on the existence of a structural barrier depends on whether the lack of a wheelchair ramp at the subject curb constituted an intentional violation of one of these other provisions of law relating to disability access.
disabled persons act 
in,the legislature enacted sections,and as one of two statutory schemes that were specifically designed to prevent discrimination against the physically disabled.people ex rel.deukmejian che,d.the other statutory scheme,which we address later,consisted of government code section et and health and safety code section et.people ex.rel.deukmejian che,supra,at.
sections through are now commonly referred to as the disabled persons act and are intended to secure to disabled persons the same right as the general public to the full and free use of facilities open to the public.citation.urhausen longs drug stores california,th,d.as originally enacted,violation of sections or constituted a misdemeanor as stated in former section,and enforcement was by government prosecution.marsh edwards theatres circuit,d.marsh.in,section was added to give individuals aggrieved by violation of sections or a right to obtain injunctive relief and in,section was amended to allow such individuals a right to maintain a civil cause of action for damages.donald cafe royale,supra,d at.summarizing statutory history.these additional enforcement methods were included by the legislature to guarantee compliance with equal access requirements and to help remove impediments to the physically handicappeds interaction in community life ibid.
the disabled persons act differs from the unruh civil rights act in at least two respects there is no intent element under the disabled persons act donald cafe royale,supra,d at,but intentional discrimination is a required element for recovery of damages under the unruh civil rights act and each act provides for a distinct measure of statutory penalties gunther lin,supra,th at,d.due to these significant differences,a plaintiff must elect between seeking damages under sections or,subd.c gunther lin,supra,th at,d.
section,subdivision a,declares that individuals with disabilities have the same right as the general public to the full and free use of the streets,highways,sidewalks,walkways,public buildings,medical facilities,including hospitals,clinics,and physicians offices,public facilities,and other public places.section,subdivision a,states in similar fashion that individuals with disabilities shall be entitled to full and equal access,as other members of the general public,to accommodations,advantages,facilities,privileges of all common carriers,airplanes,motor vehicles,railroad trains,motorbuses,streetcars,boats,or any other public conveyances or modes of transportation,telephone facilities,adoption agencies,private schools,hotels,lodging places,places of public accommodation,amusement,or resort,and other places to which the general public is invited,subject only to the conditions and limitations established by law and applicable alike to all persons.both sections and were amended in to add a provision declaring that a violation of the right of an individual under the ada also constitutes a violation of this section,subd.c,subd.c see stats,ch.
subdivision b of section includes a specific provision relating to housing accommodations that declares as follows individuals with disabilities shall be entitled to full and equal access,as other members of the general public,to all housing accommodations offered for rent,lease,or compensation in this state,subject to the conditions and limitations established by law,or state or federal regulation,and applicable alike to all persons.housing accommodations means any real property,or portion thereof,that is used or occupied,or is intended,arranged,or designed to be used or occupied,as the home,residence,or sleeping place of one or more human beings,but shall not include any accommodations included within subdivision a or any residence the occupants of which rent,lease,or furnish for compensation not more than one room therein,subd.b.
in addition to declaring that the protections of the disabled persons act apply to housing accommodations,subdivision b of section affirmatively requires that those who rent,lease or otherwise provide such housing do the following make reasonable accommodations in rules,policies,practices,or services,when necessary to afford individuals with a disability equal opportunity to use and enjoy the premises,subd.b b,and permit a disabled tenant to make reasonable modifications at his or her own expense to the rented premises when necessary to afford that tenant full use and enjoyment of the rented premises,which modifications may be conditioned on the tenant entering into a written agreement to restore the interior of the premises to the original condition,subd.b a finally,it is provided that nothing in this subdivision shall require any person renting,leasing or providing for compensation real property to modify his or her property in any way or provide a higher degree of care for an individual with a disability than for an individual who is not disabled,subd.b,italics added.the latter section clarifies that subdivision b does not by itself mandate the owner or operator of the real property to make any structural modifications,which is consistent with the interpretation that the courts have generally given the disabled persons act,as we discuss below.
historically,sections and have been construed to mean that all physically handicapped are entitled to the same right as the to full and free use of public facilities and places,requiring operators of such public facilities and accommodations to open their doors on an equal basis to all that can avail themselves of the facilities without violation of other valid laws and regulations.people ex.rel.deukmejian che,supra,d at,citing marsh,supra,d at.it has been held that these provisions do not,by themselves,require that a business owner structurally modify his or her facilities.marsh,supra,at.does not require affirmative action by way of modifying existing structures.as the marsh court concluded following an analysis of the legislative history,the operator of a business of a type enumerated in civil code section is not required by the force of that section alone to modify its facilities to allow for their use by handicapped persons.marsh,supra,at.see hankins el torito restaurants,supra,th at,d acknowledging marsh rule that a structural impediment to access does not violate civil code section unless the impediment also violates a structural access standard.
we know of no reason to depart from the analysis in marsh on this issue.in fact,there are at least two sound reasons to follow it.first,it is clear that the legislature adopted a distinct statutory scheme in,et and health et to address the separate matter of building access standards and structural modifications.see,people ex.rel.deukmejian che,supra,d at.structural access standards,applicable to new construction or modification of existing facilities,were enacted to give meaning to donald sacramento valley bank,supra,d at.same.this fact strongly indicates sections and were not themselves intended to require business owners to modify the structure of their premises,as other statutes were adopted for that purpose.second,the legislature specifically responded to one aspect of the holding in marsh,that there was no private cause of action for damages by amending section to authorize a private cause of action for specified damages stats,ch,stats,ch,and stats,ch,but left fully intact marsh fundamental interpretation of the statutory scheme that a structural barrier does not violate sections or unless it also violates a separate structural access standard.see gunther lin,supra,th at,d legislative acquiescence in prior judicial construction of statutory language creates inference that legislature agreed with that construction.
we conclude that in order to state a cause of action for violation of sections or based on a structural or architectural barrier,the existence of the barrier must be in violation of a separate provision of law relating to structural access standards.this means that,as was true in our analysis of section,we must look to other provisions of law before we can determine whether a cause of action on this theory was sufficiently supported by the evidence.
we now proceed to consider those other laws.
government code section et and health and safety code section et.
as noted,government code section et and health and safety code section et were enacted in and respectively as means of providing structural access standards in regard to public buildings and facilities.the scope and purpose of these provisions have been aptly summarized as follows to give meaning to the public accommodation law prohibiting discrimination against the handicapped,the legislature enacted government code section et providing for the establishment of standards for buildings constructed with public funds designed to insure accessibility by the handicapped.a year later,the legislature expanded these requirements to facilities constructed with private funds health,et and,with certain limited exceptions,required conformance with the same standards set forth within government code section et.the underlying legislative intent of these statutory schemes is to require affirmative conduct so as to guarantee access to the physically handicapped upon construction of new facilities or with the repair and alteration of existing facilities.citation.people ex.rel.deukmejian che,supra,d at.that is,disability access standards were first implemented with respect to public buildings or facilities constructed with public funds,and were later expanded to include public buildings or facilities constructed with private funds health,donald sacramento valley bank,supra,d at.
since cobblestone village was constructed with private funds,plaintiff contention is that health and safety code section et required the construction of a curb ramp at the location where the incident occurred.defendants respond that the walkway outside plaintiff apartment is not a public facility,and therefore health and safety code section is inapplicable.as explained below,we conclude defendants are correct.
health and safety code section,subdivision a,explains that the purpose of part of the code including sections to is to insure that public accommodations or facilities constructed in this state with private funds adhere to the provisions of chapter commencing with section of division of title of the government code.the same section defines the term public accommodation or facilities as follows a building,structure,facility,complex,or improved area which is used by the general public and shall include auditoriums,hospitals,theaters,restaurants,hotels,motels,stadiums,and convention centers.health,subd.a,italics added.similarly,health and safety code section,which relates to public curbs and sidewalks constructed with private funds,states that it applies to any curb or sidewalk intended for public use italics added.
in the present case,there was no evidence to suggest that the cement walkway outside plaintiff apartment was an area used by the general public or that it was intended for use by the general public.the relevant testimony on this issue indicated that although the general public was invited to the leasing office,only tenants and guests of tenants were supposed to be in residential areas and common areas around the residential areas.additionally,there was no evidence to indicate that the private lane or driveway going through the interior of defendants complex,as a means of vehicular access,was intended for use by the general public.thus,the curb located on the walkway outside plaintiff apartment was not a public facility or public sidewalk to which the provisions of health and safety code sections and would apply.
this determination is in accord with a attorney general opinion concluding that a mobilehome park recreational building is not a public accommodation or facility within the meaning of the above statutes.as explained by that opinion 
undoubtedly that facility is open to a more general class than the residents of the park,for surely it is available to their families and invited guests.use by the expanded group of persons in our view,however,does not reach the use by the general public spoken of in health and safety code section.there are still meaningful restrictions on who may use the facilities,which considerably narrows their amenability to user from being generally available to the is the case with an auditorium,hospital,theater,restaurant,hotel,motel,stadium or convention being available to a select and definable few.furthermore,unlike those facilities,the purpose for whose creation is based upon their being made continuously available to the general public and whose economic viability can not survive without their being so available,the recreation center at a mobilehome park is neither so created nor dependent.rather,it is a secondary appendage to another unit,the park itself which,like it,neither contemplates nor needs accessibility of continuous use by the general public for its sustenance.thus,we do not believe the fact that a recreational building in a mobilehome park might well be used by the residents families,friends,and invited guests makes it a building or facility used by the general public or a public facility or accommodation within the meaning of health and safety code section.
of further interest in our present case,the same attorney general opinion rejected an argument that the presence of a commercial office within the mobilehome park converted all structures or areas in the park into a commercial establishment within the meaning of health and safety code section.the main office of the park might be considered engaging in a commercial activity,but surely the individual mobilehomes can not be so considered,nor do we believe the recreation building itself can be so considered thus,while the office of the mobilehome park would be covered by health and safety code section,since commercial activity is performed within it,that does not extend to the park recreation building and it would not be covered by the section mandate.
in granting the nonsuit order in the present case,the trial court explained that even though defendants leasing office was a public accommodation and hence subject to the structural access standards,that fact would not convert the entirety of the apartment residential a public accommodation for purposes of the relevant statutes.we concur with the trial court analysis on this is also suggested in the above referenced attorney general opinion.in a complex such as this,where there is a commercial office open to the general public but also residential and common areas that are not open to the general public,it is appropriate to consider the particular area in question when attempting to determine the applicability of statutes that provide for structural access standards.we conclude that these statutory provisions did not require defendants to install a curb ramp at the location where plaintiff fell.
americans with disabilities act 
plaintiff claims that removal of the structural barrier in this case was required by the ada.as noted previously,the california legislature has declared that a violation of the ada constitutes a violation of the unruh civil rights act and the disabled persons act the ada provides no individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods,services,facilities,privileges,advantages,or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns,leases or leases to,or operates a place of public accommodation.a.the ada defines discrimination in a place of public accommodation to include a failure to remove architectural barriers in existing facilities where such removal is readily achievable b a iv.the term readily achievable means easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense.
thus,under the ada,the duty to remove such barriers from public accommodations now extends beyond initial construction and significant alterations of existing structures.a public accommodation shall remove architectural barriers in existing facilities,where such removal is readily achievable,easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense.citation.madden del taco,th,d madden.in madden,the court of appeal held that a restaurant was required to remove a structural barrier,a cement trash container blocking an accessible route of travel to an entrance based on the requirement in the ada to remove barriers where such removal is readily achievable.madden,supra,at,d.this was so even though the restaurant was otherwise in compliance with structural access standards and had not engaged in any triggering alterations madden,supra,at,d 
plaintiff contends that madden directly applies here because the installation of a curb ramp,as a means of removal of a structural barrier to access,was readily achievable in this case,especially when the evidence that plaintiff was willing to pay for the installation is considered.defendants argue that madden is inapplicable because it involved a place of public accommodation as defined under the ada,while the instant case did not.we agree with defendants position.
section of the ada defines the term public accommodation in terms of extensive categories,which the legislative history indicates should be construed liberally to afford people with disabilities equal access to the wide variety of establishments available to the nondisabled.pga tour,martin,d,fns.omitted.section of the ada states 
the following private entities are considered public accommodations for purposes of this subchapter,if the operations of such entities affect commerce 
a an inn,hotel,motel,or other place of lodging,except for an establishment located within a building that contains not more than five rooms for rent or hire and that is actually occupied by the proprietor of such establishment as the residence of such proprietor 
b a restaurant,bar,or other establishment serving food or drink 
c a motion picture house,theater,concert hall,stadium,or other place of exhibition or entertainment 
d an auditorium,convention center,lecture hall,or other place of public gathering 
e a bakery,grocery store,clothing store,hardware store,shopping center,or other sales or rental establishment
