in this case,the trial court dismissed a lawsuit filed in collin county,texas between two michigan businesses based on common law forum non conveniens.the court of appeals reversed the dismissal,holding that the trial court abused its discretion.it agreed that the proposed forum,michigan,was available and adequate for the lawsuit,but held that the defendant did not meet its burden to show that the private and public interest factors of the forum non conveniens analysis strongly weighed in favor of dismissal.the defendant appealed to this court.because the trial court did not abuse its discretion,we reverse the court of appeals judgment.
this dispute arose between quixtar,and signature management team,llc,team team.quixtar is a virginia corporation with a principal place of business in michigan.team is a limited liability company organized in nevada with a principal place of business in michigan.quixtar,a successor to amway corporation,is a marketing corporation that sells products through a network of individual business owners ibos.ibos increase revenue by recruiting new ibos for quixtar,and quixtar promulgates rules regulating ibo recruitment to ensure compliance with federal trade commission regulations pertaining to marketing businesses.
team is a tools company that sells marketing tools,books,seminars,and motivational speaker appearances to ibos to assist them in developing their businesses.quixtar also owns a training system and sells similar tools to ibos,making it a direct competitor with team.leading up to this dispute,quixtar alleged that team taught ibos improper and potentially illegal techniques that put quixtar entire business at risk.the entities met at quixtar headquarters in michigan on august,to discuss team alleged noncompliance with quixtar rules and potential remedial measures.quixtar alleges that team threatened to file a storm of litigation initiated by ibos if quixtar did not capitulate to certain demands,such as waiving provisions in its contract so that team founders orrin woodward and chris brady could recruit ibos for a separate business endeavor.when they did not resolve their disagreements,quixtar terminated woodward and brady ibo contracts and revoked team authorization to sell training materials.the same day,ibos filed a lawsuit against quixtar in california.over the next several days,quixtar sent to its ibos.in the,quixtar explained the terminations and warned certain ibos that their businesses would also be terminated if they continued using team products.ibos filed seventeen lawsuits,including seven in michigan.michigan courts repeatedly denied the injunctive relief requested by the ibos,but eventually a court in collin county,texas issued a temporary restraining order against quixtar to prevent quixtar from initiating any adverse action against ibos.
team initiated suit in collin county,texas on september,alleging that quixtar abused its power by interpreting rules governing ibos to restrain team trade and business with certain ibos located in collin county.it alleges that quixtar communications were part of its basis for commencing suit.quixtar filed a motion to dismiss based on the common law forum non conveniens doctrine,arguing that the suit arose from a business dispute centered in michigan that had no substantial connection to texas.at the evidentiary hearing on quixtar motion to dismiss,the trial court heard testimony from three ibos and the general counsel of quixtar parent company,alticor.it granted the motion to dismiss.
the court of appeals held that the trial court abused its discretion by granting the forum non conveniens dismissal.it reasoned that the plaintiff choice of forum must be respected unless evidence shows the and factors strongly favor dismissal in favor of another forum,pet.granted.though the court agreed that michigan was an available and adequate forum,it held that quixtar evidentiary showing under the factors was weak and that it did not show that the factors,on the whole,strongly favor michigan as a more appropriate forum for team lawsuit than texas.id.
quixtar argues that the trial court did not abuse its discretion and that the court of appeals erred in reversing the forum non conveniens dismissal.it asserts that the court of appeals analysis was flawed,imposing an excessive burden of proof on quixtar because a nonresident plaintiff forum choice deserves substantially less deference than a resident plaintiff,and it improperly required quixtar to prove that all of the public and private interest factors strongly favored dismissal.we address each contention.
the forum non conveniens determination is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court.piper aircraft reyno.it may be reversed only when there has been a clear abuse of discretion where the court has considered all the relevant public and private interest factors,and where its balancing of these factors is reasonable,its discretion deserves substantial deference.id.a trial court commits an abuse of discretion when it acts without reference to any guiding rules and principles.downer aquamarine operators.and the mere fact that a trial judge may decide a matter within his discretionary authority in a different manner than an appellate judge in a similar circumstance does not demonstrate that an abuse of discretion occurred.downer,at.
a defendant seeking forum non conveniens dismissal ordinarily bears a heavy burden in opposing the plaintiff chosen forum.sinochem int l malaysia int l shipping.however,in in re pirelli tire,this court explained that the doctrine generally affords substantially less deference to a nonresident forum choice,plurality opinion citing reyno,at upholding dismissal of nonresident plaintiff forum choice as existence of an important american interest to prevent faulty evidence of private interest factors pointed in both directions and public interest factors weighed against the plaintiff forum choice owens corning carter,see also sinochem,at explaining that the presumption in the plaintiff favor applies with less force,for the assumption that the chosen forum is appropriate in such cases is less reasonable quotations omitted.obviously,this does not mean that a plaintiff choice of forum deserves no deference.sinochem,at.but that a plaintiff is not a texas resident speaks directly to a defendant burden.see in re volkswagen of,cir.
team argues that we should not defer to pirelli less deference language because pirelli is a plurality opinion and only addressed texas forum non conveniens statute.but pirelli significance should not be dismissed so easily.first,while it addressed texas forum non conveniens statute and not the common law doctrine,the statute has deep roots in the common law.pirelli,at.the pirelli plurality cites to reyno,a common law forum non conveniens case,for the proposition that a nonresident plaintiff forum choice deserves substantially less deference.id.citing reyno,at.also,the fact that pirelli is a plurality opinion does not mean it is of no significance.a majority of the court agreed that the public and private interest factors from the common law forum non conveniens as the gulf oil merit dismissal on common law forum non conveniens grounds and that a nonresident plaintiff forum choice does not require the same balancing of interests as a resident plaintiff.see id.at willett,concurring citing gulf oil gilbert,applying the former statute which only enumerated a balancing test for resident plaintiffs forum choices.therefore,pirelli directly addresses issues in this case.
in addition to pirelli,precedent from the united states supreme court supports the proposition that a defendant heavy burden applies with less force when seeking a forum non conveniens dismissal to a nonresident plaintiff forum choice.see sinochem,at reyno,at see also swift.packers compania colombiana del caribe,distinguishing between the forum non conveniens analysis for a plaintiff who is a united states citizen and one who is foreign.because texas forum non conveniens statute governs in most situations,we rarely address the common law doctrine.however,we regularly consider united states supreme court prec
