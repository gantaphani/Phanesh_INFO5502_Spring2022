appellant michael buchanan argues that the district court grant of the defendant motion for summary judgment should be reversed because the amended complaint in this case relates back to the original complaint under federal rule of civil procedure c,thereby precluding a grant of summary judgment on statute of limitations grounds.because we believe that,with the information that was available to it,the district court could not properly determine as a matter of law that the defendant did not receive imputed notice under rule c,we will vacate the district court decision and remand for further factfinding 
this case involves an appeal by the plaintiff,the disbursing agent under the plan of liquidation formerly the official committee of unsecured creditors of color tile,the committee.the committee appealed to this court from an order granting summary judgment to defendant state street research investment services,and affiliated mutual fund defendants state street research.
the depository trust company dtc is an association of more than brokerage houses and financial institutions which was formed pursuant to congressional mandate for the purpose of owning shares for the beneficial interest of customers.cede cede is the name used by dtc to hold shares that it owns.among other services not relevant here,cede transmits the dividends received from issuers to the beneficial owners,through participating or depository banks acting as conduits.in re color tile,cir.state street bank the bank acted as state street research conduit with respect to the color tile shares held in cede name.in short,dtc functioned as a for the state street bank,who in turn operated as an agent for state street research the principal.
in february,the committee served its initial complaint against cede upon dtc.the committee did not serve its amended complaint on state street research until march the statute of limitations had run against state street research.the committee allegations arise out of color tile payment of million in dividends to certain of its stock holders,shortly before it filed for chapter bankruptcy.the committee alleges that the dividends were fraudulently transferred,and seeks return of the dividends from the stock holders,including state street research.state street research was added as a defendant in because the committee discovered that state street research had been a beneficial owner of color tile stock at the time that the dividends were paid.the complaint was otherwise unmodified.
in april,the district court of delaware granted state street research motion for summary judgment on the ground that the committee complaint was time barred.the court held that the committee failed to demonstrate that state street research had received notice of the complaint,as required under federal rule of civil procedure c a,and therefore the complaint could not relate back.
the committee appealed the grant of summary judgment and this court vacated and remanded the case.in re color tile.cir color tile i.this court in color tile i determined that the rule notice issue could not be determined without further factual development.the court remanded the case for limited discovery directed to whether state street bank received actual notice of the complaint from dtc and whether the scope of dtc obligations to the bank included forwarding notice of complaints in such a manner that they would reach state street research.
on remand,the district court conducted a evidentiary hearing and issued an opinion on october.the court granted state street research motion for summary judgment and concluded that the second amended complaint did not relate back to the original complaint under rule c because state street research had no notice of the initial suit brought against.
the district court had jurisdiction over state street research motion for summary judgment pursuant to.we have jurisdiction pursuant to d and.our standard of review over the district court grant of summary judgment is plenary,and we apply the same standard that the district court should have applied.shuman ex rel.shertzer penn manor sch,cir internal citations omitted derienzo harvard,cir becton dickinson wolckenhauer,cir.a court should grant summary judgment if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.this court will,in applying this standard,view the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draw all inferences in that party favor.shuman,at.
the primary issue for this court to address on plenary review is whether the district court properly concluded,at the summary judgment stage,that state street research had no notice of the original february complaint brought against.
we note at the outset that the district court in its october,opinion concluded that state street bank was obligated to forward complaints it received regarding its clients securities to state street research.the district court drew support for this position from of the bank custodian agreement,which states that it shall transmit all written information it received pertaining to the securities it held for its clients.however,the district court stated that b ecause the court has already concluded that the bank did not receive notice of the original complaint,its obligation to forward the original complaint is irrelevant.
the district court took an extremely narrow view of what constitutes actual notice.the court held that n either state street bank nor defendants received actual notice of the original complaint.in examining the scope of actual notice,the court looked only at whether the bank the agent or state street research the principal examined or physically received the complaint from dtc the.because the district court has already concluded that the bank needed to forward the complaint to state street research if the bank received it,the only question we must answer is whether dtc had an obligation to forward the complaint to the bank.
the district court viewed imputed notice as a form of constructive notice.this court in singletary.of,cir suggested that,for the purposes of the relation back doctrine,notice can be actual,constructive,or imputed.the singletary panel apparently considered imputed notice as a form of constructive notice.see id.at.in garvin city of philadelphia,cir,we followed singletary for the proposition that imputed notice falls under the doctrine of constructive notice,so that imputed notice under rule c requires either a shared attorney or an identity of interests.see id.at.
the type of imputation at issue in singletary and garvin,however,differs from what we are presented with in this case.here,the plaintiffs are attempting to impute knowledge from a to an agent and therefore the principal,as opposed to imputing notice under rule c.imputing knowledge from an agent to a principal must be analyzed according to principles of actual notice rather than notice.in singletary,the primary issue was whether a plaintiff could amend her complaint to include a staff psychologist in a case brought by the mother of a prisoner who committed suicide in a state correctional institution.at.in garvin,the relevant issue was whether a complaint could be amended to include several police officers in an excessive force case.at.both of these cases dealt with imputed notice in the context of whether the actors who actually committed the allegedly tortious and unconstitutional acts could be added to the complaint.neither of these cases addressed the issue that confronts this panel.here,we are simply analyzing whether,as a matter of law,an agent and a principal should be deemed to have received actual notice when their receives knowledge within the scope of its employment by the agent.as a matter of basic agency law,imputed knowledge falls under the rubric of actual notice rather than imputed and therefore constructive notice.the key difference between the line of cases and the situation here is that,in the former context,a plaintif
