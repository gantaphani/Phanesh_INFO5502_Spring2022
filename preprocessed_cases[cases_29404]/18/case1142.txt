in,rtc brought suit against schuchmann,alleging state common law claims of breach of fiduciary duty,gross negligence,and negligence for his role in various transactions while chairman of the board and controlling shareholder of first american by operation of law,in fdic succeeded to the interests of rtc as receiver and was substituted as plaintiff.see m.
three sets of transactions are at issue in this appeal a million loan made to custer road investments in april custer road and subsequently modified a million loan to omni real estate investments in june omni and the acquisition from of a group of promissory notes collectively valued at approximately million from intervest mortgage partners i and intervest equity partners collectively intervest.
at trial,evidence of conflicts of interest,adverse domination,and statutory and regulatory violations was presented to the jury.the jury found schuchmann negligent as to the custer road and omni transactions but declined to award damages because of a lack of proximate cause.the jury found against fdic on the intervest note acquisitions and on the issues of gross negligence,breach of fiduciary duty,and adverse domination.fdic appeals.
we first address fdic allegations of erroneous jury instructions.we review the district court decision to give a particular jury instruction for abuse of discretion and consider the instructions as a whole de novo to determine whether they accurately informed the jury of the governing law.united states,cir.the instructions as a whole need not be flawless,but we must be satisfied that,upon hearing the instructions,the jury understood the issues to be resolved and its duty to resolve them.medlock ortho biotech,cir citing brodie chem,cir.
fdic contends the district court gutted its case when the court refused to give the jury its tendered instruction entitled conflicts of interest.although a party is entitled to an instruction on his theory of the case if the instruction is a correct statement of the law and if he has offered sufficient evidence for the jury to find in his favor,i t is not error to refuse to give a requested instruction if the same subject matter is adequately covered in the general instructions,at internal quotations omitted see also woolard jlg,cir.
the instruction proffered by fdic stated 
a conflict of interest exists when an officer or director allows an institution to enter into a transaction such that the officer or director puts him or herself into a position in which a conflict may arise between the best interests of the association and the officer or director personal loyalties or personal financial interest,whether direct or indirect.
appellant app.at.it permitted a finding of liability if the schuchmanns caused or allowed first american to enter into transactions whereby they placed themselves in a position creating or which could lead to a conflict of interest.id.similarly,fdic second proffered instruction stated that federal regulations prohibit first american directors from placing themselves in positions creating,or which could lead to,a conflict of interest or even the appearance of a conflict of interest.id.at.
as controlling authority for the instructions it proffered,fdic cites b,which states each director,officer,or other affiliated person of a savings association has a fundamental duty to avoid placing himself or herself in a position which creates,or which leads to or could lead to,a conflict of interest or appearance of a conflict of interest.the third circuit conducted a detailed analysis of the language and history of b and concluded that it does not establish an enforceable standard of care t he sweeping language of section b indicates it is no more than a statement of policy that a director of a banking institution should use as a guide for personal conduct,not a rule whose violation triggers liability.seidman ots in re seidman,cir.relying on seidman,appellee argues that b does not impose liability but was rather issued merely as a caution against the risk that is added when an affiliated person has a personal stake in a business transaction his savings institution is considering,a risk inherent in.id.at citing first bank smith,cir.
the court in seidman reasoned that interpretive rules simply state what the administrative agency thinks the statute means,and only remind affected parties of existing duties,whereas a substantive or legislative rule,pursuant to properly delegated authority,has the force of law,and creates new law or imposes new rights or duties,at internal quotations omitted.we have also held that such a policy statement is a purely interpretive rule,unpromulgated under the administrative procedure act,see b a,and added to help clarify the meaning and application of the various promulgated rules that follow it.headrick rockwell int l,cir citing chrysler brown,d further citation omitted.consequently,although we are sympathetic to the goals of b,we are bound by the earlier determination of our circuit that it does not carry the force of law,and we need not afford it any special deference under chevron,natural resources defense council,d.see headrick,at.
turning to the district court instructions,we easily conclude that its fiduciary duty instruction accurately stated the governing law.the trial court also adequately addressed fdic conflict of interest theory it refused fdic conflict of interest instructions and instead used an instruction entitled breach of fiduciary duties.the instruction directed the jury to find against defendant on this claim if plaintiff proved by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant had breached its duty of care or duty of loyalty.it defined the duty of care to require defendant to exercise the degree of care that an ordinarily prudent and diligent director would exercise under similar circumstances,and defined the duty of loyalty to require defendant to act with undivided good faith and in the best interests of the institution and to prohibit.appellant app.at.this instruction is consistent with new mexico law under which a fiduciary breaches his duty of loyalty by placing his interests above those of the beneficiary.see kueffer kueffer,while the instruction does not employ fdic preferred wording,it makes clear that defendant could be held liable if he failed to act in the best interest of the bank or if he engaged in.
the new mexico supreme court has adopted the following test for determining whether a negligence per se instruction is appropriate 
t here must be a statute which prescribes certain actions or defines a standard of conduct,either explicitly or implicitly,the defendant must violate the statute,the plaintiff must be in the class of persons sought to be protected by the statute,and the harm or injury to the plaintiff must generally be of the type the legislature through the statute sought to prevent.
archibeque homrich.in valdez cillessen son,the new mexico supreme court added that a violation of a statute could not provide the basis for negligence per se if so construing the statutory violation would be contrary to the clear intent of the legislature.like the violation of a statute,v iolation of a properly adopted and filed rule or regulation is negligence per se.jaramillo fisher controls,citing maestas christmas.
the fdic contends that all three transactions at custer road loan,the omni loan,and the intervest federal and state statutes and regulations designed to protect fdic predecessor from the type of harm it suffered.with respect to the omni and custer road transactions,the jury found schuchmann negligent,rendering harmless any error in refusing to give the negligence per se instruction.any error would be harmless even though the jury went on to find that the negligence did not proximately cause fdic damages because o nce negligence per se is found,the fact finders would still have to determine whether the negligence per se was the actual and proximate cause of the accident.archibeque,at citations omitted.fdic urges that any error is not harmless because even the very unlikely possibility that a jury based its verdict on erroneous instruction requires reversal.appellant reply br.at.fdic offers no authority,and we find none,suggesting there is any possibility the jury verdict finding an absence of proximate cause would have been different if the jury had first found schuchmann actions breached a duty of care under a theory of negligence per se instead of negligence.
we thus focus our inquiry on whether the district court should have instructed the jury on negligence per se with respect to the intervest transaction and,if so,whether its failure to do so requires reversal.fdic proffered instruction would have directed the jury to find schuchmann had breached his duty of care if the jury found he allowed or caused first american to enter into transactions which violated these regulations or laws,including,in relevant part,federal regulations limiting the type of notes which first american could acquire.i appellant app.at.in support of that instruction,fdic cited b removed,which requires a note secured by raw land to have a maturity date of no more than three years,and b removed,which requires at least interest payments on notes secured by raw land the district court refused the proffered instruction,apparently because it did not believe the violation of a regulation,as opposed to a statute,could constitute negligence per se.instead,it instructed the jury that a violation of the described regulations may be considered as evidence that defendant was negligent or failed to meet his fiduciary duties.i appellant app.at.
negligence per se is a state law claim governed here by the laws of new mexico.at first look,the basis for the district court decision not to instruct the jury on negligence per se seems contrary to new mexico law,which provides that a violation of a regulation can constitute negligence per se.see jaramillo,at.schuchmann,however,defends the district court decision on two alternative grounds new mexico law does not recognize violation of a federal law as negligence per se or,more narrowly,it would not recognize a violation of the regulations at issue as negligence per se because to do so would be contrary to the intent of congress.
schuchmann argument that new mexico law does not recognize violations of federal regulations as negligence per se is unsupported by the case law.valdez,the case he cites in support of the proposition that violation of a federal statute,without more,does not constitute a basis for finding negligence as a matter of law,simply does not establish such a broad rule.rather,valdez held that t o negate the defendant general standard of care and impose negligence as a matter of law in a case such as this based upon an osha violation,would affect the common law duties or liabilities of employers and would be contrary to the clear intent of congress.at internal quotations omitted emphasis added.its holding,therefore,pertains to the particular federal statute at every federal statute.
turning to schuchmann second argument,the new mexico supreme court has not addressed whether basing a claim of negligence per se on a violation of federal regulations governing savings and loan institutions would be contrary to congressional intent.in the absence of new mexico law directly on point,we attempt to predict how new mexico highest court would rule.see wood eli lilly,cir see also erie tompkins.in conducting our inquiry,we are free to consider all resources available,including decisions of new mexico courts,other state courts and federal courts,in addition to the general weight and trend of authority.see wood,at farmers alliance mut.ins.bakke,cir.
in support of its finding in valdez that congress did not intend to legislate negligence as a matter of law for any violation of osha,the new mexico supreme court cited a section of osha that provides n othing in this chapter shall be construed to diminish or affect in any other manner the common law or statutory rights,duties,or liabilities of employers and employees.b.schuchmann does not cite to,nor does our research reveal,such an explicit expression of intent regarding the regulations at issue 
alternatively,schuchmann contends that congress intent not to create a negligence per se cause of action follows from repealed,which provides for enforcement of those regulations in administrative proceedings brought by the federal home loan bank board fhlbb where the legislature has constructed a regime for enforcement,permitting negligence per se claims to proceed would be engrafting an additional remedy the legislature did not provide.schwartzman,atchison,topeka santa fe ry,see also northwest airlines,transport workers,d the presumption that a remedy was deliberately omitted from a statute is strongest when the legislature has enacted a comprehensive legislative scheme,including an integrated system of procedures for enforcement.
in rtc dean,the court considered whether violations of the same regulations at issue in this case established a claim for negligence per se under arizona state law and concluded,in accordance with other courts,that violations of those federal regulations can not establish a claim for negligence per se made by a conservator of a federally insured,savings and loan against the association former director.id.at citing other cases dismissing negligence per se claims under state law based on violations of the federal regulations at issue in this case.in reaching this conclusion,the court focused on the fact that the regulations at issue do not grant a private cause of action to the rtc as the eighth circuit stated in federal savings and loan insurance capozzi,cir,vacated on other grounds,d 
we discern no congressional intent that the regulatory protections involved here grant a federal cause of action for damages to a federally insured,thrift institution against its former directors.in the context of this type of institution,we believe these regulations are,not retrospective they seek to forestall insolvency,not to provide recompense after it has occurred.in short,there is no basis in the language of the regulations or promulgating statutes for inferring that a civil cause of action for damages lay in favor of anyone.touche ross redington,d.
because the regulations fdic cites do not support a private right of action,fdic through its assertions of a state law negligence per se claim is attempting to impose on the defendants a duty unknown in state law.dean.at.
in accordance with the decisions of other courts that have considered whether violations of the regulations cited by fdic,such as b,can support a state law claim for negligence per se,we conclude that the new mexico supreme court would agree that such regulations do not support a claim of negligence per se under new mexico law.therefore,we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting fdic proposed negligence per se instruction.
under new mexico law,lenders are prohibited in certain circumstances from making a loan secured by property encumbered by liens.contending that the district court gave an incorrect instruction on the impact of new mexico law prohibiting subordinate lien lending with regard to the omni loan,fdic relies on.f which states in relevant part 
in no event shall an association make a loan,purchase or sell a note or lien or enter into any participation transaction authorized by the savings and loan act in violation of any regulation promulgated by the supervisor,and no association shall 
m ake a real estate loan which is not secured by a first and prior lien upon the property described in the mortgage,deed of trust or other instrument creating or constituting the lien unless every prior lien of record thereon is owned by or subordinated to the association.
fdic alleged that the omni loan was secured by a fourth lien.based on this statute,fdic proffered the following instruction 
until august of,first american was a savings and loan subject to new mexico law.at the time,new mexico law prohibited a new mexico savings and loan from taking anything other than a first lien on any real property securing a loan.
if you find that schuchmann allowed or caused first american to enter into the omni real estate investment loan in violation of this law,then you must find him at fault and liable for any losses resulting from the omni real estate investment loan.
i appellant app.at.although the district court adopted the language of the first paragraph,it declined to accept the rest of fdic instruction,instead charging the jury 
however,new mexico law allowed the savings and loan supervisor to adopt regulations granting savings and loan rights,powers,privileges and immunities in addition to those expressly provided by state law and also to grant exceptions to requirements of state law to the extent that those rights,powers,privileges,immunities and exceptions were possessed by institutions.during the time of the transactions at issue in this case,the savings and loan supervisor provided an exception to the requirement of first liens,allowing institutions such as first american to make loans secured by subordinate liens,during the time of the transactions at issue in this case.
the authority of the savings and loan supervisor to adopt regulations derives from,which provides that in addition to the rights,powers,privileges,immunities and exceptions provided by the savings and loan act,such additional rights,powers,privileges,immunities and exceptions may be grant ed,extend ed,and provide d for by regulations promulgated by the savings and loan supervisor,n otwithstanding any other provision of the savings and loan act.one such regulation,in effect during the time of the omni loan transaction,allowed savings and loan associations to extend a loan secured by encumbered property as long as the unpaid amount of all recorded loans secured by prior mortgages,liens or other encumbrances on the security property that would have priority over the association lien does not exceed the applicable maximum ratio limitations prescribed in this regulation.reg.d.
the district court properly instructed the jury that there was an exception to the first lien requirement.however,because the court did not inform the jury of the conditions of that exception,we simply can not find upon hearing the instructions,the jury understood the issues to be resolved and its duty to resolve them.medlock,at citing brodie,at.the trial court failure to define the exception could only lead the jury to conclude the court had determined the exception to the requirement of first liens was applicable or to speculate as to whether it was.neither alternative is acceptable.this failure is not harmless because there is insufficient evidence in the record to determine whether the omni loan met the exception to the first lien rule,to determine whether the unpaid amount of the loans secured by the previous liens exceeded the applicable maximum ratio limitations.accordingly,we reverse the district court judgment with regard to the omni loan transaction and remand for further proceedings 
the new mexico supreme court has adopted the following formulation of the business judgment rule 
if in the course of management,directors arrive at a decision,within the corporation powers inter vires sic and their authority,for which there is a reasonable basis,and they act in good faith,as the result of their independent discretion and judgment,and uninfluenced by any consideration other than what they honestly believe to be the best interests of the corporation,a court will not interfere with internal management and substitute its judgment for that of the directors to enjoin or set aside the transaction or to surcharge the directors for any resulting loss.
white banes,quoting diiaconi new cal,further citations omitted see also.b prohibiting imposition of liability on a director who acts in good faith,in a manner the director believes to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation,and with such care as an ordinarily prudent person would use under similar circumstances in a like position.consistent with new mexico law,the district court instructed the jury that directors must arrive at their decisions,within the corporation powers and their authority,with a reasonable basis,and while acting in good faith,as the result of their independent discretion and judgment,and uninfluenced by any consideration other than what they honestly believe to be the best interests of the corporation.i appellant app.at.
despite the congruence of the instructions and the applicable law,fdic contends the instructions failed to describe the exceptions to the business judgment rule and the effect of those exceptions on the burden of proof.appellant br.at.the exceptions identified by the fdic in its proffered instruction,however,are no more than a negative formulation of the affirmative duties described by the rule.for example,the proffered instructions state that the business judgment rule does not apply if directors have not acted in good faith,i appellant app.at,while the instructions given state that the rule requires directors to act in good faith,id.at.similarly,contrary to fdic assertion,the instructions adequately informed the jury that the business judgment rule does not apply if a conflict of interest tainted the decision in question.the instructions so informed the jury by stating that directors decisions are to be uninfluenced by any consideration other than what they honestly believe to be the best interests of the corporation.id.at.
the district court instructed the jury that the burden of proof was on plaintiff to prove every element of its case by a preponderance of the evidence.fdic argues it is that when the business judgment rule does not apply to a transaction,the burden of proof is on the director to show that the action under fire is fair to the corporation.appellant br.at quoting gearhart,at.appellant does not cite new mexico case law in support of this purportedly burden shifting rule.moreover,our review of what little new mexico law exists on the business judgment rule reveals that the burden shifting rule is far from.under these circumstances,we can not conclude the district court abused its discretion in declining to give a instruction.
adverse domination is an equitable theory for tolling the statute of limitations applicable to claims of negligence like those involved in the instant case.the district court instructed the jury as follows 
in order to prove adverse domination the plaintiff must establish that,for a specified period of time,there was no one with knowledge of facts giving rise to possible liability who could or would have induced first american to bring a lawsuit.to do this the plaintiff must show that the defendant had full,complete,and exclusive control of the institution and negate the possibility that any informed director or shareholder could have induced the corporation to institute a lawsuit.
