this case explores the massachusetts law of close corporations and the ability of those corporations to give releases of claims of.a jury found that the defendants,an and the controlling shareholders in two close family corporations,had unjustly enriched themselves from corporate funds in the sum of over.this appeal concerns whether that liability was extinguished by a release in favor of the defendants that was executed by the corporation and its remaining directors and shareholders on march,as part of mutual releases given in connection with a stock redemption of the defendants shares.if liability is extinguished,then the plaintiffs,who are creditors in bankruptcy standing in the shoes of the corporation,can not recover on the jury verdict.
the district court did not reach the questions about the validity and enforceability of the release because it ruled that the creditors could not assert such,that they lacked standing.while that standing analysis has some attraction,it is ultimately unpersuasive.the questions about the release will have to be addressed on remand because this record does not permit their resolution.no massachusetts case is directly on point as to the standards to be used.this opinion attempts to provide guidance for the case on remand,in an area of law marked by ambiguity and inconsistency.
corporation was in the business of manufacturing,distributing,and selling plastic dental and hair products,such as toothbrushes and combs.the company was formed under massachusetts law in by three family robert gottsegen family,the stuart gottsegen family,and the lawrence gottsegen and an individual named larry wald.robert was the president of the company,and he,stuart,and wald served as directors.lawrence was primarily responsible for sales wald was responsible for financial operations.
robert children,lori and michael,and robert,dorothy,were stockholders of the company,as were stuart,lawrence,and wald two trusts,one for the benefit of michael and one for the benefit of lori,also owned stock.lawrence was the trustee of both trusts.although robert did not own stock,he effectively controlled the company in his capacity as the sole voting trustee of a voting trust that owned percent of voting stock.wald was the only stockholder who was not a member of the voting trust.the voting trust included all of the stock held by dorothy,lori,michael,and the two trusts.to the extent that robert interests were aligned with the interests of the other members of his family unit,the robert gottsegen group effectively functioned as one unit in three intertwined capacities as the president,as a director,and as the majority shareholder of.
professional brush,pro brush was formed in and was in the business of manufacturing,distributing,and selling toothbrushes and other dental care products.robert was president and a director of the company lawrence,stuart,and wald were the other directors.michael and lori owned pro brush stock,as did steven gottsegen,stuart,and wald.
in,robert suffered a heart attack.on march,pursuant to a stock redemption agreement,redeemed all of the shares held by michael,lori,dorothy,and the two trusts.as of the same date,the voting trust was terminated,robert resigned as both president and director,and the management of the corporation changed accordingly as part of the redemption agreement,in exchange for shares of stock and for other consideration including consulting,confidentiality and noncompetition agreements with robert and dorothy,and confidentiality and noncompetition agreements with lori and michael,assigned to michael,lori,dorothy,and the trustee of the two trusts the proceeds totaling approximately million from the merger of solo products,into and granted them entitlements to receive certain other payments.
also on march,michael and lori entered into a stock redemption agreement with pro brush,whereby michael and lori each received dollars in exchange for the shares of pro brush stock that each held.pursuant to a provision in this redemption agreement,robert resigned as president and director of pro brush.
as part of the stock redemption agreement robert,dorothy,lori,michael,and the two trusts the redeeming principals or the robert gottsegen group also entered into an agreement of mutual release the release with the company and its remaining on march.under its terms,and its remaining shareholders agreed to release the redeeming principals from any and all actions,causes of action,damages,claims or demands of whatever kind or nature which the company and remaining principals ever had or claimed to have relating to any act,omission,cause or thing done or omitted with respect to the formation,incorporation or operation of the company the release excluded claims related to the continuing obligations owed by the redeeming principals under the terms of the redemption agreement and the collateral agreements and claims arising from any legal proceeding initiated by alfred stauble.the release was signed by all of shareholders and all of its directors.it is this release that is at issue here.
in june,the redeeming principals sued in state court alleging that they were owed additional payments under the stock redemption agreement based on attainment of a specified level of earnings.they also alleged fraud on the part of in the termination of the voting trust.a default judgment was entered against for,and the voting trust was reinstated.on february,the redeeming principals and entered into a settlement agreement whereby the voting trust was again terminated and robert was elected a director but agreed not to prevent from filing for bankruptcy.
on march,and pro brush voluntarily filed chapter petitions.on february,and pro brush,as,brought an adversary proceeding against the redeeming principals alleging a host of claims.among other things,the complaint alleged that the redeeming principals had caused to pay for their personal expenses and make other expenditures for their benefit that had no legitimate corporate purpose the defendants affirmative defenses included the release and the statute of limitations.
on november,the bankruptcy court confirmed the second amended liquidating joint plan of reorganization of the debtors.the court order established that all property of the and pro brush bankruptcy estates would thereafter be vested in the creditors trust and that the trustees of the creditors trust would succeed to the debtors right to bring or continue causes of action.subsequently,james liston and john monaghan,in their capacity as creditors trustees,replaced and pro brush as plaintiffs in the corporations suit against the redeeming principals.
the defendants moved for summary judgment based on the release and statute of limitations defenses,and the bankruptcy court denied the motion on february.on may,the bankruptcy court sua sponte vacated its february order and granted partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs on the statute of limitations defense.discovery ensued.the defendants filed a motion to vacate the may order in december,and the district court denied that motion on january,after de novo review.
during the five day trial in april,the parties disagreed,among other things,about the extent to which the defendants had received personal payments,about whether the defendants had reimbursed the company for the payments of personal expenses they did receive,and about whether the defendants had made loans to the company.there was general agreement,however,that funds were indeed used to pay the personal expenses of the defendants in the first instance,and that other in also received payments of personal expenses.by agreement,the release defense was not submitted to the jury.
in a special verdict,the jury found that had paid of the redeeming principals personal,expenses and that the redeeming principals had not reimbursed for such payments among the allegedly unreimbursed payments shown to have been made to robert and other members of his family unit were country club dues and expenses payments to pharmacies for medications automobile expenses payments for telephone calls from robert home in bermuda legal fees for litigation to which was not a party payments to robert divorce lawyers monthly payments to robert mother rent payments for an apartment occupied by michael and monthly payments to dorothy.
the parties filed motions for judgment as a matter of law under rule regarding whether the release should bar the unjust enrichment claim,and the district court scheduled an evidentiary hearing on that issue.the parties then agreed to have the district court decide the issues pertaining to the release without hearing further evidence,so the district court cancelled the hearing.
the district court memorandum and order on the parties respective motions for judgment as a matter of law concluded,against the plaintiffs,that the release was executed by,because there was sufficient evidence that had assented to it,despite its formal shortcomings,and enforceable,because it was executed at a time when no duties were owed to creditors.the district court entered judgment in favor of the defendants.
the creditors trustees appeal the district court decisions to deny their motion for judgment as a matter of law regarding the release and to allow the defendants motion for judgment as a matter of law.the defendants on the statute of limitations ruling argues that their statutory and constitutional rights were violated when the bankruptcy court sua sponte granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs on may.
creditors trustees as plaintiffs 
the district court construed the question of the validity and enforceability of the release as an issue of law.it first determined that the release had been executed by the corporation,even though no signature qua corporation was designated it also determined that the broad scope of the release would cover the unjust enrichment claims,if the release was deemed valid and enforceable.
the district court then explained that the corporation shareholders could have brought a derivative action if the unjustly enriched participants had acted to the detriment of the corporation in executing the release.however,the court held that the plaintiffs here were creditors and could not bring an action challenging the release unless its execution contributed to the corporation insolvency or took place while the corporation was insolvent.because the corporation was not insolvent at the time of the release and there was no evidence suggesting that the release contributed to its subsequent insolvency,the court ruled 
while shareholders may have been able to object to the release,in fact,every shareholder signed it.the fact that is presently insolvent does not mean that the release suddenly becomes invalid as a result of duties owed to creditors or to the corporation on behalf of the creditors.invalidating the release years after its execution because of its adverse effects on creditors interests would create fiduciary duties to creditors where they simply do not exist.
accordingly,the court did not reach the questions raised about the validity and enforceability of the release.
on appeal,the plaintiffs argue that the court applied the wrong analytical principles in choosing to deny creditors the ability to pursue claims as substitute plaintiffs for the corporation.they argue that the company,as,properly filed an adversary proceeding against the defendants pursuant to the rules of the federal bankruptcy system.this position is correct.a corporation may bring an action against its directors,current or former,for.see boston children heart foundation,cir applying massachusetts law.and a may commence an action without court approval.collier on bankruptcy ed.
the creditors trustees then argue that,by order of the bankruptcy court,they properly stepped into the shoes of the corporation as plaintiffs.in those shoes,they are asserting the corporation right to recover to the estate the amount of the unjust enrichment.that they,as creditors,would be the real beneficiaries of any recovery is,they say,happenstance and does not alter the fact that they sue in the shoes of the company.the defendants do not contest this proposition indeed,no objection was made to the bankruptcy court when it permitted the creditors to sue,and the case was characterized to the jury as just explained.
while the district court contrary view is a position it ultimately must give way on the question of standing.the court intuition does,though,inform the analysis later.
the creditors trustees may properly stand in the shoes of the corporation and its shareholders for purposes of the suit because they are continuing the corporation cause of action,not initiating a separate action on behalf of creditors.see collier on bankruptcy ed.the trustee stands in the shoes of the debtor corporation in prosecuting a cause of action belonging to the debtor id.a trustee appointed in a chapter case is automatically substituted as a party in any pending action,proceeding or matter and therefore has the same rights and obligations as the debtor in possession.when a corporation sues its fiduciaries or a stockholder brings a derivative suit against corporate fiduciaries to enforce the corporation rights,any recovery for the fiduciary breach belongs to the corporation see,bessette bessette,it is a basic principle of corporate law that if a majority shareholder receives corporate cash distributions and a salary in excess of the reasonable value of services rendered,the right to recover the overpayments belongs to the corporation.sums recovered by a corporation in such suits are paid first to creditors,before any distributions are made to shareholders see bagdon,cir recoveries in derivative suits pass through the corporate treasury,a process that both protects creditors who get first dibs and avoids questions of apportionment.as a result,the issues pretermitted by the district court about the validity and enforceability of the release must be reached.
in one sense it is quite true that the other shareholders were the victims of the unjust enrichment and of any failure to make adequate disclosure to them in securing the release,and they are not complaining about either.but to the extent that unjust enrichment occurred,it was through a misuse of the corporation assets and the release,although ratified by the shareholders,was a corporate act surrendering a claim of the corporation.whatever right the corporation may have to recover for unjust enrichment,through the invalidation of the release,is an asset of the corporation and now belongs to the creditors.
standard for determining the enforceability of the release 
in essence,this case involves two claims of fiduciary breach.the first,on which the jury found for the plaintiffs,is that the redeeming principals had unjustly enriched themselves from the corporation coffers.the second claim is that the redeeming principals committed a fiduciary breach that renders the release unenforceable.the plaintiffs argue that the release is unenforceable at a minimum because the defendants failed to disclose the material details of their unjust enrichment to remaining shareholders and directors when seeking the release.they also argue that the release is unenforceable because the defendants have not demonstrated that the release was fair to the company.
at issue,then,is the standard for determining the enforceability of a release,executed by a close corporation and its directors and shareholders,of claims later proven to a jury that certain corporate directors and shareholders unjustly enriched themselves at the expense of the corporation.there is no massachusetts case directly on point.
corporations,whether close or public,have a strong interest in being able to give valid and enforceable releases.a release of claims by a close corporation in particular,even a release of claims against its controlling shareholders,may benefit the close corporation by allowing it to resolve internal disputes in a swift and manner and by enabling it to facilitate the termination of the involvement of its principals close corporations like also present fewer concerns about possible injury to the investing public from the actions of corporate directors and shareholders than do public corporations or charitable corporations.and where all of the shareholders as opposed to the directors of a close corporation execute a release after having received full disclosure,there are policy reasons to enforce such a release.
even so,within close corporations there are fiduciary duties imposed on directors,officers,and,for some purposes,shareholders,in connection with their respective dealings with,and on behalf of,the close corporation and its shareholders.see demoulas demoulas super,donahue rodd electrotype.the release transaction involved here was not entered into by two or more independent business entities,but rather,was an entirely into by the close corporation itself acting through the ratification of its shareholders with its own principals.the nature of the transaction,the plaintiffs argue,gave rise to certain fiduciary obligations by the redeeming principals.
in demoulas,the most recent massachusetts case about,the plaintiff brought a derivative action against the trustee of a close corporation and certain affiliated persons and entities,alleging that the defendants had diverted corporate opportunities and engaged in.at.the supreme judicial court explained that a corporate fiduciary is not entirely barred from pursuing a corporate opportunity or entering into a transaction.when such actions are taken,though,the corporate fiduciary has a duty to disclose the details of the to the corporate and,at least when the are interested directors,has the burden of proving that the opportunity or transaction is fair.id.at.the court summarized the standard as follows 
in short,to meet a fiduciary duty of loyalty,a director or officer who wishes to take advantage of a corporate opportunity or engage in must first disclose material details of the venture to the corporation,and then either receive the assent of disinterested directors or shareholders,or otherwise prove that the decision is fair to the corporation.
it is clear from demoulas that massachusetts imposes on corporate fiduciaries a duty of full disclosure of material facts in connection with.material information about the transaction is needed to make an educated decision about whether to allow it,and in the case of a release,information about the conduct of the potential recipients of the release is necessary for deciding whether to grant the release encompassing such conduct.thus,the demoulas rule protects by giving them information.
but demoulas does not explicitly address the question of whether full disclosure to interested shareholders suffices in the context of a release given with unanimous shareholder consent and more generally,demoulas leaves open the question of the effect of ratification by interested shareholders and the question of what role fairness plays when interested shareholders have ratified.
the law in this area is a tangled web.language from cases in both the supreme judicial court and in this court could,if lifted out of context,be taken to mean that a showing of fairness is always a requirement.see winchell plywood,requiring a corporate fiduciary to prove full disclosure and fairness to the corporation boston children heart foundation,cir same,applying massachusetts law.this language in modern opinions,which seems to invoke a universal requirement of showing fairness,is at odds with older cases saying that transactions between corporations and their fiduciaries that are open and informed may be approved by the express consent of all the stockholders.warren para rubber shoe,holding that a corporation could contract with directors when the contract was made openly and with the assent of all the stockholders and the stockholders were not ignorant of the terms of the contract or of the relationship between the contracting parties.until massachusetts addresses these questions directly,we are left to work out the issue.
on balance,we conclude the wiser rule is that where there is unanimous and fully informed shareholder approval in a close corporation,such approval suffices subject to special rules for insolvency.if there is not full disclosure and unanimous approval,the question arises whether a showing of fairness alone would suffice to validate the release.this appears to be the rule in most jurisdictions,gevurtz,corporation law yet a very literal reading of demoulas language quoted above might suggest the need for both full disclosure and this variation was not decided there.quite possibly the question need not be answered in the present case and we do not seek to do so because,if the transaction embracing the release was fair,arguably this means that the corporation has already been properly compensated for its unjust enrichment claim.
the rule we adopt is close to the rule in the delaware that a transaction may be approved by the consent of all interested or long as there is disclosure to those shareholders of all material facts concerning the see ann.tit,a clark,corporate law.that statutory rule is modified by delaware case law,but the case law regarding the effect of the fully informed consent of shareholders in various has been described by the delaware chancery court as not a model of clarity.solomon armstrong.
here,there was unanimous shareholder approval,so the case does not present the question of what to do where a majority of shareholders approve but that majority is controlled by or composed of the defendants.if fully informed shareholder approval were simply by a majority,then different rules and shifting burdens might apply,see,wachsler,florafax int l,cir,because then,even an informed shareholder vote may not afford the minority sufficient protection to obviate the judicial oversight role.in re wheelabrator.that rationale for requiring an additional fairness protection of dissenting minority shareholders who,perforce,have brought a derivative inapplicable where the fully informed shareholder owners of a close corporation,even if interested,unanimously consent to the giving of a release.
as a practical matter,many close corporations are family corporations do not have any disinterested shareholders or disinterested directors.because the shareholders are the owners,if all of the owners,interested or not,of a close corporation agree to allow a release of claims of after receiving full information about it,then they have had the opportunity to protect their own interests and there are no dissenting shareholders who may need further protection.it would ordinarily be unwise to involve courts in reviewing the informed and unanimous decisions of the owners,absent special circumstances.
massachusetts,of course,may choose a different path in the future.it may,for example,feel that creditors of close corporations deserve protection against the mutual looting of corporate assets by all of a close corporation shareholders.the law,however,already provides a degree of such protection.as the district court aptly recognized,a corporation may not act to release claims when that action would cause the corporation to go into insolvency or would take place during insolvency.see.laws ch,in re tufts,explaining that prejudice to creditors arises where the transaction is a fraudulent conveyance or one which led to corporate insolvency.
if there has not been adequate disclosure to the remaining shareholders,then there may be defenses available such as lack of causation or lack of damages,the availability or force of which we need not determine.
burden of proving the enforceability of the release 
the fact of a release is an affirmative defense,and the party seeking to have a release enforced usually bears the initial burden of pleading and proving the existence of that release.see sharon city of newton.that was done here.
once the burden of proving the existence of an executed release has been met,the burden of proving or disproving its enforceability may lie with either party,depending on the context in which the release was given.the defendants argue that the release is a contract and can not be nullified absent the plaintiff proving fraud,misrepresentation,mutual mistake,breach of fiduciary duty,or undue influence or that at the time the release was given the corporation was insolvent or be
