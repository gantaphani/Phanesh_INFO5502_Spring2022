plaintiffs,tonia metz and gerald metz brought this action against at t and one of its employees,margaret roman,alleging that roman defamed the plaintiffs in the course of her employment.the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants,ruling that the metzes were not proper plaintiffs,and that the allegedly defamatory statements were conditionally privileged.it further ruled that,as the remaining plaintiff,could not defeat the privilege because there was no evidence that roman made the allegedly defamatory statements with malice or without a good faith belief in their truth.the plaintiffs appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we affirm in part,and reverse in part.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiff,is a company that provides clients with consulting and staffing services.plaintiffs and metz are the company cfo and ceo,respectively,and its sole shareholders.effective february,defendant at t and entered into an agreement under which would provide temporary workers to at t and its subsidiaries.the agreement specified that all invoices would be payable by at t ten days from the date of receipt.
the parties agree that over the life of the agreement,at t failed to pay many of these bills on time.in her affidavit,metz claimed that she confronted at t procurement specialist margaret roman prior to november about these payment problems.metz claimed that,when confronted,roman told her that before metz withdrew services,she should consider how powerful at t was and how it would appear to other clients if could not meet its service obligations to at moreover,some complaints had arisen regarding payment of certain staff by.although the parties dispute the extent and cause of these problems,it appears that they were due in part to an internal embezzlement that had suffered,a fact that metz expressed to roman.was at all times solvent.
on december,metz notified roman that he was going to terminate the agreement because of at t failure to pay the invoices within days,and that payroll would stop after that week.roman protested that it was especially difficult to effect a transition to other vendors on such short notice,so metz agreed to continue payroll until december.roman complained further that it was difficult to transfer employees around the holidays,and asked if metz was discontinuing service because of the recent embezzlement at or because you ca afford to do business metz responded,acci is healthy except for the cost we incurred from this contract,which i resolving today.marge,there nothing wrong with my business except for the time i having to spend on our contract.roman then asked metz not to say anything to the at t managers or employees about the transition,a similar request on december,that metz inform managers of the situation only on a need to know basis.metz swore in an affidavit that he believed roman was very annoyed and felt animosity toward him during the phone call.
after the conversation,roman sent to several at t managers stating that employees would be transferred to another vendor.the contained language similar to the following 
are currently having financial difficulties and can no longer provide services to at 
roman and another manager also sent these to two individuals who worked for a competitor of and who were involved with the transitions.
in her deposition,roman acknowledged that,at the time she made the statements,she did not think was unable to perform on the contract.elsewhere,roman asserted that,at the time she made the statements,she believed the plaintiffs financial difficulties may have played a part in their decision.roman also stated that she made the statements to convey a sense of urgency to the recipients.
discussion 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.universal health,thompson,cir.in california,the definition of libel includes a false and unprivileged publication by writing which has a tendency to injure any person in his occupation.cal.we first consider whether the metzes as individuals were proper plaintiffs in this action.after that,we address whether the district court erred when it held that the common interest privilege foreclosed a trial on the merits.
the district court held that the metzes could not sue as individuals for defamation directed at their company because the allegedly defamatory statements could not reasonably be interpreted as referring to the plaintiffs as individuals.we affirm on a somewhat different ground from that relied upon by the district court.
in california,whether statements can be reasonably interpreted as referring to plaintiffs is a question of law for the court.alszeh hbo,th,d.if there is no express reference to the plaintiff in a defamatory statement,the claim will fail unless the statement refers to the plaintiff by reasonable implication.see blatty times,cal d,intentional interference case citing defamation cases.
in some cases,it is relatively clear that defamatory statements about a company can reasonably be understood to refer to the owner of the company,as in bohan v.the record publ g,and schiavone constr.time.in these cases the businesses bore the individual plaintiff name,and in bohan the defamatory statement explicitly referred to the proprietor of the firm.at.neither case expressly required,however,that plaintiffs share the name of their business in order to maintain a suit.at t cites no california case and we can find none that addresses the question whether an owner of a corporation can maintain an action for a defamatory statement that refers expressly to the business alone.cases from other jurisdictions give little aid because the results diverge greatly.see,steel darby,cir shareholder suit disallowed,but suit as sole proprietor permitted a shop called east,med.rptr,suit by dual owners of corporation allowed mcbride publ g,cir suit by sole shareholder disallowed.thus we can draw no categorical conclusion whether california would or would not infer that defamation of a corporation would permit suit by its owners.
in the absence of a fixed rule,the metzes argue that,under the facts of their case,any defamation of their business could reasonably be understood as referring to them.they contend that their reputations were closely associated with the small corporation that they owned,so that any statements defaming regarding its financial problems and inability to perform would necessarily reflect on their reputations.we need not resolve this question,however,because there is an independent ground to support the district court decision.to proceed with their suit as individuals,the metzes must show not only that the statement could reasonably be understood as referring to them as individuals,but also that some third party understood the statement in this way.see dewitt wright,cal,smith maldonado,th,d.
the metzes cite church of scientology of california flynn,cir,for the proposition that i t is sufficient if from the evidence the jury can infer that the defamatory statement applies to the plaintiff.id.at quoting di giorgio fruit,d.the metzes read flynn as eliminating the need to show that a third party actually understood the statement to refer to the plaintiffs.we reject this contention.flynn arose out of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim the court held that dismissal was improper because,among other reasons,the complaint alleged that the defamatory remarks were understood by the listening public to apply to the plaintiff.see id.at.
flynn thus does not modify the rule that a defamatory statement that is ambiguous as to its target not only must be capable of being understood to refer to the plaintiff,but also must be shown actually to have been so understood by a third party.see dewitt,cal.at i t is essential not only that it should have been written concerning the plaintiff,but also that it was so understood by at least some one third person.restatement second of torts cmt.a it is necessary that the recipient of the defamatory communication understand it as intended to refer to the plaintiff.
the metzes failed to provide admissible evidence to support this second requirement of their defamation claim.they presented some testimony in the district court that third parties communicated with them in a way that implied that the allegedly defamatory statements referred to the plaintiffs as individuals.the district court held that this evidence lacked foundation and struck it from the record.the plaintiffs do not challenge its exclusion on appeal.the plaintiffs cite no other evidence in the record suggesting that any third party understood the statements as referring to the metzes by implication.
for the same reason,the metzes can not find refuge in the doctrine that small groups of plaintiffs may sometimes recover even though they are defamed in the aggregate.see blatty,cal d at,collecting cases and holding that individual defamation suits may lie when groups with fewer than members are defamed kilpatrick edge,restatement second of torts.the alleged defamation in this case referred only to the corporation.the metzes have not produced admissible evidence to show that the defamation was understood by any third party to apply to a group that included the metzes.during her deposition,roman testified that she knew of two recipients of the who had previously dealt directly with the metzes.there was no evidence other than the metzes unfounded assertions to suggest that these managers,or any other recipient of the,knew about the ownership structure of and the metzes roles within the organization.this evidence,without more,is not sufficient to support an inference that any manager understood the to refer to the metzes in addition to 
in holding as we do,we do not impugn the common law rule that circumstantial evidence may be used to prove that defamatory material was published to a third party who reasonably understood it to refer to the plaintiffs.see food lion,melton,collecting cases from seven other states.it is not always necessary for a plaintiff to present testimony from a third party regarding what that person heard and understood.id.we simply apply the rule that when a defamatory statement identifies the plaintiff only by implication,and the implication is reasonable but by no means necessary,the plaintiff carries a corresponding burden to present evidence that a recipient of the statement made the implied connection.see davis hearst,cal,w here the libel is covertly expressed or ambiguous worded,evidence is required to show that the plaintiff is the party to whom it applies,or was intended to apply.but if the jury find that any person to whom it was published would understand it as applying to the plaintiff,that will be sufficient to sustain the verdict.quoting henry folkard,slander libel at ed,overruled on other grounds by sheldon appel albert oliker,cal d,dan dobbs,the law of torts e xtrinsic facts,if known to at least one recipient of a publication not internally identifying the plaintiff,may demonstrate that it referred to the plaintiff.
because there was no evidence that the were actually understood by any recipient to refer to the plaintiffs,we need not address whether any such understanding was reasonable under bohan and blatty.therefore,we hold that the metzes have not presented sufficient evidence to proceed with their claim as dual proprietors of.
at t next contends that even if the were defamatory with respect to,the contents of the were privileged and therefore not actionable.california civil code section c specifies that privilege protects a statement made 
i n a communication,without malice,to a person interested therein,by one who is also interested,or by one who stands in such a relation to the person interested as to afford a reasonable ground for supposing the motive for the communication to be innocent,or who is requested by the person interested to give the information 
the applicability of the section c privilege provision is a question of law where the facts alleged to give rise to the privilege are undisputed.vackar package machinery.for reasons we set forth below,we hold that this common interest privilege is potentially applicable to roman,but that issues of fact remain that render summary judgment inappropriate.
a.the occasion for the communication 
the defendant has the initial burden of showing the allegedly defamatory statement was made on a privileged occasion kashian harriman,th,d.we conclude that the defendants have carried this initial burden.roman communicated the allegedly libelous statements to employees of at t and others involved with transferring the employees to a new vendor.she shared a business and organizational relationship with the recipients.therefore,the privilege extends to these relationships.
the plaintiffs argue,however,that roman communications exceeded the scope of the privilege.the privilege may be lost if the defendant abuses the privilege by excessive publication or the inclusion of immaterial matter which have no bearing upon the interest sought to be protected gardner shasta county,wl,at,quoting deaile,d.t o be protected,the communication must be one reasonably calculated to further the common interest.cuenca safeway employees fed.credit union,d.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
the plaintiffs argue that roman communications fell outside the scope of the privilege because the recipients had no legitimate common interest in financial difficulties.perhaps this is so insofar as the financial difficulties phrase was not strictly necessary to the message that roman needed to convey,namely,that employees needed to be transferred to a new vendor.the plaintiffs approach,however,places too drastic a restraint on the scope of the common interest privilege,a scope that is not capable of precise or categorical definition.kashian,th at,d.the standard is one of reasonableness,not of necessity.see cuenca,d at.even putting aside roman asserted desire to convey a sense of urgency,which is in dispute,the financial difficulties phrase still has relevance to the underlying communication.conceivably,it provides the recipients with an understanding of why they have been assigned a difficult task.it puts to rest any urge to blame roman or at t for the unwelcome news.it also undermines any hope of challenging the order these financial difficulties make the managers task imminent and unavoidable.therefore,the common interest privilege is applicable on its face to the financial difficulties language.
b.roman state of mind 
even if the communication furthers a common interest of the parties to the communication,a plaintiff may still defeat the privilege.section c specifies that the privilege does not protect statements made with malice.in addition,california courts have held that ordinarily the privilege is lost if defendant has no reasonable grounds for believing his statements to be true.inst.of athletic motivation of,d.we hold that,contrary to the view of the district court,triable issues exist as to malice and good faith,so summary judgment on this issue was improper.
malice as used in section c includes the following subjectively oriented definition 
malice means a state of mind arising from hatred or ill will,evidencing a willingness to vex,annoy or injure another person.thus the privilege is lost if the publication is motivated by hatred or ill will toward plaintiff,or by any cause other than the desire to protect the interest for the protection of which the privilege is given.
cabanas gloodt,citations and internal quotation marks omitted.malice may not be inferred from the publication itself.cal.the plaintiff bears the burden of proving malice.lundquist reusser,cal th,d.
a showing that malice merely exists is not sufficient to defeat the privilege.if the occasion is conditionally privileged,if the defendant primary motive is the advancement of the interest which the privilege protects and if he speaks in good faith,the mere fact that he harbors ill will toward the plaintiff should be a neutral factor.biggins hanson,d.
the district court based its conclusion that the plaintiffs could not show malice solely on a bit of deposition testimony where metz admitted a belief that roman did not hate him and his wife at the time roman sent the.this admission,however,is but one piece of evidence
