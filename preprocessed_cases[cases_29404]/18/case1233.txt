deutsche bank ag deutsche bank appeals from the decision of the united states court of federal claims the claims court denying deutsche bank motion for summary judgment and holding that deutsche bank was not entitled to additional interest on an overpayment of its income tax.see deutsche bank ag united states,fed.cl.because we conclude as a matter of law that deutsche bank income tax return was not filed by the extended return filing due date in processible form to commence the accrual of overpayment interest,we affirm.
background 
deutsche bank filed its income tax return on or before september,the original return,after obtaining a extension of time from the return filing due date of march.deutsche bank,fed.cl.at.the original return consisted of form income tax return of a foreign corporation and supporting documents.on the first page of form,deutsche bank reported a total tax of line,a total payment of line including credit for taxes withheld at the source in the amount of line,and a resulting overpayment of million line,which deutsche bank requested to be credited to the tax year.
form does not itemize the withholding credit reported on line,which is the total of individual taxes withheld at different sources.deutsche bank,fed.cl.at.the individual withholding credits are derived from information returns such as internal revenue service irs form foreign partner information statement of section withholding tax and form s foreign person source income subject to withholding,which are issued by a withholding agent to the taxpayer to report income paid or allocated to that taxpayer and taxes withheld on behalf of that taxpayer.the withholding agent prepares duplicative copies of an information return,sends one copy directly to irs,retains one copy for its records,and sends the remaining copies,two copies of form or three copies of form s,to the taxpayer.id.
for the tax year,deutsche bank received one form and five forms s from six different withholding agents.id.the instructions for forms,and s and statements on those forms required deutsche bank to attach forms and s to its federal income tax return.see also.deutsche bank,however,did not attach forms and deutsche bank,fed.cl.at.irs sent the original return back unprocessed and requested documentation to support the withholding credit claimed on line.id.
deutsche bank resubmitted the original return with forms and s in november the resubmitted return.id.in an accompanying letter,deutsche bank informed irs that upon review of the forms,it discovered that it had overstated the withholding credit by and therefore that the correct amount on line should have been and that the claimed overpayment should have been reduced by.irs processed the resubmitted return without correcting the error and credited the overpayment to the tax year.deutsche bank,fed.cl.at.
in march,deutsche bank filed an amended income tax return on form amended corporation income tax return claiming an additional refund of million based on a valuation adjustment.irs issued the million refund in november along with million in overpayment interest for the period from january,to november.id.when deutsche bank requested additional interest from march to december,irs contended that the original return was not filed in processible form.because no interest on overpayment accrues before a return is filed in processible form,irs explained that deutsche bank was entitled to interest only from january,the date on which irs had recorded the resubmitted return as filed.id.at.
deutsche bank sued the united states in the claims court for additional interest on the million overpayment and moved for summary judgment.the court denied the motion,holding that the original return was not in processible form because deutsche bank did not include all of the required documentation with its original income tax return and that the initial return did not itself contain sufficient information to allow the mathematical verification of income tax liability.id.at.the parties subsequently stipulated that the resubmitted return was filed on december,and the united states agreed to pay interest from december to december.the court then entered final judgment for the united states.

in an appeal from the claims court,we review the court legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.columbia gas,united states.statutory interpretation is a question of law.id.we review the claims court denial of summary judgment de novo when the disputed issues concern the interpretation of a statute.massie united states.if there are no material facts in dispute precluding summary judgment,then our task is to determine whether the judgment granted is correct as a matter of law.bankers trust united states.
a taxpayer claiming a refund in a tax return is entitled to interest on overpayment when the refund is issued more than days after the initial due date for filing the return or the actual return filing date,whichever occurs later.a,e if the return is timely filed,then interest accrues from the date of the overpayment,which is generally the initial return filing due date.id.b,d.however,if the return is filed late,after the last date prescribed for filing such return determined with regard to extensions,no interest shall be allowed or paid for any day before the date on which the return is filed.id.b.in that case,interest accrues from the date on which the late return was filed.to determine the return filing date,section g provides that 
for purposes of subsections b and e,a return shall not be treated as filed until it is filed in processible form.
for purposes of paragraph,a return is in a processible form if 
a such return is filed on a permitted form,and 
b such return contains 
i the taxpayer name,address,and identifying number and the required signature,and 
ii sufficient required information whether on the return or on required attachments to permit the mathematical verification of tax liability shown on the return.
id.g emphases added.
the issue in this case is whether deutsche bank original return without forms and s met the requirements of section g to be in processible form.if the original return was processible,then interest began to accrue on march,the initial filing due date.on the other hand,if the original return was not processible,then interest began to accrue on december,the stipulated filing date of the resubmitted return.
it is undisputed that the original return satisfied the requirements of sections g a and g b i.deutsche bank,fed.cl.at.the parties disagree,however,on whether the original return contained sufficient required information on the return or the required attachments to permit the mathematical verification of tax liability under section g b ii,and the claims court held that it did not.id.first,the court concluded that forms and s were required attachments as that term is used in section g.id.at.secondly,the court concluded that w ithout the missing forms,the tax return did not contain sufficient information to allow the mathematical verification of the income tax liability shown on the tax return.id.at.we review each of those conclusions in turn.
deutsche bank argues that forms and s are not required attachments because they were not required by any statute or regulation.deutsche bank contends that the claims court erroneously relied on statements contained in irs forms and form instructions and general compliance rules of section.deutsche bank argues that for purposes of calculating interest,the specific requirement of section g supersedes the general requirement of section.deutsche bank also asserts that the required forms that we referred to in columbia gas are forms on which a tax return is based,such as form,not information reporting attachments,such as forms and 
the government responds that the statements on the face of forms,and s,the instructions accompanying those forms,and the general requirement of a return under section a provided ample basis for the court conclusion that forms an
