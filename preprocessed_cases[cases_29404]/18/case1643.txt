plaintiff fane lozman and defendant gerald putnam were business associates whose relationship turned sour.on april,they signed a written agreement regarding the sharing of revenues and commissions.just six months later,on october,they signed mutual releases that voided their april agreement.
after a dual bench and jury trial the circuit court of cook county held on july,that the release and the doctrine of laches barred plaintiffs cause of action for usurpation of corporate opportunities.lozman putnam,l,ch,circuit court of cook county,hereinafter lozman.
the plaintiffs are lozman and blue water partners,bwp,an illinois corporation.lozman and putnam were both officers in bwp prior to the execution of the release and it is bwp corporate opportunity that lozman claimed putnam usurped.
the defendants include terra nova trading,an illinois limited liability company established by putnam which received,according to lozman,the corporate opportunities usurped from bwp and archipelago,and archipelago holdings,illinois limited liability companies established by putnam subsequent to terra nova and which lozman claimed were the ultimate recipients of the opportunities usurped from bwp.plaintiff also claimed that gdp,gerald putnam received corporate opportunities usurped from bwp.putnam is the sole shareholder and director of gdp,an illinois corporation.
in addition to the putnam defendants,there are the townsend defendants stuart and marrgwen townsend,the computer programmers who programmed brokerage and trading software for bwp and townsend analytics,tal,their programming firm,which is an illinois corporation.the trial court found that it was plaintiff lozman who introduced the townsends to defendant putnam,and that bwp relationship with the townsends was a valuable asset used to establish terra nova.
defendant chicago trading and arbitrage,cta was a small order execution system soes trading business,formed by putnam and the townsends and located in the same office as bwp and terra nova.plaintiffs alleged that they were entitled to revenues generated by cta,an illinois limited liability company.
although court orders dismissing counts against defendants cta and virago enterprises,were named in the notice of appeal,plaintiffs appellate brief makes no arguments with respect to these two defendants and thus these two defendants are not part of this appeal.
for the reasons discussed below,we affirm the order and opinion of the trial court.
background 
the partnership 
plaintiff lozman and defendant putnam met in,when they both worked for the chicago securities firm of walsh greenwood.lozman later developed the idea for scanshift,a computer program for traders that displayed trading and price data based on the appearance of a pilot controls in an airplane,rather than in rows and columns.lozman had previously been a pilot with the united states marines.
in january,lozman contacted the computer programming firm of defendant tal to program scanshift.tal owned and marketed its own software program called realtick which displayed the trading prices of stocks.lozman wanted to program scanshift so that it appeared as a window or component of realtick.tal is owned by defendants stuart and marrgwen townsend.
in february,lozman discussed scanshift with putnam.putnam then approached the law firm of foley lardner to incorporate bwp,which was done on march.putnam was the president and chief executive officer of bwp,and lozman was the and the chairman of the board of directors.putnam and lozman were also directors and equity shareholders,with each owning 
lozman testified that he and putnam had agreed to form a firm to scanshift,so that the software could be furnished in exchange for brokerage commissions.with brokerage,the customer receives software from the brokerage firm in exchange for giving the brokerage firm commissions for the customer trades.
on june,lozman and putnam met with the townsends at their offices to discuss programming scanshift to work with realtick.in june and july,putnam and lozman offered the townsends a equity in and profits of bwp,in return for the townsends programming work on scanshift.however,the townsends never became officers,directors or controlling shareholders of bwp.lozman claimed that it was during this time that he disclosed to putnam and the townsends his knowledge of small order execution system soes,a form of electronic trading trading room business electronic trading and an electronic stock exchange.
on october,lozman assigned his rights in scanshift to bwp lozman and putnam agreed that bwp would receive the brokerage commissions from traders,as a result of bwp furnishing computer software to traders 
on november,terra nova trading,was incorporated in illinois,with putnam owning of the stock.terra nova had its office in the same space as bwp at west adams,chicago.lozman and putnam testified that they would market scanshift to traders through bwp free of charge,but money from licensing would be routed through terra nova.
lozman testified that terra nova was created simply to allay the fear of the townsends that partial ownership in bwp might have an adverse impact on their relationships with existing customers and to insulate the townsends from any trading liability.lozman claimed that he would not have consented to the formation of terra nova if he had known that he would not be a owner.lozman alleged that he,putnam and the townsends had an oral agreement that any proceeds from any electronic trading,soes trading and electronic exchanges that were developed would be shared on an equal basis second amend.compl.para.d.the jury found that putnam did not breach an oral agreement to deliver an ownership interest in terra nova to plaintiffs.
in january,lozman was in a serious bicycle accident,which led to months of painful physical therapy.at the time,he was unsure whether he could return to work.lozman claimed that after the accident,he could not monitor defendants activities in bwp and terra nova.lozman alleged that during this time,bwp did not receive funds to which it was entitled.second amend.compl.para.
in march,lozman returned to the office,and practiced his numchucks there to continue his physical therapy.putnam testified that lozman swung numchucks at others in the office.
on april,lozman and putnam signed a agreement that covered futures and futures options commissions generated for customer accounts initiated through scanshift or townsend software commissions paid by townsend for the promotion of their software products and equity and equity options commissions generated from customer accounts initiated through scanshift or townsend software.
putnam testified that in june,he decided to end his relationship with lozman due to lozman disruptive behavior in the office and complaints received about lozman from colleagues,vendors and customers.
lozman alleged that in june and july,putnam and the townsends met with another trader,lewis borsellino,and discussed the creation of a soes trading organization.second amend.compl.para.lozman alleged that this was a corporate opportunity diverted from bwp.
lozman alleged that on june,he was locked out of the offices occupied by bwp and terra nova.lozman sent a letter,dated july,to putnam,tal and samuel long informing them that scanshift could no longer be sold as an option to realtick.lozman alleged that from july through october,defendants continued to promote scanshift,with the townsends realtick software second amend.compl.para.
putnam and marrgwen townsend testified that the relationship soured between lozman on one hand and the townsends and putnam on the other,when lozman would repeatedly arrive unannounced at tal to discuss technical bugs in the scanshift software.lozman would demand that tal engineers fix immediately any technical bug and refused to leave the premises.stuart and marrgwen townsend asked him to stop arriving unannounced.
lozman testified that in september he attempted to find legal counsel but lacked the financial resources to pay the retainer.
the termination 
on october,just six months after having signed their april agreement,putnam and lozman terminated it and ended their business relationship.in order to effect the termination,they signed a number of documents on october,including 
three releases of liability,each signed by lozman,putnam and long 
a letter signed by putnam resigning as president and board member of bwp 
a secured demand note,signed by lozman,for to putnam and 
two assignment s separate from certificate signed by putnam and transferring to lozman common a voting shares of bwp and common b shares.
lozman,putnam and long each signed releases that,except for the inserted names,were identically worded and only four sentences long.the release signed by lozman stated 
i,fane lozman,as chairman of blue water partners,hereby release analytic services,terra nova trading,gerald putnam and samuel long from any obligations past and present arising from my past association with those entities and persons and as a result of the attached agreement.
further,i fane lozman personally release analytic services,terra nova trading,gerald putnam and samuel long from any obligations as a result of my past association with those entities and persons and as a result of the attached agreement.
i agree to release and hold harmless analytic services,terra nova trading,gerald putnam and samuel long from any obligations resulting from the attached agreement.
i further agree not to disclose the details of this agreement or to discuss terra nova trading,and analytic services or my past business relationship with gerald putnam,samuel long,terra nova trading,and analytic services,with my current or future prospects or clients.
the attached agreement mentioned in the releases was the april,commission sharing agreement.the words void were written by hand at the bottom of the april agreement,followed by the signatures of both putnam and lozman.
lozman testified that he believed that the october release voided only the april agreement,which was attached to the release.however,the trial court held that the release covered both obligations as a result of lozman past association with the named entities and persons and obligations as a result of the attached agreement.lozman,l ch,slip op.at.
the release signed by putnam was identical to the release,except it stated that he was president of terra nova trading,and that he released blue water,partners,and fane lozman.the release signed by long was also identical,except it stated that he was president of analytic services and the he released blue water partners,and fane lozman.
in the resignation letter dated october,putnam stated dear fane,please accept this letter as my resignation as president and board member of blue water partners,cancelled was handwritten on putnam two bwp stock certificates.in a secured demand note,dated october,lozman stated i promise to pay to gerald putnam after profits from the sale of my invention known as scanshift exceed.
lozman alleged that the release he signed was conditioned on putnam and townsends return to him of the scanshift software programming code,which was controlled by tal.second amend.compl.para.at trial,lozman and putnam provided contradictory testimony about whether returning the scanshift code was a condition precedent to the validity of the release.the trail court found that t he only evidence that plaintiffs proffered to rebut the presumption that no conditions precedent existed was plaintiff lozman own testimony that the parties had agreed orally to return the scanshift code back to blue water partners.lozman,ch and l,slip op.at.the trial court held that lozman testimony was insufficient to rebut the presumption that a written agreement that does not state any conditions precedent,does not have any.lozman,slip op.at.
putnam testified that he believed that signing the october release only obligated him to return the bwp stock certificates,though not physically returned,because they were being held at the law firm of foley lardner.the trial court found that,by accepting putnam resignation as president and director of bwp,lozman obtained complete control over bwp and scanshift.lozman,slip op.at.
after the october releases were signed,lozman terminated all relationships with scanshift customers by cancelling the licenses.also,jon najarian became a shareholder and director of bwp.
on november,lozman and putnam signed a termination agreement that was backdated to october.bwp retained attorney craig fowler,who had been najarian lawyer,to draft a termination agreement to verify that putnam had resigned his ownership in bwp.fowler also prepared transfer documents to transfer putnam stock certificates on november.putnam was not represented by counsel.
although the termination agreement stated that it was made and entered into as of the day of october,there is no dispute that the agreement was actually signed in november.the agreement stated in part 
effective immediately,the shareholder agreement is hereby terminated and of no further force or effect provided,however,that any causes of action which may have arisen thereunder prior to the date of this termination agreement,whether for or with respect to actions,inactions,breaches thereof or other matters,shall survive this termination.
the clause of the termination agreement that preserves any causes of action appears to conflict with the october release.lozman testified that he believed that the termination agreement preserved any claims concerning the source code,electronic trading,and an electronic exchange.putnam testified that lozman presented the termination agreement as a document that better reflected their previous agreement under the releases and resolved problems with the transfer of shares.
lozman alleged that putnam and the townsends formed chicago trading and arbitrage cta,a soes trading business located in the same office as bwp and terra nova.second amend.compl.para.lozman alleged that cta developed advanced software and computer mechanisms that led to the development of an electronic computer network ecn.second amend.compl.para.lozman alleged that cta was using townsend software and generating revenues to which plaintiffs claimed they were entitled based on the april,agreement.second amend.compl.para.lozman alleged that this was the same line of business as that in which bwp was engaged.second amend.compl.para.
defendant putnam testified that in october,he attended a meeting with nasdaq representatives,whereby he realized he could build his own qualified electronic communication network ecn.
in december,the archipelago defendants were created as a joint venture between tal and terra nova,with putnam as the chief executive officer.the archipelago defendants business included an ecn.the townsend defendants supplied the ecn software,and terra nova provided the services.putnam testified that terra nova brokerage license and security capital were necessary to start archipelago ecn,for its timely debut as allowed under new sec regulations.terra nova ceased its sponsorship of archipelago,after archipelago obtained its own license.the trial court found that archipelago was more like a stock exchange than a.lozman,ch and l,slip op.at.archipelago has since merged with the new york stock exchange.
procedural history 
although the relationship was formally dissolved on october,plaintiffs waited until august,almost four years later,to file their initial complaint.the complaint,which alleged usurpation of corporate opportunity and breach of joint venture,was later dismissed without prejudice.on december,plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint ch against putnam,the townsend defendants,terra nova trading,cta and the archipelago defendants.
plaintiffs alleged that misappropriated assets included bwp leasehold interest at west adams,chicago bwp scanshift computer code,programmed by the townsends bwp scanshift computer software programs,compiled by the townsends to run on realtick software putnam work time,owed to bwp a percentage share of the brokerage trading revenues due to bwp revenues owed to bwp from the sale of scanshift software and corporate opportunities in the electronic trading field,soes room trading and the electronic stock exchange.
on march,the trial court orally dismissed with prejudice the following counts from the first amended complaint,and the trial court also dismissed with prejudice counts land,with respect to cta and the archipelago defendants only,and count with respect to terra nova,cta and the archipelago defendants only.
with respect to the archipelago defendants,the trial court dismissed with prejudice all the counts against them which were counts through,and pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure ilcs west on april,the trial court ordered the march order amended to add that t he dismissal of the archipelago defendants with prejudice is a final and appealable order.
on april,the appellate court affirmed the trial court dismissal of counts,and against the archipelago defendants.lozman putnam,d.however,the appellate court held that the trial court dismissal of counts and which both alleged usurpation of corporate opportunities was not a final and appealable order.lozman,d at.
the appellate court found that the circuit court dismissal of counts and involving archipelago did not dispose of the parties rights on a definite part of the litigation,namely,archipelago putative liability,because the trial court did not dismiss count,which sought rescission of lozman october release.lozman,d at.the appellate court found that plaintiffs had pled sufficient facts in the complaint to show,allegedly,the line of business from blue water to archipelago,with putnam as the fiduciary link.lozman,d at.because of this link,archipelago had potential,putative liability.lozman,d at.as a result,the appellate court dismissed the appeal with respect to counts and.lozman,d at.
on december,plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint.defendants pled affirmative defenses including release,laches and ratification and filed a counterclaim for declaratory relief.
on december,plaintiffs filed a separate action l against defendants gdp and virago.on january,plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint in this second action which alleged three counts usurpation of corporate opportunity unjust enrichment and fraudulent conveyance of assets.the trial court dismissed count,and on november,granted summary judgment for defendant virago on counts and.
on march,plaintiffs moved the trial court for leave to file a revised,second amended complaint against the archipelago defendants and to vacate the march,dismissal of counts and against the archipelago defendants.on april,the trial court denied plaintiffs motion.thus,the archipelago defendants were out of the case,prior to trial.
on july,the trial court granted summary judgment motions by the townsend defendants for count joint venture,and count breach of oral contract to pay revenue and commission and by defendants putnam,terra nova and the townsend defendants for counts,and injunctive relief.

starting on november,a dual bench and jury trial was held,concluding on december.on november,the trial court ruled that any jury findings concerning the equitable claims were merely advisory.the equitable claims included counts and,for usurpation of corporate opportunities.
both the archipelago defendants and virago were not part of the trial as a result of prior dismissal and summary judgment orders,the counts at issue at trial were counts and,usurpation of corporate opportunity,against defendants putnam and terra nova count,equitable remedies of rescission,cancellation and reformation of the october release count,damages for breach of the april,agreement count,damages for breach of an alleged oral contract by defendants putnam and terra nova to pay bwp revenues and brokerage commissions due under a brokerage trading agreement and count,damages,against defendants putnam and terra nova,resulting from putnam alleged promise to lozman to deliver a ownership interest in terra nova.in addition,there were also counts against defendant gdp from the second action l for usurpation of corporate opportunity and unjust enrichment.
the jury found for plaintiff bwp on its claim of usurpation of corporate opportunities,against putnam and terra nova counts and.the jury found for defendants putnam and terra nova on count,plaintiffs claim for breach of the written april,contract and on count,plaintiffs claim for breach of an alleged oral contract.the jury also found for defendant gdp on count usurpation of corporate opportunities of the second action.
in addition,the jury answered special interrogatories.in the interrogatories,the jury found that a business was reasonably incident to the present or prospective business of bwp putnam breached his fiduciary duty to bwp by usurping business from bwp and pursuing that business with terra nova putnam failed to disclose to bwp the corporate opportunities of a business,a soes room,an ecn and an electronic exchange and putnam did not promise lozman a interest in terra nova.
with respect to the october,release,the jury found that it was not signed on the condition that putnam would furnish lozman the scanshift source code it was just and equitable to lozman and bwp it was not obtained by putnam without disclosure of material facts it was supported by consideration,the scope of the release was not limited to releasing the april,agreement and plaintiffs ratified the release.
the jury also found,without regard to the validity of the release,that defendants did not breach the written april,contract there was no oral contract to give lozman ownership of terra nova and the value of terra nova was.
on july,the trial court entered judgment for defendants putnam,terra nova and gdp on counts,and on all claims against gdp and on the counterclaim for declaratory judgment.the trial court concluded that the october release was valid that plaintiffs ratified the release and that the doctrine of laches barred plaintiffs claims of corporate usurpation counts and from the first action and count from the second action.
on august,the trial court entered an order modifying its july opinion to add judgment for defendants on count rescission,cancellation and reformation of the october release.on march,the trial court denied plaintiff posttrial motion.
on march,plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal appealing a list of over orders.in their appellate brief,plaintiff asked this court to reverse only six orders

in their appellate brief to this court,plaintiffs make four claims the trial court erred on july,when it held after the trial that the october release and the equitable doctrine of laches precluded plaintiffs recovery on counts and the trial court erred on march,when it dismissed the archipelago defendants under section the trial court erred on july,when it held that defendant gdp was covered by the october release and the trial court erred on november,when it granted the townsend defendants motion for summary judgment on amended count.
standards of review 
plaintiffs appeal the trial court judgment after a dual bench and jury trial,as well as orders by the trial court granting motions to dismiss pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure ilcs west and motions for summary judgment uxs west,
for factual findings made by a trial court during a bench trial,we apply a manifest weight of the evidence standard.eychaner gross.we apply the same standard for a jury verdict.hanumadass coffield,ungaretti harris,d.a finding is against the manifest weight of the evidence only when an opposite conclusion is apparent or when the findings appear to be unreasonable,arbitrary,or not based on the evidence.eychaner,at.
this court will also apply a de novo standard of review to grants of motions to dismiss under section ilcs west and motions for summary judgment ilcs west.iseberg gross,d,dismissal under section ragan columbia mutual insurance,summary judgment.
with respect to summary judgment,our supreme court has held that it is proper where,when viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,the pleadings,depositions and admissions on file reveal that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.ragan,at.
by contrast,a motion to dismiss under section is a challenge to the legal sufficiency of the complaint.iseberg,d at.in reviewing the legal sufficiency of the complaint,we regard all facts as true and draw all reasonable inference in favor of the plaintiff.iseberg,d at.we construe the complaint liberally and dismiss only when it appears that plaintiffs could not recover under any set of facts.iseberg,d at.
plaintiffs claim that the october release did not preclude their recovery on counts and for usurpation of corporate opportunities,because the release was invalid due to defendants breach of fiduciary duty and failure to disclose material facts plaintiffs were entitled to the remedy of rescission plaintiffs were also entitled to the remedy of cancellation plaintiffs did not ratify the release,as the trial court found,even if the release was valid,its scope did not include plaintiffs claims of breach of fiduciary duty and corporate usurpation and putnam failure to disclose material facts precluded the trial court finding of laches.
for the reasons discussed below,this court rejects plaintiffs laches arguments.since we affirm the trial court laches finding,we do not need to consider plaintiffs first five arguments.plaintiffs first five arguments all relate to the release its validity,rescission,cancellation,ratification and scope.however,the trial court decision rested on two independent grounds the release and the equitable doctrine of laches.since we accept the latter,we do not need to consider the former 
plaintiffs claim that the trial court erred on july,when it found that laches barred plaintiffs recovery on counts and usurpation of corporate opportunities.lozman,l and ch,slip op.at.usurpation of a corporate opportunity is a claim based in equity and thus subject to the equitable defense of laches.tarin pellonari,d,laches applied to claim of misappropriation of corporate opportunities.
plaintiffs claim error,because since putnam,as a fiduciary,had a duty to disclose certain facts and failed to do so,the running of time for laches began on the date that plaintiffs actually discovered his fraud laches may not be used as an affirmative defense in those limited circumstances where a fiduciary knowingly violated a restriction and pressed ahead laches can not be found where the statute of limitations has not run and in the alternative,plaintiffs claim that they were diligent,and any finding to the contrary was against the manifest weight of the evidence.for the reasons stated below,we do not find plaintiffs arguments persuasive.
in order to prevail on the affirmative defense of laches,defendants must prove that there was a lack of due diligence by plaintiffs in bringing suit and plaintiffs delay resulted in prejudice to defendants.people mcclure,jameson realty group kostiner,d,people hawkins.
for the first requirement,plaintiffs must have failed to seek prompt redress after having knowledge of the facts upon which their claim is based.eckberg benso,d.plaintiff need not have actual knowledge of the specific facts upon which his claim is based if he fails to ascertain the truth through readily available channels and the circumstances are such that a reasonable person would make inquiry concerning these facts.eckberg,d at.
the determination of whether laches applies to a particular set of facts is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge.hannigan,d at.tarin,d at,pettey first national bank,d,eckberg,d at.an appellate court will not disturb a trial court determination of laches unless that determination is so clearly wrong as to constitute an abuse of discretion.hannigan,d at,tarin,d at.an abuse of discretion occurs when the trial court judgment was palpably erroneous,contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence,or manifestly unjust.meyer,d.the burden of pleading and proving the defense is on the movant.hannigan,d at.
the trial court found both laches requirements satisfied because plaintiffs did not exhibit due diligence in pursuing their claims,when they knew at the time of the release signing that putnam intended to continue operating terra nova as a business reasonably incident to bwp business and defendants would be prejudiced,since they relied on the release in pursuing their own businesses.lozman,l and ch,slip op.at.
on appeal,plaintiffs claim that different laches rules apply in the fiduciary context.first,plaintiffs claim that where a defendant fiduciary had a duty to disclose facts and failed to do so,then the running of time for laches began on the date that plaintiffs actually discovered defendant fraud.prueter bork,d.prueter,cited and quoted by plaintiff,states 
although the period of time on which laches is predicated normally begins to run either when the plaintiff learns of the facts on which his rights are based or when a reasonable person would acquire such knowledge,a different rule applies where a fiduciary relationship is involved.where a fiduciary has a duty to disclose certain facts to the plaintiff but fraudulently fails to do so,plaintiffs failure to ascertain these facts is excused.in such cases,the running of time begins when the fraud is actually discovered by plaintiff.citations omitted prueter,d at.
however,plaintiffs brief failed to specify the facts that defendant failed to disclose,with the dates when plaintiff actually discovered those facts.h argument section of appellant brief shall contain citation to the pages of the record relied on.since plaintiffs have failed to even alone dates of their discovery,facts uniquely within their possession,plaintiffs have failed to explain how the trial court abused its discretion in computing the time when laches should have begun to run.
second,plaintiffs claim that laches may not be used an as an affirmative defense in those limited circumstances where a fiduciary knowingly violated a restriction and pressed ahead.for support,plaintiff cited a case fick burnham.fick is not on point.the opinion never even discusses fiduciary duty.after citing fick,plaintiffs also cited pettey,d without a page cite which also does not discuss fiduciary duty.even if fick and pettey were somehow relevant,this section of plaintiffs brief does not discuss facts or contain any citations to the record,as required by supreme court rule h.h argument section of appellant brief shall contain citation to the pages of the record relied on.plaintiffs failure to provide evidentiary support waived any possible way this court could entertain their argument.
third,plaintiffs claim that laches can not be found before the statute of limitations ran,and cited for support pinelli alpine development,d.pinelli states laches will not be found if the delay is short of the statutory period of limitations and there has been no change of circumstances.emphasis added.pinelli,d at.plaintiffs do not even try to argue that there had been no change of circumstances,between the formal dissolution of the business relationship on october,and plaintiffs filing of their first complaint on august,almost four years later.as pinelli states,a party seeking to rescind a contract on grounds of fraud or misrepresentation must elect to do so promptly after learning of the fraud or misrepresentation.emphasis added.pinelli,d at.pinelli does not help plaintiffs.
last and least,plaintiffs argue in the alternative that they were diligent,and any finding to the contrary was against the manifest weight of the evidence.plaintiffs make this claim in one line without any factual support or legal argument.this court has repeatedly held that a party waives a point by failing to argue it.rosier cascade mountain,d,by failing to offer supporting legal authority or any reasoned argument,plaintiffs waived consideration of their theory for asserting personal jurisdiction over defendants people ward,point raised in a brief but not supported by citation to relevant authority is therefore forfeited in re marriage of bates,a reviewing court is entitled to have issues clearly defined with relevant authority cited ferguson bill berger,associates,d,it is not necessary to decide this question since the defendant has waived the issue by failing to offer case citation or other support as supreme court rule requires h argument in appellate brief must be supported by citation to legal authority and factual record.
for the foregoing reasons,we do not find plaintiffs laches arguments persuasive.
ii.dismissal of archipelago defendants 
plaintiffs already appealed,and this court already affirmed,the section dismissal of most of the counts against the archipelago defendants.lozman,d at.this court dismissed the prior appeal only with respect to counts and.lozman,d at.thus,only the trial court section dismissal of counts and is before this court at this time.in re christopher,the doctrine prohibits the reconsideration of issues that have been decided by a reviewing court in a prior appeal norton city of chicago,d,a question of law decided on appeal is binding on the trial court on remand and the appellate court if the case is appealed again.
count sought injunctive relief for usurpation of corporate opportunity.lozman,d at.count sought an accounting,constructive trust and monetary relief for usurpation of corporate opportunity.lozman,d at,archipelago putative liability was through putnam who was the fiduciary link in the line of business from blue water to archipelago.lozman,d at.
as we held above,the affirmative defense of laches barred recovery on plaintiffs claims for usurpation of corporate opportunity.great west casualty cote,d,an appellate court can affirm the trial court dismissal on any ground warranted by the record,even if it was not the reason given for the dismissal,citing beckman freeman united coal mining.thus,plaintiffs can not succeed on their remaining counts and against the archipelago defendants.
iii.defendant gdp 
in its brief to this court,plaintiffs claim that the trial court should have entered judgment against defendant gdp.the counts against gdp that went to trial were count usurpation of corporate opportunities and count unjust enrichment.in its july,opinion,the trial court found that gdp should be held liable for any corporate opportunities that putnam and terra nova were held liable for usurping and gdp would be unjustly enriched if it were allowed to keep any monetary distributions resulting from its imputed liability.lozman,and ch,slip op.at.however,the trial court also found that both the october release and the doctrine of laches barred any finding of damages for plaintiffs.lozman,l and ch,slip op.at and.
in their appellate brief,plaintiffs abandoned their claims against gdp by failing to provide any facts or legal reasoning.plaintiffs brief mentioned gdp twice in the jurisdictional statement,which stated that the jury returned an advisory verdict in favor of gdp and in the section of its argument relating to gdp.gdp is not mentioned once in the statement of facts.plaintiffs do not identify defendant gdp they do not explain what role gdp played in the events and they do not specify the corporate opportunities that were allegedly transferred to gdp.
the argument section concerning gdp contains no facts and lists what are,in essence,argument headings 
gdp was not covered by the release.plaintiffs are entitled to judgment against gdp record cite omitted.the usurped corporate opportunities were in part transferred to gdp.the tracing authorities cited above in a prior section also support liability against gdp two case citations,omitted.
the trial court agreed with most of the assertions in the above paragraph.the trial court did find that the opportunities were transferred,in part,to gdp,and that liability could be traced in part to gdp.the place where the trial court and plaintiffs differ is that the trial court found that both the october release and the doctrine of laches barred recovery.in the above paragraph,plaintiffs claim that gdp was not covered by the release but without offering any supporting facts or legal analysis.
the brief filed on behalf of defendant gdp noted that plaintiffs brief waived any arguments concerning defendant gdp by failing to supply facts and legal reasoning.instead of replying,plaintiffs reply brief dropped their gdp claims entirely.
as already noted above,a party waives a point by failing to argue it.rosier cascade mountain,d,by failing to offer supporting legal authority or,any reasoned argument,plaintiffs waived consideration of their theory for asserting personal jurisdiction over defendants people ward,point raised in a brief but not supported by citation to relevant authority is therefore forfeited in re marriage of bates,a reviewing court is entitled to have issues clearly defined with relevant authority cited.ferguson bill berger associates,d,it is not necessary to decide this question since the defendant has waived the issue by failing to offer case citation or other support as supreme court rule requires h argument in appellate brief must be supported by citation to legal authority and factual record.
