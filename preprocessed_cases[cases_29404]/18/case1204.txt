ceridian corporation refused to meet with a union bargaining committee during nonworking hours,and at the same time refused to grant the employee members of the committee unpaid leave to attend bargaining sessions during working hours.the national labor relations board concluded that,in so doing,ceridian impermissibly interfered with its employees choice of bargaining representatives.because the board conclusion was reasonable and supported by substantial evidence,we deny ceridian petition for review and grant the board for enforcement.
ceridian is an information services company that provides a variety of employment services to other companies throughout the united states.one of its divisions offers assistance and counseling to employees of customer companies that contract with ceridian.that division operates a service center in eagan,minnesota,where its consultants provide advice to employees of customers on subjects ranging from substance abuse to emotional.the center operates hours per day,days per week,days per year.consultants are divided into teams depending on their areas of expertise,and work the day,evening,or overnight shift.
ceridian maintains a paid leave policy for its own employees called personal days off pdo.under the policy,employees can accrue up to four weeks of paid time off per year.employees may use their pdo for whatever purpose they wish,including vacation,illness,or personal business,as long as they obtain management approval.ceridian also provides ten paid holidays per year,four of which are floating holidays that can be designated by the employee subject to management approval.unpaid leave,other than for absences,is not available to employees unless required by the family and medical leave act,et.thus,pdo and the four floating holidays are employees only options for discretionary leave.employees who take time off in excess of their accrued pdo and floating holidays are subject to discipline,including discharge.
on june,the national labor relations board nlrb certified service employees international union as the exclusive collective bargaining representative for approximately employees at the minnesota center.the employees included day,evening,and overnight shift consultants,as well as other employees classified as clinical coaches,referral specialists,and network development specialists.the first to represent employees at the together a committee of six employees drawn from different work groups and shifts.the six employees volunteered to serve as the negotiating team in pursuit of a collective bargaining agreement with ceridian.
the first bargaining session between the union committee and ceridian management took place on september.all six employee representatives attended,along with a union business representative and union negotiator.one of the first topics of discussion was accounting for time spent by employees in bargaining sessions.the union requested that employees be permitted to take leave without pay,and indicated that it would compensate the employees for their lost wages.ceridian refused this request and insisted instead that,in order to attend bargaining sessions,employees would have to take time from their accrued pdo in segments.although ceridian continued to insist that employee representatives use their pdo to attend bargaining sessions,after further discussion it agreed to allow them to take pdo in segments for sessions that were limited in advance to half days,and to permit those who exhausted their accrued pdo to borrow against the following year allotment for the purpose of attending bargaining sessions.ceridian also tentatively agreed to schedule the next bargaining session in the evening,in order to lessen the pdo burden on the employee representatives,the majority of whom worked the day shift.
following this first meeting,ceridian replaced its lead attorney with another.in a subsequent telephone call to the union business representative,new lead counsel cancelled the evening bargaining meeting.he then followed up with a letter,insisting that all such meetings be conducted during normal business hours.joint appendix.
after ceridian announced that it would require employees to use pdo for negotiating sessions and would refuse to negotiate during nonworking hours,three of the union six employee representatives stopped regularly attending bargaining sessions.the other three continued to attend.employee jerry buchko used more than one hundred hours of his pdo and two of his floating holidays to attend seventeen of eighteen sessions.employees robert lodin and kevin kirley were able to attend most of the sessions without using pdo because they worked the evening and night shifts.after the eighteen sessions,all held during regular business hours on weekdays,the parties still had not reached a contract.
on december,the union filed an unfair labor practices charge with the nlrb.a hearing was held before an administrative law judge alj,and the board entered its decision and order,adopting the alj recommendations,on november.the board found that ceridian had violated sections a and of the national labor relations act,a and,by denying its employees unpaid time off to attend bargaining sessions during the workday,while simultaneously refusing to bargain during nonworking hours.the board therefore ordered ceridian to grant the employee representatives unpaid leave to attend negotiating sessions held during working hours,or,in the alternative,to schedule bargaining at mutually times when the employees were not scheduled to work.see ceridian seiu local,nlrb,wl,at.
ceridian now petitions for review,and the board for enforcement of its order.
under the national labor relations act nlra,employees have a fundamental right to select representatives of their own choosing for collective bargaining or other mutual protection without restraint or coercion by their employer.nlrb jones laughlin steel.an employer may not take action that effectively chills its employees right to select their own bargaining representatives by preventing or discouraging those representatives from fully participating in negotiations.procter gamble nlrb,cir.ceridian challenges,on three grounds,the nlrb conclusion that it interfered with its employees choice of bargaining representatives.
we first consider ceridian contention that the board decision is an unreasoned and inexplicable departure from its own precedent.petr.br.as we have repeatedly held in considering this kind of challenge,an agency interpretation of its own precedent is entitled to deference.cassell fcc,see boca airport,faa,telecom ass fcc,global crossing,fcc.
according to ceridian,the board precedents in this area stand for the proposition that an employer is entitled to insist on conducting collective bargaining during business hours,as long as it gives employee representatives time off to attend negotiations.the board contradicted its precedents,ceridian argues,by holding that ceridian was obligated to offer its employees not just time off,but unpaid time off,in order to attend bargaining sessions held during working hours.as ceridian points out,it did permit its employees to take time off,although it required that the time come from the employees paid leave accounts accrued under the company pdo policy.
while they disagree as to their meaning,both ceridian and the board agree which of the board precedents are relevant indiana michigan,nlrb,enforced,cir and milwhite,nlrb.at first glance,we find it difficult to see any inconsistency between indiana and milwhite on the one hand,and this case on the other.the same is true at second glance.
in indiana,the board held 
we find that the respondent refusal to grant members of the union negotiations committee uncompensated leave to permit them to engage in bargaining during working hours,while at the same time refusing the union request to bargain during nonworking hours,is an unlawful interference with the union selection of its bargaining representatives.
nlrb at emphasis added.in milwhite,the board repeated and reaffirmed the above quotation from indiana.see milwhite,nlrb at.in the instant case,the board announced precise
