in this complex suit between two corporations struggling for control over a national billiards league,kenda corporation,pot pool league kenda,had much more success before the jury and judge than pot money leagues,and the individual defendants jeffrey germain and david kratze.indeed,kenda secured a damage award of against the individual defendants for fraudulent inducement,and another award against them for for tortious interference with contractual or advantageous business relationships.pot money leagues received nothing from the jury on its counterclaims.moreover,kenda persuaded the judge to rescind a number of its agreements with the defendants.nevertheless,in this appeal and,all parties claim a variety of errors by the district court.with only one slight exception,we find no merit in any of these claims.the jury verdicts will stand.so too will the rulings by the court.
background 
kenda corporation is a massachusetts corporation that operates an amateur billiards league under the name pot pool league.kenneth perry and david rischitelli formed kenda in july.by the fall of,the relationship between perry and rischitelli had become tense,but kenda continued to operate its pool league.during that time period,perry became acquainted with jeffrey germain,a businessman from louisville,kentucky,and they discussed the operation of the pot pool league and its potential for expansion.in november,perry traveled to detroit,michigan,to meet with germain and his partner david kratze to discuss the creation of a national billiards league.perry brought with him to this meeting paul frankel,who was,at the time,a regional director with kenda league.at the end of this meeting,the participants resolved to meet again in december.
on or about december,perry and frankel,along with four other individuals who were kenda employees or league directors,returned to detroit to meet with germain and kratze.on that day,the six attendees affiliated with kenda,along with germain,kratze,and two of their associates,signed a series of documents which made them shareholders of pot money leagues pot,a kentucky corporation that germain had established before the meeting.each of the ten shareholders paid to purchase ten shares of stock in the new corporation.perry testified at trial that when he went into negotiations with kratze and germain,he thought they intended to invest in the league that kenda had been operating since.however,as became clear at this meeting,kratze and germain actually wanted to join with perry and his associates to form a new corporation which would be operating a league competing with kenda.
over the next few months,perry,with the assistance of the kenda employees and directors who had become shareholders in pot,transferred kenda assets and control over regional leagues and tournaments to pot.these transfers occurred in a variety of ways.perry directly transferred from the kenda corporate account to pot and germain.he also directed kenda employees to change the return addresses on the envelopes league members used to pay their dues.instead of dues being mailed to kenda post office box,they now went to one controlled by pot.kenda employees also copied removed kenda bookkeeping records and statistics from kenda massachusetts office to give to germain and pot.on january,when rischitelli arrived at the kenda office,he discovered that the company two employees had left,the corporate records were no longer in the office,and the league dues had not been sent to kenda post office box.he also discovered that was missing from the kenda bank account.
later in january,germain contacted rischitelli in massachusetts and asked him to meet with him and kratze in detroit.rischitelli agreed,and the meeting occurred on january.at the start of this meeting,kratze and germain presented rischitelli with a document entitled agreement not to compete and protection of confidential information,which they told him he would have to sign before any business discussions ensued.rischitelli executed the agreement that day in his individual capacity.kratze signed as ceo of pot.the three parties then discussed pot business plans and rischitelli potential role in the new corporation and league.after this meeting,rischitelli agreed that he would become a consultant to pot.on february,he returned to detroit and executed three contracts formalizing his and kenda relationship with pot.
the first contract,simply entitled agreement,states,inter alia,that kenda,through rischitelli,would provide consulting services to pot,relinquish all rights and control over the league,convey office equipment and handbooks to pot,and provide funds to operate the national tournament.in return,kenda would be paid on a sliding scale tied to pot gross revenues.rischitelli also signed a general release of all claims and waiver of rights which purported to release pot and its officers,directors and shareholders from all possible claims rischitelli or kenda might bring.finally,rischitelli signed a separate agreement assigning the name pot pool league to pot.
the new enterprise encountered immediate problems.by march,perry had become so frustrated with the manner in which germain was operating the pool league that he contacted the league regional directors,asking them to stop sending their weekly dues to pot and instead to send them to kenda post office box in massachusetts.he told them that rischitelli would take care of all the problems plaguing the league once he was in charge of operating it again.by the end of march,nearly all the teams that had formerly been associated with pot had reaffiliated themselves with kenda,and rischitelli started paying off pot outstanding liabilities,including awards owed to teams that had won recent tournaments.
shortly thereafter,kenda sued pot,kratze and germain the defendants in worcester superior court,alleging,inter alia,fraud,tortious interference with contractual advantageous relationships,violations of.laws ch.and violations of et civil rico.kenda also asked for a piercing of the corporate veil to allow personal recovery against kratze and germain if the jury found pot liable,and sought a declaratory judgment regarding the validity of the contracts it entered into with pot.in their answer,the defendants raised a number of counterclaims and claims,including breach of contract,fraud,trademark and servicemark infringement,and violations of chapter against kenda,and breach of contract,fraud and tortious interference against rischitelli individually.
prior to the commencement of trial,the district court informed the parties that it would issue a written decision on the declaratory judgment demands and the opposing chapter claims after the jury delivered its verdict.the remainder of the claims went to trial.the parties filed opposing motions for judgment as a matter of law at the close of evidence,and the district court dismissed kenda civil rico claims and pot claims against rischitelli for fraud.after one day of deliberation,the jury returned the following verdict 
pot was not liable for fraudulent inducement 
kratze and germain were liable to kenda for fraudulent inducement in the amount of 
kratze and germain were liable to kenda for for tortious interference 
rischitelli was neither liable for tortious interference nor breach of contract.
while kenda may not have run the table in its claims presented to the jury,it certainly came close.shortly thereafter,the court issued its decision on the opposing chapter claims and the declaratory judgment,holding that all of the contracts rischitelli signed on behalf of himself and kenda on january and february were void and that neither party could prevail on its chapter claim.all parties now appeal.
ii.the appeals of the defendants 
in their brief on appeal,the defendants raise a panoply of objections to the outcome of this litigation.arguing that the court erred in refusing to direct verdicts on certain claims,admitting certain evidence during the trial,and voiding the contracts at issue,the defendants ask us to undo the jury verdict against them and overturn the court declaratory judgment regarding the validity of the contracts.we decline the invitation.
effects of the jury verdict in favor of pot 
in its most complex argument on appeal,pot claims that the jury verdict that it,the corporation,was not liable for fraudulent inducement requires judgment in its favor and a reversal of the jury verdicts against the individual defendants,kratze and germain.before we address this argument on the merits,we must provide some additional factual background.
when rischitelli met with kratze and germain in detroit in february,he signed a series of contracts formalizing his relationship and kenda as consultants to pot,and transferring a number of kenda assets to the new corporation.among those contracts was one entitled general release of all claims and waiver of rights.the third clause in that contract states 
the undersigned,kenda corporation,does hereby remise,release and forever discharge,pot o gold money leagues,inc and its officers,directors and shareholders,of and from all and all manner of actions,causes of actions,suits,claims and demands whatsoever,known or unknown,liquidated or unliquidated,in law or equity against pot o gold money leagues,and its officers,directors and shareholders 
the first clause states that rischitelli similarly releases all claims he may have against pot,its officers,directors,and shareholders.rischitelli signed this contract both in his own capacity and as president of kenda.rischitelli signed another contract on behalf of kenda entitled agreement,outlining rischitelli and kenda responsibilities as consultants to pot.this agreement contains a clause which states,in pertinent part 
kenda corporation,now and forever,relinquishes all of its rights contractual relationships and contracts to and with all of its league members or past league members for the reason it no longer wishes to independently create,develop,control,manage and supervise pool leagues kenda corporation waives all rights and claims to any names,indicia,slogans,copyrights,including pot pool leagues,and all similar names.
kenda also agreed in this contract to transfer its equipment and records to pot.finally,kenda signed a contract assigning the servicemark pot to pot.
less than three months after signing these contracts,kenda filed this lawsuit against pot,kratze,and germain,alleging that pot,kratze,and germain had fraudulently induced kenda into signing the aforementioned contracts and had tortiously interfered with kenda business relationships.kenda also sought a declaratory judgment as to the validity of the contracts signed on february.the fraud and tortious interference claims went to the jury,which found for pot but against its officers,kratze and germain.the complex jury verdict form had eight questions,most with subparts,for the jury to answer.we excerpt the relevant portions 
question a did kenda prove that its agent,david rischitelli rischitelli was fraudulently induced by any of the defendants listed below to enter into the agreements dated on or about february,
pot o gold money leagues.
david kratze kratze 
jeffrey germain germain 
if you answer question a no as to pot money leagues,proceed to question b.
question b did kenda prove that either of the individual defendants listed below tortiously interfered with a contractual or advantageous business relationship belonging to kenda 
beneath both question and,the jury was asked to determine the amount of damages due kenda if it found that any of the defendants had committed fraud or tortious interference.the instructions on the verdict form also told the jury that if they answered yes with respect to any of the defendants listed in question a,they were to skip questions.questions addressed pot counterclaims against kenda for breach of contract,conversion,and service mark infringement the jury concluded that pot did not fraudulently induce the contracts,but that kratze and germain did.it also concluded that kratze and germain committed tortious interference.after the jury delivered its verdict,the court issued a written opinion declaring that the agreement,general release,and assignment were void for fraud and lack of consideration.
the defendants now argue in their brief on appeal that the jury verdict in favor of pot requires judgment in its favor.they elaborate as follows 
there can be no doubt that the feb sic agreements are valid.the jury determined that there was no fraud by pot.the individual defendants,kratze and germain,were not signatories to the agreements o ver counsel objections,the verdict form directed the jury to consider the claims against the individuals even if it found the feb agreements valid.but for plaintiff argument that the individual defendants were acting outside the scope of their authority,the individuals would have been exonerated,as the feb agreements,including the release,were determined by the jury to be valid,no fraud by the only party to the agreements,pot.
as relief,the defendants ask that w ith respect to all agreements,this court should declare them valid,enforceable and enter an order requiring kenda and rischitelli to honor their terms.they also state that the individual verdicts against kratze and germain must be reversed to avoid a substantial miscarriage of justice.
as the defendants see it,the jury verdict in favor of pot on the fraudulent inducement claim conclusively establishes the validity of the contracts signed on february,including the general release,which,by its terms,barred the kind of claims kenda brought against pot,kratze,and germain.consequently,the jury verdict form was flawed in that it permitted the jury to consider claims of fraudulent inducement and tortious interference against kratze and germain even after finding that pot had not committed fraud moreover,the favorable finding for pot precluded the court from finding in its written opinion that the contracts were void.
the defendants contend that if kenda is able to collect damages for the tortious conduct of the individual defendants as well as rescind its contracts with pot,kenda will have it both ways.the jury verdict against the individual defendants but not against the corporation likely was based on the theory that the individual defendants were acting outside the scope of their agency as directors of pot when they fraudulently induced kenda to sign the february,contracts the defendants now claim that if the jury concluded that kratze and germain were acting outside the scope of their agency as directors of pot,then the corporation can not be held liable for these actions.
this is a strange argument because pot is not being held liable in this case.the jury did not award any tort damages against the corporation.pot only loss is the loss of the benefit of its contracts with that the jury specifically found kenda was fraudulently induced into signing.far from an unfair or inconsistent resolution,the rescission of the february,contracts is entirely permissible under basic principles of contract law.
fraud in the inducement can serve as both a basis for tort liability,see page keaton,et,prosser and keaton on torts ed,and as grounds for rescinding a contract,see yorke taylor,denton utley,restatement second of contracts see also harris delco,the test to be applied in the case at bar to determine whether the defendant is to be relieved of its contract by reason of any alleged fraudulent misrepresentations is the same as that applied in actions of tort for deceit.principles of contract law permit rescission of a contract even when the misrepresentations at issue were made by a to the contract.see,restatement second of contracts if a party manifestation of assent is induced by either a fraudulent or material misrepresentation by one who is not a party to the transaction upon which the recipient is justified in relying,the contract is voidable by the recipient.rescission is an equitable remedy,and can be imposed on a contract even in the absence of culpable behavior.see robert haig,business and commercial litigation in federal courts recognizing that rescission can be granted in cases of mistake and innocent representation.therefore,the mere fact that pot did not engage in conduct warranting a remedy in tort does not prevent the court from relieving kenda of a contract it was fraudulently induced into signing by directors of pot.
while pot contends that the rescission of its contracts with kenda must be in error because it would permit kenda to have it both recovering tort damages from the individual defendants for their ultra vires activities and being able to rescind the contracts with pot defendants are actually the ones trying to have it both ways.after convincing the jury that the corporation should not be held liable for the tortious conduct of its directors thereby relieving itself of vicarious tort liability,pot now seeks to retain the benefits of kratze and germain tortious,the signed contracts with kenda.such a result does not accord with the equitable principles of rescission.see,boston five cents sav.bank brooks,discussing fraudulent inducement as a defense to enforcement of a promissory note the bank can not adopt the acts of an agent acting beyond his authority in accepting the note from the maker and at the same time disavow the means by which he secured the execution and delivery of the note in its behalf.bates southgate,opining that a principal should not be able to enforce for his own benefit a contract procured through the actual fraudulent misrepresentation of his agent white tower mgmt,taglino,the seller ought not to be permitted to take the benefit of false and fraudulent misrepresentations made by its agent.after the rescission of the contracts,pot is now in the same position it would have been in but for the intentional misrepresentations of the individual are no contracts between pot and kenda.the district court ruling on the declaratory judgment permitting the rescission of the february agreements was correct.
as a necessary corollary,then,since the jury verdict in favor of pot did not conclusively establish the validity of the february,the general was permissible for the jury to consider kenda claims against the individual defendants.therefore,the district court did not err in its construction of the jury form.
kratze liability for fraudulent 
the defendants also challenge the jury verdict against kratze on the fraudulent inducement claim on the ground that it was not supported by the evidence produced at trial.in evaluating claims that the evidence does not support the jury verdict,our standard of review is de novo.walton nalco chem,cir.we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the prevailing party,and we will affirm unless the evidence was so strongly and overwhelmingly inconsistent with the verdicts that no reasonable jury could have returned them.id.quoting negron caleb brett,cir.in order to overturn the verdict,we must find that no reasonable jury could have found that all five elements of common law fraud were met with respect to the alleged misrepresentations these elements are that the statement was knowingly false that the defendants made the false statement with the intent to deceive that the statement was material to the plaintiffs decision to sign the contract that the plaintiffs reasonably relied on the statement and that the plaintiffs were injured as a result of their reliance.turner johnson johnson,cir.the defendants contend that no reasonable jury could have found that rischitelli reasonably relied on the statements kratze and germain made when he signed the contracts.
at trial,rischitelli testified that kratze and germain brought in a chart that showed projections where they were going to make million in the next year running their pool league.he also testified that kratze talked to him about the league affiliating with oprah angels that he had kids signed,sealed and delivered as league participants.finally,rischitelli testified that kratze told him he was going to invest his own money in the corporation.the defendants argue that these statements can not be the basis for fraud liability.
noting that the statements relied upon by rischitelli were not incorporated into the signed contracts,the defendants point to an integration clause included as paragraph of the agreement,which states each party hereto agrees that this agreement is the entire agreement and understanding between the parties and no verbal statements at any time shall affect in any way the terms and conditions of this agreement.but it is well settled in massachusetts that a n integration clause in a contract does not insulate automatically a party from liability where he induced another person to enter into a contract by misrepresentation.starr fordham.see sound techniques hoffman,whether we refer to the clause in question as a merger clause,an integration clause,or an exculpatory clause,the settled rule of law is that a contracting party can not rely upon such a clause as protection against claims based upon fraud or deceit.see also broomfield kosow,fraud involved in the contract may be proved by extrinsic evidence 
rischitelli testified that he actually relied on the statements cited above when deciding to sign the contracts i inquired about whether or not i could become a stockholder with them.i liked what he had to say about the fact that they were going to give some money and they had oprah angels already signed up they said t he only way to bring me on board was for me to sign a consulting agreement.the jury could have found that rischitelli reliance was reasonable.
s tatements of present intention as to future conduct may be the basis for a fraud action if the statements misrepresent the actual intention of the speaker and were relied upon by the recipient to his damage.mcevoy travel bureau norton.kratze statement that he planned to invest his own money into pot is more than just a vague promise.rischitelli could have believed that it accurately expressed his intent at the time he convinced rischitelli to sign the contract.rischitelli had no reason to believe that kratze did not intend to carry through with this investment.the evidence adduced at trial indicated that kratze never invested any of his own money into pot.
similarly,kratze statement that he had a signed,sealed,and delivered contract with the oprah angel network was a statement of fact,which rischitelli also had no reason to suspect was not true.the defendants contend that rischitelli was a sophisticated businessman who could have detected kratze intentional misrepresentations simply by asking to see the contract with oprah.although rischitelli might have demanded more of his future business associates,his failure to confirm that there was actually a contract with oprah angels does not make his reliance unreasonable.certainly where a defendant has wilfully made false representations with intent to deceive he ought not to be relieved of liability because of his victim lack of diligence.yorke,at.the outer limit of this doctrine requires only that the statement not be preposterous or palpably false.see kuwaiti danish computer digital equip,finding that plaintiffs could not have reasonably relied on an oral statement made during contract negotiations when the statement falsity would have been discovered if plaintiffs had read the entire contract.the mere fact that rischitelli could have discovered kratze misrepresentation by pressing kratze to produce the contract at issue does not render the statement palpably false.see prosser and keeton on torts,supra,it is now held that assertions of fact as to matters inducing commercial transactions may justifiably be relied on without investigation where the falsity of the representation might be discovered with little effort by means easily at hand.see also zimmerman kent,upholding the determination that the plaintiff reasonably relied on the false statement,even though its falsity would have been uncovered merely by obtaining an independent estimate.hence,the jury supportably could have found that rischitelli reliance on kratze representations without further investigation was not unreasonable.
kratze statement that pot could generate million in revenue in presents a more difficult question on the issue of justifiable reliance.because we find rischitelli could have reasonably relied on kratze other statements,and these provide a sufficient basis for the jury verdict,we need not determine whether kratze projection was mere puffery.
rischitelli not liable for breaching the january agreement 
the contract rischitelli signed on january states,inter alia 
for a period of one year after your discussion and any resolution sic discussions hereafter,you agree not to compete with the company,in any manner,with respect to the business conducted by the company,anywhere in the united states of america this agreement not to compete pertains to all business conducted by the company,including by way of example only the company pool dart leagues.
pot claimed that rischitelli breached this contract in march when he regained control of the teams that had played in the league operated by pot since january.the jury disagreed.after the conclusion of the trial,the court considered the parties request for a declaratory judgment on the validity of the january contract,and declared the contract void.
the validity of this contract must be considered separately from the validity of the contracts rischitelli signed on february.while we have concluded that the individual defendants misrepresentations tainted the february,contracts to the extent that they could be rescinded,the statements that pot had a signed contract with oprah angel network and that kratze and germain were going to invest their own money into the corporation were not made until after rischitelli signed the january,contract.these statements,then,can not be the basis for finding that rischitelli was fraudulently induced into signing the january,contract.therefore,we must carefully review the jury verdict and the judge decision to determine whether the january,contract fails for a lack of consideration.
the judge had instructed the jury that i f you find by a preponderance of the evidence that consideration did not exist with respect to a particular contract,the party accused of breaching that contract is excused from performing under the terms of that contract and may not be held liable for breach of that contract.there was no objection to this instruction.question eight on the jury verdict form asked did pot money leagues,prove that rischitelli breached a contract he had with it the jury responded no.after this verdict,the district court determined that the agreement was void for lack of consideration in that the defendants provided nothing of value to rischitelli in exchange for his promise.
defendants argue that the promise to tell rischitelli about their plans was sufficiently valuable consideration to enforce the contract.that argument ignores rischitelli testimony that kratze and germain business plans consisted only of their desire to see the pot league expand its player base and their claims that such growth was imminent given their signed,sealed,and delivered contract with the oprah angels network.noting that this valuable information turned out to be no more than a series of misrepresentations,the trial court explained its decision to rescind the january contract 
the party seeking rescission must demonstrate that the alleged misrepresentation and resulting failure of consideration amounts to an abrogation of the contract,or goes to the essence of it,or takes away its foundation.nike,d at,citing plumer houghton dutton,internal quotations and citations omitted.although as a general principle of contract law,courts will not inquire into the adequacy of consideration in an exchange,equity will grant relief where the consideration is so grossly inadequate as to shock the conscience of the court.see wroblewski wroblewski.
we find no fault with this analysis.
admission of improper evidence 
the plaintiffs elicited testimony from several witnesses who were shareholders working as either league directors or employees of the new corporation,pot.the defendants object to three types of evidence that they claim were irrelevant 
oral testimony that germain and kratze lied to these shareholders,owed them unpaid wages,stole money and threatened them 
a letter perry wrote to kratze outlining the problems pot was having with its finances and 
a document prepared by germain and presented to a pot director showing that pot could earn million in revenues in.
the defendants argue that this evidence,having nothing to do with kenda and rischitelli,the only plaintiffs in this case,was irrelevant to kenda claims and unfairly prejudicial.they insist that the only evidence that the jury should have heard was that concerning the alleged fraudulent inducement of the feb sic agreement.we agree with the trial court that the defendants take much too narrow a view of the case and the concept of relevance.
federal rule of evidence defines relevant evidence as evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.the district court enjoys substantial latitude in admitting testimony pursuant to this rule,and only in exceptional cases will reversible error be found in the district court determination of the probative value of testimony in a particular case.cummings standard register,cir quoting conway electro switch.cir.the evidence in question was relevant to the issues present in the case at the start of the trial.
in addition to its claim of fraudulent inducement,kenda alleged tortious interference with business relations,violations of civil rico,and violations of the massachusetts consumer protection act chapter.the defendants added to the complexity of the case with their counterclaims.all of the evidence challenged by the defendants was relevant to at least one of the claims present in the litigation.for example,germain assertion,accompanied by a chart,that pot could make million in helped to convince league directors to keep their teams aligned with pot,and hence bore directly on kenda tortious interference claim.it was also relevant to kenda rico claim in order to prove the defendants violated rico,kenda had to show the defendants were committing a pattern of racketeering activity.therefore,conversations among pot shareholders and documents produced during those conversations regarding kratze and germain attempts to expand the company could have supported kenda claims that pot was engaging in such a pattern.
testimony describing the general disarray of pot between january and march was similarly relevant to kenda claims.in support of kenda fraudulent inducement claim,rischitelli testified that kratze and germain told him they were going to infuse the league with substantial amounts of their own money.the testimony elicited from pot kratze and germain had not contributed their own funds to the league,that the corporation money was being handled inappropriately,and that the corporation was therefore unable to pay its relevant to whether kratze and germain statements to rischitelli were misrepresentations.
there is no reason to think that the evidence presented in this case was unfairly prejudicial.the witnesses testified only to germain and kratze conduct as businessmen.although that portrayal was unfavorable,it was offered in support of claims that they acted improperly in creating pot and in carrying out its business.flattering evidence would not have made the case.see kelley airborne freight,cir a ll probative evidence is prejudicial.onujiogu united states,cir the fact that a piece of evidence hurts a party chances does not mean it should be automatically excluded.if that were true,there would be precious little left in the way of probative evidence in any case.
after finding kratze and germain liable,the jury awarded kenda on its fraudulent inducement claim and on its tortious interference claim.the defendants now contend that those damages awards are not supported by the evidence submitted in the trial,and alternatively,that the awards are redundant.we disagree.
fraudulent inducement 
rischitelli testified that he wrote germain a check for the purpose of fulfilling his responsibilities under the february,agreement.that agreement states that kenda would be responsible for the tournament fees for the upcoming national tournament.rischitelli gave the check to germain shortly after the february meeting as the jury found that rischitelli was fraudulently induced into signing the february,contract on behalf of kenda,the transfer of this can be directly traced to this contract.
additionally,rischitelli testified that he estimated kenda would have received approximately in revenue if it had operated the league between january,and march.certainly,as kenda did not operate the league during this period,rischitelli could not know for sure how much money players actually paid in dues to pot.nevertheless,his estimate was reconstructed from records indicating the number of teams registered and the number of games played during the period that the teams were sending their dues to pot and germain.the remainder of the jury award for fraudulent inducement could have been to compensate kenda for this lost income.it is reasonable to assume,as the jury must have,that at least of the estimated in revenues kenda lost would have been earned after february,the date of the contract signing.
tortious interference 
kenda also adduced sufficient evidence to justify a discrete award of on the tortious interference claim.rischitelli and perry both testified that perry transferred from the kenda account to germain before rischitelli even knew perry was abandoning their business.perry took two blank checks that rischitelli had signed before leaving for vacation in december,wrote out one for and the other for,and gave them to germain.the remaining of the award could have come from revenues kenda lost before february.teams affiliated with kenda had been paying dues through the mail.kenda employees would send blank score sheets to the teams together with an envelope addressed to kenda post office box.after playing each week,the teams would fill out their score sheets,place them in these envelopes along with their weekly fees,and mail them.after the meeting on december,when perry and the other former kenda employees and league directors became shareholders of pot,germain directed pot employees to change the addresses on these envelopes.the new address was a post office box controlled by pot.rischitelli testified that when he returned from vacation in early january,the kenda post office box had very few envelopes in it.therefore,it is reasonable to assume,as the jury probably did,that kenda lost at least in revenues before february.consequently,we find that the jury verdict was both supportable and.
april,amended judgment 
finally,the defendants cite what appears to be a clerical error in the amended judgment.the district court entered judgment on september.shortly thereafter,the plaintiff moved to amend the judgment under rule e for the purpose of adding prejudgment interest.the defendants did not oppose the motion,and the court issued an amended judgment on april.in the amended judgment,the district court omitted the following sentence that had been present in the initial judgment a nd it is further ordered that judgment be entered in favor of the defendant pot money leagues,on the plaintiff claims against it that were tried before the jury.although the plaintiffs prevailed in their claims against kratze and germain,the jury concluded that pot was not liable for fraudulent inducement.therefore,on that claim,pot was the prevailing party.this sentence should have been retained in the amended judgment.therefore,we will direct the district court to restore the deleted language to its amended judgment.
in its,kenda argues that the district court erred in three ways in denying kenda motion for leave to amend its complaint in directing a verdict in the defendants favor on the civil rico claim and in finding that pot did not violate.laws ch.we will address these arguments in turn.
motion for leave to amend 
on may,one week after the jury had delivered its verdict,kenda moved to amend its complaint to add claims against kratze and germain for violations of.laws ch.under its original complaint,already twice amended,kenda only named the corporation pot as a chapter defendant.kratze and germain opposed the amendment and the district court denied the motion.
rule b permits amendments to conform the pleadings to the evidence w hen issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties.b.the district court denied kenda motion on the grounds that kratze and germain did not consent to their inclusion in the chapter count,and that the addition of such a count would unduly prejudice the individual defendants.we review denials of leave to amend under rule for abuse of discretion,deferring to the district court for any adequate reason apparent from the record.resolution trust gold,cir.
consent to trial on a particular claim can be either express or implied.as there is no indication that kratze and germain expressly consented to trying a chapter claim,we must determine whether they impliedly consented to such a claim.consent to the trial of an issue may be implied if,during the trial,a party acquiesces in the introduction of evidence which is relevant only to that issue.dcpb,city of lebanon,cir.but t he introduction of evidence directly relevant to a pleaded issue can not be the basis for a founded claim that the opposing party should have realized that a new issue was infiltrating the case.see galindo stoody,cir it is not enough that an issue may be inferentially suggested by incidental evidence in the record the record must indicate that the parties understood that the evidence was aimed at an unpleaded issue.as kenda points to no evidence introduced against kratze and germain that goes solely to their individual liability under chapter,we agree with the district court that the individual defendants did not consent to the inclusion of the individual chapter claims.
even in the absence of consent,explicit or implicit,kenda argues that the district court erred in denying the amendment in the absence of a finding that the late amendment would prejudice the defendants.kenda fails to recognize that prejudice,or lack thereof,is only one issue to be weighed in considering whether an amendment is appropriate.a finding that the nonmoving party would not be prejudiced by an untimely amendment does not compel a determination that the amendment is appropriate.united states davis,cir.finally,kenda offered no explanation for its lengthy delay in raising its motion to amend.the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied kenda motion to amend.
civil rico 
after the close of the evidence,the court granted the defendants motions for judgment as a matter of law on kenda civil rico claim.kenda alleged that pot,kratze,and germain participated in racketeering activity by committing acts of mail fraud,wire fraud,and transporting money procured by fraud from kenda over state lines,all for the purpose of establishing pot.we agree with the district court that kenda did not produce sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable jury to find that the defendants violated rico.
in order to succeed in its rico claim,kenda had to prove four elements required by the statute conduct,of an enterprise,through a pattern,of racketeering activity.sedima,imrex,d,quoted in feinstein resolution trust,cir.we focus on the pattern of racketeering activity.
by statute,the pattern element requires a plaintiff to show at least two predicate acts of racketeering activity,which is defined to include violations of specified federal laws,such as the mail and wire fraud statutes.efron embassy suites,cir.kenda alleges that the defendants redirection of the players payment envelopes and the numerous false promises germain and kratze made over the phone to kenda agents were fraudulent use s of the mail or telephone constitut ing separate predicate act s under the statute.case law has made clear,though,that the mere showing of multiple predicate acts is insufficient to prove a pattern the plaintiff also must demonstrate that the predicates are related,and that they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.id.quoting northwestern bell,d.while there is no precise formula to help us determine whether an organization poses a continuing threat of criminal behavior,our recent decision in systems management,loiselle,cir,forecloses kenda argument that the defendants conduct posed such a threat.in systems management,we stated 
rico is not aimed at a single narrow criminal episode,even if that single episode involves behavior that amounts to several crimes for example,several unlawful mailings.a single scheme may be reached by rico,but only if it is reasonably broad and far reaching.
id.at internal citations omitted.
kenda adduced evidence of only a single scheme by the plan to induce rischitelli into signing away control of kenda assets and its pool league.although kratze and germain committed multiple acts justifying civil verdicts against them,all of these efforts were directed toward one transaction,and therefore,did not comprise or threaten the kind of continued criminal activity at which the rico statute was aimed.id.at quoting apparel art int l,jacobson,cir holding that a contractor fraudulent activities,all aimed at obtaining and keeping a single government contract,do not amount to a pattern under rico see efron,at concluding that defendant multiple related acts of deception could not be basis for rico liability as they were all aimed at the narrow goal of transforming the ownership of the partnership during its early stages.if kenda had produced evidence that the defendants had plans to take over another company or pool league in the same fraudulent manner,they might have had a stronger argument opposing the motion for a directed verdict.based on the evidence presented at trial,though,there was insufficient evidence for a jury to find that the defendants posed a continuing threat of criminal activity.see efron,at there is nothing to suggest that the defendants would seek to repeat their fraud in other partnerships or similar business settings,or to employ mail and wire fraud indefinitely in the partnership.
kenda also argues that the district court erred in finding that pot did not violate.laws ch.chapter states that u nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.laws ch,a see arthur little,dooyang,cir.the statute does not specifically define unfair or deceptive,id.at,but massachusetts courts have recognized that a practice is unfair if it is within the penumbra of some,statutory,or other established concept of unfairness is immoral,unethical,oppressive,or unscrupulous and causes substantial injury to other businessmen.linkage trustees of boston,modifications and internal quotations omitted.
the district court based its ruling for pot on a number of grounds.first,it concluded that kenda chapter claim against pot was without support because the jury found that pot was not liable for fraud and there is no other actionable misconduct on which to base such a claim.additionally,it determined that even if the jury finding that kratze and germain were liable for fraud could be imputed to pot,the court was not persuaded that the defendants actions were sufficiently unfair or deceptive to justify chapter relief.finally,the court concluded that the actions of the several defendants did not occur primarily and substantially within the commonwealth of massachusetts,but instead occurred in michigan.for our purposes,we need only conclude that the district court was correct on one of the grounds cited.we focus on the primarily and substantially determination.
kenda points to the same evidence in support of its chapter claim that it relied upon for its tort transfer of funds and teams from kenda to pot and the fraudulent misrepresentations made to rischitelli.assuming arguendo that this conduct by pot rises to the level of unfair or deceptive as defined by the statute,kenda claim still must fail.chapter permits relief only for unfair or deceptive actions that primarily and substantially occur within the commonwealth of massachusetts.laws ch.the massachusetts supreme judicial court recently issued an opinion discussing the test for evaluating the locus of allegedly unfair or deceptive conduct in the context of a chapter claim.see kuwaiti danish computer,at.specifically citing to a test we had suggested in our decisions in roche royal bank of canada,cir,and clinton hospital association corson group,cir the sjc concluded that w hether the actions and transactions constituting the claim occurred primarily and substantially within the commonwealth is not a determination that can be reduced to any precise formula.kuwaiti danish computer,at quoting.laws ch.instead,the sjc outlined a approach to the question 
t he analysis required under should not be based on a test identified by any particular factor or factors because of a tendency to shift the focus of inquiry away from the purpose and scope of chapter.section suggests an approach in which a judge should,after making findings of fact,and after considering those findings in the context of the entire claim,determine whether the center of gravity of the circumstances that give rise to the claim is primarily and substantially within the commonwealth.
id.although both the parties and the district court constructed their analyses within the framework of the test we had discussed in earlier cases,we must follow the sjc pronouncements on interpretations of massachusetts statutes.therefore,we evaluate whether the conduct occurred primarily and substantially within the commonwealth under the center of gravity test announced in kuwaiti danish computer.
we are aided in this endeavor by the district court factual findings,which,although later subjected to an incorrect legal standard,are nonetheless reusable.see societe des produits nestle casa helvetia,cir explaining that trial court subsidiary findings of fact may be subject to reuse on appeal,despite trial court legal error united states mora,cir explaining that the court of appeals can arrange untainted factual findings along the proper legal matrix.giving due weight to these findings,the center of gravity of the transactions that gave rise to the claims in this case was michigan.although germain contacted perry at the kenda office in massachusetts,it was not until perry traveled to michigan that he was convinced by the defendants misrepresentations to transfer money out of the kenda account and abandon his position as owner of kenda.soon thereafter,perry traveled to michigan again to meet with kratze and germain,bringing with him five kenda employees or league directors.at that meeting,the kenda agents in attendance became shareholders of pot,and the league directors agreed to the regional leagues under their control from kenda to pot.those two meetings,inspired by kratze and germain misrepresentations,are the pivotal events underlying kenda chapter claim.
it was also in michigan that rischitelli was convinced to sign away the remainder of his company to pot.certainly,germain and kratze made vague and somewhat enticing statements to rischitelli over the phone while he was in massachusetts.nevertheless,the actual misrepresentations upon which kenda relies in this case were not expressed until rischitelli traveled to michigan on january.rischitelli held meetings with germain and kratze twice,both times in michigan,and at both of those meetings he signed the contracts at the heart of this case.since the misrepresentations and the signing of contracts are some of the primary events kenda points to in support of its chapter claim,we must conclude that the center of gravity of the challenged conduct occurred in michigan.
the plaintiffs correctly cite a number of activities that occurred in massachusetts as a result of deceptive statements made and received in michigan 
perry directed kenda employees to copy and remove records from one massachusetts office to another 
kenda employees called league directors from massachusetts to convince them to reaffiliate their regional leagues with pot 
perry and rischitelli withdrew funds from kenda bank account in massachusetts to give to germain and pot.
nevertheless,these actions were ancillary to,and a direct resul
