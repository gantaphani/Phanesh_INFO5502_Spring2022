facts and procedural history 
a.the franchise agreement 
in,obtained a franchise service station and convenience store from chevron.chevron and had a typical gasoline franchise arrangement.chevron retained ownership of the facility but leased the station to el khoury.chevron licensed its trademarks to and supplied the gasoline sold at the franchise.in return,paid a portion of his sales to chevron as rent.the agreement between chevron and consisted of a dealer lease,dealer supply contract,and other attached riders and exhibits collectively,the dealer agreements.the dealer agreements were renewed regularly.the current dealer agreements were executed in march of.
in,during negotiations with its many franchisees to renew the dealer agreements,chevron sought to include a specific reference to its right to audit tax returns and schedules dealers objected to this provision.in response to those objections,chevron eliminated the reference to tax records.instead,the final dealer agreements provide more generally that chevron has the right to audit all books and records relevant to dealer operation of the premises.the dealer agreements also include a general provision in which the dealer agrees to comply with all applicable federal,state and local laws and regulations relevant to the use and operation of the premises.
b.the attempts to purchase the franchise 
in,chevron began implementing a business plan that sought to eliminate control over certain franchises.chevron targeted franchises that were considered strategic locations based on their facilities,sales volume,and other factors.franchise was such a location.that same year,chevron approached and proposed that the franchise become a location,meaning that part of the franchise would become a mcdonald restaurant.ultimately rejected that proposal.
chevron continued to pursue the location idea.in,chevron discussed the matter with at a general dealer meeting.remained concerned that the franchise would lose business to mcdonald.in late or early,chevron changed its approach and instead offered to purchase the franchise for.considered the franchise to be worth much more and,therefore,declined chevron offer.on december,chevron sent a letter to mcdonald stating that it had attempted unsuccessfully to buyout the station from the dealer at this site,and as a result is ceasing any further negotiations.
however,chevron continued its efforts to purchase franchise even after it had decided not to pursue the facility idea.in late or early,chevron retail marketing manager,mike riley,and another employee,noushad hyder,tried to persuade to accept the offer.chevron approached daughter about the sale as late as june of.
c.the audit and the termination 
in the second quarter of,riley nominated as a candidate for audit.an independent firm conducted the audit on april.the auditors discovered that the franchise had underreported and underpaid california state sales tax by approximately.in may of,chevron issued a notice of termination,informing of its intent to terminate the franchise.chevron stated that had violated the general provision of the dealer agreements regarding a dealer compliance with law to support its termination notice,chevron attached the independent audit report.
at first,denied that he had knowingly underreported sales tax.later,he admitted that he had underreported and underpaid because of financial difficulties.stated that he always had intended to file amended returns to correct the violation.in march of,he did so.he has paid the deficiency,including interest and penalties,and is now in good standing with the state.

discussion 
we review de novo a grant of summary judgment.unocal kaabipour,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,there are no genuine issues of material fact and the law requires a holding in the moving party favor.id.
does not dispute that he knowingly underreported the franchise state sales tax and that his doing so breached the dealer agreements.however,the parties do dispute whether that breach was material to the franchise relationship.we hold that both of the cited provisions governing termination of a gasoline franchise agreement require an inquiry into the significance of the breach.because has raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether his failure to pay sales tax was material to the franchise relationship,we reverse and remand.
a.the statutory framework 
we turn first to the applicable statutory provisions.the parties relationship is governed by the pmpa.the pmpa generally prohibits early termination of a franchise agreement e xcept as provided in subsection b of.a.chevron cites two provisions of subsection b in support of its termination of the franchise b a and b c 
subsection b a states that a franchisor may terminate upon failure by the franchisee to comply with any provision of the franchise,which provision is both reasonable and of material significance to the franchise relationship.
subsection b c states that termination is permissible on the occurrence of an event which is relevant to the franchise relationship and as a result of which termination of the franchise is reasonable.section c provides a nonexhaustive list of relevant events that would be reasonable grounds for termination under subsection b c.c.one item on that list,c,is the knowing failure of the franchisee to comply with federal,state,or local laws or regulations relevant to the operation of the marketing premises.
the pmpa defines failure.section a states that t he term failure does not include any failure which is only technical or unimportant to the franchise relationship.emphasis added.
materiality of violation under the applicable provisions 
the district court held that only subsection b a requires chevron to prove that the ground for termination is of material significance.under the district court analysis,the importance of the breach to the franchise relationship is not relevant under subsection b c.did not dispute that he had knowingly failed to comply with laws pertaining to the franchise.because an event specifically enumerated in c had occurred,the district court concluded that termination was permissible under subsection b c as
