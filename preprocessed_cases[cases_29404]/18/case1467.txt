william gregory appeals from a judgment holding him individually liable for his corporation delinquencies in paying outstanding wages,expenses,interest and penalties,not because he did business as or through any analysis,but simply because he was a corporate officer who ha d operational control of the corporation covered enterprise,quoting lopez silverman d.the labor commissioner,by the division of labor standards enforcement dlse,brought this suit against gregory on behalf of the corporation unpaid california employees.relying on assertedly analogous federal authorities,dlse argued gregory fell within the meaning of employer in various labor code wage provisions and industrial welfare commission iwc wage orders.attacking the judgment,gregory contends california law does not support imposing personal liability on corporate officers or agents as employers.guided by our supreme court recent decision in reynolds bement cal th,d,reynolds,we agree.we therefore reverse the judgment and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
factual and procedural background 
gregory was the creative force behind science adventures sa,a collection of summer science camps aimed at elementary school children.the session of sa premiered in,with campers.some years later,there were more than enrollees nationwide,generating in excess of million in revenues.
gregory dominance of sa corporate activities left no doubt about his place in the company pecking order.variously known to his employees as the owner,the big wig,the top guy,and the boss,gregory was registered as sa chief executive officer with the california secretary of state.all remaining corporate positions for sa were held by gregory wife,toni.
gregory held an ownership interest in a combined building housing sa main base of operations and was a fixture at the facility.at any time of day,he might be found in virtually any area of the building.
in the wake of the company dramatic growth,gregory personally hired and assembled a team of seven lead staff members,each assigned to cover a different area of the company.all of these individuals reported directly to gregory.gregory set salaries and promotions for the members of this topmost echelon,and supervised their duties as well.he also set the wage rates for all other sa employees,authorized pay changes,and personally fired staff members he deemed unacceptable.similarly,any ideas for new projects or expansion were directed to gregory for his consideration and approval.and he was the only individual authorized to sign checks on sa behalf.as one employee opined,gregory was the overall approver sic for everything anything and everything went through bill.
being a seasonal enterprise,sa generated at least percent of its revenue during the summer months.put another way,sa summer program brought in lots of cash flow on a regular basis.during the school year,however,the cash flow thinned out,so sa planned enrollment and staffing needs accordingly.
near the end of summer,sa ran into an unexpected glitch.cash on hand ran low even though the program had produced some million in gross receipts.by the time the dust settled,some summer instructors and administrators were left with wages due and unpaid.gregory claimed to have no prior knowledge of the shortfall and identified the unauthorized release of some in checks as at least a partial cause of the problem.
in a series of signed memos to all sa employees,gregory recounted the company funding status and its inability to pay wages.with each memo,the prospects turned progressively more bleak,with gregory ultimately announcing a priority wage repayment scheme w e have begun paying those instructors who have returned to work first.they will be helping generate the cash which will eventually pay everyone else we now propose to pay any unpaid summer instructors who are not currently working,but who choose to return to teach summer camp in three payments.the first will be equal to approximately of what is owed the second payment will be paid whenever the instructor shows up for training.the balance will be made at the end of the summer season.although all employees who have not been paid certainly have the right to seek legal action,they will be placed in last priority he invited any employee who would agree to settle their claim for percent of the total sum owed to complete an attached release form.
according to gregory,he relinquished control of sa to an investment group in november.he continued to work for that group,science enrichment services,until it filed for bankruptcy in october.sa continues in operation as an ongoing concern and gregory serves as its chief executive officer.
in august,dlse sued gregory,sa by then a suspended california corporation,and another entity,community achievement services,cas,to recover wages owed to former california employees.cas filed for bankruptcy before trial.
dlse complaint sought an accounting and alleged the following causes of action failure to pay wages immediately upon discharge,layoff,or resignation failure to pay vested vacation time failure to indemnify business expenses and money had and received.the complaint also sought to enjoin the defendants pursuant to section from engaging in any further and future violations of the labor laws,regulations and orders,specifically,labor code sections,and.dlse alleged e ach of the defendants was a joint employer of the employees,and an agent alter ego of the other defendants 
the matter went to trial in a bifurcated proceeding,with the court eventually entering judgment in favor of employees who testified at trial.the judgment,entered jointly and severally against sa and gregory,totaled for unpaid wages,unpaid vacation time,business expenses,interest,and waiting time penalties.this appeal followed.
discussiona.reynolds rejected plaintiffs argument that an employer with operational control of a corporation is liable for employee wages 
gregory argues the trial court erred in looking to lopez operational control standard to impose personal liability on a corporate officer for unpaid employee wages.the fair labor standards act flsa defines employer broadly holding a corporation president liable for his employees unpaid overtime wages,lopez observed n umerous federal circuits have concluded that an individual corporate officer or owner may be deemed an employer under the therefore responsible for the corporation flsa situations where the individual has overall operational control of the corporation,possesses an ownership interest in it,controls significant functions of the business,or determines the employees salaries and makes hiring decisions.lopez,supra,d at.
unlike the flsa,the labor code supplies no uniform definition,broad or narrow,for employer,although some provisions define the term in a manner expressly limited to the particular section.see,subd.b sick leave requirement,providing that,as used in this section,employer means any person employing another under any appointment or contract of hire and includes the state,political subdivisions of the state,and municipalities,subd.a as used in this article concerning gratuities,employer means every person engaged in any business or enterprise in this state that has one or more persons in service under any appointment,contract of hire,or apprenticeship,express or implied,oral or written,irrespective of whether the person is the owner of the business or is operating on a concessionaire or other basis.
under our supreme court recent decision in reynolds,supra,cal th,d,federal law provides no mooring for the trial court decision.in reynolds,an automobile paint shop employee sought overtime wages for himself and putative class members,suing the incorporated paint shop,its president,and other individual defendants under section.that statute provides,in pertinent part notwithstanding any agreement to work for a lesser wage,any employee receiving less than the legal minimum wage or the legal overtime compensation applicable to the employee is entitled to recover in a civil action the unpaid balance of the full amount of this minimum wage or overtime compensation,including interest thereon,reasonable attorney fees,and costs of suit,subd.a see also defining overtime.
reynolds acknowledged f ederal decisions have frequently guided our interpretation of state labor provisions the language of which parallels that of federal statutes citation.reynolds,supra,cal th at,d.but the high court explained that where the language or intent of state and federal labor laws substantially differ,reliance on federal regulations or interpretations to construe state regulations is misplaced citation.while the flsa contains an express definition of employer citation,section does not,footnote omitted.in this statute referring to employees without defining the have generally applied the common law test of employment.id.at,d.as the court observed,under the common law,corporate agents acting within the scope of their agency are not personally liable for the corporate employer failure to pay its employees wages.citations.ibid.
as with section,so too none of the labor code provisions plaintiffs rely upon in their,or define employer.hence,as reynolds explained,the flsa,lopez,and other federal authority plaintiffs extensively cited are simply beside the point.and the presumption is that the common law definition of an employer applies,precluding personal liability for corporate agents.
reynolds is instructive in another respect.the iwc is the state agency empowered to formulate regulations known as wage orders governing employment in the state of california.tidewater marine western,bradshaw cal th,d.in reynolds,the plaintiff relied on a wage order affecting transportation businesses,wage order,which defines employer to include an individual who exercises control over the wages,hours,or working conditions of any person.plaintiffs rely on an identical definition of employer in the wage order applicable here 
but as the supreme court noted,the plain language of the iwc employer definition does not expressly impose liability under section on individual corporate agents.nor can we infer that the legislature,simply by amending sections and several times after the iwc adopted its employer definition,impliedly intended to incorporate that definition reynolds,supra,cal th at,d.notably,n either section nor section contains any reference to the iwc employer definition id.at,d.reynolds explained that a statute will be construed in light of the common law unless the legislature clearly and unequivocally indicates otherwise and therefore,had the legislature intended to depart from the common law by engrafting wage order onto section,it would have more clearly manifested that intent.id.at,d.similarly here,none of the provisions plaintiffs rely upon refer to the iwc employer definition hence,there is no reason to suppose the legislature intended to alter the common law rule against personal liability for corporate agents.
actions plaintiffs attempt to distinguish reynolds fails 
plaintiffs attempt to distinguish reynolds because the plaintiff there sued in his private capacity,whereas dlse has prosecuted this action.there is some,albeit limited,support for this distinction in reynolds itself.see reynolds,supra,cal th at,d,we have no occasion in resolving this private dispute to address questions concerning dlse use,in administrative proceedings,of the iwc employer definition,italics added see id.at,d,original italics explaining that an employee may seek administrative relief by filing a wage claim with the commissioner commonly known as the berman hearing procedure,after the name of its sponsor see generally et.berman hearings,tit,hearing procedures.plainly,the distinction evaporates insofar as dlse filed this action in court rather than before an administrator.
the distinction,moreover,may be an empty one,since berman hearings are reviewed de novo in superior court at request of either party.additionally,even in the administrative context,the dlse in its adjudicatory role is of course obligated to follow the substantive law and,as the supreme court observed,nothing in that process precludes hearing officers from finding individual corporate agents liable for unpaid wages when such liability is proven on established common law,alter ego or statutory theories.reynolds,supra,cal th at,d,italics added,fn.omitted,citing requires personal guarantee of minimum wage and overtime compensation in garment manufacturing operations.the supreme court did not suggest individual corporate agent liability for unpaid wages may be proven on anything other than established common law or statutory theories.here,the trial court expressly declined to premise its ruling on the plaintiffs alter ego theory,and we are not in a position to make such a finding on appeal as we discuss below,the statutory theories plaintiffs have advanced in briefing do not support the imposition of individual liability.
plaintiffs point out that while n either section nor section contains any reference to the iwc employer definition reynolds,supra,cal th at,d,section,subdivision b,expressly provides the labor commissioner may prosecute action s for the collection of wages and other moneys payable to employees or to the state arising out of an employment relationship or order of the industrial welfare commission.italics added.a plain reading of this language reveals no intent to make substantive changes to the labor code by importing iwc orders in whole or in part.see reynolds,supra,cal th at,d,the best indicator of intent is the language of the provision itself.the supreme court described the special statutory scheme codified in sections to in procedural terms noting,for example,its provision for administrative relief in berman hearings reynolds,supra,cal th at,d.while section authorizes the labor commissioner to prosecute civil actions in addition to pursuing administrative relief,nothing in section purports to modify the substantive terms of the labor code.
moreover,section is untethered to any particular statutory wage requirement,so reynold observation remains true that the iwc employer definition does not expressly impose liability under section or any other labor code provision on individual corporate agents.reynolds,supra,cal th at,d.in other words,if the legislature had intended to depart from the common law by engrafting wage order or a similar iwc regulation onto section or other statutory provision,it would have more clearly manifested that intent.id.at,d.put simply,section does not engraft wage order exercises control language onto the code provisions cited in plaintiffs complaint.
plaintiffs next contend section authorizes the dlse to seek an injunction against any person employing an employee where such person has willfully violated any of the laws,regulations,or iwc orders governing wages,hours of work,or working conditions.plaintiffs quotation and italics.but the statute terms do not actually embrace any person.rather,only persons employing others are subject to injunction and,under common law agency principles long ago codified,see,oppenheimer general cable d,a corporate officer or agent does not employ corporation does section evinces no clear and unequivocal intent to depart from these principles.see reynolds,supra,cal th at,d.additionally,the equitable relief contemplated by the statute,an injunction against any further violations,is prospective,and plaintiffs do not explain how they may invoke the statute to support damages for the past violations identified here 
plaintiffs argue section furnishes grounds for individual corporate officer or agent liability.according to plaintiffs,section allow s the labor commissioner to reach beyond the common law employer for amounts owed under the labor code wage article even assuming we were to overlook plaintiffs failure to raise section below,the statute terms do not provide for the damages judgment entered here.instead,if a judgment is entered or a misdemeanor penalty assessed,as applicable and remains unsatisfied and the employer has waived or exhausted appeal,dlse may seek a bond payable to the labor commissioner and conditioned that the employer shall,for a definite future period,not exceeding six months,pay the employees in accordance with the
