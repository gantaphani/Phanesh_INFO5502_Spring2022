appellants castle investment group,castle and lake view nutrition consulting services,lake view appeal the tax court decision stating that it did not have jurisdiction to entertain appellants petition contesting a deficiency found against castle after castle dissolution.because castle did not have the legal capacity to file a petition and because the irs has not filed a notice of transferee liability against lake view,we affirm.
background 
castle was an illinois corporation.on october,the illinois secretary of state dissolved castle because it failed to file an annual report and because it failed to pay the annual franchise tax.at the time of castle dissolution,lake view was its sole shareholder and successor to its assets.pursuant to tax court rule c,illinois state law determines castle capacity to litigate.the relevant illinois statutes provide that the illinois secretary of state may administratively dissolve any corporation if,inter alia,the corporation has failed to file its annual report and pay its franchise tax.comp.stat.a.a corporation dissolution terminates its corporate existence and a dissolved corporation shall not thereafter carry on any business except that necessary to and liquidate its business and affairs.id.furthermore,the illinois statutes make it plain that any action or other proceeding to defend the company interests must be commenced within the state five year corporate period.id.castle period expired on october.
in july,the irs sent castle a notice indicating that castle had failed to file an income tax return for the period ending june.nearly four years later,on june,castle belatedly filed the requested tax return.on june,the irs sent castle a notice of deficiency under which disallowed certain deductions for its taxable year.the notice further explained that castle was liable for delinquency and accuracy related penalties,plus interest.both the issuance of the notice of deficiency and the filing of the petition challenging the deficiency occurred in,well beyond the october,deadline.
on september,a petition in the names of castle and lake view was filed in the tax court under to redetermine castle deficiency.the commissioner filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.the commissioner argued that castle lacked the capacity to petition the tax court because,under illinois law,castle was dissolved and its ability to commence new proceedings had expired in after the conclusion of illinois five year period.he also argued that lake view could not maintain the petition pursuant to a and tax court rule b because the commissioner had not issued it either a notice of deficiency or a notice of transferee liability.
appellants opposed the motion,arguing that the filing of castle tax return constituted an action or other proceeding under illinois law that would toll the expiration of the corporate period.alternatively,appellants argued that lake view was the real party in interest,and as such,should be allowed to maintain the petition in the tax court.the tax court agreed with the government and granted the commissioner motion in an order of dismissal.

iii.analysis 
castle did not have the capacity to petition the tax court to redetermine its deficiency.
appellants argue that the solicitation or the filing of castle tax return prior to the expiration of illinois corporate period constituted the proceeding that triggered the tax court jurisdiction to entertain appellants petition.appellants rely upon american police and fire foundation,commissioner,cch.in that case,the tax court held that receipt within the corporate survival period of a notice of deficiency created jurisdiction w e believe that a proceeding had been commenced at least at the time of issuance of the statutory notice we need not decide whether a qualifying proceeding had commenced before that time.id.emphasis added.appellants argue that the court refusal to decide whether the qualifying proceeding had commenced prior to the issuance of the notice indirectly acknowledged that the expiration of a corporate period should not limit a corporate taxpayer right to defend itself from a potentially erroneous tax determination.appellants contend that this is particularly true where the petition challenging the determination could not be filed until after the survival period expired.
appellants also rely upon bahen wright,commissioner,cir holding that sending a notice of tax deficiency within the three year state statutory period commenced a proceeding for purposes of invoking the tax court jurisdiction bared cobo,commissioner,wl holding that issuance of a notice of deficiency to a corporation three years after its dissolution was an action or other proceeding under florida corporate survival statute and american standard watch,commissioner,cir holding that filing a claim for a tax refund within the statutory survival period commenced the proceeding for jurisdictional purposes.appellants conclude that they must be permitted to pursue their claim because they filed their tax return before the period expired.they argue that the district court has effectively allowed the irs to take advantage of them by filing a notice of deficiency after the expiration of the period,during which castle could have pursued its petition.
appellants argument fails,however,because congress has expressly authorized the commissioner to issue notices to defunct corporate taxpayers that can no longer legally contest the notice.specifically,b provides that i n the absence of notice to the secretary under section of the existence of a fiduciary relationship,notice of a deficiency in respect of income tax if properly mailed to the taxpayer shall be sufficient even if such taxpayer,in the case of a corporation,has terminated its existence.additionally,the tax court has confirmed on numerous occasions that congress has authorized the commissioner through b to issue a notice of deficiency to a dissolved corporation,despite the fact that the corporation does not have the legal capacity to challenge the notice in the tax court,bloomington transmission,comm r,wl we recognize that our holding will leave petitioner in the anomalous position of being unable to defend against the determination,assessment,and possibly the collection of federal tax.it was,however,petitioner failure to file annual reports or pay franchise tax,or to cure the defects during either the or period.padre island thunderbird,comm r,wl condo comm r,wl dillman.asphalt comm r,wl great falls bonding agency,comm r,wl.the tax court has never found the filing of a return to commence a proceeding within the meaning of a statutory period,but it has dismissed for lack of jurisdiction a petition filed after the period in which a return had been filed before the period ended.dillman.asphalt,at see also malone hyde,comm r,cch holding that audit of a tax return does not constitute an action or proceeding within the meaning of delaware statute addressing the survival of any action or proceeding in a merger badger materials,comm r,wl w e do not regard the filing of an application for tentative carryback adjustment or the issuance of an informal conference letter as a suit or other proceeding within the purview of the wisconsin statute.
the cases appellants rely upon are readily distinguishable.in bahen wright,at bared cobo,at and american police fire foundation,cch,wl the courts held only that the issuance of a notice of deficiency constituted the commencement of a proceeding within the meaning of the state statute before it a notice of deficiency serves a function different from that of a tax return.as the tax court stated in american police fire foundation,it signals the existence of a contest over tax liability and is the taxpayer ticket to the tax court.
