background 
in january,plaintiff kelly brugger,then a minor,seriously injured her knee while playing a game of bombardment during a physical education class at the academy.brugger doctor had previously sent a note to the academy barring her from participation in any activity involving movement due to a knee injury,but brugger alleges that she was ordered to play bombardment or risk receiving a failing grade for the class and being unable to graduate.
the academy is a corporation operating as a private school for educating emotionally handicapped youth.brugger former public school district,leyden community high school district the school district,contracted with the academy for brugger education because it was unable to provide an appropriate education for her in its own facilities.
brugger filed a personal injury complaint against both the academy and the school district,alleging that her injury was caused by willful and wanton misconduct in that she was required to participate in the game of bombardment contrary to her physician orders.the circuit court of cook county granted the school district motion to dismiss it as a party that ruling is not challenged on appeal.the academy filed a motion for summary judgment,and the trial court granted the motion,finding that the facility had immunity as a l ocal public entity under section of the act ilcs west.the appellate court reversed,finding that this court decision in cooney society of carmel,precluded granting immunity to the academy as a local public entity under section.d at.
this court granted the academy petition for leave to appeal on february,brugger joseph academy,pursuant to supreme court rule a a.on february,we filed our decision in carroll.the lower courts in this case did not have the benefit of the carroll decision,and the academy now raises important questions concerning the practical application of the carroll test in the context of a new set of facts.
ii.analysis 
the academy raises two issues before this court.first,it argues carroll paddock,was wrongly decided.it contends that the test recently adopted in carroll to identify local public entities qualifying for immunity under the act is overly restrictive and does not comport with either the plain language of the act ilcs west or the intent of the legislature.in the alternative,the academy contends that,even if the carroll test is applied in this case,it qualifies as a local public entity under section of the act ilcs west.thus,the academy maintains that the trial court properly granted summary judgment in its favor.we begin our examination of these issues with the academy challenge to our recent decision in carroll.
the act grants covered entities immunity from tort liability for injuries arising from the operation of government.ilcs west carroll,at.the entities protected by the act include the bodies specified in section as well as any corporation organized for the purpose of conducting public business.ilcs west.
in carroll,this court considered whether a hospital was a local public entity within the meaning of section and,thus,entitled to immunity.carroll,at.we concluded that the undefined term public business requires the pursuit of an activity that benefits the entire community without limitation.in addition,the phrase public business is also today commonly understood to mean the business of the government.carroll,at,quoting carroll paddock,d,quoting lake forest symphony ass n,d.furthermore,since p ublic business is the business of government,a organization seeking immunity under section must establish that it is tightly enmeshed with government either through direct governmental ownership or operational control by a unit of local government.carroll,at.the academy challenge to our construction of the act in carroll presents a question of law.accordingly,we will review this issue de novo.in re.
the academy first argues that carroll adopted an erroneous definition of public business for purposes of the act.it contends that,based on our misconstruction of this term,carroll established an overly restrictive test for determining whether an entity qualifies for tort immunity under the act.indeed,the academy claims that our test effectively renders the entire phrase as well as any corporation organized for the purpose of conducting public business mere surplusage because the requirement of government ownership or control eliminates all nongovernmental agencies.
the academy contention that a corporation can never qualify for immunity under our test in carroll is belied by a case cited in its own brief,barnes chicago housing authority,d.in that case,the plaintiffs filed a tort complaint seeking,in part,recovery for serious personal injuries allegedly caused by the failure of a resident management corporation to provide adequate security at a public housing development in chicago.barnes,d at.
resident management corporations are organizations recognized under a program of the united states department of housing and urban development,designed to promote tenant management of public housing developments.see et.pursuant to the united states housing act of,the resident management program requirements provide that each resident management corporation shall enter into a contract with the public housing agency establishing the respective management rights and responsibilities of the corporation and the public housing agency.b west supp.that same statute mandates that the contract 
be consistent with the requirements of this chapter applicable to public housing projects and may include specific terms governing management personnel and compensation,access to public housing project records,submission of and adherence to budgets,rent collection procedures,tenant income verification,tenant eligibility determinations,tenant eviction,the acquisition of supplies and materials,rent determination,community service requirements,sic and such other matters as may be appropriate.b west supp.
other federal regulations further govern the interaction between the public housing authority and the resident management corporation.et.these regulations include provisions restricting eligibility for membership in the resident council and mandating election procedures.resident councils play an important role because they may establish resident management corporations.such close interaction and comprehensive governmental control of a corporation exemplify the characteristics of the type of organization that may be able to qualify for immunity as a local public entity under section of the act ilcs west.without specifically ruling on the immunity of resident management corporations,we reject the academy contention that carroll renders the portion of the act granting immunity to any corporation organized for the purpose of conducting public business mere surplusage.
the academy next challenges carroll definition of public business by arguing that it was improperly drawn from definitions in black law dictionary,rather than from the common law usage of that term.see advincula united blood services.the academy asserts that at common law public business described governmental activities that furthered the public welfare or affected the public interest.since the public has an interest in the
