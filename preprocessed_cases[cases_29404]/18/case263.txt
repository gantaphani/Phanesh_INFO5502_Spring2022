plaintiff andrew roth,suing derivatively on behalf of nominal defendant metal management,mmi or metal management,for disgorgement to mmi of profits under b of the securities exchange act of exchange act or act,b,appeals from a final judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york,deborah batts,judge,granting motions by defendants benjamin jennings and european metal recycling,emr collectively defendants,to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted.the complaint alleged that jennings and emr as a group,within the meaning of the act,owned more than percent of mmi outstanding stock that within a period of less than six months,jennings purchased and sold mmi stock at a profit of some million and that b required the disgorgement of that profit to mmi.the district court granted both defendants motions to dismiss on the ground that the complaint was insufficient to plead that defendants acted as a group,given the disclaimers of group status in documents filed by defendants with the securities and exchange commission sec.the court ruled that the claim against emr was also dismissable on the ground that the complaint did not allege that emr itself had engaged in any transactions or received any pecuniary profit from the mmi stock transactions by jennings.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the dismissal of the claim against emr,but we vacate the dismissal of the claim against jennings and remand for further proceedings.
background 
for purposes of reviewing the dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim,we accept the complaint factual allegations,and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from those allegations in the plaintiff favor,as true.see,leatherman tarrant county narcotics intelligence coordination unit,d overton todman,cir.the following description is taken from allegations in the complaint and from documents referred to in the complaint which were filed by emr or jennings with the sec pursuant to sec rule and schedule,a,schedule filings.
a.the parties and the transactions in mmi stock 
metal management or the company,which describes itself as one of the nation largest scrap metal recyclers,is a publicly owned delaware corporation headquartered in chicago,illinois.emr is a privately owned scrap metal processing company headquartered in the united kingdom.jennings,an illinois resident,is a former chairman and chief executive officer of mmi.
on may and may,emr purchased a total of shares of mmi common stock in transactions.these shares represented approximately percent of mmi outstanding common stock.see complaint.the schedule filed by emr with respect to those transactions stated that 
emr has taken certain actions that indicate that emr be deemed to have the current intent to seek to change or influence control of the company,although it has not formulated any specific plan or proposal in this regard any such plan or proposal that may be formulated could involve,among other things,entering into one or more privately negotiated acquisitions of additional company securities,purchases,proposing a business combination transaction with the company,making a tender offer for some or all of the shares or waging a proxy contest for control of the company.
emr schedule dated june,at emphases added.
on may and,jennings,in transactions,purchased a total of shares of mmi common stock.see complaint.these shares constituted approximately percent of mmi outstanding stock.see jennings schedule dated june,at.the prices ranged from to,for a total purchase price of jennings paid for the shares by obtaining a million loan from emr.see complaint.according to the terms of the loan agreement,the loan was unsecured the interest rate was percent per annum.see jennings schedule dated june,exhibit a emr schedule dated june,exhibit 
roth complaint alleged that t he loan was made for the specific purpose of buying mmi securities in furtherance of emr and jennings sic agreement to work together to effect a change of control or similar transaction involving mmi complaint,and that jennings and emr therefore constituted a group within the meaning of d of the act for purposes of determining each entity beneficial ownership of mmi stock under of the act,id.the complaint alleged that under b,each member of the group is liable to pay to the issuer all profits earned by that group member in stock transactions effected within a period during which time the group owned a greater than beneficial interest in the issuer stock.id.
on july and,jennings sold of his mmi shares,at prices ranging from to per share.see complaint.from august through september,he sold an additional shares,at prices ranging from to per share.see id.the complaint alleged that a t all relevant times during the period while jennings purchased and sold mmi common stock,the group owned in excess of of mmi outstanding common stock.id.it alleged that jennings sales,which occurred less than six months after his purchases,resulted in profits totaling at least,and that jennings and emr are each liable to the extent of its sic pecuniary interest in the disgorgeable profits.id.see id.
b.the motions to dismiss and the district court decision 
jennings and emr moved for dismissal pursuant to.b for failure to state a claim under b.they attached to their respective motions several documents they had filed with the of which were referred to in the described,inter alia,the loan agreement between emr and jennings,certain of their transactions in mmi stock,and their respective mmi holdings.the loan agreement,in the form of a june,letter from emr to jennings,signed as a ccepted and agreed to by jennings loan agreement the version attached to the schedule filed by follows 
this letter will evidence our legally binding agreements effective as of june,
european metal recycling emr has agreed to provide you with a bridge loan in an aggregate of up to the loan.
the loan shall be unsecured,shall accrue interest at the rate of four percent per annum,and shall be due and payable in full no later than ninety days from the effective date hereof.
emr hereby acknowledges that you have used proceeds of the loan to purchase shares of common stock of metal management.emr hereby acknowledges and agrees that you currently are not,nor in the future shall you,be under any obligation to vote,retain or dispose of such shares as part of,nor otherwise to participate in any way in any plans or proposals of,any group within the meaning of the applicable federal and state securities laws in regard to the securities of metal management,including any group that may in the future involve emr in any way.
emr schedule dated june,exhibit i see also jennings schedule dated june,exhibit a with slight linguistic differences from emr exhibit i.jennings and emr argued that the complaint failed sufficiently to allege that they were a group within the meaning of the pertinent securities laws and that the loan agreement and their other sec filings showed that they had disclaimed group status.
in a memorandum and order dated february,the district court agreed,granting both defendants motions to dismiss.see wl,district court opinion.the court found principally that defendants sec filings disclaimed group status,and it held that notwithstanding the contrary allegations of the complaint,defendants disclaimers were controlling.
the court began its discussion by noting that in considering a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b,the court is required to accept as true the factual allegations in the complaint,draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff,and refrain from assessing the weight of the evidence that might be offered in support of the complaint.the court noted that such a motion should be granted only if,after viewing plaintiff allegations in this favorable light,it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.district court opinion,wl,at quoting walker city of new york,cir quoting conley gibson,d,cert.denied,d.the court also stated that 
consideration of a rule b motion is limited to the factual allegations in the complaint,documents attached to the complaint as exhibits or incorporated in it by reference,to matters of which judicial notice might be taken,or to documents either in plaintiff possession or of which plaintiffs had knowledge and relied on in bringing suit.
district court opinion,wl,at.it added that 
the second circuit has held that when a district court decides a motion to dismiss a complaint alleging securities fraud,it may review and consider public disclosure documents required by law to be and which actually have been filed with the sec,as these are documents that should be noticed by the court.cortec,sum holding,cir referencing kramer time warner,cir.

as to the merits of the motions,the court noted that,in order to show that jennings purchases,amounting to percent of mmi shares,were subject to b,roth was required to show that emr and jennings constituted a group within the meaning of the act,that is,that they combined in furtherance of a common objective.district court opinion,wl,at quoting wellman dickinson,cir,cert.denied,d.the court stated that i n order to plead group activity sufficiently,plaintiff is not required to allege that a common objective of actual corporate control existed among the defendants,but simply that the defendants acted together in furtherance of a common objective with regard to acquiring,holding,voting or disposing of securities of the issuer,although the concerted action of the group members need not be expressly memorialized in writing.district court opinion,wl,at internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.
the court ruled,however,that roth complaint d id not sufficiently allege such an common purpose between emr and jennings.id.at.citing schedule filings by emr and jennings,respectively,the court observed that the schedule filed by jennings in june,which disclosed jennings purchases of mmi shares and the loan from emr,stated a that t here are no arrangements or understandings between emr and jennings as to how jennings would utilize the proceeds of the l oan,and b that jennings does not have any definite plans regarding an extraordinary corporate transaction,such as a merger,reorganization or liquidation involving mmi or a sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of mmi or any of its subsidiaries.district court opinion,wl,at quoting jennings schedule dated june,at emphasis ours.the court noted also that emr schedule disclosing its loan to jennings stated that 
emr has no contract,arrangement or understanding of any kind with jennings with respect to the common stock of mmi owned by emr or by jennings expressly disclaims any direct or indirect beneficial ownership in the common stock of mmi owned by jennings and further disclaims any group status with jennings.
district court opinion,wl,at quoting emr schedule dated june,at other internal quotation marks omitted emphasis ours.and the court noted that 
t he loan agreement signed by both jennings and emr managing director expressly states that jennings and emr are in no way,either by the loan of june,or at any time in the future,to be considered a group or part of any group that might include more than the defendants emr filed an amended schedule after loaning money to jennings,which further declared that the loan did not constitute group activity.
district court opinion,wl,at emphases added.the court stated that defendants had thus filed three separate statements with the sec,asserting that their actions do not constitute group activity that their disclaimers conflicted with the allegations of the complaint and that the complaint did not explain the documents that emr and jennings had filed with the sec.id.the court accepted defendants disclaimers as true.see id.
the district court rejected roth contention that,in ruling on the rule b motions,the court should not rely on defendants disclaimers 
plaintiff contends that the disclaimer of group status in the loan agreement and the subsequent amended schedules by both defendants was meant to circumvent liability even though the two were acting in concert.however,unadorned allegations based on unmitigated speculation that defendants are acting as a group are inadequate to sustain a section d claim.segal gordon,cir.in the instant case,defendants have filed three separate statements with the sec,asserting that their actions do not constitute group activity.the express disclaimer of group status conflicts with plaintiff allegations.even interpreting the pleadings in a light most favorable to the plaintiff,the defendants statements,which have been submitted to a government agency and made public,should not be contradicted or taken as perjurious simply because the plaintiff,without evidence,says they are.see matusovsky merrill lynch,d,stating that if a plaintiff allegations are contradicted by a document considered in determining a rule b motion,those allegations are insufficient to defeat the motion rap o port asia,d,stating that when documents contain statements that contradict the allegations in the complaint,the documents control and the court need not accept as true the allegations contained in the complaint.
district court opinion,wl,at emphases added.
in addition,the district court ruled that the complaint would be dismissable e ven were this court not to accept the truth of defendants statements in their sec filings.id.the court concluded that b was inapplicable because other evidence submitted by defendants indicated that emr and jennings could not be considered to have been a group at the time of jennings sales.citing the language in b that t his subsection shall not be construed to cover any transaction where such beneficial owner was not such both at the time of the purchase and sale,or the sale and purchase,of the security involved,b,the court concluded that for traders to constitute a group,the exchange act requires that their coordinated activity persist during the time of purchase and during the time of sale of the securities,district court opinion,wl,at emphasis in original.the court noted that,according to documents submitted by defendants,emr had offered in august to buy jennings shares at a price and that jennings had declined that offer and sold shares on the open market.see id.at citing emr schedule dated august,exhibit emr letter offering to pay jennings per share.the court found that 
s uch transactions do not reflect two group members acting in concert to effectuate a common objective with regard to acquiring,holding,voting or disposing of securities of the issuer had defendants held a common purpose,jennings likely would have accepted emr offer.while group members need not march in lock step to qualify as a group,marching in opposite directions certainly counsels against concluding that jennings acted with emr as a group.jennings refusal of emr offer contradicted precisely what one would have expected of him had he been acting in concert with emr.
district court opinion,wl,at internal quotation marks and brackets omitted emphases added see id.t his evidence does not in any way approximate an instance of group activity,and belies allegations of any common objective shared by the defendants emphasis added id.at in selling his shares on the open market,jennings did not act in concert with emr at the time of sale he did the opposite.the court concluded that,
a ccordingly,emr shares can not be aggregated with jennings to constitute the more than ten percent ownership required to warrant section b liability.neither emr nor jennings may be considered part of a group.
because the complaint does not sufficiently aver that defendants acted as a group at the time jennings sold his mmi shares,because public sec filings indicate that defendants never intended to act as a group,and because jennings alone did not own ten percent of a class of mmi equity securit ies,jennings motion to dismiss plaintiff complaint is hereby granted.
id.emphasis added.
the court ruled that the claim against emr should be dismissed on the additional ground that the complaint did not allege that emr had made any sales of its own shares or had any direct or indirect pecuniary interest in the shares sold by jennings.
judgment was entered dismissing the complaint,and this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,roth contends principally that the district court erred in concluding that the complaint failed to state a claim on which relief can be granted against jennings,arguing that the complaint sufficiently pleaded that emr and jennings acted as a group for the purpose of jennings acquisition of mmi shares,that defendants disclaimers of group activity were not entitled to evidentiary weight in the consideration of rule b motions,and that jennings sales of his shares were not a basis for concluding that the group provisions no longer applied.for the reasons that follow,we agree.
section of the exchange act,with respect to any company whose securities are registered on a national securities exchange,imposes certain obligations and restrictions on the company officers,directors,and e very person who is directly or indirectly the beneficial owner of more than percent of any class of any equity security other than an exempted security,a.d efining directors,officers,and such beneficial owners as those presumed to have access to inside information,provident securities,d,congress enacted b of the act,which provides,in pertinent part,as follows 
b profits from purchase and sale of security within six months.for the purpose of preventing the unfair use of information which may have been obtained by such beneficial owner,director,or officer by reason of his relationship to the issuer,any profit realized by him from any purchase and sale,or any sale and purchase,of any equity security of such issuer other than an exempted security within any period of less than six months,shall inure to and be recoverable by the issuer,irrespective of any intention on the part of such beneficial owner,director,or officer in entering into such transaction of holding the security purchased or of not repurchasing the security sold for a period exceeding six months this subsection shall not be construed to cover any transaction where such beneficial owner was not such both at the time of the purchase and sale,or the sale and purchase,of the security 
the general purpose of congress in enacting b is well known.see kern county land occidental petroleum,d reliance electric emerson electric,d,and the authorities cited therein.congress recognized that insiders may have access to information about their corporations not available to the rest of the investing public.by trading on this information,these persons could reap profits at the expense of less well informed investors.in b congress sought to curb the evils of insider trading by taking the profits out of a class of transactions in which the possibility of abuse was believed to be intolerably great.reliance electric,supra,at.
at.emphasis added.
profits resulting from,or,transactions within a period of less than six months are commonly known as transactions,see,id.at.sec rule a,a.as indicated by the irrespective of any intention clause in b,that section is a provision it requires the inside,trader to disgorge all profits realized on all purchases and sales within the period,without proof of actual abuse of insider information,and without proof of intent to profit on the basis of such information,kern county land occidental petroleum,d emphasis added see,at.section b imposes a strict prophylactic rule with respect to insider,trading.
the exchange act also recognizes that the abuses it targets may be accomplished by persons acting not individually but in combination with others.see,d.with respect to,sec rule a provides that,s olely for purposes of determining whether a person is a beneficial owner of more than ten percent of any class of equity securities,the term beneficial owner means,with exceptions not pertinent here,any person who is deemed a beneficial owner pursuant to section d of the act and the rules thereunder.a.section d of the act provides,in pertinent part,that 
w hen two or more persons act as a partnership,limited partnership,syndicate,or other group for the purpose of acquiring,holding,or disposing of securities of an issuer,such syndicate or group shall be deemed a person for the purposes of this subsection.
d emphases added.and sec rule b promulgated thereunder provides,with exceptions not pertinent here,that 
w hen two or more persons agree to act together for the purpose of acquiring,holding,voting or disposing of equity securities of an issuer,the group formed thereby shall be deemed to have acquired beneficial ownership,for purposes of sections d and g of the act,as of the date of such agreement,of all equity securities of that issuer beneficially owned by any such persons.
b emphases added.accordingly,under d and this rule,if two or more entities agree to act together for any of the listed purposes,a group is thereby formed.
thus,the touchstone of a group within the meaning of section d is that the members combined in furtherance of a common objective.wellman dickinson,cir wellman,cert.denied,d.although a common purpose to acquire control of the issuing company would be an indicium of collective action within the meaning of d,it is not an essential.
t he agreement required by d need not be an agreement to gain corporate control or to influence corporate affairs the plain language of d demands only an agreement for the purpose of acquiring,holding,or disposing of securities,d,and rule is similarly satisfied by that sort of agreement,b.
morales quintel entertainment,cir.further,evidence that group members might not always make identical investment decisions does not preclude existence of agreement.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
importantly,for purposes of this case,the actors need not have combined for all of the purposes listed in d or rule b.acquiring,holding,and disposing of are listed in the disjunctive.hence,a ll that is required is that the members of the group have combined to further a common objective with regard to one of those activities.morales freund,cir emphasis added see,morales quintel entertainment,at wellman,at.
the questions of a whether two or more persons act ed as a group or agreed to act together,and b whether their purpose was the acquisition,holding,or disposition of an issuer equity securities are questions of fact.see,morales quintel entertainment,at.if they in fact so acted or agreed to so act,the legal consequences are specified in d and rule b if the persons agreed to act together for the purpose of purchasing an issuer shares,a group was thereby formed,b if they acted as a group,they must be treated as a single person,d shall be deemed a person and each person in the group shall be deemed to be the beneficial owner of all equity securities of that issuer beneficially owned by any member of the group,b.
an agreement to act together for the purpose of acquiring,holding,or disposing of shares need not be unconditional in order to support a finding that the actors constituted a group within the meaning of those provisions.see,wellman,at.nor need the group be committed to acquisition,holding,or disposition on any specific set of terms.see,morales freund,at.and,o f course,the concerted action of the group members need not be expressly memorialized in writing.wellman,at.the formation of such a group may be formal or informal and may be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence.morales quintel entertainment,at see also id.at sworn statements by defendants,alleged group members,that the members never agreed among themselves to acquire the stock are insufficient to support the granting of summary judgment in favor of the defendants where there is circumstantial evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could discredit the sworn statements and infer instead that the defendants entered into an agreement with one another,with an agreed purpose to acquire the stock.
in considering a motion under.b to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted,the district court is normally required to look only to the allegations on the face of the complaint.if,on such a motion,matters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court,the court should normally treat the motion as one for summary judgment pursuant to.b see,global network communications,city of new york,cir global.in any event,a ruling on a motion for dismissal pursuant to rule b is not an occasion for the court to make findings of fact.see,leonard israel discount bank of new york,cir.
in certain circumstances,the court may permissibly consider documents other than the complaint in ruling on a motion under rule b.documents that are attached to the complaint or incorporated in it by reference are deemed part of the pleading and may be considered.see,pani empire blue cross blue shield,cir,cert.denied,d.in addition,even if not attached or incorporated by reference,a document upon which the complaint solely relies and which is integral to the complaint may be considered by the court in ruling on such a motion.cortec industries,sum holding,cir cortec emphases added,cert.denied,d see,global,at.
this principle has its greatest applicability in cases alleging fraud.see,cortec,at kramer time warner,cir kramer.when a complaint alleges,for example,that a document filed with the sec failed to disclose certain facts,it is appropriate for the court,in considering a rule b motion,to examine the document to see whether or not those facts were disclosed.see,id.or when the complaint alleges that such a document made a particular representation,the court may properly look at the document to see whether that representation was made.see,id.at.consideration of such documents filed with the sec is appropriate with respect to a nondisclosure or misrepresentation claim because no serious question as to their authenticity can exist,and because the court is to consider them on a rule b motion only to determine what the documents stated,and not to prove the truth of their contents.kramer,at emphases added.
similarly,where public records that are integral to a fraud complaint are not attached to it,the court,in considering a rule b motion,is permitted to take judicial notice of those records.see,brass american film technologies,cir.if the court takes judicial notice,it does so in order to determine what statements they contained but again not for the truth of the matters asserted.kramer,at emphases added see,liberty mutual insurance rotches pork packers,cir.
a decision that a complaint fails to state a claim on which relief can be granted is a ruling of law,see,de jesus sears,roebuck,cir,cert.denied,d mccall pataki,cir,and we review such a decision de novo,see,gregory daly,cir.in our review,we,like the district court,must accept as true all of the factual allegations set out in plaintiff complaint,draw inferences from those allegations in the light most favorable to plaintiff,and construe the complaint liberally.id.internal quotation marks omitted.and whatever documents may properly be considered in connection with the rule b motion,the principle is that once a claim has been stated adequately,it may be supported by showing any set of facts consistent with the allegations in the complaint.bell atlantic twombly,d twombly.
c.the claim against jennings 
sufficiency of the allegation of group action 
because jennings apparently owned no mmi stock just prior to the may purchases he made with the loan from emr,he was not a statutory insider to whom applied unless he and already owned as a group for the purpose of jennings acquisition,holding,or disposition of mmi shares.the district court,in ruling that the complaint did not sufficiently allege that emr and jennings had acted as a group,did not properly apply the above principles.
the district court correctly noted that sec filings may properly be considered in ruling on a rule b motion to dismiss a complaint alleging claims of fraud.but this is not a fraud case.it is,rather,a b action seeking the disgorgement of profits,for which an insider is to be held strictly liable.defendants submissions of their schedule filings thus presented material that was inappropriate for consideration on rule b motions to dismiss a b complaint that contained no allegation of a failure to disclose or of a factual misrepresentation.
further,even if there had been allegations of fraud,defendants sec filings could not properly be considered for the truth of their contents.the district court view that the defendants statements,which have been submitted to a government agency and made public,should not be contradicted or taken as perjurious simply because the plaintiff,without evidence,says they are,district court opinion,wl,at a possible argument to a not an appropriate rationale for ruling on a motion under rule b.
the cases cited by the district court for the proposition that if a plaintiff allegations are contradicted by a document considered in determining a rule b motion,those allegations are insufficient to defeat the motion,id.citing matusovsky merrill lynch,d,emphases ours,that when documents contain statements that contradict the allegations in the complaint,the documents control and the court need not accept as true the allegations contained in the complaint,district court opinion,wl,at citing rapoport asia electronics holding,d,emphasis ours,are not applicable to the present case.matusovsky was a case in which the plaintiff claimed that a general release he had signed was without consideration,whereas the signed release itself recited the consideration he received and the cited discussion in rapoport concerned a fraud claim alleging that a prospectus failed to disclose certain facts.these cases fall squarely within the principle that the contents of the document are controlling where a plaintiff has alleged that the document contains,or does not contain,certain statements.as we noted in kramer,however,such documents may properly be considered only for what they contain,not to prove the truth of their contents.
in the present case,the gravamen of the complaint was simply that defendants were subject to strict liability for jennings profits on his transactions as members of a group that owned more than percent of mmi shares.the district court ruling that the complaint failed to state a claim that emr and jennings constituted a group because of defendants disclaimer s of group status in their schedule filings with the sec,district court opinion,wl,at,was flawed for several reasons.first,it improperly considered the representations in defendants filings for the truth of their assertions that there were no current agreements or understandings between jennings and emr as to how jennings would vote or dispose of his shares in the future.even assuming that those factual assertions were relevant,they raised issues of fact that should not have been determined at the pleading stage.
second,the court apparently assumed that defendants representations,which used the present tense as to their current understandings with respect to jennings future obligations,also meant that they had had no past understanding,when emr made the loan to jennings,that the purpose of the loan was to fund his purchase of mmi shares.the schedule filings did not,however,actually state that there had not been such an agreement with regard to jennings acquisition of the shares.for example,emr june schedule acknowledged that jennings had used the loan to fund his may purchases of mmi shares and stated that emr has no understanding with respect to the mmi shares owned by jennings.jennings june schedule made similar use of the present tense,stating there are no agreements as to how he would use the proceeds of the emr loan.thus,even if it had been appropriate to consider defendants sec filings for the truth of their assertions,their representations would not have warranted rulings in their favor,for they did not actually assert that emr had not agreed to make the loan to jennings for the purpose of the mmi stock acquisition.
third,in disclaiming group status,defendants were in effect attempting to disclaim the legal effects of their conduct.the district court acceptance of and reliance on defendants express state ment s that jennings and emr are in no way,either by the loan of june,or at any time in the future,to be considered a group,as a disclaimer that was control ling,district court opinion,wl,at,gave no recognition to the terms of d and rule b.if in fact emr and jennings acted together for the purpose of jennings acquiring mmi shares,emr and jennings thereby,under those provisions of law,formed a group,regardless of their attempted disclaimers of the legal effect of such joint action.
finally,looking at the group allegations in the complaint,that emr loan to jennings was made for the purpose of allowing him to buy mmi shares in furtherance of an agreement to work together to effect a change of control or similar transaction involving mmi complaint,and at the documents to which the complaint referred,we can not agree with the district court view that the group allegations were unmitigated speculation or unadorned allegations made without evidence,district court opinion,wl,at internal quotation marks omitted.leaving aside the principle that t he pleading of additional evidence,beyond what is required to enable the defendant to respond,is not only unnecessary,but in contravention of proper pleading procedure,geisler petrocelli,cir see,moore federal b ed,the complaint allegation of collaboration between emr and jennings was hardly unadorned or an unmitigated speculation.that allegation was accompanied by other allegations,and by references to defendants respective june schedule filings,that included the following 
on may,emr completed its accumulation of shares of mmi stock,or percent of the outstanding shares see complaint emr schedule dated june,at.
in connection with its may purchases,emr stated that it might seek to change or influence control of mmi by,inter alia,waging a proxy contest for control of the company emr schedule dated june,at.
on may and,jennings,in purchases,acquired shares of mmi stock see complaint,which constituted percent of mmi stock see jennings schedule dated june,at.
jennings paid for his may purchases with a million loan from emr see complaint.
the rate of interest on emr loan to jennings,according to the loan agreement,was percent per annum which we judicially notice was below the prime rate,see,wall street journal,at prime rate id.june,at,and june,at prime rate cut from to effective june.
emr million loan to jennings was unsecured see jennings schedule dated june,exhibit a emr schedule dated june,exhibit i.
although we do not suggest that roth was required to adduce such evidence at the pleading stage,see,twombly.at a complaint attacked by a rule b motion to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations,we note that on this record,no rational factfinder would be compelled to believe that emr and jennings had had no agreement with respect to jennings acquisition of his shares.given evidence that emr acquired a percent stake in mmi and stated that it might attempt to gain control of mmi,that within days of its acquisition of that percent emr made a cheap and unsecured loan of million to jennings,that jennings was mmi former chairman and ceo,and that jennings used the emr loan to acquire percent of mmi stock,a rational factfinder could instead easily infer that emr and jennings acted together for the purpose of jennings purchase of shares in mmi.and upon such a finding,d and rule b would require that emr and jennings be treated as a group,with each being deemed to own the total of their holdings of mmi stock.
in sum,the district court erred in accepting defendants sec filings for the truth of their contents,in inferring that those contents were sufficient and controlling,and in concluding that the complaint itself did not allege facts sufficient to show that emr and jennings constituted a group,within the meaning of the exchange act,for the purpose of having jennings purchase shares of mmi.
the duration of the group 
the remaining question is whether the complaint was nonetheless properly dismissed on the ground that b was inapplicable because emr and jennings were no longer a group on the theory that their interests had jennings sold his shares.the district court answered this question in the affirmative.because the final sentence of b states that 
t his subsection shall not be construed to cover any transaction where such beneficial owner was not such both at the time of the purchase and sale,or the sale and purchase,of the security,
b the exemptive provision,the court reasoned that two or more persons are not to be considered a group unless they pursued a common purpose in selling the issuer stock,see district court opinion,wl,at.in light of the language of d and rule b,and the purpose of b,we disagree with this interpretation.
as discussed in part.above,the stated purpose of b is preventing the unfair use of information which may have been obtained by an insider by reason of his relationship to the issuer,b.section b itself contains no provision as to who is an insider.the provisions delineating who is an insider by reason of size of stock ownership are a and d of the act and sec rules a and b.thus,a of the act deems insiders to include any person who is directly or indirectly the beneficial owner of more than percent of any class of the issuer stock.sec rule a provides that owners include any person who is deemed a beneficial owner of more than percent by reason of d of the act and the rules thereunder.and d and rule b provide that if any two or more persons act together for the purpose of acquiring,holding,or disposing of shares of an issuer,each actor is deemed to be the beneficial owner of the total number of shares owned by all of them.
the disgorgement provision of b simply dictates the consequences when an insider profits from transactions.however,because b was designed to prevent a corporate director or officer or the beneficial owner of more than per cent of a corporation from profiteering through securities transactions on the basis of inside information,at.internal quotation marks and footnote omitted,the exemptive provision was needed to be sure that a person who was an insider solely by reason of his beneficial ownership of more than percent of the issuer stock would be held strictly liable for profits only if he was an insider at the time of both his purchase and his sale or sale and repurchase.if he was not an insider at both of those times,there is no presumption that he was privy to inside information at both times.accordingly,the exemptive provision means that in a sequence,a beneficial owner must account for profits only if he was a beneficial owner of more than percent before the purchase,id.at.internal quotation marks omitted and it means that a sale made after a former beneficial owner of more than percent has already reduced his holdings to percent or below is exempted from b by the phrase at the time of sale,reliance electric emerson electric,d.the exemptive provision in b does not purport to define insider status it merely says that,for the disgorgement provision to apply,the trader must have insider status at the time of both of his transactions.
under d and rule b,which delineate the insider status of joint actors,if two or more persons act together for the purpose of acquiring,holding,or disposing of shares of an issuer,they are deemed a group,and each is deemed the beneficial owner of all the shares beneficially owned by all of the collaborators.because the statute and the rule list those purposes in the disjunctive,a group is formed as a matter of law if those persons act for any one of the listed purposes.
the district court thus erred in holding that for traders to constitute a group,the exchange act requires that their coordinated activity persist during the time of purchase and during the time of sale of the securities,district court opinion,wl,at emphasis in original.that ruling gave a conjunctive reading to provisions that are disjunctive.
in sum,and d and the rules thereunder mean that where,as alleged here,two persons acted together for the purpose of acquiring the stock of an issuer,and collectively those persons owned more than percent of that stock both before any transaction leading to a profit and at the time of the matching transaction,t
