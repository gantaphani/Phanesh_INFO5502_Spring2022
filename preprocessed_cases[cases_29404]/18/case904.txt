international,through certain of its current and former officers and directors,philip kives,lawrence kieves david weiner,corey fischer,and jeffrey koblick defendants and appellees,markets and distributes entertainment and consumer products,including music compilations.during the relevant time period,common stock was publicly traded on the nasdaq national market system nms.the appellants constitute a class of those who acquired common stock between may,and on november,the class.the class alleged that during the class period they suffered damages as a result of violations by of the provisions of federal securities laws.b.
on may,announced the financial results for the quarter ending march,which reported a decline in sales and income.on may,filed with the sec its form for the quarter ending march,the march,echoing the negative information previously disclosed.the march represented net tangible assets in excess of million.during the period from may,to june,share price dropped from to.
on october,after an extension of time requested by,the company filed form,an annual report filed with the sec,for fiscal year ending june.in the june,disclosed a shareholders equity of,thereby representing was below the million net tangible asset minimum requirement for continued listing on nasdaq.
on october,the national association of securities dealers the nasd notified that net tangible assets,based upon the june,had fallen below the million minimum level necessary for continued listing.made no public announcement at this time of either its receipt of the october,delisting letter or its request for a hearing and temporary extension of time to meet the net tangible asset requirement.however,on november and november,made public announcements regarding a partnership with playboy online for an online music store and another partnership arrangement with microsoft.
on november,filed its form for the quarter ending september,september.the september included information regarding negative financial results and also the receipt of the october,nasd letter.was not actually delisted as a result of the october,nasd letter.
a series of common stock transactions by individual defendants occurred during the class period.specifically,almost million shares of common stock were sold by four individual defendants between may,and june,from june,to november,there were only two other transactions by the individual defendants on november,koblick purchased shares through the exercise of stock options,and on november,the day after filing the september,fischer sold shares.the class alleged the individual defendants received over million from the sales of common stock during the class period.
in its amended complaint,the class alleged violations of section b of the exchange act and rule based upon the omission of material adverse information and the knowing or reckless dissemination of false statements count i violations by the individual defendants of section a of the exchange act based upon their alleged wrongful conduct count ii and violations by the individual defendants of section of the exchange act based upon their sales of common stock count iii.in counts ii and iii,the class raised claims against individual defendants kives,kieves,and koblick.on appeal the class does not challenge the district court dismissal of these two counts.
the class alleged that a continuous fraudulent scheme in combination with large stock trades by some of the individual defendants gave rise to the securities law violations in count i.as alleged,the scheme was characterized by two circumstances.first,the class alleged two accounting violations gleaned from sec filings.the class asserts knew in march of a million loss due to the poor performance of a subsidiary and was required by gaap to the assets of the subsidiary in its march filing,filed may.wrote down assets in that amount by march.additionally,the class alleged failed to disclose future losses of million related to the subsidiary,also in violation of gaap.the class alleged such overstating of assets in the march and the later june is a violation of gaap and is evidence of fraud and scienter because inclusion of the overstated assets concealed its inability to comply with the minimum necessary tangible net asset requirement for continued listing on the nms.
second,the class alleged failure to disclose publicly the october,nasd letter is evidence of fraudulent intent.the class alleged failure to disclose the letter in the period after it was received was a material omission because during the period was involved in press releases extolling the company business including,inter alia,new partnerships with playboy online and microsoft.
the district court granted motion to dismiss all claims pursuant to rules b and b of the federal rules of civil procedure,and b,finding the amended complaint failed to allege with sufficient particularity either material misrepresentations or facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter.further,the district court denied leave to amend the complaint again and entered judgment for and the individual defendants.

as our court recently said allegations of gaap violations are insufficient,standing alone,to raise an inference of scienter.only where these allegations are coupled with evidence of corresponding fraudulent intent might they be sufficient.in re navarre,wl,slip op.at internal citation omitted see also dsam global value fund altris software,cir city of philadelphia fleming,cir only where such allegations gaap violations or accounting irregularities are coupled with evidence that the violations or irregularities were the result of the defendant fraudulent intent to mislead investors may they be sufficient to state a claim.ziemba cascade int l,cir citing cases allegations of violations of gaap,standing alone,do not satisfy the particularity requirement of rule b.under the reform act,the circumstances of the fraud must be stated with particularity,including such matters as the time,place and contents of false representations,as well as,the identity of the person and what was obtained or given up thereby this means the who,what,when,where,and how.parnes gateway,cir.conclusory allegations do not satisfy the pleading requirements of the reform act.id.at in re.sec,cir.
in this case,the class alleged violations of financial accounting standard fas and financial accounting standard fas.generally,the class alleged violated fas and fas when it filed the march,on may,by representing its net tangible assets were in excess of million.the march,signed by individuals kives,weiner,and fischer,stated in relevant part 
in,the company formed an sic and subsidiary,which performed media buying services for third parties and also marketed products through infomercials produced by third parties.as of march,sic,due to accumulated losses to date of the company has curtailed most of these media buying operations and will now focus on its existing primary distribution and direct response marketing,and its newly launched internet retailing business.
similarly,the class alleged continued the fraudulent scheme through the june filed on october.the june made an almost identical statement as did the march but included the accumulated losses through june,in the amount of million.the june represented net tangible assets below million and was signed by all of the individual defendants.
counters by arguing the class is only alleging fraud by hindsight in relying on later amounts in order to argue the should have been made earlier.specifically,points to the complaint which alleged was charged to earnings during the quarter ended september,and was charged to earnings during the period ended march.these two amounts equal,the amount the class alleged was the subsidiary loss known to in march.
additionally,the complaint alleged million in future losses would be incurred due to this subsidiary contracts however,the class fails to specify how it arrived at this figure.the figure does not include million of additional accumulated losses difference between the march and the june which the class breaks into and million increments,alleging at least the million amount should have been disclosed in the march as it was incurred by may.
w e can not countenance pleading fraud by hindsight green tree,at.mere allegations that statements in one report should have been made in earlier reports do not make out a claim of securities fraud.acito imcera group,cir.corporate officials need not be clairvoyant they are only responsible for revealing those material facts reasonably available to them.novak kasaks,cir see also in re navarre,wl,slip op.at acito,at.under the reform act the complaint must allege facts or further particularities that,if true,demonstrate that the defendants had access to,or knowledge of,information contradicting their public statements when they were made.in re navarre,wl,slip op.at.
what makes many securities fraud cases more complicated is that often there is no reason to assume that what is true at the moment plaintiff discovers it was also true at the moment of the alleged misrepresentation,and that therefore simply because the alleged misrepresentation conflicts with the current state of facts,the charged statement must have been false a plaintiff must set forth,as part of the circumstances constituting fraud,an explanation as to why the disputed statement was untrue or misleading when made.

fas relates to the accounting for the impairment and disposal of assets and certain identifiable intangibles.specifically,fas 
r equires that assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.in performing the review for recoverability,the entity should estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition.if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset,an impairment loss is recognized.otherwise,an impairment loss is not recognized.
fas,summary available at http.
the class alleged the asset subject to fas review is the infomercial subsidiary.no review for the impairment of this asset was reflected in the march.the class alleged was required by fas to perform the review because a change in the curtailing of operations and stated the recoverability of the carrying amount of the subsidiary assets should have been assessed for impairment.the class further alleged an assessment would have revealed obligation pursuant to fas to the cost of infomercials and other media items purchased by the subsidiary.later charged to earnings for the quarter ending september,and during the period ending march.
argues the complaint contains no particularized allegation supporting the figure or the asset or assets subject to fas assessment.further,contends the class has failed to allege facts implicating a violation of fas.concludes the class failed to allege facts showing fas had been triggered and violated.
although a change in circumstances occurred by the curtailing of operations,which may implicate fas,the complaint failed to allege particular assets subject to fas assessment.if,however,the assets intended by the class include the subsidiary itself or unspecified infomercials and other media items,we are unconvinced fas is implicated.
the district court found,and we agree,assets include items such as land,buildings,equipment and furniture.in re,at listing accounting sources.identifiable intangibles include items such as patents,franchises,and trademarks.id.the assets alleged by the class are not assets or identifiable intangibles.therefore,as a matter of law,the class has failed to allege facts triggering fas.
rather than argue the district court erred as a matter of law,and submit contrary accounting sources,the class states,untenably,the district court made its determination as a factual finding.while the allegations contained in the complaint may withstand standard notice pleading,such allegations were not pled with particularity as required by the reform act in terms of alleging a basis for implicating fas and further specifying the assets,the carrying amount and the impairment of such assets.see greebel ftp software,cir plaintiffs presented invoices,purchase orders,and other documentation to substantiate their contentions.
furthermore,the class has failed to allege any basis or source for why should have been written off in march pursuant to fas,rather than in september and march pursuant to other accounting rules.accordingly,the class allegations related to fas fail for lack of particularity.
fas establishes standards of financial accounting and reporting for loss contingencies.fas 
r equires accrual by a charge to income and disclosure for an estimated loss from a loss contingency if two conditions are met 
a information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements,and 
b the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.
fas,summary available at http.
the class alleged fas required to make a million charge to income and disclose the subsidiary future obligations and likely losses.the class alleged that the subsidiary 
was obligated to perform under one or more contracts which were likely to result in additional future losses of approximately million over and above those which had already been reported during the twelve month period ended march,and 
had already sustained no less than million in additional losses over and above the accumulated losses of which had been reported as of the may,date of filing of the march,form,and would suffer an additional million in losses by june.
again,the class fails to provide any basis for the allegations or sources for the amounts,other than later financial disclosure made by.the class fails to specify any contracts or circumstances that knew at the time of the march or june would result in the specified losses.merely stating a particular dollar amount without a corresponding source or basis is insufficient under the reform act.see parnes,at.the complaint does not explain what specific information was available and how any loss could be reasonably estimated for the march or the june.accordingly,the class allegations related to fas also fail for lack of particularity.
scienter is not explicitly required by the statutory text of the exchange act,but it is an acknowledged essential element of a section b and rule claim.see ernst ernst hochfelder,d green tree,at alpern,at.w e view the investors amended complaint to determine whether they set forth facts that give a strong reason to believe that there was reckless or intentional wrongdoing.in re navarre,wl,slip op.at.
traditionally,there are three methods of establishing scienter.first,scienter may be established from facts demonstrating a mental state embracing intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud.hochfelder,at.alpern,at helwig,at.second,while allegations of negligent conduct are not sufficient,hochfelder,at,conduct which rises to the level of severe recklessness may be sufficient to meet the scienter requirement.k s continental bank,cir.such sufficient conduct is limited to highly unreasonable omissions or misrepresentations involving an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care,and present ing a danger of misleading buyers or sellers which is either known to the defendant or is so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it.id.citing woods barnett bank of fort lauderdale,cir.
recently,we determined the effect of the third method of establishing a strong inference of scienter,allegations of motive and opportunity.m otive and opportunity are generally relevant,but particularly important to establishing scienter is a showing of unusual or heightened motive to meet the reform act standard.green tree,at.additionally,the facts giving rise to motive and opportunity may also support a reason to believe the defendant misrepresentation was knowing or reckless.id.finally,without a showing of motive or opportunity other allegations tending to show scienter would have to be particularly strong in order to meet the reform act standard.see also in re navarre,wl,slip op.at.
generally,the issue of whether a particular intent existed is a question of fact for the jury.press chemical inv.servs,cir.since conclusory allegations do not satisfy the pleading requirements of rule b,the complaint must provide a factual basis for allegations of scienter.in re.sec,at see parnes,at.additionally,unsupported allegations with regard to motives generally possessed by all corporate directors and officers are insufficient as a matter of law.see kalnit eichler,cir green tree,at finding a desire universally held among corporations and their executives does not contribute significantly to an inference of scienter.the plaintiffs must assert concrete and personal benefit to the individual defendants resulting from the fraud.kalnit,at.
the second circuit has found insufficient motives to include the desire for the corporation to appear profitable and the desire to keep stock prices high to increase officer compensation.id.however,alleging the defendants misrepresented corporate performance in order to keep stock prices inflated while selling stock is sufficient.novak,at.in contrast,evidence that the individual defendants abstained from trading may undercut allegations of motive.acito,at see green tree,at noting same,but finding no allegations of insider trading.
we agree with the second circuit.more specifically,we have found where an individual defendant will benefit to an unusual degree,based upon the magnitude of a compensation package tied to earnings and the timing of an overstatement of earnings,motive is sufficiently pled.green tree,at.however,the general desire to maintain a high credit rating or make a company appear attractive to potential buyers may be too thin a reed on which to hang an inference of scienter.id.at.
accounting violations.
as discussed above,allegations of gaap violations,alone,are insufficient to state a claim for securities fraud.in re navarre,wl,slip op.at.the class alleged knew or was reckless in not knowing prior to filing the march that a subsidiary or its assets had been impaired and that was required by fas to the assets in the amount of.the class claimed such knowledge was evident in stated intention to curtail subsidiary activities.it contended the was not timely completed with the purpose of inflating stock prices until after the delisting issue was resolved and the individual defendants had completed millions of dollars in insider trading.further,the class alleged the failure to the impaired assets resulted in an overstating of assets,net worth and earnings.finally,the class claimed the march was materially false and misleading when it stated the subsidiary operations had been curtailed because the subsidiary had contract obligations which would result in additional losses of million about which fas required disclosure in may.
the class alleged knowing overstatement of assets in violation of gaap evinces fraudulent intent.it claimed asset base was deteriorating due to the losses sustained,and expected to sustain,by the subsidiary.the class contended deferred gaap imposed in order to artificially maintain an asset base of over million,nasdaq minimum net asset value requirement for listing.the deferral allegedly facilitated the sale of stocks by four of the individual defendants prior to public disclosure of the possibility of delisting.the class further alleged the individual defendants,as executives of the company,by at least may,knew of the facts surrounding the improper accounting conduct.specifically,the class concluded stated its intentions to curtail the activities of the subsidiary,thereby acknowledging the impaired nature of the assets.finally,the class alleged the sheer magnitude of the gaap violations exhibit scienter.
the class alleged multiple motives for the individual defendants including a inflating the price of common stock,b avoiding or delaying nasdaq delisting,c deferring adverse effects of nasdaq delisting,d increasing compensation directly tied to stock price,and e protecting employment with.the motive allegations are insufficient to support scienter.we will address them in reverse order.
as stated above,general allegations of a desire to increase stock prices,increase officer compensation or maintain continued employment are too generalized and are insufficient.see kalnit,at.while such allegations may be sufficient if the benefit to an individual defendant is unusual,green tree,at,no such allegations were pled in this case.the class failed to allege how or to what extent the defendants compensation or continued employment was tied to stock price or to what degree,if any,the defendants benefitted.
the motive allegations related to delisting are insufficiently pled to support a finding of a strong inference of fraudulent intent.even assuming gaap violations occurred,the class has alleged no facts to support the inference that the individual defendants violated gaap in the march or the june,reports to avoid delisting.the class allegation assumes the defendants knew they would be receiving a delisting letter and would,in fact,be delisted.the record shows was not delisted,even though the june represented the company was below nasdaq requirements for continued listing and the nasd delisting letter was sent october.further,an intent to curtail certain activities based on past losses does not,by itself,raise a red flag that nearly million in assets need be immediately written off.the class has failed to allege facts demonstrating had the intent to defraud.
the class contends massive insider trading is evidence of the defendants motive to commit fraud through inflating stock price.u nusual insider trading activity during the class period may permit an inference of bad faith and scienter.acito,at.here,however,the class alleged only conclusory statements that the insider sales were unusual or suspicious.such conclusory and speculative allegations are insufficient.see in re comshare,sec,cir.the class failed to allege the prior history of sales for the defendants or even the number of shares held by each.see greebel,at holding plaintiffs failure to provide information regarding sales made by insiders at times outside the class period permitted no possibility of comparison.therefore,the class failed to allege facts to show the trading activity was unusual or how it was unusual.
additionally,taking each defendant individually decreases any inference of scienter.kieves,company president in october and previously on the board of directors,sold no shares of common stock during the class period.kieves conduct actually undercuts the class argument.see acito,at.
weiner sold shares between may,and may,for approximately million.weiner conduct should not materially impact the scienter analysis because he resigned as company president in august.see greebel,at it is not unusual for individuals leaving a company,like defendant,to sell shares.
the complaint alleged the remaining defendants sold shares between may,and june,during a period when the stock price experienced a steady decline from approximately to.specifically,kives,who owned of common stock,sold shares between may,and june,for over million fischer sold shares on may,for approximately and koblick sold shares on may,for approximately million.as alleged in the complaint,on may,announced the financial results for the quarter ending march,which included a decline in sales and income.on may,filed its march,echoing the negative information previously disclosed.selling after delivering news that causes a company stock price to go down is not suggestive of withholding information.greebel,at finding no sales were made before a big event was made known to the public,and sales were made after negative information was disclosed and before positive information was disclosed see nathenson zonagen,cir decrease in stock price after allegedly misleading disclosure precluded action under theory.therefore,similar to the greebel court,we find,a lthough the total sum involved was large,the plaintiffs produced no evidence that the trading was out of the ordinary or suspicious.greebel,at.
if we were to conclude the trading provides circumstantial evidence of scienter,the claim would still fail because the trading did not coincide with false or misleading statements,which is required to survive dismissal.see in re navarre,wl,slip op.at.accordingly,it is not possible to draw a strong inference of scienter based on a the alleged accounting violations or b the alleged improper trading.
october delisting letter.
the class alleged failure to disclose the october,delisting letter when received,or at least contemporaneous with other public announcements,is evidence of a strong inference of fraudulent intent because the failure created a material omission.
we agree with the district court that the class failed to show a strong inference of scienter.we will assess this claim only with regard to the delisting letter allegations,namely,whether they meet the materiality requirement for securities fraud.see alpern,at generally,the issue of whether a public statement is misleading is a mixed question of law and fact for the jury.silver h r block,cir.the issue is appropriately decided as a matter of law,however,when reasonable minds could not differ.in other words,if no reasonable investor could conclude public statements,taken together and in context,were misleading,then the issue is appropriately resolved as a matter of law.id.citation omitted see press,at.accordingly,a complaint that alleges only immaterial misrepresentations presents an insuperable bar to relief and dismissal of such a complaint is proper.parnes,at quoting fusco xerox,cir.
a fact is material if it is substantially likely that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.basic levinson,d citation omitted adopting the standard of materiality from tsc,northway,d,for section b and rule claims see parnes,at.material information is that which would have assumed actual significance in the deliberations of the reasonable shareholder.tsc,at.see press,at.this determination requires delicate assessments of the inferences a reasonable shareholder would draw from a given set of facts and the significance of those inferences to him.tsc,at.in contrast,a fact is immaterial w here a reasonable investor could not have been swayed by the misrepresentation.parnes,at.immaterial statements include vague,soft,puffing statements or obvious hyperbole.id.at finding a prediction of significant growth is immaterial.
argues its failure to disclose the delisting letter prior to november,can not be considered as part of a showing of scienter because it did not have a duty to disclose the delisting letter.the parties agree that a duty to disclose the letter arises only when a regulation,statute or rule requires disclosure disclosure is required to prevent a voluntary statement from being misleading or the defendants are engaging in insider trading.see backman polaroid,cir en banc.in this case the parties agree had no duty to disclose pursuant to regulation,statute or rule 
materiality alone is not sufficient to place a company under a duty of disclosure.in re sofamor danek group,cir.in fact,s ilence,absent a duty to disclose,is not misleading under rule.basic,at.a duty arises,however,if there have been inaccurate,incomplete or misleading disclosures.sailors northern states power,cir.therefore,even absent a duty to speak,a party who discloses material facts in connection with securities transactions assume s a duty to speak fully and truthfully on those subjects.helwig,at internal quotations and citation omitted.however,the requirement is not to dump all known information with every public announcement,but the law requires an actor to provide complete and information with respect to the subjects on which he undertakes to speak.id.internal quotations and citation omitted emphasis added.in this case,the class argues four public statements made by rendered misleading the omission of a public disclosure regarding the delisting letter.
the first public statement made by was on november.vice president of corporate development stated,with regard to the new partnership agreement with playboy online we expect the music store to compete with leading online music services such as cdnow,and.
the defendant lawrence kieves made two statements on november.kieves announced,with regard to the partnership with microsoft microsoft extensive online outreach to the consumer is in a league of its own and will further enhance the express brand name across the internet.additionally,kieves appeared on cnbc stating we looking at several options now,we looking at several strategic opportunities for our company that would be very premature to announce right now,including most traditional financing options a secondary offering,perhaps partnering up with somebody in a strategic venture with regard to our sales.
finally,on november,after the close of the market,but prior to filing the september,reported its financial results for the quarter ending september,by press release.the class alleged only that the november press release did not include information about the october,delisting letter,nor did it include enough information to determine whether was in compliance with the listing requirements.the class does allege,however,common stock closed down per share the next day.
the first two statements,relating to playboy online and microsoft were not rendered misleading based upon failure to disclose the receipt of the delisting letter.while the fact had received the delisting letter may have been material,no duty to disclose was triggered by the partnering statements.the delisting letter was unrelated to the subject matter of the statements.
third statement,made by kieves on cnbc,is so vague,cautionary and such obvious puffing that no reasonable investor would have relied on it.see parnes,at.specifically,kieves stated it would be very premature to announce anything more,a cautionary note rendering the statement immaterial as a matter of law.see id.at.furthermore,kieves seemed to describe tentatively the strategic partnerships which had already been announced by saying,perhaps partnering up with somebody in a strategic venture with regard to our sales.such statements are not specific enough to perpetuate fraud on the market.see id.at.furthermore,the statement does not implicate the delisting letter,nor was the immaterial statement made misleading without disclosure of the letter.
the financial results publicly disclosed on november,may have been rendered misleading by failure also to include notice of the delisting letter.at the very least,such would be a jury question.see silver,at.the subject matter is closely linked and underlying assumptions were at least colored by the letter.this determination does not end the discussion,however.
the class argued the individual defendants,by reason of the material omission,were obligated to either disclose the letter or abstain from trading.in fact,the defendants did abstain from trading until the letter had been disclosed with the filing of the september on november,just four days after the november,public disclosure of financial results.the complaint alleged no individual defendants sold shares between june,and november,and no other significant event or harm allegedly occurred within the four days between november and.
accordingly,we find,as a matter of law,failure to disclose the delisting letter prior to november,does not give rise to a strong inference of scienter.
motion to amend 
finally,the class contends the district court abused its discretion in denying the class leave to replead its complaint for a third time.we find no merit in this argument.
under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,leave to amend should be granted freely when justice so requires.a.however,futility constitutes a valid reason for denial of a motion to amend.knapp hanson,cir.generally,we review the denial of a motion to amend for abuse of discretion.id.however,our review of the denial of leave to amend based upon futility is de novo where such denial is based upon the failure of the amended complaint to state a claim.see united states ex rel.gaudineer comito,iowa,cir.
in the present case,in denying the class leave to amend,the district court stated the class had failed,with nine months elapsing between the filing of the complaint and the amended complaint,to plead facts with sufficient particularity to raise a strong inference of scienter.further,the district court,after a hearing on the matter,found insufficient evidence that the class could cure the amended complaint.during the hearing,the class told the court it had already alleged what it knew and admitted it could not plead certain claims with any greater precision.
the class provides no further support for this court on appeal to explain how it would amend the complaint to add particularity.see brandt davis,cir finding no abuse of discretion where party failed to explain how he would amend the complaint to save the claim wisdom first midwest bank,of poplar bluff,cir parties should not be allowed to amend their complaint without showing how the complaint could be amended to save the meritless claim.
under the circumstances presented,we find the abuse of discretion standard is applicable because rather than find a specific allegation futile as a matter of law,the district court found it futile to amend where no actual amendments were possible.therefore,we find the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying leave to amend the complaint.we would also affirm the denial of the motion to amend under the de novo standard.
iii.conclusion 
congress has obviously raised the pleading bar for securities fraud complaints.president william clinton vetoed the reform act on december,because he disagreed with the intent of the conference committee in erect ing a higher barrier to bringing suit than any now so high that even the most aggrieved investors with the most painful losses may get tossed out of court before they have a chance to prove their case.cong.rec.daily ed,veto message of president clinton.with the president message in hand,congress overrode the veto.

i respectfully dissent.the primary goals of the federal securities laws are to protect investors and to promote full disclosure of relevant information,ernst ernst hochfelder,d,and there was no indication in the reform act that its purpose was to undercut those goals or to protect violators from meritorious claims.although pleading standards for securities fraud cases have been strengthened by the reform act,it does not require that a case be proven in the complaint or prevent a case from going forward to discovery when there are allegations that corporate insiders had enhanced motive and opportunity to commit fraud and knew facts suggesting that their public statements were materially inaccurate.florida state bd.of admin.green tree fin,cir.
many relevant facts in securities cases may not be discoverable at the pleading stage because they are known only by key insiders.see in re navarre.sec,wl,slip op.at cir.this can be especially true if the alleged fraud concerns a special purpose business entity which does not appear on the corporate balance sheet as here.whether or not appellants can ultimately prove their allegations,or even withstand an eventual summary judgment motion,is not at issue at this stage.the allegations in this case,especially those relating to the nature and timing of both the disclosure of corporate information and the insider trading,meet the new pleading standards and are sufficient to withstand a rule b motion.
the allegations in the amended complaint set out significant facts related to and its failed subsidiary.the sequence of alleged events in relation to each other and to the actions of appellees is of critical importance in determining whether the allegations are sufficient.for that reason it is necessary to recount the allegations here in considerable detail.
during the price of shares ranged from to,and formed a media buying and infomercial marketing subsidiary.the subsidiary accumulated significant losses by march,and appellees curtailed its operations at some point during.before any negative information about the subsidiary was reported,appellees announced in april,that they would undertake a promising online venture and a stock split.share price rose more than tenfold on the strength of these announcements,from on april,to on may.
publicly traded companies like must file quarterly reports with the securities and exchange commission sec for each of the first three quarters of a fiscal year,and the reports are due within days of the end of a quarter.for the quarter ending march,reported operating losses in a press release on may and in a form filing on may.the may filing was the first of at least four consecutive sec filings that reported quarterly operating losses.these losses were primarily due to the subsidiary,and net tangible assets eventually declined below the minimum requirement for continued listing on nasdaq.the filing on may,was form for the quarter which ended march.it was signed by appellees kives,weiner,and fischer,and it reported pre tax losses of for the quarter,compared to pre tax gains of in the same period of the previous year.it also reported that the subsidiary had accumulated losses of and that most of its operations had been curtailed.
the amended complaint alleges that appellees knew at the time of the may filing,or were reckless in not knowing,that the subsidiary had already sustained losses of and that it was obligated to perform under contracts which would likely result in future losses of approximately million.appellants allege that the balance sheet contained in the filing overstated company earnings because it did not show actual or foreseeable losses.it is further alleged that these nondisclosures on the balance sheet allegedly enabled appellees to report net tangible assets of and therefore to maintain the listing of shares on the nasdaq stock market.a company must have at least in net tangible assets in order to remain listed,and delisting would have seriously impaired the liquidity and value of stock.on the day that appellees filed the march,stock closed at per share.
in the month following the may filing,which reported net tangible assets of approximately million,four of the five corporate insider defendants named in the complaint sold very large blocks of stock.their sales amounted to approximately of all outstanding stock of shares,and they reaped proceeds of over million.kives,chief executive officer and chairman of its board of directors,sold shares for.weiner,president of until his resignation in august,sold shares for.fischer,chief financial officer,sold shares for.koblick,an executive vice president and director,sold shares for.kieves,the only individual appellee who did not sell stock during the may period,was a member of board of directors at that time and became a manager only when he was appointed president in october.
from the allegations relating to the number of shares owned by the individual appellees and documents underlying the pleadings,percentages may be calculated about their transactions.kives sold approximately of his entire holdings during this period at share prices ranging from to the other individual appellees sold at least of their aggregate holdings at share prices ranging from to.the daily closing price of shares dropped from to during this period of insider trading.
the sec requires publicly traded companies to file annual reports within days of the end of a fiscal year,and filed its annual report for the fiscal year ending june,on october,the october filing was signed by kives,fischer,koblick,and kieves,and it was audited by the accounting firm of arthur andersen,llp.it reported a net operating loss of for fiscal year,as opposed to a gain of for fiscal year.the annual report attributed negative cash flow primarily to losses of the defunct media buying subsidiary and stated as of june,due to accumulated losses of,the company had curtailed most of these media buying operations.the october filing also pegged net tangible assets at,an amount below nasdaq minimum requirement for continued listing.shares closed at after the filing.
key allegations in the amended complaint state that in april appellees announced a new venture and a stock split that increased the value of stock tenfold,and then sold off their own stock for millions of dollars in may and june.this was at a time that,according to statements by appellees,the subsidiary operations had been curtailed although it was continuing to run up losses.when appellees began to sell their stock immediately after they disclosed poor quarterly results on may,the accumulated losses and impaired assets of the subsidiary had not been accrued on balance sheet.fiscal year results were released in october that revealed large operating losses and net tangible assets insufficient to remain listed on the nasdaq market.the pleadings,and reasonable inferences from them,thus allege a sequence in which insiders touted favorable information about the company,sold shares of their own,and only later revealed the true financial condition of.
a similar pattern is alleged for the fall of,but with less insider trading.in november appellees publicly announced a strategic partnership with playboy online and an agreement to include online music store on the microsoft network shopping channel more significantly,kieves is alleged to have appeared on cnbc on november,when he stated that was looking at several strategic opportunities including most traditional financing options including a secondary offering these announcements drove share price up from to.appellees issued a press release thereafter,on november,which projected losses for the quarter ending september,share price slid to on november,
during the week of october,received a letter from nasdaq threatening to delist its shares,but appellees did not announce or disclose it until after business hours on november when they filed form for the quarter ending september,the november filing was signed by appellees kives,kieves,and fischer.it disclosed that t he company has been notified by the nasdaq stock market that the company failed to meet the minimum tangible net asset requirement necessary for continued listing on the nasdaq national market and that t here is no assurance that the company will be successful in its attempt to remain listed the same report also showed net tangible assets of and quarterly operating losses of.for the first time,the november filing recognized an operating loss of which had been incurred by the subsidiary for of certain infomercials and remaining deferred media assets because management determined such assets were not realizable.appellants allege that another operating loss of due to the subsidiary was later recognized in for the quarter ending march.
the major news services reported receipt of the delisting letter at approximately on november.stock price immediately dropped and was down by the end of the day,at per share.fischer sold shares for on the same day his sales occurred at prices approximately midway between the daily high and the stock closing price for the day the exact time of the sales is not alleged and presumably unknown by appellants,but a possible inference is that the sell order could have been given before the disclosure even if the transaction occurred later.
the amended complaint alleges that appellees knew that the subsidiary assets were impaired and that its losses were certain,but that recognizing those losses on balance sheet would have lowered the company stock price and threatened its continued listing on nasdaq.appellees allegedly delayed recognition of these losses,in violation of generally accepted accounting practices gaap,and delayed disclosure of the nasdaq delisting letter while publicly touting a new partnership and a new online venture.it is alleged that the strategic nondisclosures kept stock price artificially high while the individual appellees sold millions of shares in violation of b of the securities exchange act,b,and related rule,underlying the allegations in the amended complaint are four of sec filings,four company press releases from the period in question,and a graph of stock performance in calendar year.see porous media pall,cir court may take notice of public documents in reviewing dismissal on pleadings.
in reviewing de novo a dismissal under rule b,we must assume all factual allegations in the complaint are true,and the plaintiff is entitled to all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the allegations of the complaint.florida state bd.of,at.as to scienter,however,the sum of the reasonable inferences must be strong in order to proceed to discovery.id.a complaint should only be dismissed for failure to state a claim if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.parnes gateway,cir,quoting fusco xerox,cir.
to state a violation of b or rule a plaintiff must allege a false statement or omission of material fact occurring in connection with the purchase or sale of a security scienter reliance and damages.alpern utilicorp united,cir.an omission occurs upon a breach of a duty to disclose,which arises if a statute or regulation requires it,if it is necessary to prevent a voluntary statement from being misleading,or if corporate insiders trade on confidential information.see roeder alpha,cir.the parties do not dispute that the misrepresentations alleged in this case would be material if proven.the questions on appeal are whether the pleadings sufficiently allege that appellees made false statements or omissions and whether they acted with scienter.
each element of fraud must be pled with particularity.see.b all elements of fraud except scienter must be pleaded with particularity b in securities fraud action,scienter must be pled with particularity.nevertheless,our court has recently recognized that investors need not plead precise details where the subject matter of the fraud is uniquely within the defendants knowledge or control.in re navarre,wl,at.in respect to the element of scienter,a plaintiff must plead facts giving rise to a strong inference,b,that the defendant acted intentionally or recklessly.van dyke coburn enterprises,cir.
the amended complaint alleges that kives,weiner,and fischer signed march on may,and that the filing was false and misleading because the balance sheet contained in it failed to recognize the subsidiary losses and the impairment of its assets in violation of statements of financial accounting standards sfas and.the amended complaint thus identifies who made the alleged announcement,where it was made,what it entailed,and when it was made.in re navarre,wl,at.the issue on appeal is whether the amended complaint is deficient because it did not adequately plead why it was false when made.id.
the may filing,signed by three appellees,states that the subsidiary had already incurred operating losses of by march,and the october filing,signed by four appellees,shows that the subsidiary incurred an additional in operating losses between march and june.while the may filing claimed that the subsidiary operations had been curtailed as of march,the october filing stated that they were not concluded until june.the pleadings allege that appellees knew as of may that the subsidiary closure was imminent,that its losses and the impairment of its assets either had occurred or were reasonably certain to occur,and that appellees failure to recognize any portion of these losses in the march balance sheet was misleading and in violation of gaap.
the accounting standards are designed to give a realistic picture of a company financial condition.robert kay gerald searfoss,handbook of accounting and auditing,ch,at ed.sfas requires that assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.accounting for the impairment of assets and for assets to be disposed of,statement of financial accounting standards,summary financial accounting standards bd.sfas requires that a corporation disclose a loss contingency when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred.accounting for contingencies,statement of financial accounting standards,financial accounting standards bd.an estimated loss from a loss contingency shall be accrued by a charge to income if two conditions are met available information suggests that an asset has been impaired and it is probable that future events will confirm the loss,and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.id.at.these standards seek to bring relevant information to the market at the earliest opportunity.
the amended complaint alleges that by the time the march was filed on may,losses incurred by subsidiary had triggered a duty under sfas for the company to conduct an impairment review of its long term assets and identifiable intangibles and a duty under sfas to disclose an estimated loss from a loss contingency on the company balance sheet.it is also alleged that had not curtailed most of its media buying operations as it later claimed in sec filings,but that in fact continued to be obligated to perform under one or more contracts which were likely to result in additional future losses of approximately million.the district court believed that the allegations were not pled with sufficient particularity because they did not include the terms of the alleged contracts and did not specify that the subsidiary or any of its property was a asset or an identifiable intangible,that the sum of any future cash flows was less than the asset carrying amount,or that future losses from the asset were inevitable.
the accounting standards are not bright line rules,and application of them requires judgment calls.see shalala guernsey mem l,d,citing kay searfoss,ch,at.the nature of accounting makes it unreasonable to expect securities fraud plaintiffs to plead gaap violations with the most exacting particularity,especially where the subject matter of the fraud is uniquely within the defendants knowledge or control.in re navarre,wl,at.the allegations here concern operations of and accounting for an off balance sheet corporate entity so only insiders would normally have access to the relevant information.a subsidiary engaged in media buying and infomercial marketing might be presumed to own identifiable intangible assets such as copyrights,licenses,or record masters,see kay searfoss,ch,at,as well as long term assets such as equipment,see,ch,at.the allegation that the subsidiary was obligated to perform under unprofitable contracts should be considered together with other allegations relating to the losses reported after the subsidiary operations were shut down.it is not an unreasonable inference that losses occurring after closure resulted from preexisting obligations,and reasonable inferences arising from the amended complaint must be regarded as true at this stage of the case.florida state bd.of,at.
a securities fraud complaint need not allege gaap violations to establish that a material misstatement occurred in a company financial statement.the accounting standards and the requirements of rule are not perfectly coextensive.malone microdyne,cir.compliance with gaap does not provide immunity from liability,id.at,and accountants have been held criminally liable for certifying false or misleading financial statements even though they followed gaap.united states simon,cir.without discovery plaintiffs have not had access to detailed information about business units,their assets,or their operations,and it is not necessary at this stage to plead accounting irregularities with greater specificity than was done by the plaintiffs here.see in re navarre,wl,at.the amended complaint alleges facts sufficient to show that publicly filed balance sheets potentially contained material misstatements or omissions under rule.
the amended pleadings in this case identified specific statements attributable to appellees that allegedly inflated earnings and net tangible assets by hiding specific losses that were also identified.appellants have not relied on generalized imputations of scienter based on the individual appellees positions within the corporation,in re advanta.sec,cir,nor is this a case where the pleadings repeatedly fail to show who made the alleged misstatement,when it was made,where it was made,what it entailed,and why it was false.in re navarre,wl,at.appellants here have alleged that each individual appellee signed at least one of sec filings which blamed the subsidiary for poor performance and yet failed to recognize its losses or the impairment of its assets on the balance sheet in violation of gaap.
the amended complaint also alleges that breached its duty to disclose the delisting letter,a duty which arose when appellees made november announcements touting the company.the majority claims that the delisting letter was unrelated to the subject matter of any of the november announcements,but a delisting directly impairs a publicly traded company ability to raise capital and is therefore highly relevant to any public statement concerning capitalization or financing.kieves allegedly appeared on cnbc on november,and discussed the company consideration of most traditional financing options including a secondary offering,and a finder of fact could conclude that kieves had a duty to disclose receipt of the delisting letter at that time.the majority states that failure to disclose the delisting letter in the november press release may have created a jury question,but it then reaches the puzzling conclusion that failure to disclose it before november is insufficient as a matter of law to permit the case to go forward.the nondisclosure of the delisting letter may not have impacted most of the insider sales,but it contributes to a reasonable inference that appellees acted deliberately to inflate share price artificially.
the reform act does not require that plaintiffs plead with particularity every single fact upon which their beliefs concerning false or misleading statements are based.rather,plaintiffs need only plead with particularity sufficient facts to support those beliefs.novak kasaks,cir emphasis in original.our court requires that investors must plead with particularity the who,what,when,where,and how of an alleged scheme,in re navarre,wl,at,and appellants here have met that burden.the amended complaint alleges facts from which it could be inferred that appellees knew,or had reason to know,that the balance sheet in may filing was false when made and that kieves november discussion of financing options was misleading at the time.
the new pleading standards require a securities fraud plaintiff to state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that a defendant acted with scienter,b.one important way to demonstrate a strong inference of scienter is to make a showing of heightened motive and opportunity to commit fraud.florida state bd.of,at.an unusually large executive compensation package is one indication of heightened motive and opportunity,id.at,and an unusual pattern of insider trading is another.id.at.see also in re scholastic.sec,cir rothman gregor,cir.i n the insider trading case,trading at a particular time is circumstantial evidence that the insider knew the best time to trade because he or she had inside information not shared by the public.this in turn is circumstantial evidence that he or she kept the information from the public in order to trade on the unfair advantage.florida state bd.of,at.whether a pattern of insider trading is unusual depends upon such factors as the timing of the sales,the percentage of stock holdings sold,the amount of profit derived from them,and the number of insiders selling.id.at.see also in re scholastic,at.
the amended complaint alleges sufficient facts to show the insider sales here to be suspicious in each of the ways identified by florida state bd.of admin.during the class period,four of five individual appellees are alleged to have sold between and of their holdings at a time when the alleged nondisclosures could have artificially inflated the share price so that sales proceeds amounted to more than million.kives sold of his holdings and received approximately million on his sales.his individual codefendants apparently sold at least of their aggregate holdings for approximately million.an inference may be drawn from the allegations that the motive for these sales was personal profit rather than any institutional need.
this is not a case where only a single insider benefitted,see,san leandro emergency med.group profit sharing plan philip morris,cir,or where a significant number of insiders have not benefitted at all.see in re advanta,at inference weakened when only four of seven individual defendants traded acito imcera group,cir inference undermined when only one of four individual defendants traded.kives may have benefitted the most,but the allegations on motive are not undercut by the fact that different appellees profited unequally from the alleged scheme.florida state bd.of,at.it is not suspicious for an insider to sell a relatively small percentage of his holdings,see ronconi larkin,cir not suspicious acito,at not suspicious rothman,at not suspicious,but when a larger percentage is sold the timing of the sales is critical to determine whether they contribute to a strong inference of scienter.
it is suspicious when insider sales occur at a time when alleged nondisclosures could have artificially inflated the stock price,see in re navarre,wl,at,and that is what is alleged here.the vast majority of the sales began when share price was approximately on may,a price nearly ten times higher than before appellees had made their announcements of a new online venture and stock split,and nearly equivalent to the stock high of which occurred on may.the sales occurred immediately after the alleged nondisclosures and at the beginning of a prolonged period of operating losses and diminishing net tangible assets.
this is not a case in which the timing of the sales undercuts the allegations of fraud,and the insider sales here did not occur before the a
