debtor excel innovations,excel applied for a preliminary injunction staying arbitration proceedings between two parties,indivos corporation indivos and former excel ceo ned hoffman hoffman.the bankruptcy court granted the injunction,finding a reasonable probability that the arbitration could conceivably affect the debtor and the bankruptcy estate.the bankruptcy appellate panel bap affirmed.the present appeal followed.
we hold that when a debtor applies for a a preliminary injunction to stay a proceeding in which the debtor is not a party,the bankruptcy court must balance the debtor likelihood of success in reorganization against the relative hardship of the parties,as well as consider the public interest if warranted.because the bankruptcy court misapprehended the operative legal standard,we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
background 
hoffman is the founder and a major shareholder of both indivos and excel.in,hoffman entered into a series of agreements settlement contracts with indivos.these included the settlement agreement and general release,the voting trust and standstill agreement,the pledge agreement,and the proprietary information and inventions agreement.one of the main purposes of these agreements was to separate hoffman from the management of indivos.excel,which was controlled by hoffman and separately owned indivos shares,was not a party to the settlement agreement or the pledge agreement.however,excel was a party to the voting trust and standstill agreement,which required hoffman and excel to place their indivos shares in a voting trust as collateral for their obligations under the settlement contracts.section a of the voting trust and standstill agreement,which applied to hoffman only,prohibited him from individually or with others,directly or indirectly,taking any action to control,disrupt,or unduly influence the management or policies of indivos.the parties agreed to submit any dispute arising from the settlement contracts to binding arbitration with the american arbitration association aaa.
in june,indivos initiated aaa arbitration proceedings against hoffman and excel.indivos alleged that hoffman and excel attempted to disrupt a merger between indivos and solidus networks,solidus by,inter alia,filing multiple shareholder derivative actions,initiating a proxy contest,and attempting to gain a seat on the indivos board.indivos also alleged that excel and hoffman filed a patent infringement action against indivos in the northern district of california in violation of the proprietary information and inventions agreement.indivos claimed that it,not excel,owned the patents at issue.indivos pled seven claims for relief,including breach of the settlement contracts,unfair business practices,and breach of fiduciary duty by hoffman.indivos also sought to hold excel liable as hoffman alter ego.
on may,the arbitrator granted partial summary judgment for indivos,finding hoffman liable for breach of contract because he filed lawsuits to disrupt the merger,urged shareholders to vote against the merger,and tried to get on the indivos board.the arbitrator found excel liable as hoffman alter ego for some of the lawsuits excel filed under hoffman direction,but denied summary judgment as to other lawsuits filed by excel.the arbitrator further denied summary judgment with respect to actions undertaken by two alleged surrogates of hoffman.the arbitrator postponed any determination of the parties patent rights,including whether their positions on patent ownership were taken in good faith,until resolution of the patent litigation in federal district court.the arbitrator also dismissed without prejudice indivos unfair business practices claim less than a week later,the arbitrator began hearings on the remaining claims and damages.
in late may,excel and hoffman suffered a significant setback in their patent infringement action against indivos.judge chesney of the northern district of california granted partial summary judgment for indivos,ruling that all of the patents excel accused indivos of infringing were actually owned by indivos.
in june,hoffman and excel filed bankruptcy petitions under chapter and chapter,respectively.the bankruptcy filings automatically stayed the arbitration against hoffman and excel,as well as the patent litigation.see a.at that point in the arbitration,indivos and solidus had concluded their affirmative case,hoffman and excel had presented a substantial part of their defense,and the parties were attempting to schedule additional hearing dates to finish the proceeding.hoffman bankruptcy petition was dismissed in september.in december,hoffman resigned as an officer and director of excel.
in february,indivos recommenced arbitration against hoffman,on the ground that the stay established by hoffman bankruptcy petition had been lifted.hoffman argued to the arbitrator that the stay established by excel bankruptcy petition applied to indivos claims against him because those claims were intertwined with indivos claims against excel.the arbitrator disagreed.the arbitrator stated that any claims that alleged direct or alter ego liability for excel remained subject to the stay,but claims involving only hoffman could proceed.the arbitrator did not schedule further evidentiary hearings and asked hoffman and indivos to submit closing briefs by july.
in july,excel initiated adversary proceedings in bankruptcy court against indivos,solidus,hoffman,aaa,and the arbitrator.excel sought declaratory and injunctive relief on the ground that the arbitration violated the automatic stay in excel bankruptcy case.according to excel,hoffman might argue that he acted as excel agent,leading to new liabilities for excel and the bankruptcy estate.on the same day,excel applied for a temporary restraining order tro to stop the arbitration.to reassure the court that the arbitration would not affect excel,indivos and solidus stipulated that the arbitration would have no preclusive effect on excel that damages against hoffman would not be offset against the indivos shares excel had pledged to the voting trust and that to avoid privilege issues,no further evidence would be presented in the arbitration proceeding.the bankruptcy court denied the tro on the basis of these representations.
hoffman then wrote to aaa to request changes to the briefing schedule so he could present additional evidence.the arbitrator agreed.hoffman immediately filed an ex parte application to reopen excel motion for a tro and preliminary injunction.counsel argued that,because the arbitrator now planned to take additional evidence,one of the bases for denying the agreement not to present additional no longer present.the bankruptcy court entered a tro.the court expressed concern that information subject to excel privilege could be revealed by hoffman in the arbitration proceeding.
in september,excel filed a motion for a preliminary injunction.the motion was supported by an affidavit from hoffman.he had served as excel ceo during the events that gave rise to indivos claims,but at this time was only a consultant for excel.in the affidavit,hoffman offered three reasons why permitting arbitration against him would adversely impact excel.first,he planned to demand indemnification from excel on the ground that he was acting as an officer and agent of excel when he challenged the merger.thus,arbitration could lead to new liabilities for excel.second,his defense would focus on his own interests and not those of excel.third,he would be compelled to reveal the substance of critical privileged communications between myself and attorneys for the debtor,because he acted in accordance with legal advice from attorneys for the debtor.he also intended to call excel employees as witnesses.
the bankruptcy court granted an injunction staying arbitration until confirmation of excel reorganization plan.the court stated that a a injunction is proper if arbitration could conceivably have any effect on the administration of the bankruptcy estate.the court decided that excel established a reasonable probability of possible negative impacts on the estate.moreover,the court found that excel motion also satisfied the traditional,test for a preliminary injunction,which balances the plaintiff likelihood of success on the merits against the relative hardship to the parties.see clear channel outdoor city of los angeles,cir.the bankruptcy court made no findings on plaintiff likelihood of success,but concluded that a stay would protect excel from possible injury while causing no harm to indivos and solidus.
indivos and solidus appealed to the bap,contending that the bankruptcy court applied the wrong legal standard to the motion for a preliminary injunction.the bap affirmed.the bap noted that the ninth circuit has not established a standard for a a motion to enjoin an action against a nondebtor.citing a series of fourth circuit opinions,the bap stated that a a injunction is appropriate when the debtor and interests are so intertwined that an action against the is in effect a claim against the debtor.see,robins piccinin,cir oberg aetna cas.sur.in re robins,cir.the bap concluded that to the extent that is recognized as authority for granting injunctive relief in matters that are related to the bankruptcy case,we hold that the bankruptcy court correctly asserted its a authority in enjoining appellants arbitration proceeding.alternatively,the bap found that excel had also satisfied the traditional standard for a preliminary injunction.the bap explained that excel had shown likelihood of success on the merits because the reorganization plan had a fair chance of success.the bap further noted that permitting arbitration to proceed would cause irreparable harm to excel.appellants filed a timely notice of appeal.
ii.jurisdiction 
although parties do not challenge our jurisdiction over this appeal,we have an independent obligation to inquire into the presence or absence of subject matter jurisdiction.moldo ash in re thomas,cir.under d,we have jurisdiction to hear appeals from final decisions of the bap.we look to the underlying bankruptcy court order reviewed by the bap to determine whether the bap decision is final.lievsay fin.sav.bank in re lievsay,cir.if the underlying bankruptcy court decision is interlocutory,the bap order affirming or reversing it is also interlocutory.id.
we hold that the injunction granted by the bankruptcy court constitutes an appealable final decision.the injunction is in effect an extension of the automatic stay,halting another proceeding to avoid disruption of the debtor reorganization.we have held that a decision granting or denying relief from a a automatic stay constitutes a final order for purposes of appellate jurisdiction.crocker bank am.mariner,in re am.mariner,cir,overruled on other grounds by united sav.ass timbers of inwood forest,d.we see no reason to treat the instant injunction differently.see gruntz county of los angeles in re gruntz,cir en banc the automatic stay is an injunction issuing from the authority of the bankruptcy court.moreover,although the parties and the bankruptcy court labeled the injunction preliminary,nothing in the record indicates that the bankruptcy court contemplated further proceedings on the injunction.see shugrue air line pilots ass n,int l in re ionosphere clubs,w here the bankruptcy court issues a preliminary injunction,but contemplates no further hearings on the merits of the injunction,apart from the outcome of the reorganization,the injunction is a final,appealable order.
iii.standard of review 
the decision of the bap is reviewed de novo.contractors state license bd.of cal.dunbar in re dunbar,cir.on appeal from the bap,this court independently reviews bankruptcy courts rulings.id.the injunction will be reversed only if the bankruptcy court abused its discretion by basing its decision on an incorrect legal standard or on clearly erroneous findings of fact.see see also ragsdale haller,cir.
iv.discussion 
preliminary injunction standard 
under a,a bankruptcy court may issue any order,process,or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title.section a gives the bankruptcy courts the power to stay actions that are not subject to the a automatic stay but threaten the integrity of a bankrupt estate.canter canter in re canter,cir citation and quotation marks omitted fin.miller mining,cir.the proper standard for granting a a preliminary injunction staying an action against a is an issue of first impression in our circuit.appellants argue that the bankruptcy court must apply the usual preliminary injunction standard.excel disagrees,and claims that the movant need not show irreparable harm,only that the injunction would conform to the objectives of the bankruptcy code.
in the context,we have consistently required trial courts deciding preliminary injunction motions to balance the moving party likelihood of success on the merits and the relative hardship of the parties.the moving party must show 
a strong likelihood of success on the merits,the possibility of irreparable injury to plaintiff if preliminary relief is not granted,a balance of hardships favoring the plaintiff,and advancement of the public interest in certain cases.alternatively,a court may grant the injunction if the plaintiff demonstrates either a combination of probable success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable injury or that serious questions are raised and the balance of hardships tips sharply in his favor.
as we have said many times regarding the two alternative formulations of the preliminary injunction test these two formulations represent two points on a sliding scale in which the required degree of irreparable harm increases as the probability of success decreases.they are not separate tests but rather outer reaches of a single continuum.
save our sonoran,flowers,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.we have applied this usual approach in reviewing a preliminary injunction issued by a bankruptcy court to prevent the debtor shareholder from dissipating assets claimed by the estate.rubin pringle in re focus media,cir.however,in a case involving stay of a suit against a bankruptcy trustee,we have also stated that our usual preliminary injunction standard does not apply to injunctions issued by the bankruptcy court pursuant,and that the court does not need to demonstrate an inadequate remedy at law or irreparable harm.beck fort james in re crown vantage,cir.
the majority of circuits that have reviewed injunctions staying actions against have applied the usual preliminary injunction standard.am.imaging servs,in re,cir piccinin,at cir commonwealth oil ref.epa in re commonwealth oil ref,cir.as the fifth circuit pointed out in commonwealth oil,the traditional approach is strongly supported by the legislative history of a.at.the relevant senate report explained that a grants bankruptcy courts all the traditional injunctive powers of a court of equity,at,as reprinted in.stays or injunctions issued under these other sections will not be automatic upon the commencement of the case,but will be granted or issued under the usual rules for the issuance of injunctions.id.emphasis added.the second,third,and eighth circuits have similarly applied the traditional standard with respect to stays that are not automatic under a.see nlrb superior forwarding,cir staying nlrb regulatory proceeding against debtor wedgewood inv.fund wedgewood realty group,in re wedgewood realty group,cir reimposing automatic stay manville equity sec.holders comm.in re,cir reversing stay of shareholder action seeking to compel debtor to hold an annual meeting.
the seventh circuit,in contrast,has expressly held that the moving party need not show irreparable harm.fisher apostolou,cir in re l s,cir the seventh circuit approach rests upon the notion that w hen the evidence shows that the defendants are engaged in the act or practices prohibited by a statute which provides for injunctive relief to prevent such violations,irreparable harm to the plaintiffs need not be shown.in re chicago,milwaukee,paul and pac,cir.that proposition has its roots in united states city and county of san francisco,in which the supreme court affirmed an injunction against a municipality for violating the terms of a federal land grant.ultimately,that decision turned on the court interpretation of congressional intent behind the land grant statute.
we hold that the usual preliminary injunction standard applies to stays of proceedings against under a.as the relevant house and senate reports indicate,congress intended that standard to apply to a preliminary injunctions,at,as reprinted in,at,as reprinted in.moreover,we have consistently held that the automatic stay does not apply to suits against.see chugach timber stevedoring handling in re chugach forest,cir summarizing cases.the usual standard helps to ensure that stays would not be granted lightly.
crown vantage does not compel a different result.there,defendants in an adversary action filed by the debtor trustee had sued the trustee in state court,alleging that the adversary action was barred by a prior settlement agreement between the defendants and the debtor.see crown vantage,at.citing the barton doctrine which prohibits suits against receivers in other fora without permission from the appointing court,the trustee successfully moved the bankruptcy court to enjoin the state court action.the district court vacated the injunction,finding that the trustee failed to show irreparable harm.id.at.we reversed,stating that t he only requirement for the issuance of an injunction under is that the remedy conform to the objectives of the bankruptcy code.id.at.as we explained,it makes no sense to require a showing of irreparable harm in the context of barton prohibition of unauthorized litigation against receivers.once such an action had been filed,t he only appropriate remedy is to order cessation of the improper action.id.at.in other words,irreparable harm need not be shown because the movant was certain to succeed on its claim of a barton violation.if the movant has a probability of success on the merits,the injunction should issue without regard to the balance of the hardships.sammartano first judicial dist.court,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.however,there is no general rule prohibiting suits against.see chugach forest,at.to obtain equitable relief,the party seeking the stay should be required to satisfy the usual preliminary injunction standard.
the parties also dispute what a bankruptcy court should consider with regard to the likelihood of success prong of the preliminary injunction standard.appellants contend that excel must show likelihood of success on its complaint in the adversary proceeding,specifically its claim that the arbitration violated the automatic stay under a.excel rejoins that it needed to show only likelihood of success in reorganization.
we hold that a debtor seeking to stay an action against a must show a reasonable likelihood of a successful reorganization.the inquiry for a preliminary injunction necessarily focuses on the outcome of a later proceeding,at which time the merits of the questions giving rise to the litigation will be decided.commonwealth oil,at.within the confines of the instant adversary proceeding,however,there is no later proceeding at which time excel claims will reach final disposition.excel has already received the maximum injunctive stay until confirmation of a reorganization the bankruptcy court could grant.see am.hardwoods,deutsche credit in re am.hardwoods,cir bankruptcy courts lack the power to issue injunctions that outlast plan confirmation.in this context,the most relevant future proceeding is the debtor reorganization.because excel claim is ultimately that arbitration would harm its ability to reorganize,it makes sense to require a showing of a reasonable likelihood of a successful reorganization.homestead holdings,broome wellington in re pti holding,considering likelihood of success in reorganization under merits prong of preliminary injunction inquiry see also,at same in re monroe well,same otero mills,sec.bank trust in re otero mills,same but see ftc first alliance mortgage in re first alliance mortgage,collecting conflicting cases.moreover,because the gravamen of excel adversary complaint is that the arbitration would harm the bankruptcy estate,adopting appellants approach would collapse the traditionally distinct merits and hardship prongs into a single hardship inquiry.
in sum,our usual preliminary injunction standard applies to applications to stay actions against under a.in granting or denying such an injunction,a bankruptcy court must consider whether the debtor has a reasonable likelihood of a successful reorganization,the relative hardship of the parties,and any public interest concerns if relevant.
proceedings below 
both the bankruptcy court and the bap applied incorrect legal standards.citing am.hardwoods,at,the bankruptcy court stated that a preliminary injunction is proper whenever an action in another forum could conceivably have any effect on the administration of the bankruptcy estate.that is actually the standard for determining whether the bankruptcy court has subject matter jurisdiction over a motion for a preliminary injunction.id.at.whether the bankruptcy court has subject matter jurisdiction is a distinct question from whether an injunction should issue.the two inquiries can not be identical otherwise a bankruptcy court would be required to grant every preliminary injunction motion over which it has jurisdiction.
the bap likewise applied an incorrect standard.the bap relied on the unusual circumstances doctrine the fourth circuit developed in piccinin,which provides an exception to the general rule that the automatic stay does not apply to actions against.piccinin held that the automatic stay may be extended if unusual circumstances make the interests of the debtor and the defendant inextricably interwoven.at affirming stay of actions against debtor officers under a combination of a,a,and the court inherent equitable powers see also acquisition,eastway delivery,in re acquisition,cir extending the a automatic stay to action against debtor alleged alter egos.the bap treated the unusual circumstances doctrine and the usual preliminary injunction standard as separate and distinct bases for affirming the stay.that is error,because the unusual circumstances doctrine does not negate the traditional preliminary injunction standard.as we have noted,stays under the doctrine,although referred to as extensions of the automatic stay,were in fact injunctions issued by the bankruptcy court after hearing and the establishment of unusual need to take this action to protect the administration of the bankruptcy estate.chugach forest,at quoting patton bearden,cir.indeed,piccinin itself applied the usual preliminary injunction standard in affirming the stay.at.
the bankruptcy court and the bap alternatively found preliminary injunctive relief warranted under the usual preliminary injunction standard.we find that the injunction can not be affirmed under their application of the usual standard.
as discussed above,the first prong of the usual preliminary injunction standard is whether the debtor can demonstrate a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits.the bankruptcy court did not consider that issue at all.that failure to consider a critical element of the injunction standard is reversible error.the bap did find that excel had shown reasonable likelihood of a successful reorganization,but the bap finding is not supported by the record.the bap noted that hoffman was actively marketing excel products in his consulting position.that mere fact is insufficient to show that excel had a reasonable chance of successfully reorganizing.there is no indication in the record of what hoffman marketing activities are or how they could meaningfully contribute to excel reorganization.excel bankruptcy petition shows that it had no income from business operations during the past months.although it is not a high burden to show a reasonable likelihood of success in reorganization,the bap conclusion that excel had done so amounted to an abuse of discretion because the record contains no evidence on which the bap rationally could have based that decision.benedor conejo,in re conejo,cir.
the next prong is the balance of hardship between the parties.a bank
