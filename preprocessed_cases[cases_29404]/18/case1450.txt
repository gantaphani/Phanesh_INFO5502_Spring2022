a daughter brought a lawsuit against her father,seeking declaratory relief and an accounting with respect to an investment the father made for the daughter without her knowledge.the daughter asserted the father improperly repaid himself,from her capital account in the limited liability company in which the funds were invested,for the funds he advanced.we hold that 
the trial court erroneously granted summary judgment to the father,because triable issues of fact exist as to whether the funds advanced were a loan as the father contends or a gift as the daughter contends.
the daughter was entitled to discovery of the financial records of the limited liability company in which she held a one percent interest,based upon the inspection rights provided under corporations code section to members of foreign limited liability companies residing in california.the trial court therefore erred in denying the daughter motion to compel production of company records.
the trial court abused its discretion in failing to permit the daughter to amend her complaint to seek damages from the father for conversion and breach of fiduciary duty.
factual and procedural background 
carrie burkle is ronald burkle adult daughter in,when carrie was,her father formed yucaipa monterey,llc,a delaware limited liability company that was formed to purchase art and owns an unspecified number of paintings.carrie has had a one percent interest in yucaipa monterey since its formation.carrie father owns percent of the company,and provided the funds for carrie one percent interest.
in november,several months after her mother,janet burkle,filed a petition for dissolution of her marriage to carrie father,carrie filed a lawsuit naming her father and her mother as defendants.carrie mother is paying carrie legal fees for the lawsuit.the lawsuit alleged that carrie parents made various investments for her benefit,during her minority and thereafter,and asserted numerous causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud,fraudulent suppression of fact,unjust enrichment and constructive trust,declaratory relief,an accounting,and for the return of personal property.among the investments identified was ronald acquisition for carrie of her one percent interest in yucaipa monterey.as to the yucaipa monterey investment,carrie alleged causes of action for declaratory relief and an accounting specifically,carrie first amended complaint alleged that she learned of her one percent ownership interest on approximately september,and that her father claimed she owed him allegedly lent to her to acquire her one percent interest.carrie asserted the value of yucaipa monterey was million,and sought declaratory relief,requesting the court to determine the rights and obligations of the parties arising from carrie claims regarding her interest in yucaipa monterey and ronald claims that carrie owes him money,and to determine the value of carrie interest and that her interest be liquidated and the funds paid to carrie.she also asserted she was entitled to an accounting,b ased on the fiduciary relationship between carrie and her parents,of all monies due her 
carrie filed discovery requests,among which was a request for documents relating to the financial condition and assets of yucaipa monterey.ronald resisted,and on november,the trial court denied carrie motion to compel production of the yucaipa monterey financial records,without prejudice.the court stated that i f the answer is not received at the deposition of ronald burkle,then the motion may be renewed after ronald deposition on january,carrie renewed her motion to compel production of yucaipa monterey documents,because ronald refused to provide information about the company assets at his deposition carrie argued ronald,by virtue of his control over her interest in yucaipa monterey,had a fiduciary duty to disclose the information,and also had a statutory obligation under the corporations code to provide access to yucaipa monterey books and records.she asserted the discovery was relevant and necessary to determine the value of carrie interests in yucaipa monterey and for calculation of damages.
the trial court requested further briefing to identify the statutory or common law sources creating a right to discovery of the financial records of a limited liability company in which carrie has a one percent interest and her father has a percent interest,including whether delaware or california law applied to the asserted statutory obligation to provide access.the court ultimately denied carrie motion,concluding carrie had no right to discovery of the requested information.the court concluded a right to discovery exists where the plaintiff alleges wrongdoing by a defendant and seeks to discover evidence to support the claim,or where applicable corporations statutes create a disclosure obligation.however 
because carrie did not allege any wrongdoing by ronald,the scope of carrie discovery rights was defined by the statutes creating disclosure obligations on the part of the managers of limited liability companies 
if california law applied,carrie was not entitled to discovery because she does not own the threshold percent interest necessary to entitle her to discovery of the company financial records and 
if delaware law applied,the delaware chancery court has exclusive jurisdiction to decide whether carrie was entitled to the discovery she sought.
meanwhile,ronald filed a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication.ronald asserted,among other points,that 
carrie admitted at her deposition that she had no evidence of any improprieties by ronald in connection with the investments at issue.
carrie admitted the purpose of her lawsuit was to obtain an accounting of all the accounts and interests her father set up for her.
all of the money in the accounts and interests at issue came from carrie father,without any obligation on his part to do so.
carrie owns a one percent interest in yucaipa monterey.
in and,ronald made capital contributions to yucaipa monterey on carrie behalf in the form of a loan in the amount of.in,ronald drew down carrie capital account in yucaipa monterey to repay himself for his prior loans to carrie by which he funded her capital account,plus interest that had accrued on those loans since and.ronald repayment to himself totaled.
carrie opposed ronald motion for summary judgment.she disputed ronald testimony that his capital contributions on her behalf were loans,asserting that no loan agreements were ever made between her and her father,and that her father never told her he thought these investments were loans from him instead of gifts from him to her,and never told her she would have to repay him for these investments,either principal or interest.she also disputed ronald claim that she had no evidence of any improprieties,asserting that she never authorized her father to make any loans on her behalf she never agreed to any loan she testified at her deposition that she did not have enough information to determine whether any improprieties occurred and she also testified that she did not know what her father did with the money in her accounts and investments 
two days before the hearing on ronald summary judgment motion,carrie filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint.carrie sought to add causes of action for conversion and breach of fiduciary duty based upon ronald unilateral appropriation of of carrie funds from yucaipa monterey as alleged repayment of a claimed loan he made to her for her capital contribution in that entity.
on july,the trial court granted summary adjudication of carrie causes of action for declaratory relief and an accounting with respect to yucaipa monterey.the court observed 
carrie testimony did not create a triable issue of fact that ronald had any obligation to render an accounting to her or that he breached any duty owed to her or committed any wrongful act.to the contrary,carrie has admitted in deposition that she has no evidence or belief that ronald has committed any wrong against her.
ronald presented evidence demonstrating he gave her a interest which was funded by proceeds that he loaned to her and caused yucaipa monterey llc to repay to him.carrie evidence does not demonstrate there is a triable issue of fact as to any actual,present controversy over her interest in yucaipa monterey 
carrie evidence that ronald never told her about the loan and only spoke to her generally about gifts does not create a triable issue that the money he withdrew from yucaipa monterey llc was not a loan but something the court should declare to be otherwise.
as for carrie motion for leave to file a second amended complaint,the court observed carrie did not seek a ruling on her motion before the hearing on the summary judgment motion,and did not submit any evidence in opposition to the summary judgment motion that would tend to show a triable issue of fact as to whether ronald converted or misappropriated her property or breached any fiduciary duty owed to her.
judgment was entered in favor of ronald on august,and this appeal followed.
discussion 
carrie contends summary judgment should have been denied she was entitled to discovery and all inspection rights she would have if yucaipa monterey were a california entity and it was error to deny her motion for leave to file a second amended complaint.we agree on all counts.
we review first the principles governing summary judgment,and then turn to the substance of each of the trial court rulings.
the standard of review.
we reiterate the established principles governing summary judgment.the trial court ruling is reviewed de novo to determine whether the moving party,ronald,has established there is no triable issue as to any material fact and he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.ronald must show either that carrie can not establish one or more elements of her causes of action for declaratory relief and an accounting,or that there is a complete defense.if that burden of production is met,the burden shifts to carrie to show the existence of a triable issue of fact with respect to the cause of action or defense.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,code civ,subds.c,o p.
ronald was not entitled to summary judgment.
the question on appeal is whether a triable issue of fact exists as to carrie claim that ronald misappropriated her investment in yucaipa monterey by taking from her capital account.this question turns on whether the funds invested for carrie were a gift or a loan.
ronald contends the undisputed of his own declaration that he intended a loan,not a he lent carrie the funds for her capital contribution to the company and was entitled to repayment of the loan with interest.according to ronald,carrie failed to present sufficient evidence demonstrating a triable issue of fact that the monies he advanced were a gift.carrie contends otherwise,asserting that ronald did not establish his right to appropriate the funds in her capital account as a matter of law,and poses the factual dispute this way 
carrie declaration created an evident factual dispute which went to the heart of ronald motion for summary judgment he claimed the existence of a loan agreement in she denied the existence of any such agreement and denied that the subject ever even came up or was discussed.
we agree with carrie.the question whether a transfer of funds was a gift or a loan often presents questions of fact,and this case is no different.the question depends principally upon ronald intent at the time he advanced the funds to acquire carrie one percent interest ronald declaration states his advance was made in the form of a loan.but sufficient evidence was presented to permit a reasonable to conclude otherwise 
first,as carrie avers,ronald at no time raised or discussed the subject of a loan with her and,in her younger years,often spoke to her of investments he had given her and her siblings.
second,ronald presented no evidence of the terms upon which he lent carrie the money to purchase her one percent interest in yucaipa monterey.until he distributed carrie capital account to carrie on the books of the to himself in record anywhere reflected a loan to carrie no indication of the principal amount of the loan no indication of the interest rate to be charged and no indication when the loan would be due and payable.while the absence of documentation might be understandable when a parent is investing for a minor child,carrie was an adult when ronald made this investment on her behalf.in a transaction involving adults,it is not unreasonable to infer that if ronald intended to create a repayment obligation on carrie part,some evidence of that obligation and its terms would exist.
third,ronald declaration asserts that carrie currently owes is,even after ronald repaid himself with substantially all of carrie capital account of additional interest that had accrued beyond the capital account balance.the record,however,is devoid not only of any evidence of the terms of the asserted loan but also of any evidence carrie agreed to those terms,which are known to no one but ronald.while we can conceive of circumstances under which a parent might make an investment for a minor child with the expectation of recouping the monies advanced from the fruits of the investment,we do not see how a parent can unilaterally determine the terms of a loan to an adult child,and assert his entitlement to unpaid interest,without the knowledge or agreement of the borrower.
in short,on this record we can not say that ronald has met his burden of establishing no triable issue of fact exists as to whether his advance of funds was a gift or a loan.a could reasonably the absence of any evidence of the terms of a loan,from ronald failure to tell carrie he was lending her funds she would be obligated to repay with interest,and from the lack of any agreement to loan ronald intended a gift at the time he made the investment for carrie.eklund eklund d,trial court had the right to consider that where services are rendered by a near relative or member of a family without an agreement thereon an inference that payment or compensation is to be made is not usually drawn.the only evidence of a loan is ronald declaration that he made the capital contributions for carrie in the form of a loan a trier of fact,however,might disbelieve ronald testimony.see code civ,subd.e summary judgment may be denied in the discretion of the court where a material fact is an individual state of mind,or lack thereof,and that fact is sought to be established solely by the individual affirmation thereof.
in sum,the evidence presented in the summary judgment proceeding does not compel the conclusion that ronald lent,rather than gave,carrie the funds for her one percent investment in yucaipa monterey.that question is for the trier of fact,and the trial court therefore erred in granting summary judgment to ronald 
the trial court erred in refusing to compel production of yucaipa monterey financial records.
carrie contends the trial court erred in declining to compel ronald to produce documents and answer questions about the assets of yucaipa monterey.she argues she was entitled to access to yucaipa monterey financial records a because she is an owner of yucaipa monterey,and b under california liberal discovery statutes,in support of her causes of action for declaratory relief and accounting.we agree carrie is entitled to discovery as an owner of yucaipa monterey.
carrie motion to compel further discovery responses was not premised upon any allegations of or other wrongdoing by ronald with respect to yucaipa monterey,but instead was based only on her declaratory relief and accounting claims and upon her common law and statutory rights as an owner of the company.because carrie expressly admitted she was alleging no wrongdoing,the trial court was correct in a declining to compel discovery on the basis of case precedents addressing the duty of business partners or corporate directors to disclose financial records to partners or shareholders where wrongdoing is alleged,and b concluding the scope of carrie discovery rights was defined by california statutes creating disclosure obligations on the part of managers of limited liability companies.however,the trial court erred when it co
