this action for breach of fiduciary duty requires us to decide what vote of the limited partners of a california limited partnership is necessary to ratify a transaction proposed by the partnership general partner.we hold that only the partnership agreement may vary the unanimous ratification requirement of california law,and that it would be manifestly unreasonable for a partnership agreement to include votes cast by an interested general partner or its affiliates in a ratification vote.we reverse the decision of the district court.
factual and procedural background 
prometheus income partners,lp partnership was a california limited partnership,organized to manage two large apartment complexes in santa clara,california its general partner was prometheus development,pdc,a california corporation.pdc is owned by the dns trust,a trust effectively controlled by sanford diller diller,who is also pdc sole director,president,and cfo.louis and frank perretta plaintiffs were limited partners in the partnership,and are suing as representatives of the class of limited partners 
in late,pdc notified the limited partners that it was contemplating a transaction merger whereby the partnership would be merged into pip,llc pip partners,an entity owned by the dns trust and diller daughter,and which owned approximately of the limited partnership units in the partnership.pdc initial proposal offered consideration of per partnership unit,but in march the consideration was increased to per unit,and later increased again to per unit.
on june,pdc issued a proxy statement to the limited partners proxy statement describing the terms of the proposed merger and soliciting the proxy of limited partners to approve the merger.in the proxy statement,pdc stated that pip partners would vote neutrally with respect to the merger proposal,meaning that pip partners will vote its units for or against the proposal in the same proportion as the total number of units voted by unaffiliated partners.the proxy statement noted several times that the interests of pdc and its affiliates were adverse to those of the limited partners unaffiliated with pdc.
in july,the limited partners of the partnership voted.of the limited partnership units outstanding,or,were voted to approve the merger.this total included votes owned by pip partners,the affiliate of the defendants.the unaffiliated limited partners cast votes in favor of the total unaffiliated limited partner votes,votes against,and votes expressly abstaining.limited partners holding units,or of the unaffiliated limited partner votes,did not vote in person or return a proxy thus,of the total partnership units owned by unaffiliated limited partners were actually voted,but only a plurality of of those units were voted to approve the merger.if the limited partnership votes of pdc affiliate,pip partners,were not counted,an absolute majority of votes in favor of the merger would not have been achieved.according to the second amended and restated limited partnership agreement of the partnership partnership agreement,an absolute majority of limited partner interests entitled to vote was necessary to approve the merger 
in july,plaintiffs filed a class action complaint in the district court against pdc,diller,and two other officers of pdc.the defendants filed a federal rule of civil procedure b motion to dismiss.in their brief opposing the motion,plaintiffs stated plaintiffs do not dispute that a majority of the unaffiliated limited partners voted in favor of the merger.rather,the gravamen of their lawsuit is that they were induced to do so by statements in proxy materials that were deliberately false and misleading.
the district court granted the defendant motion to dismiss the complaint,with leave to amend.citing plaintiffs admission that a majority of unaffiliated limited partners had voted to ratify the merger,the district court stated that the limited partners ratification of the merger would only be disregarded if pdc disclosure in the proxy statement were properly alleged to be fraudulent.the district court held that plaintiffs had not previously done so with the specificity required by federal rule of civil procedure b,which requires that the circumstances constituting fraud shall be stated with particularity.
in january,plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint fac.the fac named only pdc and diller as defendants.the plaintiffs alleged,among other things,that the ratification was ineffective because pdc failed to properly disclose eight material matters to the limited partners in the proxy statement.it omitted the allegation that a majority of unaffiliated partners had approved the merger,and noted that if pip partners had simply abstained from voting,the merger would not have been approved.
pdc and diller moved to dismiss the fac,and included the vote totals summarized above in their moving papers.the district court granted the motion to dismiss without leave to amend because it believed that any further amendment would be futile.the district court held that the vote ratified the merger because a majority of the voting unaffiliated limited partners voted for the merger,even if they did not make up a majority of all unaffiliated limited partners entitled to vote.alternatively,the district court held that plaintiffs were in any event judicially estopped to deny that a majority of unaffiliated limited partners approved the merger,notwithstanding defendants subsequent statement to the contrary.finally,the district court ruled that the fac still did not plead circumstances constituting fraud in the proxy statement with sufficient particularity to satisfy the requirements of rule b.plaintiffs appealed.

discussion 
a.a general partner duty of loyalty under california law 
under california law,the general partner of a limited partnership has the same fiduciary duties as a partner in any other partnership.cal.b.the fiduciary duties a partner owes to the partnership and the other partners are the duty of loyalty and the duty of care set forth in subdivisions b and c.cal.a.subdivision b of the statute,in relevant part,states 
b a partner duty of loyalty to the partnership and the other partners includes all of the following 
to account to the partnership and hold as trustee for it any property,profit,or benefit derived by the partner in the conduct and winding up of the partnership business or derived from a use by the partner of partnership property or information,including the appropriation of a partnership opportunity.
to refrain from dealing with the partnership in the conduct or winding up of the partnership business as or on behalf of a party having an interest adverse to the partnership.
id.b.a partner may not dissolve a partnership to gain the benefits of the business for himself,unless he fully compensates his copartner for his share of the prospective business opportunity.leff gunter,cal d,quoting page page,cal d.in the fac,the plaintiffs allege that the merger constituted a transaction which violated pdc duty of loyalty by setting an unfairly low price.
however,not all transactions violate the duty of loyalty.a partner does not violate a duty or obligation under this chapter or under the partnership agreement merely because the partner conduct furthers the partner own interest.cal.e.the question is not whether the interested partner is benefitted,but whether the partnership or the other partners are harmed.partnership is a fiduciary relationship,and partners may not take advantages for themselves at the expense of the partnership.jones wells fargo bank,th,d emphasis added.there is an obvious and essential unfairness in one partner attempted exploitation of a partnership opportunity for his own personal benefit and to the resulting detriment of his copartners.leff,at.thus,a partner who seeks a business advantage over another partner bears the burden of showing complete good faith and fairness to the other.everest investors mcneil partners,th,d.
one way a partner may meet this burden is to have disinterested partners ratify its actions.the doctrine of shareholder ratification is well known in the corporate context.however,the only california case specifically addressing ratification in a partnership context is skone quanco farms,d.in skone,the court held 
there is no breach of a fiduciary duty if there has been a full and complete disclosure,if the partner who deals with partnership property first discloses all of the facts surrounding the transaction to the other partners and secures their approval and consent.in fact,it would be incongruous to hold that a partner who consented to a partnership transaction,with full knowledge of all the facts,may later complain and seek damages against the other partner simply because he benefitted by the transaction.
id.at.citations and footnotes omitted.california statutory law expressly provides for ratification by a partnership all of the partners or a number or percentage specified in the partnership agreement may authorize or ratify,after full disclosure of all material facts,a specific act or transaction that otherwise would violate the duty of loyalty.cal.b b.the language of both skone and cal.b b indicates that,upon a showing of proper ratification by the partners,any claim against the partner for a violation of the duty of loyalty is extinguished.thus,we must determine whether any potential claim plaintiffs might have for breach of the duty of loyalty was extinguished by a valid ratification of the merger under cal.b b.
were plaintiffs judicially estopped to deny a ratification of the merger 
before analyzing other aspects of the ratification question,we address the district court holding that plaintiffs were judicially estopped to argue that the merger vote was insufficient because of a representation made by plaintiffs in their opposition to defendant motion to dismiss the original complaint.in plaintiffs brief in opposition,they wrote plaintiffs do not dispute that a majority of the unaffiliated limited partners voted in favor of the merger.rather,the gravamen of their lawsuit is that they were induced to do so by statements in proxy materials that were deliberately false and misleading.plaintiffs now characterize this as a misstatement of counsel what they meant to say was that they did not dispute that a majority of all limited and approved the merger.
judicial estoppel,also known as preclusion of inconsistent positions,prohibits a litigant from asserting inconsistent positions in the same litigation.humetrix,gemplus,cir.the doctrine generally prevents a party from prevailing in one phase of a case on an argument and then relying on a contradictory argument to prevail in another phase.pegram herdrich,d.the supreme court has identified three factors that typically inform the decision whether to apply the doctrine in a particular case whether the two positions are clearly inconsistent,whether the party was successful in asserting the earlier position,and whether the party seeking to assert the position would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment upon the opposing party.new hampshire maine,d.we review the decision whether to invoke judicial estoppel for an abuse of discretion.united states ruiz,cir.
in this case,we hold that the district court abused its discretion by invoking judicial estoppel.first,it is not obvious that the positions are clearly inconsistent,but we will concede that they are for purposes of this analysis.however,the second factor,success on the prior position,is entirely absent here.absent success in a prior proceeding,a party later inconsistent position introduces no risk of inconsistent court determinations,and thus poses little threat to judicial integrity.new hampshire,at.citation and quotation marks omitted.in this case,plaintiffs lost the very motion they were arguing,and it is difficult to see what advantage they might have derived from the apparent concession even then.the third factor,unfair prejudice to the opposing party,appears to be absent as tally of votes cited above are drawn from defendants reply in support of their motion to dismiss plaintiffs first amended complaint and,on appeal,have been accepted by both parties as true.
plaintiffs explanation for the apparent change in it merely reflects a misstatement,rather than a also plausible.while plausibility is not one of the three new hampshire factors,those factors were not meant to be exhaustive,and the text of new hampshire itself lends support to the idea that it should be taken into account.see id.at.quoting charles wright,et,federal practice and procedure at absent any good explanation,a party should not be allowed to gain an advantage by litigation on one theory,and then seek an inconsistent advantage by pursuing an incompatible theory emphasis added.
finally,in this case,the district court noted,in justifying the holding of estoppel,that the proxy materials indicated that the facts about the vote could not have been as plaintiffs allege.it is not clear what the proxy statement,which preceded the vote,has to do with the factual matter of the final vote tally.at any rate as shown below,it was the district court,not the plaintiffs,that was mistaken about the importance of the proxy statement in determining how the outcome of the vote was to be determined.an abuse of discretion occurs if the district court based its decision on an erroneous legal conclusion or a clearly erroneous finding of fact.gonzales free speech,cir quotation marks and citation omitted.
we hold that the plaintiffs are not judicially estopped from contesting the effectiveness of the ratification of the vote on the merger.
c.what constitutes a majority vote 
the district court also held that the merger was effective because it was approved by limited partners holding of the units actually voted.it further ruled that those limited partners who did not vote were not to be included in the calculation.the district court based its determination on the rules for counting votes set forth in the proxy statement.however,california law and the partnership agreement govern how the outcome of the vote is to be determined,not the proxy materials.
cal.b b states all of the partners or a number or percentage specified in the partnership agreement may authorize or ratify,after full disclosure of all material facts,a specific act or transaction that otherwise would violate the duty of loyalty.emphasis added.in skone,the partnership had only two partners.the ratification of the one partner actions by the other was,therefore,a unanimous one.d at.by contrast,this case involves a limited partnership with approximately partners.nothing in the statute,however,varies the unanimity requirement in a general partnership based on the number of partners,and neither does the california revised limited partnership act act,which also applies in this case,provide a different default rule for ratification when limited partnerships are at issue.the act commands that,unless otherwise provided,limited partnerships shall be governed in the same manner as general partnerships would be governed.cal.
moreover,the act specifies that only the partnership agreement can vary the unanimity requirement and require a lesser number of partners necessary to ratify a violation of the duty of loyalty.the district court observed that the proxy statement,drafted by pdc and sent out shortly before the vote,purported to set forth what vote was required to approve the merger,and in places stated that would not be considered but no references to proxy statements appear in b b,and for good reason allowing the general partner which,after all,drafted the proxy statement to unilaterally adopt ad hoc rules to ratify its own transaction would undermine the very purpose of the limited partners to protect themselves.only the partnership agreement,which the limited partners agreed to upon joining the partnership,can vary the statutory requirement for what vote is required to ratify.
the partnership agreement,unfortunately,does not expressly mention the duty of loyalty or ratification neither does it address limited partner votes in the presence of a conflicted general partner.rather,it states,in relevant part,that limited partners shall have the right,by majority vote to d issolve and wind up the partnership.majority vote,in turn,is defined as the vote of limited partners who are entitled to vote,consent or act and are holders of record of a majority of the outstanding units.nowhere does the partnership agreement distinguish between interested and disinterested in areas where the general partner would almost always have a conflict of interest.for example,a majority vote is required to permit the general partner to perform a number of otherwise restricted selling the partnership properties to itself or comingling its funds with that of the partnership 
the lack of any reference in the partnership agreement voting provisions to duties of loyalty or conflicts of interest militates in favor of construing the partnership agreement voting provisions narrowly to involve only the juridical effectiveness of the merger pursuant to cal.not to effect ratification under cal.b b.following that approach,the partnership agreement has not varied the unanimous ratification rule,and the ratification fails.however,we do not so construe the partnership agreement.the fact that a majority vote is required to approve certain potentially conflicted actions of the general partner makes clear that the majority vote is intended to be the principal way for limited partners to protect themselves against adverse actions of the general partner.the majority vote explicitly acts as an approval and consent of the issue under consideration,which is the requirement for ratification under skone,d at.
we thus look to the partnership agreement definition of majority vote to determine what vote is necessary to ratify the merger.while pdc contends that only a majority of disinterested shareholders actually voting was required to effect ratification,the partnership agreement definition of majority vote expressly requires a majority of the outstanding units making no distinction whether the units are voted or not.those who failed to cast their vote must,therefore,be included in the denominator of any vote total.
manifestly unreasonable 
since the voting provisions of the partnership agreement do not forbid the limited partners from ratifying the actions of an interested general partner,the plain language of the partnership agreement places no limit on the ability of an interested general partner to participate in ratifying its own transactions.however,in this case,pdc requires interested limited partner votes to ratify since only of total unaffiliated units voted yes to the merger.
california law permits a partnership agreement to vary or permit ratifications of violations of the duty of loyalty only if the provision doing so is not manifestly unreasonable.cal.b thus,we are required to determine whether a provision that allows an interested partner to count its votes in the total required for ratification is manifestly unreasonable.
there is some authority suggesting that such a provision might not be manifestly unreasonable.in particular,a comment to the uniform limited partnership act explaining the provision allowing ratification upon a specified vote of the limited partners,notes the act does not require that the authorization or ratification be by disinterested partners,although the partnership agreement may so provide it may be argued,then,that in the context of a large limited partnership,such a provision might not be manifestly unreasonable.
we disagree.we begin with the proposition that california has a strong public policy against transactions by fiduciaries,especially in cases involving changes of organizational control 
in whatever form it occurs should be handled with rough hands for what it dealing.and while it is often difficult to discover in mergers,consolidations,sale of all the assets or dissolution and liquidation,the difficulty makes it even more imperative that the search be thorough and relentless.
jones ahmanson,cal d.it is for this reason that transactions are denied the deference embodied in the business judgment rule,which ordinarily requires deference to the business decisions of managers of business enterprises.see mcneil partners,th at,d.to the extent ratification represents an exception to california general policy of thorough and relentless scrutiny of,we are confident that a california court would construe it narrowly,with particular skepticism toward any aspect that might hint of unfairness.
california statutes in related areas of the law support the idea that interested partners should not be allowed to count their votes in a ratification vote.for example,in an action for rescission of the merger of a limited partnership,a party to a reorganization which controls another party to a reorganization shall have the burden of proving that the transaction is just and reasonable as to the limited partners of the controlled party unless a majority in interest of the limited partners other than limited partners who are directly or indirectly controlled by,or under common control with,another party to the reorganization approve or consent to the reorganization.cal.c,d emphasis added.we fail to see why the standard for ratification to extinguish a claim for violation of fiduciary duty should be any less than the standard for an action directly challenging the merger itself.
for california corporations,the applicable statute mandates that conflicted actions be ratified in elections with the shares owned by the interested director or directors not being entitled to vote thereon.cal.a.that the rules governing another organizational form expressly prohibit this sort of calculation provides further evidence that a california court would find it manifestly unreasonable in the partnership context as well,were the issue presented.
finally,allowing an interested partner to participate in a ratification election subverts the very purpose of ratification itself.the delaware court of chancery described that policy as follows 
when unitholders have the contractual opportunity to protect themselves against an unfair vote simply by voting no,it would be paternalistic and inefficient for courts to exercise a supervening judgment to protect the unitholders from their own erroneous investment decision.it is at best highly doubtful the court is in a better position than unitholders to determine the economic utility of transactions put to them moreover,it seems a misallocation of judicial resources to have courts reassess the fairness of transactions that minority unitholders could have blocked themselves.
alliance capital mgmt.holdings,footnote omitted allowing an interested party to vote,however,only interferes with the unaffiliated partners.the interested party has no need to protect itself from its own decision,and its contention that the decision also benefits the unaffiliated partners,unaccompanied by those partners affirmative agreement,need not be taken at face value.
this is the case notwithstanding pip partners attempt to vote neutrally by voting its units in the same proportion as the unaffiliated yes and no votes.pip partners vote was manifestly not neutral,as it failed to account for those who failed to return their proxy in defining majority vote to mean an absolute majority of all those entitled to vote,rather than those who actually voted,the partnership agreement reflects a judgment that certain fundamental changes in the partnership structure should be taken only with the affirmative approval of limited partners,rather than merely over their silence.pdc and the limited partners could have struck a different bargain,one closer to
