this case presents a difficult issue of corporate tax liability.fleetboston financial corporation,through its predecessor bankboston corporation,overpaid its reported tax liability for tax years and.rather than seek refunds of the reported overpayments,fleetboston elected to have the overpayment for each of those two years credited to its tax account for the immediately succeeding year.several years later,the internal revenue service irs audited fleetboston tax accounts and assessed deficiencies for and.after fleetboston eliminated the deficiencies,the irs assessed interest on the amount of the deficiencies for the intervening period.fleetboston paid the assessment,but it challenged the amount of the interest and ultimately filed a refund claim for the disputed amount with the court of federal claims.the primary question before that court and before us on appeal is whether fleetboston must pay interest on the full extent of the deficiencies in its and tax accounts or,alternatively,whether interest on those deficiencies is suspended to the extent of fleetboston overpayments residing in other tax years accounts on which the government did not pay interest to fleetboston.the court of federal claims concluded that fleetboston must pay interest on the full extent of the deficiencies,and we agree.
in its tax return for,which was filed on september,fleetboston reported an overpayment of.under the internal revenue code and irs regulations,a taxpayer that reports an overpayment of its income tax may request a refund or elect to have the reported overpayment applied to its estimated tax for the following year.b a.the subject of such an election is known as a credit elect overpayment or simply a credit elect.on its tax return,fleetboston instructed the irs to apply fleetboston reported overpayment of to its estimated tax for.
during,fleetboston made three payments,totaling million,toward its tax liability.that amount,together with the credit elect from,resulted in a million overpayment of fleetboston reported tax liability for.on its tax return for,which was filed on september,fleetboston elected to credit that reported overpayment to its estimated tax for.
in,fleetboston again overpaid its reported tax liability.once again it elected to apply a portion of the reported overpayment as a credit against the following year liability.the same pattern continued until,when fleetboston requested and received a refund of its reported overpayment for.
subsequent to fleetboston filing of its tax returns for and,the irs audited those returns and determined that,rather than having overpaid those years taxes,fleetboston actually had deficiencies for both tax years.after the parties reached agreement as to the amount of the deficiencies for those two years,fleetboston applied net operating loss carrybacks from later years to eliminate the deficiencies.the parties,however,continued to dispute the amount of interest that fleetboston should be required to pay on the deficiencies for and.the irs calculated underpayment interest for and as accruing on the portions of fleetboston and taxes that were not satisfied by funds in fleetboston tax account for each respective year.the irs treated fleetboston reported overpayment as transferred into fleetboston tax account by virtue of the credit election and,for periods after that transfer,charged fleetboston with interest on an additional deficiency in the amount of the credit elect.similarly,the irs treated fleetboston credit elect overpayment as transferred into fleetboston tax account,thereby increasing the deficiency on which underpayment interest was owed.the irs did not view the additional overpayments made by fleetboston for tax years after as affecting the or deficiencies on which underpayment interest accrued.
fleetboston took the position that the and deficiencies on which underpayment interest was due should not include the amounts of its credit elects for those years.fleetboston noted that the funds represented by the credit elects were never needed to pay fleetboston estimated taxes during the pertinent period and that the government never had to pay overpayment interest on those funds over the years.because the irs was not deprived of the use of those funds between the time of their deposit with the irs and the ultimate resolution of the deficiencies for and,fleetboston argued that it should not be required to pay interest on the portions of the deficiencies attributable to the credit elect overpayments taken in those years.under the same theory,fleetboston argued that the and deficiencies should be deemed reduced,for deficiency interest purposes,during time periods in which the irs had use of overpayments that fleetboston made on account of later years taxes.
after the irs rejected fleetboston refund request,fleetboston filed a refund action in the court of federal claims,where it renewed its arguments regarding the calculation of interest.the court rejected fleetboston claim.the court first noted that sections b and d of the internal revenue code,b,d,provide that a credit elect is applied against a taxpayer liability in the immediately succeeding tax year and only in that year.the court held that when fleetboston credit elects were applied to subsequent tax accounts,the deficiencies for and were increased,and interest on the increased portion of the deficiencies began to accrue.the court ruled that the statutory authorization in section b for crediting funds from one tax account to another resulted in increasing and decreasing deficiencies in different accounts.in light of that explicit statutory authorization,the court rejected fleetboston argument that the principle underlying a,the underpayment interest provision of the code,requires that overpayments be recredited to deficient accounts for purposes of calculating the underpayment interest due.the court reasoned that although the principle is a useful tool of statutory construction,only a provision explicitly authorizing the crediting of funds back to the and tax accounts would allow the relief fleetboston sought.the court found nothing in section a or elsewhere in the code to authorize such crediting.finally,the court rejected fleetboston argument that it was entitled to interest netting under section d of the code,d.the court explained that fleetboston was not eligible for that statutory remedy because it had not complied with the special requirements for relief under that provision.fleetboston now appeals to this court.
the internal revenue code renders a taxpayer liable for underpayment interest on any amount of tax that is not paid until such time as the amount in question is paid.a see brookhurst,united states,cir avon,united states,cir.fleetboston argues that a tax for a particular year is paid for purposes of section a not only by funds in the taxpayer tax account for that year,but also by any funds that the government holds in other tax accounts when those funds are not needed to satisfy the taxes associated with those accounts.
contrary to fleetboston argument,the statutory and regulatory scheme governing the treatment of overpayments requires a narrower interpretation of the term paid.the internal revenue code does not adopt as a general principle the rule that an amount of tax due for one year is paid by funds assigned to other years tax accounts.instead,the code contains specific crediting provisions that allow money in one year tax account to be applied against another year taxes in particular circumstances.
of specific relevance here is section b of the code,b,which authorizes the secretary of the treasury to prescribe regulations providing for the crediting of any reported overpayment against the estimated income tax for the succeeding taxable year.the treasury regulations adopted pursuant to that statutory authority provide that when a taxpayer reports an overpayment and claims the overpayment as a credit against the taxpayer estimated tax for the following taxable year,such amount shall be applied as a payment on account of the estimated income tax for such year or the installments thereof.a.that regulation accords with section d of the code,d,which provides that any overpayment claimed as a credit against estimated tax for the succeeding taxable year shall be considered as a payment of the income tax for the succeeding taxable year whether or not claimed as a credit in the return of estimated tax for such succeeding taxable year.see also d,h vii.
as these provisions make clear,the consequence of fleetboston election to have the reported overpayment for credited to its tax account for is that the reported overpayment was no longer available in fleetboston account to offset the deficiency for that year.the same is true of fleetboston election to credit its reported overpayment for to its tax account for.the reported overpayments moved to fleetboston and accounts,even though they were not needed to pay fleetboston estimated taxes for those years.the regulations expressly contemplate that the treatment of a credit elect as a payment of income tax for the succeeding taxable year may result in an overpayment for such succeeding taxable year,d,and the code specifically allows that a payment can be made on account of a tax for which no liability exists,see c.
fleetboston does not disagree that its credit elect overpayments moved out of its and tax accounts and into others rather,it argues that the calculation of underpayment interest transcends tax accounts and looks to any overpayments that the irs held,whatever tax account they were assigned to.yet the existence of statutory provisions for crediting funds from one tax account to another indicates that a tax for a particular year is not paid by money generally held by the irs,but rather by money assigned as payment of the tax for that year.the code and regulations explicitly direct the secretary of the treasury to apply a credit elect overpayment of one year reported tax as a payment of the next year tax nothing in the statutes or regulations suggests that a credit elect overpayment can be considered as never having moved to a different year tax account for the purpose of calculating deficiency interest.
compounding the difficulties with fleetboston approach to determining whether a tax has been paid for purposes of section a is the way in which the internal revenue code implements provisions when netting is intended.certain provisions of the code implement the principle in limited instances,but fleetboston broad interpretation of section a would render those specific provisions superfluous.
in,congress enacted section a in substantially its present form as part of the internal revenue code of.pub,a,stat.four years later,congress enacted two provisions that implement the principle in particular settings.pub,a,b,stat.congress enacted those provisions because differing interest rates on underpayments and overpayments,as well as other aspects of the code,created situations in which even though underpayments and overpayments offset each other,the internal revenue service collects more interest than it pays or the taxpayer is entitled to more interest than he owes,at,reprinted in.congress sought to eliminate these erratic differences of present law by terminating the interest both as to the overpayment and underpayment in certain circumstances.id.accordingly,congress enacted two complementary provisions,now codified at sections f and b of the internal revenue code,f,b.one provision sets aside deficiency interest for certain periods the other sets aside overpayment interest for the same periods.together,they suspend interest in certain cases involving offsetting overpayments and underpayments,not including a case such as this one.
fleetboston interpretation of section a as providing for interest suspension would make sections f and b redundant.rather than resort to those provisions,a taxpayer could simply assert that its overpayment for any tax year made an offsetting deficiency in a different account paid under section a.in perceiving a need to enact sections f and b,the congress presumably had a different understanding of what the congress meant when it used the words paid and not paid to delineate when underpayment interest would accrue.the enactment of these specific provisions confirms that a given tax is paid or unpaid for purposes of section a only by funds assigned to the taxpayer account for that tax year.
fleetboston responds to the government statutory arguments by pointing to the text of section a.that provision imposes underpayment interest if an amount of tax is not paid on or before the last date prescribed for payment and imposes interest from such last date to the date paid.fleetboston notes that the portion of its tax liabilities for and corresponding to subsequent credit elections for those years was,in fact,paid on or before the last date prescribed for payment because the credit elects did not leave the and tax accounts until several months after the last date prescribed for payment of each year tax.fleetboston posits that under a literal interpretation of section a,interest would not accrue on a deficiency arising after the payment deadline because the amount of such a deficiency was paid on or before the prescribed date,even if the payment was later withdrawn to a deficient tax account because of a credit election.
fleetboston does not directly contend that section a should be accorded this interpretation.rather,it argues that the only other principled interpretation of section a,and the correct interpretation,is one that imposes interest for the government loss of the use of money to which it is entitled.fleetboston contends that because the government has chosen the interpretation of section a,it must accept the logical limitations of that interpretation along with its benefits.
the flaw in that argument is that the two interpretations fleetboston posits are not the only possible interpretations of section a.under a third interpretation,adopted by the government and the trial court,section a can be read as imposing interest for any period during which an amount of tax is both due and not paid,as the term paid is used in section a.we regard that interpretation as the most persuasive for two reasons.first,it gives meaning to the statutory term paid as referring to the funds in the taxpayer account for the relevant tax year.that definition serves the government interest in having tax payments reside in the proper tax account.second,it avoids an obviously unintended result of the literal interpretation,under which interest would never run on a deficiency initially satisfied by funds in a particular tax account,even if those funds were promptly transferred out of that year account after the due date for that year tax had passed.indeed,fleetboston acknowledges that the literal reading of section a is contrary to the interpretation of section a.
the government interpretation of section a is also consistent with most of the authorities that fleetboston relies upon to support its position.in avon products,united states,cir,the case on which fleetboston principally relies,the taxpayer on september,made a credit election for an apparent overpayment of taxes for tax year.the credit elect was applied to the taxpayer payment for that was due on that same day.when it was later determined that the taxpayer had a deficiency rather than an overpayment for,the government sought interest on the amount of the deficiency that was created by the credit election.the narrow issue before the court was whether the government was entitled to interest during the period between june,when the taxpayer tax was due,and september,when the taxpayer made the credit election on its return and used the credit elect to pay its installment of estimated tax.the court held that interest did not run against the taxpayer for that period,noting that the taxpayer tax was paid in full from the due date,june,until a deficiency was created on september.id.at.
although the avon court stated that underpayment interest under section a is not meant to be a penalty,nothing in avon reflects a broad adoption of the principle.instead,the avon court simply held that section a imposes interest on tax amounts that are both due and unpaid,at,and then looked to the funds in the taxpayer tax account to determine when that year tax became unpaid.
in revenue rulings issued in the wake of avon,the irs accepted that interest could be charged only when a tax was both due and unpaid,and it stated that it would consider the credit elect portion of an earlier year tax to be unpaid on the date that the credit elect became effective as a payment of the succeeding year estimated tax.see rul,wl rul,wl.those revenue rulings address situations in which the credit elect is needed to pay an liability for the year succeeding the overpayment year.they conclude that the credit elect applies to the following year tax at whatever point in the following year it is needed to pay that year tax.they do not,however,address the situation presented here,where a credit elect overpayment is not needed to pay an liability during the succeeding year but nonetheless is treated as a payment of the following year estimated tax by operation of law.importantly for present purposes,the revenue rulings adopt the both due and unpaid interpretation of section a,and they focus on determining when a credit elect overpayment leaves the relevant tax account.they do not adopt fleetboston broader interpretation of section a by focusing,for purposes of interest computation,on whether the government had the use of offsetting taxpayer funds in any tax account 
to be sure,a district court and a bankruptcy court have reached the result that fleetboston urges upon us in this case.in otis spunkmeyer,united states,civ,the district court held that a taxpayer election to credit overpayments of its reported taxes to the succeeding years did not increase the taxpayer unpaid taxes for purposes of section a when the credit elects were not needed to satisfy any tax liability.the court ruled that the use of money principle absolves the taxpayer of any obligation to pay interest while the irs had in its possession funds offsetting deficiencies.the bankruptcy court in in re vendell healthcare,reached a similar conclusion on similar facts.
we find those cases unpersuasive because we conclude that congress did not enact a broad principle for purposes of computing underpayment interest,but instead enacted a specific set of rules and authorized the secretary of the treasury to adopt additional regulations governing the computation of underpayment interest in particular settings,such as in the case of credit elect overpayments.invoking the broad principle,those cases have in effect created a judicial exception to the governing statutory and regulatory scheme.they disregard both the meaning of the term paid in the internal revenue code and the regulatory scheme under which a credit elect overpayment will be deemed to reside in the tax account for the succeeding year,even if it is not needed to pay estimated tax in that year.the principle,which is merely a principle of statutory construction,can not be used to trump the specific statutory scheme congress has devised.see marsh mclennan united states.
finally,fleetboston appeals to equity.it argues,with some force,that the regime it envisions would be equitable,in that the government would not be entitled to interest on one tax account while holding excess funds in a different account,free of any obligation to pay interest to the taxpayer.the regime that fleetboston describes,however,is not the regime created by the pertinent statutes and regulations.those legal prescriptions,not general notions of rough equity,govern this highly technical tax question and require that we rule in favor of the government.
to construe section a as a broad directive to follow general principles of equity would render the statute unmanageably.if fairness requires that underpayment interest on a tax deficiency cease running when the irs has use of offsetting overpayments,the same principle of fairness would seem to require that underpayment interest cease running whenever the government has use of any of a taxpayer funds.but the government can come into temporary possession of private funds in a wide variety of circumstances in which it does not pay the taxpayer interest during the time of its possession.fleetboston does not argue that all such payments are available to suspend statutory underpayment interest.yet fleetboston offers no limit on its theory that would avoid the need to create a distinction between income tax overpayments and other private funds held by government entities for purposes of suspension.
in sum,we hold that the trial court correctly concluded that an amount of tax is paid within the meaning of section a only by funds in the taxpayer account for that tax year.in light of the fact that fleetboston overpayments of reported tax for and were applied to its tax accounts for subsequent years,underpayment interest under section a was properly charged on the deficiencies created by fleetboston and credit elections.fleetboston has not shown that any overpayments of estimated tax or income tax for later tax years ever resided in its and tax accounts those overpayments therefore never suspended the underpayment interest due for and.
there are plausible grounds for disagreement over precisely when fleetboston and credit elect overpayments were applied to its tax accounts for the following years.the regulations say that a credit elect overpayment shall be applied against the immediately succeeding year estimated tax,but they do not say precisely when during that succeeding year the credit elects are applied to that year tax account.the irs decided in this case that because the succeeding years income taxes were due on march,the credit elects were effective at the latest on the march deadline for payment of the income taxes.we need not address whether each credit elect became effective at some earlier point within the succeeding year,because the government does not argue for an earlier date thus,we sustain the trial court decision that the interest attributable to the underpayments resulting from the credit elects for and was properly calculated for each taxable year from the march due dates for the succeeding years income taxes.
independent of its primary argument on appeal,fleetboston argues that it is entitled to payment netting under section d of the code,d.that section provides for a net interest rate of zero during overlapping periods in which overpayment interest is allowable and underpayment interest is payable.the court of federal claims correctly held that fleetboston is not entitled to retroactive application of section d.
that section was enacted in and is ordinarily not given retroactive application.it can apply retroactively,however,if certain requirements are met.in particular,the taxpayer seeking retroactive application must not later than december,request the secretary of the treasury to apply section.pub,c,stat.as the court of federal claims noted,there is no evidence that fleetboston did so.rather,fleetboston argues that the irs waived compliance with this requirement in two ways.
first,fleetboston argues that an irs revenue proceeding waives the writing requirement.it plainly does not.rather,it simply provides that in certain circumstances a letter or written statement making the request for retroactive application can be submitted in place of a specific form.proc,wl.
second,fleetboston points out that the government did not argue in the trial court that fleetboston failed to comply with the retroactivity requirements.that is true,but it was fleetboston that raised in the first instance its failure to comply with the formalities required for retroactive application of section d,arguing that those requirements should be waived.mem.supp.pl.mot.partial summ.opp def.mot.summ.the government silence thus did not prejudice fleetboston,and it should have been no surprise that the court of federal claims would rest its decision on a weakness that fleetboston raised in its own case.
in this case of income tax overpayment and underpayment,the question on appeal is the taxpayer obligation to pay interest on underpaid income tax,as later determined by audit,when a tax overpayment for the same tax period and amount was already
