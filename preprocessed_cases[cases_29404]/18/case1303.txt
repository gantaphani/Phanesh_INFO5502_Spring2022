introduction 
often,it is the federal courts,applying federal law,that wrestle with claims of securities fraud involving a stock.here,plaintiffs of various states allege defendants,securities firms headquartered on the east coast,violated california and new jersey law through their involvement in massive naked short selling of overstock shares.the trial court sustained demurrers to plaintiffs new jersey racketeer influence and corrupt organizations rico claim without leave to amend and subsequently granted summary judgment on plaintiffs california market manipulation claims.
we affirm the dismissal of the belatedly raised new jersey rico claim.we also affirm the summary judgment as to three of the four defendants,but reverse as to merrill lynch professional clearing corporation.the evidence,although slight,raises a triable issue this firm effected a series of transactions in california and did so for the purpose of inducing others to trade in the manipulated stock.in reaching this disposition,we conclude corporations code section,subdivision b,reaches not only beneficial sellers and buyers of stock,but also can reach firms that execute,clear and settle trades.however,as we further explain,such firms face liability in a private action for damages only if they engage in conduct beyond aiding and abetting securities fraud,such that they are a primary actor in the manipulative trading.
ii.factual and procedural background 
plaintiffs are,an online retailer,and seven of its investors.in their fourth amended complaint,plaintiffs alleged defendants intentionally depressed the price of overstock stock by effecting naked short sales that is,sales of shares the brokerage houses and their clients never actually owned or borrowed.this practice,and specifically perpetuating the naked short positions by means of exotic trading schemes,allegedly increased the apparent supply of the stock,lead to a pile on of further short sales,and thereby decreased the stock value including the value of shares plaintiffs sold.plaintiffs claimed defendants conduct violated corporations code sections and business and professions code sections and and new jersey rico statute c c d.to put plaintiffs allegations and the nature of the evidence proffered during the summary judgment proceedings in context,we start with an overview of how securities transactions unfold,naked short sales,and the security and exchange commission sec efforts to prohibit abusive short selling.
steps in a securities transaction 
securities transactions involve a number of steps.these include,among others,executing a trade order,clearing a trade,and settling a trade.see generally henry minnerop,clearing arrangements bus.law,minnerop t.
execution is the process of reaching agreement on the terms of a transaction.this includes,for a buyer,not only finding the best price,but also choosing the right seller given the size of the order,the nature of the security being traded,and the costs and fees associated with the trade.see newton merrill,lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir,fn.execution can be accomplished manually or automatically by computer.see domestic securities,in the nasdaq marketplace,buyers and sellers can automatically execute trades against quoted prices.
upon execution,the actual transaction has only begun.thereafter,several steps must be taken to complete the course of dealing.these steps are typically the responsibility of a clearing agency associated with a given stock exchange.bradford nat.clearing securities and exchange commission,fn.bradford.the clearing agency has three functions.first,the agency compares submissions of the seller broker with those of the buyer to make sure that there is a common understanding of the terms of the trade.following this process,the resulting compared trade is cleared.most simply,this amounts to the clearing agency advising the selling and buying brokers,respectively,of their delivery and payment obligations.ibid.
the final,settlement,stage in the process involves the delivery of securities certificates to the purchasing broker and the payment of money to the selling broker.modernization of this task has led to storage of most stock certificates in a depository affiliated with the clearing agency.thus,delivery amounts to a bookkeeping entry that removes the security from one account and places it in another.bradford,supra,at,fn.see also norman poser,the stock exchanges of the united states and europe automation,globalization,and consolidation.int l econ.
some firms,known as clearing firms,specialize in postexecution,back office clearing and settling of trades in conjunction with the appropriate clearing agency,in which the clearing firm is a participant.such firms may provide these services to introducing brokerage firms on a basis dillon militano,douglas branson,nibbling at the edges regulation of short selling policing fails to deliver and restoration of an uptick rule bus.law,see also a defining clearing agency and participant.their services tend to include extending credit in margin accounts providing written confirmation of executed orders to customers receiving or delivering funds or securities from or to customers maintaining books and records that reflect transactions,including rendering monthly or periodic statements of account to customers providing custody of funds and securities in customer accounts clearing and settling transactions effected in customer accounts.minnerop,supra,bus.law.at.
b.the parties 
overstock sold shares in may and december through public offerings arranged by a san francisco firm,hambrecht.the other seven plaintiffs are individuals who sold overstock shares in,and.
there are four defendants,two related goldman entities and two related merrill entities.their ordinary activities can be understood with reference to the stages in a securities transaction discussed above.
goldman,sachs hereinafter goldman brokerage executes,clears,and settles securities transactions.its operations are centered in new jersey and new york.in some cases,goldman brokerage performs execution,clearance,and settlement for a single transaction.in other cases,its clients execute elsewhere and goldman brokerage provides only clearance and settlement services.goldman brokerage also houses a securities lending department which procures and supplies stock associated with certain transactions,including,as explained below,short sales.in this case,goldman brokerage execution of certain client trades and its own purchase of certain securities in connection with its securities lending business are primarily at issue.
goldman sachs execution clearing,hereinafter goldman clearing likewise executes,clears,and settles securities transactions.it is an and a member of the national securities clearing corporation.it is headquartered in new jersey and has significant operations there,and in new york and chicago.it offers its clearing services to other,hedge funds,and institutions.in this case,goldman clearing clearing and settlement services are primarily at issue.
merrill lynch,pierce fenner smith hereinafter merrill brokerage,like its goldman brokerage counterpart,provides various investment services and runs a stock lending department that borrows and lends securities.this department conducts its borrowing,lending,and related transactional activity in new york and illinois.as with goldman brokerage,it is merrill brokerage trade execution and lending operations connected to naked short sales that are primarily at issue.
merrill lynch professional clearing hereinafter merrill clearing,like its goldman clearing counterpart,provides various investment services and is an and a member of the national securities clearing corporation.merrill clearing is a subsidiary of merrill brokerage.it is headquartered in new york and has a substantial presence in new jersey and illinois.it also has a san francisco customer service office.merrill clearing offers only limited execution services,and most merrill clearing clients execute their own trades.merrill clearing uses merrill brokerage to procure stocks needed to settle or close out a transaction.as with goldman clearing,merrill clearing clearing and settlement operations are primarily at issue here.
naked short selling 
in a short sale,the seller sells stock the seller does not own.it is a bet against the stock.in an ordinary short sale,the seller borrows stock from a lender such as a brokerage firm lending department,sells this stock to a buyer at the going price,and then purchases replacement stock hopefully at a lower price to return to the lender.lenders typically charge a borrow fee for lending shares to sell short.the seller profits if the stock price falls enough to cover all costs and fees associated with the sale,including borrowing the stock.otherwise,if the stock price rises or does not fall enough to cover the costs and fees,the short seller suffers a loss.if the short seller never delivers the stock to the buyer,a fail to deliver occurs.the sale nonetheless appears on the seller and buyer books,and is then termed a naked short sale.
stocks that are also called negative rebate stocks can command high borrow fees,given their scarcity and desirability for short selling.during the and timeframe,overstock was a particularly security,and shares of the company commanded a negative rebate of up to percent of its value on an annualized basis.thus,any trader hoping to profit from selling short would ordinarily need to recoup the borrow fees through a significant decline in the price of the security.in naked short sales,however,there is no borrowing and thus no borrow fee,and it is significantly easier to make a profit.
short selling,itself,is lawful.gfl advantage fund,colkitt cir,gfl.even short sales resulting in fails to deliver are not necessarily nefarious and occasionally occur in the regular press of market activity.cohen stevanovich d,cohen allegations of failures to deliver,without more,are insufficient to state a claim for market manipulation.in cohen,the alleged naked short selling activity was untethered to any distort tion to the price of the stock at issue and so did not constitute willful conduct designed to deceive or defraud investors with regard to market activity.id.at.similarly,in sullivan long,scattered cir,the short selling of more shares than could be obtained could not be viewed as manipulative when,under the peculiar circumstances,the selling drove the stock down to the correct market price,given the terms of a restructuring agreement.
but there are situations in which intentional naked short selling can be employed to manipulate the market.see cohen,supra,d at pp.fails to deliver can occur for a variety of legitimate reasons,and flexibility is necessary in order to ensure an orderly market and to facilitate liquidity,but some fails may be a potential problem when willfully combined with something more to create a false impression of how market participants value a security hyperdynamics southridge capital management,llc,fn.noting naked short sales could depress the price of a target company shares in re adler,coleman clearing d,the court is persuaded that the evidence sufficiently establishes that diprimo conduct,under gurian control,amounted to concerted,naked short selling whose purpose was to drive down the price of hanover house stocks regulation sho proposed release,sec rel,amendments to regulation sho,large and persistent fails to deliver can be indicative of manipulative naked short selling,which could be used as a tool to drive down a company stock price.the perception of such manipulative conduct also may undermine the confidence of investors.thus,in gfl,supra,at pages,the third circuit suggested naked short selling would be actionable if it caused an artificial depression in price,by,for instance,injection of inaccurate information or creation of a false impression of supply and demand,such as by means of matched buy and sell orders to create a misleading appearance of active trading.
regulation sho regulating abusive short sales 
the sec began to focus on naked short selling and its potential abuses in and.see charles walker,colin forbes,sec enforcement actions and issuer litigation in the context of a short attack bus.law,relating history of sec regulation of short sales,particularly through regulation sho.it recognized manipulative short selling could pose problems for the markets and took steps to restrict or prohibit it in various situations.see regulation sho proposed release,sec rel,short sales,sec rel,amendments to regulation sho,sec rel,emergency order,sec rel.july.pet quarters,depository trust and clearing cir,fn.
in its proposal to regulate,the sec warned naked short selling can have a number of negative effects on the market,particularly when the fails to deliver persist for an extended period of time and result in a significantly large unfulfilled delivery obligation at the clearing agency where trades are settled.at times,the amount of fails to deliver may be greater than the total public float.in effect the naked short seller unilaterally converts a securities contract which should settle in three days after the trade date into an undated contract,which the buyer might not have agreed to or that would have been priced differently.the seller failure to deliver securities may also adversely affect certain rights of the buyer,such as the right to vote.more significantly,naked short sellers enjoy greater leverage than if they were required to borrow securities and deliver within a reasonable time period,and they may use this additional leverage to engage in trading activities that deliberately depress the price of a security.regulation sho proposed release,sec rel,fn.omitted.
the following year,in,the sec adopted regulation sho which imposes two requirements locate and delivery aimed at curtailing intentional naked short sales.electronic trading group,llc banc of america securities llc cir,electronic trading,citing.the regulation first imposes a locate requirement see b i iii a broker or dealer may not accept a short sale order in an equity security from another person unless the broker or dealer has i b orrowed the security,or entered into a arrangement to borrow the security or ii r easonable grounds to believe that the security can be borrowed so that it can be delivered on the date delivery is due.the regulation sho also imposes a delivery requirement see b with certain enumerated exceptions,i f a participant of a registered clearing agency has a fail to deliver position in a threshold security for thirteen consecutive settlement days,the participant shall immediately thereafter close out the fail to deliver position by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity.electronic trading,supra,at pp.
in other words,regulation sho requires brokers to have a reasonable belief they can locate the shares to be sold short and requires participants,clearing firms to deliver shares on a timely basis.bona fide market makers trades,however,are exempt from the locate requirement b iii.thus,market makers and their brokers,when engaged in legitimate trading,can commence a short sale without first worrying about whether they have ready access to the shares.the delivery requirement,in turn,only applies to threshold securities,meaning certain listed securities already suffering numerous fails to deliver c,and clearing firms can reasonably delegate the obligation to deliver shares to bona fide market maker clients.b vi see also short sales,release,available at wl.overstock,at all relevant times,was a threshold security.
sec and exchange actions against market maker clients of defendants 
following the enactment of regulation sho,the sec and several exchanges brought enforcement actions against a number of market participants for violating locate and delivery requirements,including two market maker clients of defendants,steven hazan and scott arenstein.while hazan and arenstein purported to be bona fide market makers,in fact,they were not.
hazan,a new york resident,was sanctioned in an august,sec order for violating both locate and delivery requirements.in re the matter of hazan capital,llc,sec release,available at wl.among numerous other findings,the commission found hazan was not acting as a bona fide market maker and violated regulation sho when executing riskless and profitable reverse conversion trades and related reset trades.
in the reverse conversion trades,hazan would sell short a threshold security to a counterparty.he would also buy from that counterparty a call option in the security and sell to that counterparty a put option in the security,such that he would eliminate all market risk associated with the short sale.because all three components of the reverse conversion were priced interdependently,hazan was assured an profit.meanwhile,the counterparty for instance,a brokerage firm such as goldman brokerage or merrill brokerage was willing to pay this price to hazan to obtain on its books shares of the threshold security,which it could lend for a profit until the put and call options expired.consequently explained the sec,prime brokers created the demand for the reverse conversion to create inventory for stock loans on hard to borrow securities and options market makers like hazan fed this demand.
hazan employed additional nefarious trading practices to insure the short sale portions of the reverse conversions remained naked over time.specifically,when alerted by clearing firms of his regulation sho obligation to deliver shares so settlement could occur,hazan engaged in sham reset transactions that only gave the appearance of delivery,while actually perpetuating his undelivered short positions.hazan would obtain the necessary shares for delivery by buying from another market maker who was also selling short and who similarly never intended to deliver shares to hazan.meanwhile,hazan would pair or hedge his new purchase with option trades,creating what the sec called married puts or,sometimes using flex options.even though hazan clearing firm a firm such as goldman clearing or merrill clearing would not receive actual delivery of the shares,it nevertheless would record the transactions as generating a close out and a new long position.there was also an appearance of delivery of the purchased shares back to the other market maker who had never delivered them in the first place.in the end,hazan would reestablish his previous short position,still naked,while succeeding in having the regulation sho delivery clock,in the clearing firms eyes,reset to day one.as settlement dates approached again and again,hazan would repeat this process until the options on the original reverse conversion trade expired or were assigned,thus finally closing out the short position and eliminating the synthetic long position that the short position had hedged.
hazan pocketed over million through his trading strategy.the sec ordered him to disgorge it,enjoined him from further violations of regulation sho,censured his organization and barred him from association with any broker or dealer,with the right to for association after five years.the new york stock exchange issued a similar order regarding the same conduct.hearing board decisions nyse amex llc amex and amex,nyse arca,arca and arca.nyse amex and nyse arca imposed in penalties,and barred hazan from membership and association with any member for seven years.
arenstein was sanctioned in a june order issued by the american stock exchange ase.in the matter of scott arenstein,amex case.he admitted engaging in the same reverse conversions and sham reset transactions as hazan and made at least million from his unlawful trades.the ase ordered disgorgement,assessed a million fine,and barred him from membership and associating with any member for five years.
in,keystone,another purported market maker and a goldman clearing client,was sanctioned by the nasdaq for engaging in the same kind of sham reset transactions.o n the very same day keystone would be by keystone clearing firm,keystone,on over fifty occasions would negate the clearing firm and contradict guidance provided by the securities and exchange commission requiring that it be a net purchaser of the open fail position in the security by selling near equivalent number of shares.keystone was required to disgorge million in profits,pay a fine,and suffer a censure and suspension in a supervisory capacity.john pickford,enforcement counsel,nasdaq omx phlx,notice of disciplinary action against keystone trading partners to members,member organizations,participants and participant organizations re finra matter and enforcement.
in short,there is no question hazan,arenstein and keystone,purported market maker clients of defendants,engaged in abusive naked short selling and flagrant violations of the federal securities laws.
the sec has continued to target abusive naked short selling,recently pursuing not only traders,but the firms that enabled their manipulative trading.the sec pulled no punches in this regard in in the matter of optionsxpress,et,in which it ruled the brokerage firm violated regulation sho in connection with sham reset transactions,similar to those just discussed,designed to avoid delivery because the firm knew shares that were the subject of a buy were shares for it client account that were the subject of simultaneous calls,which would be exercised and assigned so that no shares were delivered to the clearing agency,optionsxpress engaged in a sham of its fail to deliver position optionsxpress did not close out its fail to deliver positions by executing consecutive transactions and willfully violated rules and.feldman the client did not mislead those he dealt with at various clearing brokers who knew,directly or indirectly,that he was not going to the deliver securities if his calls were exercised and assigned however,the market as a whole did not have this knowledge.see wharf holdings united int l holdings,to sell an option while secretly intending not to permit the option exercise is misleading,because a buyer normally presumes good faith.walling beverly,cir entering into a contract of sale with the secret reservation not to fully perform it is fraud cognizable under b.d fraud and deceit f raud may consist of the creation of a false impression by words or acts,fns.omitted.in the matter of optionsxpress,et,release june,available at wl.
f.the instant lawsuit 
pleadings and demurrer to new jersey rico claim 
plaintiffs filed suit against merrill brokerage and merrill clearing,and goldman brokerage and goldman clearing in,based largely on their suspected involvement in the hazan and arenstein trading schemes.plaintiffs third amended complaint,filed in april,alleged several causes of action,including as relevant here,violations of california corporate securities law et.
in december,plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file a fourth amended complaint,seeking to add a cause of action under new jersey rico statute against the merrill and goldman defendants.according to plaintiffs,the new rico claim was simply a new theory based on facts unearthed late in discovery on their california securities claims.
defendants,though wary of the new complaint,ultimately chose to acquiesce in its filing and entered into a stipulation with plaintiffs,which became an order of the trial court in january.in the stipulation,the parties recited their conflicting positions on the motion for leave to amend defendants believed the fourth amended complaint was defective and prejudicial,while plaintiffs did not and noted the court tentative inclination,expressed at a case management conference,to address any issues of prejudice by continuing the trial date.the stipulation also expressly stated defendants were not waiving,and expressly reserve d,all rights to file in response to the fourth amended complaint any and all pleadings,motions,and other responses on any grounds available under law or equity.the complaint was deemed filed,and the trial date was continued for approximately three months,to december.
as advertised,and as pertinent here,plaintiffs fourth amended complaint violations of sections and and additionally alleged a violation of new jersey rico statute c c d.
defendants demurred to the new jersey rico claim,arguing california law,not new jersey law,should apply and,in any case,plaintiffs failed to state a claim under the new jersey law.they did not ask the trial court to dismiss the new complaint based on prejudicial delay,but sought denial of further leave to amend on that ground.ruling from the bench on may,the trial court concluded the allegations about conduct in new jersey were vague and conclusory,did not disclose whether actionable trade or commerce occurred in that state,and thus failed to state a claim.
the trial court also found such lack of detail in the pleadings so close to trial pernicious to defendants.however,rather than denying leave to amend outright,it allowed plaintiffs to submit a proposed fifth amended complaint,stating it would consider granting leave based on the contents of the proposed pleading.plaintiffs promptly submitted a proposed amended complaint with over pages of additional allegations in support of their new jersey rico claim.
after extensive briefing and a lengthy hearing,the trial court,on august,denied leave to file the proposed fifth amended complaint.it cited two grounds granting leave to add the new rico claim would prejudice defendants on the eve of trial and the rico claim would be futile because the facts as alleged do not warrant the application of new jersey rico law to this case under california principles.
summary judgment on the corporations code and ucl claims 
two weeks later,on august,the defendants moved for summary judgment on the remaining causes of action,including those based on california securities laws.
defendants advanced several arguments as to plaintiffs securities claims no actionable conduct occurred in california,defendants did not effect any stock transactions,defendants conduct was not manipulative,defendants did not act for the purpose of inducing others to trade in a manipulated stock,defendants conduct did not cause any decline in overstock share price and thus did not result in injury to plaintiffs,and federal securities laws and regulations preempted the claims.we do not discuss the parties extensive evidentiary showing here,but do so in the next section in discussing the merits of the motions.
the trial court heard three days of argument on evidentiary objections to the documents filed in connection with the summary judgment motions and a full day of argument on the merits.in an order dated january,the court granted the motions.as to the securities claims relevant here,the court ruled plaintiffs failed to raise any triable issue of material fact supportive of finding that any act by any defendant foundational to liability,causation,or damages occurred in california.the court declined to reach any of the other grounds for judgment defendants had urged.it issued a final,comprehensive order on april and entered judgment the following day.
iii.discussion 
on appeal,plaintiffs seek reversal of the dismissal of their new jersey rico claim and reversal of the summary judgment on their california corporate securities law claims.
new jersey rico claim 
as recited above,in exchange for a continuance of the trial date,defendants acquiesced to the filing of the fourth amended complaint with plaintiffs newly asserted new jersey rico claim,while reserving the right to challenge the complaint by answer,motion,or otherwise.the trial court then employed a somewhat unusual,but not unprecedented,process to assess defendants demurrer to the new jersey claim and determine whether to allow further amendment.it first sustained the demurrer,concluding plaintiffs failed to adequately allege actionable conduct in new jersey.the court also worried the paucity of specifics prejudiced defendants given the impending trial date.it therefore solicited a proposed fifth amended complaint and set a briefing schedule on leave to amend.after reviewing the proposed amended complaint,considering the supplemental briefing,and hearing further argument,the court denied leave to amend.it concluded the new jersey rico claim as fleshed out in the proposed amended complaint was so different from what had been previously alleged that belatedly injecting it into the litigation would be seriously prejudicial to the defendants.it also concluded choice of law principles prohibited application of new jersey rico law to defendants alleged conduct.
demurrer to fourth amended complaint 
given how events unfolded,we first address whether the fourth amended complaint,standing alone,adequately stated a new jersey rico claim.
the trial court gave several reasons for concluding the pleading was lacking plaintiffs did not adequately allege trade or commerce in new jersey,or conduct affecting trade or commerce in new jersey.the allegations of conduct by alleged enterprises were vague and conclusory.plaintiffs identified some,but not all,of the conspiring market makers.the conspiracy allegations were vague and conclusory.
lack of specificity,alone,was sufficient reason to sustain the demurrers.in new jersey,it is unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in or activities of which affect trade or commerce to conduct or participate,directly or indirectly,in the conduct of the enterprise affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.c.to be liable,a defendant must have been employed by or associated with a racketeering enterprise which engaged in trade or commerce in new jersey or affected trade or commerce in new jersey.state casilla.as pertinent,r acketeering activity means any of the following crimes which are crimes under the laws of new jersey or are equivalent crimes under the laws of any other jurisdiction p fraud in the offering,sale or purchase of securities.a p,italics added.thus,plaintiffs new jersey rico claim was predicated on fraudulent conduct.
claims under another state substantive law,if raised in a california forum,are subject to california procedures for judicial administration,including its pleading standards.see hambrecht quist venture partners american medical,th,fn.gervase superior court th,fn.state pleading law applies to federal rico claim,so long as it does not impose undue barriers to bringing federal claim in state court.
under california pleading rules,fraud must be pled with particularity quelimane stewart title guaranty cal th.thus,it is not enough to allege a defendant engaged in fraudulent conduct to execute the aforesaid fraudulent scheme or in relation with such a scheme.sepulveda,supra,th at.but that is all plaintiffs did in their fourth amended complaint,alleging only i n engaging in the actions described above,each of the rico defendants engaged in a least two incidents of racketeering by engaging in fraud in the offering,sale or purchase of securities.
while the pleading spoke broadly of a scheme in which defendants and market makers colluded to use conversions and other exotic trades to inflate the ostensible supply of overstock shares and drive down their price presumably the actions described above the fourth amended complaint did not assign any particular action to any particular act of alleged fraud in the offering,sale or purchase of securities.nor did any portion of the complaint disclose a specific instance of allegedly fraudulent conduct see goldrich natural y surgical specialties,th,even in a case involving numerous misrepresentations,the plaintiff must,at a minimum,set out a representative selection of the alleged misrepresentations sufficient to permit the trial court to ascertain whether the statements were material and otherwise actionable.
accordingly,the trial court correctly concluded plaintiffs failed to plead their new jersey rico claim with the requisite specificity and properly sustained defendants demurrers.
denial of leave to amend 
in blank kirwan,the supreme court stated with respect to an order denying leave to amend,we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment if it can be,the trial court has abused its discretion and we reverse if not,there has been no abuse of discretion and we affirm.blank kirwan cal d,kirwan.plaintiffs read this language as establishing a rigid,rule that a trial court,following the sustaining of a demurrer,must always allow an amendment that ostensibly cures a pleading defect,regardless of any other consideration,including how late in the litigation the amendment is offered and the degree of prejudice to the defense.we do not agree this is a fair reading of kirwan or that the case forecloses the particular procedural process the court employed here to fully understand the nature of plaintiffs new jersey rico claim and to assess whether its belated injection into the case would be unduly prejudicial to the defense.
when a demurrer is sustained,the court may grant leave to amend the pleading upon any terms as may be just.code civ,subd.c,italics added.accordingly,trial courts are statutorily imbued with wide discretion in the matter of amendment.see leader health industries of america,th,a litigant does not have a positive right to amend his pleading after a demurrer thereto has been sustained.his leave to amend afterward is always of grace,not of right.whitson city of long beach d,same.it has long been recognized a court can take into account the number of amendments already allowed.see consolidated concessions mcconnell,there is a limit to which the patience of the trial court may be extended in the matter of allowing repeated attempts to amend a faulty pleading.and at least one case considering leave to amend following a demurrer explicitly recognized the relevance of prejudice california courts have a policy of great liberality in allowing amendments at any stage of the proceeding so as to dispose of cases upon their substantial merits where the authorization does not prejudice the substantial rights of others.douglas superior court,supra,d at,italics added.in kirwan,the supreme court addressed only the plaintiff many contentions he could amend to state a viable claim.no countervailing considerations,such as timing and prejudice,were raised,and the court had no occasion to,nor did it,consider any such matters.kirwan,supra,cal d at pp.
furthermore,countless cases involving motions for leave to amend outside of the demurrer context motions that similarly implicate a trial court discretion code civ,subd.a routinely analyze prejudice,duchrow forrest th,magpali farmers group,th,it is apparent that adding the new cause of action would have changed the tenor and complexity of the complaint from its original focus on representations and demands made to magpali by his superiors to an exploration of farmers activities and practices in the entire southern california area.estate of murphy d,where inexcusable delay and probable prejudice to the opposing party is indicated,the trial court exercise of discretion in denying a proposed amendment should not be disturbed.
in this case,the trial court was not considering pleadings filed at or near the outset of the litigation,the usual context in which a demurrer is interposed and where prejudice is not an issue.rather,here,the court was dealing with a context equivalent to a motion for leave to amend,namely a request to file an amended pleading very late in the litigation.indeed,the court expressed serious concern about prejudice at the time plaintiffs sought leave to file their fourth amended complaint adding their new rico claim.and on discerning the full magnitude of the claim proffered in the fifth amended complaint,the court concluded it was not just another theory as they had represented in connection with their fourth amended complaint.rather,it was a fundamentally different and highly complex claim that could not fairly be injected into the case only two months before summary judgment motions were due and only six months before the already trial date.under these circumstances,the court did not abuse its discretion in denying leave to amend.
contrary to plaintiffs protestations,it is neither accurate nor fair to say the proposed fifth amended complaint simply fleshed out the general allegations of the fourth amended complaint and raised no specter of complexity not already apparent in that latter pleading.while the fourth amended complaint focused on an alleged conspiracy between defendants,hazan and arenstein,and other unnamed traders and market makers,the fifth amended complaint added allegations about several market makers.while the fourth amended complaint alleged five criminal enterprises,the proposed fifth amended complaint alleged ten.although the fourth amended complaint and proposed fifth amended complaint both alleged a conspiracy to violate new jersey rico statute,the fourth amended complaint only conclusorily pleaded each defendant conspired,while the proposed fifth amended complaint,for the first time,alleged which defendants allegedly conspired with which market makers.and not only did the proposed fifth amended complaint allege various iterations of conspiracies to violate new jersey rico statute between the defendants and hazan and arenstein,it also alleged conspiracies between the market makers and defendants.
in addition,the proposed fifth amended complaint made manifest the new jersey rico claim was based on conspiracy and indirect liability.while secondary conspiracy liability is a feature of a new jersey rico claim c d state cagno,it is not,as discussed in the next section of this opinion,a feature of the california securities claims under sections and that had long been the principal claims in the case see kamen lindly th kamen california amplifier,rli ins.th,california amplifier noting legislative decision to exclude aiders and abettors from liability.indeed,plaintiffs had repeatedly emphasized their california law claims did not hinge on the liability of the market makers,but depended solely on the defendants own primary conduct.further,it was apparent from the proposed fifth amended complaint there would be a focus on additional new jersey laws governing defendants alleged predicate acts of racketeering.
in short,with the proposed fifth amended complaint,the trial court saw clearly the road ahead if a new jersey rico claim was belatedly added to the litigation and accurately observed that road looked extremely complex.the court did not abuse its discretion in denying leave to file the proposed pleading 
california corporate securities law claim 
sections and

section,subdivisions a through e,address different species of manipulative conduct which were common during the pool operations in the.kamen,supra,th at.for instance,section,subdivision a prohibits wash sales,the entering of purchase and sale orders of equal amounts in order to create the appearance of active trading and raise or depress the price of a security.subdivisions c and e deal with tipster sheets where either a or other person engaged in the pool operations,or a third person employed by the principals,disseminates information that the price of a security will rise or fall because of the market operations of the pool.see marsh volk,supra.
t he more general and fundamental prohibitions of section are set forth in subdivisions b and d.marsh volk,supra.subdivision b makes it unlawful t o effect,alone or with one or more other persons,a series of transactions in any security creating actual or apparent active trading in such security or raising or depressing the price of such security for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of the security by others,subd.b.subdivision d makes it unlawful for sellers or buyers of stock to make false or misleading statements of material facts for the purpose of inducing a purchase or sale.diamond,supra,cal th at.
in this case,we are concerned with subdivision b,which makes it unlawful t o effect a series of transactions that create actual or apparent active trading raising or depressing the price of the security,for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others,subd.b.since a lmost any conceivable series of transactions in a particular security would necessarily create either actual or apparent trading or raise or depress the price of the security to some extent,the crucial question is intent.marsh volk,supra,d california amplifier,supra,th at pp.as marsh volk emphasizes,liability under section extends to everyone whose market trades are affected by the market manipulation i n view of this potentially enormous and virtually unlimited liability,intention is a necessary qualification of the defendant liability.
before examining the evidence presented in connection with the summary judgment motions as to the two brokerage firms and two clearing firms,we discuss two legal issues that are pivotal to the significance of the evidence.the first is the meaning of the term t o effect a series of transactions in a security,subd.b,emphasis added.the second is the distinction between liability as a principal,and aider and abettor liability.see california amplifier,supra,th at a private civil action under sections and does not reach aiders and abettors.
effecting a trade under section is not limited to beneficial sellers and buyers 
defendants contend section,subdivision b,reaches only the beneficial sellers and buyers of manipulated securities and does not reach entities that execute,clear and settle trades for clients.thus,according to the defendant clearing firms,for example,no section,subdivision b,claim can lie against them as a matter of law.rather,any claim under this subdivision would have to be advanced against their former trader clients,such as hazan and arenstein,in whose name the manipulative trades were made and who have been punished by the sec and major exchanges.
subdivision b could have been drafted to apply only to beneficial sellers and buyers.but it was not.rather,this subdivision applies to any person,directly or indirectly who effect s,alone or with one or more other persons,a series of transactions,subd b,italics added.this is in stark contrast to other provisions of section that apply to narrower classes of persons,subd.a subdivision a applies to those who effect transactions,while subdivision a and a apply only to those who enter an order or orders,subds.c,d both applying only to a or other person selling or offering for sale or purchasing or offering to purchase the security.
the verb to effect means to bring about produce as a result cause accomplish.webster new world dict.college ed.people brown d.a,in turn,is defined under california securities law as any person engaged in the business of effecting transactions in securities in this state for the account of others or for his own account,subd.a,italics added.thus,the plain language of the securities laws contemplates those effecting a transaction can include someone other than the beneficial seller or buyer,and can include.
section of the sea,on which section was based,also uses the terminology effect a series of transactions a,and that terminology is construed broadly united states weisscredit banca commerciale e.the legislative history of the sea shows the term effect as used in section of the act and other sections means to participate in a transaction whether as principal,agent,or both,cong d sess,italics added see also loss et,securities regulation,ed sec release,available at wl.
moreover,reading section to reach,as appropriate,agents of beneficial sellers and buyers also harmonizes the section with other provisions of the sea and its regulations,which,like california definitional statute,speak of brokers effecting transactions by carrying out various agency and functions,including clearing and settlement.see a a broker means any person engaged in the business of effecting transactions in securities for the account of others id.e c a person provides brokerage and research services insofar as he effects securities transactions and performs functions incidental thereto such as clearance,settlement,and custody t b for purposes of this section,a member effects a securities transaction when it performs any function in connection with the processing of that transaction,including,but not limited to,transmission of an order for execution,execution of the order,clearance and settlement of the transaction,and arranging for the performance of any such function.see also securities investor protection d,fn.it is the clearing broker who actually effectuates the trade.
we therefore conclude the word effect in section,subdivision b,includes more than the activity of beneficial sellers and buyers,and can include execution,clearing and settlement activities by brokerage and clearing firms.
kamen does not hold,contrary to what defendants maintain,that effecting a transaction refers only to beneficial sellers and buyers.indeed,the case does not even consider the meaning of the term effect in subdivision b.the complaint in kamen purport ed to state a cause of action under section,subdivision d.kamen,supra,th at,italics added.that subdivision,in contrast to subdivision b,prohibits a a or other person selling or offering for sale or purchasing or offering to purchase a security from making any false or misleading statement for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others,subd.d.while the defendants in kamen,a corporate officer and an accounting firm,were accused of making false statements about the company performance,neither sold or offered for sale any of the company shares.kamen,supra,th at.thus,neither was liable under the plain language of subdivision d,which is strikingly different from the language of subdivision b.kamen,at.
defendants also point out the authors of marsh volk were heavily involved in the drafting of the state securities laws,and their treatise states section generally reaches only those engaged in market activity.marsh volk,supra.the treatise then continues,s ubdivision a,dealing with matched orders,and subdivision b,dealing with liability for a series of transactions manipulating the price of a security,by their very nature require that the defendant be a purchaser or seller,since the conduct prohibited is associated with a market transaction.ibid.we have no disagreement with marsh volk general observation,as one can engage in market activity by executing,clearing and settling trades.however,for all the reasons we have discussed,we conclude marsh volk second statement is unsupported and incorrect.in fact,the treatise provides no analysis on this point,let alone any discussion of either the statutory language or the like provisions of section of the sea on which corporations code section was based.see diamond,supra,cal th at the marsh volk treatise can not be invoked in favor of a statutory interpretation contrary to a statute plain language.
primary versus aider and abettor liability 
having concluded any person who effect s a series of transactions can include not only beneficial sellers and buyers of shares,but also brokerage and clearing firms that execute,clear and settle the trades,we next consider under what circumstances brokerage and clearing firms can incur liability,given the rule that a private civil action under sections and does not reach aiders and abettors.rather,only primary actors are subject to civil liability for damages.kamen,supra,th at,citing central bank of denver,first interstate bank of denver,central bank holding no secondary liability under section b of the sea california amplifier,supra,th at to impose liability on persons who do not directly participate in a section violation would be contrary to the legislative decision to exclude aiders and abettors from section liability.compare,authorizing enforcement actions by commissioner of corporations and allowing aider and abettor liability in such actions 
as did kamen,we take guidance from central bank.the supreme court in central bank discussed section b of the sea and specifically its provision and concluded the absence of aiding and abetting liability does not mean that secondary actors in securities markets are always free from liability under the securities act.any person or entity,including a lawyer,accountant,or bank,who employs a manipulative device or makes a material misstatement or omission on which a purchaser or seller of securities relies may be liable as a primary violator,assuming all of the requirements for primary liability are met.in any complex securities fraud there are likely to be multiple violators central bank,supra,at see in re enron.securities,derivative erisa litigation d.
thus,section b liability has been imposed on brokerage and clearing firms when they have crossed the line from aider and abettor to primary violator,fox intern.relations fiserv securities,d,liability under section b possible when not engaging in mere ordinary clearing services in re mutual funds inv.litigation d,the trader defendants are alleged to have been involved in the section b fraudulent scheme from the outset and to have been at least one of its architects.moreover,unquestionably it is the trader defendants who received the profits that were siphoned off from the mutual funds as a result of late trades and market timed transactions.these are not the activities of a mere aider and abettor but those of a primary participant in the unlawful conduct in re blech securities litigation,blech ii plaintiffs have remedied the defects of their previous complaint by adding sufficient allegations to give rise to an inference that clearing firm bear stearns had actual knowledge of blech fraudulent conduct as well as a motive and opportunity for engaging in the scheme with blech and his confederates id.at bear stearns is alleged to have conceived of and participated in the initiation and clearing of sham transactions aimed at affecting the price of the blech securities.
in the blech cases,bear stearns,a clearing firm,was accused of market manipulation under section b for directing and clearing trades of an introducing firm client,blech.on the one hand,the trades were arguably legitimate efforts to reduce blech debt balance on bear stearns books on the other,they were arguably known by bear stearns to be propping up the price of the traded securities.blech ii,supra.at pp.in re blech securities litigation,civ rws wl,blech iii.in blech ii,the district court denied a motion to dismiss.while allegations bear stearns cleared or otherwise engaged in manipulative trades were insufficient to state a claim,as even knowingly processing the sham trades of others does not give rise to direct liability,additional allegations bear stearns directed the sales and cleared the resulting trades to its pecuniary benefit,and did so knowing blech fraudulent purpose,brought bear stearns into the realm of a primary violator.blech ii,supra.at pp.
in blech iii,bear stearns moved for summary judgment.evidence corroborated the plaintiffs allegations of bear stearns orchestration of the trades and knowledge of the manipulation of the market.not only did bear stearns direct trades,but it decided with blech who should be on the purchasing side of his sales blech iii,supra,wl,at.indeed,the plaintiffs alleged these demands forced parking and trading between blech accounts.id.at,italics added.bear stearns contended in turn,its actions with respect to debit demands were simply consistent with its agreement to serve as clearing broker,an agreement that,under nyse rule,allocated functions to bear stearns and compliance with rules and regulations to blech as an introducing broker.blech iii,at pp.
the district court acknowledged margin calls by a clearing broker or a failure to make margin calls,even with suspicion or knowledge of impropriety on the part of the initiating broker,is an appropriate and essential part of the securities business.blech iii,supra,wl,at.the court concluded,however,a n agreement to clear does not constitute an absolution from securities fraud and concluded t he contentions here go further.ibid.a margin call made with knowledge that it will cause the initiating broker to commit a securities fraud which must be cleared by the clearing broker,constitutes direct action in connection with a contrivance to manipulate a security.here that element of causality is at issue.ibid.
in in re mutual funds inv.litigation,the district court also discussed clearing firm liability and allowed a sea manipulation claim to proceed against two such firms when their activity extended beyond mere clearing services to providing clients with access to trading platforms that allowed for late trades and trades without time stamps.in re mutual funds inv.litigation,supra,d at.these acts are manipulative or deceptive on their face,and by virtue of the trades they enabled,they affected the worth of mutual fund shares.thus,they are the functional equivalent in the mutual fund industry of sham transactions that artificially affect market prices in more conventional contexts.citation.moreover,these alleged acts of deception,when considered with other allegations concerning the extent of bank of america and bear stearns activities on behalf of late traders and market timers,imply that bank of america and bear stearns did not merely assist in facilitating late trades and market timed transactions.rather,it is reasonably inferable that they participated in initiating,instigating,and orchestrating the scheme.if discovery demonstrates this to be so,bank of america and bear stearns face primary liability under central bank.ibid.
in contrast,clearing firms were absolved of liability in fezzani bear,stearns,d.the plaintiffs in that case alleged,much as in blech,that bear stearns engaged in market manipulation under section b because it knew of a client,baron,activities aimed at inflating stock prices and provided financial support to baron,and directed baron at times to sell the manipulated securities to the public.id.at pp.but in fezzani,the allegations d id not cross the threshold laid out in blech iii.id.at.all the complaint alleges is bear stearns knew of baron fraud and cleared the transactions that were fraudulently made there was no allegation bear stearns contrived and agreed to fund a manipulative scheme as in blech.fezzani,at.
scone investments,american third market,civ.sas wl,also distinguished the blech cases.in scone,a bank was alleged to have directed that securities be sold,not that the sale be effectuated by way of fraudulent misrepresentation.the bank liquidation demand is a far cry from the intimate involvement and participation in key decisions about the details of the sale which would render it a primary violator.scone,at pp.see abrams,supra,brook.at.
the second circuit recently addressed the normal clearing services standard in levitt morgan securities,cir,levitt,in reversing a class certification order.the circuit court concluded bear stearns had no duty to disclose a known fraud to the plaintiffs,clients of an introducing firm,sterling foster,which had a clearing agreement with bear stearns making sterling foster responsible for monitoring its customers.the plaintiffs maintained bear stearns knew of sterling foster plan to manipulate the market for a stock,ml direct,by misusing insider shares supposedly subject to a agreement.they further alleged bear sterns nonetheless agreed to clear transactions in these shares,extended sterling foster unsecured credit,failed to cancel trades as required by an sec regulation regulation t,and failed to disclose to purchasers sterling foster percent profit in the underwriting.id.at pp.
levitt observed courts have grouped clearing firm activity into two categories first,in cases where a clearing broker was simply providing normal clearing services,district courts have declined to impose liability on the clearing broker for the transgressions of the introducing broker.citations.the district courts have so held even if the clearing broker was alleged to have known that the introducing broker was committing fraud,citation even if the clearing broker was alleged to have been clearing sham trades for the introducing broker,in re blech.at and even if the clearing broker was alleged to have failed to enforce margin requirements against the introducing broker thereby allowing the introducing broker fraud to continue in violation of federal reserve and nyse rules,citation.levitt,supra,at.
in the second,much more limited category of cases,district courts have found plaintiffs allegations to be adequate and so have permitted claims to proceed where a clearing broker is alleged effectively to have shed its role as clearing broker and assumed direct control of the introducing firm operations and its manipulative scheme.thus in berwecky bear,stearns,the district court granted class certification in a suit brought by investors against clearing broker bear stearns for its role in the introducing firm scheme to defraud investors.the berwecky plaintiffs alleged that bear stearns asserted control over the introducing firm trading operations by,inter alia,placing bear,stearns employees at baron offices to observe baron trading activities,approving or declining to execute certain trades,imposing restrictions on baron inventory,and loaning funds to baron.similarly,the district court in blech ii,found that the c omplaint crosse d the line dividing secondary liability from primary liability when it claim ed that bear stearns the clearing broker directed or contrived certain allegedly fraudulent trades.levitt,supra,at pp.
applying this dichotomy to the facts before it,levitt concluded bear stearns did not have a duty to disclose sterling foster fraud because plaintiffs failed to allege sufficiently direct involvement.levitt,supra,at.certainly plaintiffs here do not allege that bear stearns,beyond merely acquiescing in the ml direct scheme,went so far as to control and implement that scheme in the manner alleged,for example,in berwecky.ibid.that bear stearns allowed putatively sham or manipulative trades was not comparable to directing or instigating such trades.id.at.
thus,the threshold for primary liability on the part of clearing firms is high.they do not incur such liability when they provide normal clearing services and that is so even when a firm knows the trader is committing fraud or knows it is clearing and settling sham trades.rather,to qualify as a primary violator a clearing firm must shed its role as clearing broker and engage in conduct akin to directing the client manipulative trading,or deciding with the client how to engage in the unlawful trading,or intentionally providing a specialized tool for the client to engage in unlawful trading,or initiating,instigating,and orchestrating the client unlawful scheme,or having intimate involvement and participating in key decisions about the details of the client unlawful trading,or assuming direct control of the client operations and its manipulative scheme.
the summary judgment evidence 
goldman brokerage 
goldman brokerage was,itself,a purchaser of reversion conversions,and plaintiff expert,marc allaire,based on his review of goldman documents,averred goldman bought reverse conversions from hazan and arenstein.allaire and other experts also opined,based on the pricing of these trades,goldman brokerage knew the short sale components of these complex trades would fail and continue to fail for the duration of the options components of the trades in short,goldman knew the trades were shams and created a phony supply of overstock shares.indeed,there is evidence goldman brokerage acted as arenstein agent in executing conversion trades with itself,and acknowledged arenstein could provide the firm a supply of shares it could not obtain in the pits.in an,for example,goldman acknowledged such conversion trades create inventory to allow customers to short.in another email,it acknowledged a general goal of its hedging strategies group was to create supply and perpetuate selling in stocks with a large amount of short interest.in sum,there is substantial evidence goldman brokerage was,itself,a beneficial purchaser of one species of the exotic trades in which hazan and arenstein engaged to circumvent regulation sho.
there is no evidence,however,raising a triable issue goldman brokerage own purchases,or its execution of hazan or arenstein or another clients sham trades in overstock,were made in california.hazan and arenstein operated out of new york and new jersey goldman brokerage operated out of new york,new jersey and chicago.further,plaintiffs did not rebut goldman brokerage evidence that any conversion trades were consummated on regional exchanges outside of california,such as the chicago board options exchange,midwest stock exchange,or cincinnati stock exchange 
accordingly,summary judgment was properly granted as to goldman brokerage.
merrill brokerage 
there is a similar shortcoming in the evidence as to merrill brokerage.to begin with,there is no evidence merrill brokerage,in contrast to goldman brokerage,was,itself,a purchaser of reverse conversions in overstock.
there is evidence eugene mccambridge,a merrill broker in chicago,executed some trades in overstock shares for hazan and arenstein.however,mccambridge could not identify which exchange he used for any given trade.he testified at deposition he would ordinarily route nasdaq trades through arca or p coast.but he was shown and testified specifically about trade tickets showing overstock trades on the midwest stock exchange in chicago.the blotters the paperwork showing the trades also do not identify the exchange used for the trades.thus,whether mccambridge executed any overstock trades on the pacific exchange is pure speculation,insufficient to raise a triable issue merrill brokerage executed trades in overstock in california.
in addition,there is no evidence the trades mccambridge executed were of the exotic variety designed to avoid regulation sho delivery requirement.plaintiffs experts purported to identify the alleged manipulative trading and they focused on goldman brokerage purchases of conversions and on the clearing firms activities.they made no reference to the trades mccambridge executed.
accordingly,summary judgment was also properly granted as to merrill brokerage.
goldman clearing 
goldman clearing did not have a clearing office in california,and there is no evidence this clearing firm did anything,in california or otherwise,beyond normal clearing activity.there is no evidence goldman clearing directed,developed,or instigated as opposed to acquiesced in any strategy for repeatedly failing short sales,shirking delivery obligations,or clearing sham reset transactions.see california amplifier,supra,th at no aiding and abetting liability compare in re mutual funds inv.litigation,supra,d at,italics added reasonably inferable that they participated in initiating,instigating,and orchestrating the scheme.at best,there is evidence suggesting the firm was clearing purported market makers sham reset transactions,was aware short interest in overstock was high,noticed fails going up rather dramatically at goldman clearing,and generally monitored client short sales in overstock and gave clients notice of their regulatory obligations to.however,there is no evidence raising a triable issue the firm shed its role as clearing broker and assumed direct control of the scheme to evade federal securities laws.levitt,supra,at pp.indeed,the evidence pertaining to goldman clearing does not come close to that pertaining to merrill clearing and to which we now turn.
merrill clearing 
merrill clearing,unlike goldman clearing,had an office in california and from that office provided clearing services to traders in overstock shares,including hazan and arenstein.by february,alan cooper,the head of the office,was having frequent interactions with hazan approximately times a week by telephone and.cooper,hazan,and merrill clearing compliance department discussed regulation sho and,in general,a clearing firm responsibility to insure delivery and not to fail trades.at his deposition,cooper claimed he and the compliance officer were not offering opinions on regulation sho,but simply explaining how merrill clearing would be implementing it.
in one interaction,in,hazan was upset that merrill clearing was automatically borrowing shares to insure delivery,when he expected it would not.in an internal,cooper,based on a conversation with hazan,relayed the trader did not know we were going to be charging fees to borrow negatives and if merrill clearing were to hazan on the trade,hazan would likely shares to maintain his hedge.cooper asked if the could be stopped.
what hazan,and in turn,cooper,were complaining about was what merrill termed the flipping of all trades for automatic delivery and settlement.this deprived legitimate market maker clients of regulation sho exemption from the locate requirement,and deprived the clearing firm of its right under the regulation to delegate delivery obligations to bona fide market maker clients.hazan was not the only merrill clearing client complaining about it.moreover,merrill clearing had had a do not flip practice for market maker clients in place prior to the time hazan and arenstein became clients,and the automatic flipping started with merrill acquisition of another firm,sage for whom cooper had worked,and its computer system which was not programmed to hold back market maker short sales.
about a week later,hazan sent cooper an noting an interaction with merrill clearing compliance department concerning regulation sho,and then posing several questions did a clearing firm need to pay to borrow a stock if it being held for less than days as would be the case with a flex or short term option hedge could the options market maker exemption exempt trades from regulation sho requirements if stock did not appear on the reg sho list of threshold securities until after a short sale as a hedge if merrill clearing were long in the stock,could hazan use that position to offset short sales 
on the afternoon of february,cooper told colleagues,in an email,hazan was threatening to leave merrill clearing for another firm if merrill could not without providing further specifics accommodate his trading style.one colleague responded i would say we ca.at his deposition,cooper could not recall what he had meant by trading style,but admittedly knew at the time it involved trading in threshold stocks,doing riskless trades,trades,conversions,and reversals.he also admitted having at least a general understanding hazan could profit from the spread between the pricing of the options components of reverse conversions.and he admitted the reverse conversions the sec later investigated and for which it imposed sanctions,were the sort of trade merrill was clearing.
at around the same time that is,february cooper also began working with arenstein.cooper spoke to arenstein about possibly opening an account,and merrill clearing managing director,curt richmond,told arenstein he and cooper were speaking to compliance about reg sho.
in a march,richmond and merrill clearing president,thomas tranfaglia,discussed how arenstein wanted to talk to tranfaglia about regulation sho and merrill clearing related policies.richmond stated after the hazan incident i informed arenstein that we had no interest in clearing his reg sho fail with flex options strategy.richmond noted arenstein had taken some of the other side of hazan closing trades,but told tranfaglia it is your call.arenstein particularly wanted to know if merrill clearing would charge market makers lending fees on a fail to deliver if there was no violation of regulation sho,and whether merrill clearing would give its clients a chance to get out on their own before regulation sho deadlines.
at the end of the month,cooper relayed to superiors a trading strategy suggested by hazan to use a one day flex in which hazan would buy and sell calls in the same number of shares.cooper asked c ould we fail on those shares from the assignment the next day.the admitted goal was to reestablish a new short and not borrow it.cooper was asked to discuss the matter in person,and the conversation went offline.at his deposition,cooper claimed he did not believe the goal of such a trade was to evade regulation sho,but to address hazan desire to avoid fees related to the supposedly unnecessary,automated borrowing of shares imposed by the computer system merrill clearing had inherited from sage.
the following month,in april,cooper filled in parts of a spreadsheet listing certain securities hazan was holding none of which were overstock.in the far right column,cooper marked down checks indicating hazan will not pay negative rebate and had a desire to fail.
in,cooper oversaw a reg sho test trade by hazan.the trade would establish a new share short position in a security one other than overstock for which options had been placed before implementation of regulation sho,and merrill clearing would not process the trade for delivery at his deposition,cooper again claimed the purpose of this exotic trade was not to evade regulation sho delivery requirement,but to move a position from a faulty account that required borrowing of shares,to a different account which would allow a bona fide market maker to sell short without borrowing.in an internal that same day,cooper said he told hazan he would be subject to regulation sho buy in requirement,even though hazan had earlier hoped for assurances that the position would not be subject to reg sho in days.
the compliance department wanted to have further discussions to get more comfortable with the test trade,and wanted to have a procedure set up to deal with hold ing these trades back a procedure that it would need to provide to the sec.but the trade was already in motion.
on may,after trade execution,a managing director at both merrill entities and president and chief operating officer of merrill clearing,peter melz,responded to the compliance department concern about the trade saying fuck the compliance area procedures,scmecedures.at her deposition,merrill compliance officer stated she watched melz draft the and it was made as part of an jest.
by mid,merrill clearing remedied the computer trading system it had acquired from sage,and completed implementation of an automated do not flip process.this new process ensured trades in negative rebate securities those,like overstock,with high borrow fees would not automatically flip to settlement when a market maker was selling short.thus,merrill clearing would no longer inform merrill brokerage of the need to acquire shares to settle such short sales.both firms were aware if the brokerage firm kept on its books the shares of negative rebate securities it otherwise would have provided to comply with regulation sho,those shares could be lent out for profit.
merrill clearing claims the do not flip process was the means by which,as allowed by regulation sho,it allocated responsibility for delivery to bona fide market maker clients.yet,merrill still had a policy of giving such clients notice of impending day deadlines to close out fail to deliver positions,and actually buying in clients who did not comply a buy in being a trade ostensibly conducted to close out a fail to deliver and enable delivery to a waiting buyer.
by summer,discussions within merrill turned to handling buy ins.in late july,cooper noted hazan trades many hard to borrows and will need as much color that is,information on potential as possible.on august,one of cooper employees,hugh skinner,wrote to cooper that hazan wanted early notification of because late notice could prevent him from selling into the.at his deposition,cooper stated traders like hazan wanted estimates of impending so they could sell into it and,in the case of naked shorts,the naked short position and remain risk neutral.this would,cooper understood,effectively reset the regulation sho clock and give traders,at least from merrill perspective,a new period of time to complete delivery of shares.as we have discussed,the sec found this scheme to reset the regulation sho clock and avoid delivery to be an egregious violation of the regulation 
it was the san francisco office that provided the notification function for hazan and other clients in and around august,but not necessarily for the entire period relevant here.at his deposition,cooper denied taking an active role in hazan trades or the trades of other merrill clearing clients,and viewed his role as largely clerical.he also denied reviewing trades to see if anyone repeatedly used reset transactions to perpetuate the naked short positions.
despite cooper assertions of passive ignorance,on august,a merrill clearing employee,bill stein,noticed cooper traders were knowingly putting on shorts and then basically rolling them every days.at his deposition,cooper said he did not recall exactly what this statement referred to,but conceded stein was referring to beating the reg sho obligation.certainly by july of,cooper understood this aspect of the trading strategy hazan and others were pursuing,noting flexs were being questioned and wrote in an email a few traders have figured out how to use the flexs to deal with reg sho.
in december,merrill clearing chief compliance officer sent a bulletin noting the firm had received regulatory inquiries and scrutiny over flex trades by two clients in ostk.
in an internal january telephone call,the compliance officer talked about arenstein trading,how he was not acting as a bona fide market maker,and how it was not okay to be recycling his short position.she said you know,i we really i got to set up a meeting where we have to talk to the business,because these guys,they must be spoken to.not by you.you know what i saying like this is not okay.like you can not be recycling this short position.i mean,i do understand.if he got if he got,you know,a due today,tomorrow,and the next day,right then he ca short anymore in these next few days.
that same month,the compliance officer followed up with an email to merrill clearing executives,telling them as you know arenstein had been involved in trading activity the nasd was questioning as inconsistent with regulation sho,and informing them of the flex option recycling scheme and how merrill net fails to deliver in overstock were not diminishing.she noted if the firm were to drop hazan and arenstein,the database of fails shrinks unbelievably.there is also evidence,during this time frame,of compliance communications with hazan and arenstein during which they insisted they were acting as bona fide market makers,and a telephone call to arenstein confronting him about recycling of trades and requesting he to do real.
nevertheless,merrill clearing continued to clear hazan and arenstein trades for another seven months and did not even begin to wind down its clearing relationship with them until august just before the sec and new york exchange issued stipulated sanctions orders against the two traders.even after hazan was told to leave merrill clearing,he continued to increase his short positions there for several months before he was finally terminated.
all told,merrill cleared hazan and arenstein exotic trades designed to support perpetually naked short positions for more than a year,and as a result failed to deliver overstock shares for settlement every single day between august,and the end of.the number of failed deliveries quickly rose above a million shares,and at one point reached three million shares.
tria ble issue merrill clearing was a primary violator 
as we have discussed,even if there is a triable issue merrill clearing knew hazan and arenstein trades were designed to evade regulation sho and knew it was clearing sham trades,that is not enough to raise a triable issue of primary liability under sections and.rather,the evidence must be such that merrill clearing conduct was arguably akin to directing hazan and arenstein trading schemes levitt,supra,at pp,or to deciding with them how to effect a manipulative trade see blech iii,supra,wl,at,or to providing calculated access to the means to engage in unlawful trading in re mutual funds inv.litigation,supra,d at pp,or to initiating,instigating,and orchestrating the scheme id.at,or to having intimate,involvement and participating in key decisions about the details of the exotic trades scone investments,american third market,supra,wl,at pp.
while a close question,we conclude the evidence is sufficient to raise a triable issue merrill clearing did more than provide normal clearing services,bearing in mind the observation of the district court in blech iii,that i n this difficult distinction between aiding and abetting and direct action,the line will be drawn with respect to summary judgment in favor of protecting the investing public rather than the clearing broker.blech iii,supra,wl,at.
there is clearly a triable issue merrill clearing had knowledge,indeed abundant knowledge,its clients were rolling shorts and engaging in sham reset transactions to mimic the appearance of genuine trading.there is a triable issue merrill did not believe,or,at the very least,could not have reasonably believed,hazan and arenstein were bona fide market makers engaging in legitimate trading.and there is a triable issue merrill took an active,direct role in their trading schemes to cause,and to profit from,ongoing failures to deliver shares in short sales of overstock,as well as other securities.
for example,there is a triable issue cooper and others within merrill clearing purposefully developed or contrived procedures,at the request of hazan and arenstein,by which merrill clearing could,and repeatedly did,effect their flex options to reestablish a new short and not borrow it.arguably,hazan effectively asked merrill clearing to review and approve the exotic test trade he concocted to flagrantly violate the securities laws.not only did merrill give its stamp of approval,it continued to clear hazan unlawful trades even after compliance personnel made it clear this was not ok.indeed,merrill did so for another seven months and only stopped clearing those trades on the eve of the sec sanction ruling.such contriving behavior is akin to that found actionable in in re mutual funds inv.litigation,supra,d at page,in which the clearing firm provided clients with access to trading platforms that enabled manipulative late trades,and in blech iii,in which the clearing firm and clients discussed and agreed upon a strategy that would manipulate the market.
even if merrill procedures were initially designed as a legitimate means to correct the sage computer problem,they arguably became deliberately employed as tools to implement hazan and arenstein strategy of perpetuating naked short positions.similarly,even if notifications are usually normal clearing activities,it is arguable cooper went beyond giving routine notice and knowingly coached hazan and arenstein on handling obligations for the very purpose of selling into them and naked short positions.moreover,the arguable coaching of these traders can not be viewed in isolation from the evidence showing merrill clearing involvement with the development,for these same abusive traders,of the process to roll shorts.
cooper techniques were,indeed,known,and ratified,within merrill clearing.cooper clients,said one colleague,were knowingly putting on shorts and then basically rolling them every days.in,tanfaglia was given the call on whether to add arenstein as a client given his flex options strategy and the hazan incident and arenstein became a client.in early,a merrill clearing compliance officer was aware of arenstein recycling his short position and called for action,but the abusive trading practices continued.
in sum,while close,when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,as it must be on review from summary judgment,it suffices to raise a triable issue merrill clearing,through its san francisco office,did more than provide normal clearing services,and did more than knowingly clear its clients manipulative trades and sham reset transactions.there is enough to commit to a jury the difficult distinction between aiding and abetting and direct action.blech iii,supra,supra,wl,at.
ii.there is a triable issue merrill clearing acted to induce trading i n a manipulated stock 
it is not enough for there to be a triable issue merrill clearing crossed the line from aider and abettor to primary violator in a scheme to evade regulation sho for the benefit of its clients.rather,to impose liability under section,subdivision b,there must be evidence raising a triable issue merrill participated in hazan and arenstein manipulative trading scheme for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of shares of overstock by someone else.
plaintiffs principal evidence that merrill clearing had the requisite purpose of inducing market activity in overstock was not the direct statements by defendants recounted above.rather,they relied on expert opinions.that is,their experts drew inferences about the clearing firm purpose from its knowing participation in hazan and arenstein trading schemes and their opinion merrill benefited financially when the stock price declined.since the firm benefitted from price declines,and since market activity is necessary to generate a decline,the experts opined merrill must have intended to induce further market activity.
plaintiffs experts declared the recycling of naked short positions created downward pressure on overstock price,and plaintiffs expert conner,in particular,testified the clearing firm benefited from price declines,which would spur further short selling and increase transaction fees.also,when the clearing firm had a fail to deliver position,it might have to pay a mark to the party not receiving its shares if the share price rose.if the share price declined,the clearing firm got a mark.the clearing firm thus did not profit directly from price declines,but rather held the mark money in a reserve account in case the share price rose.meanwhile,however,the firm and its client earned interest on the money.conner,thus,opined merrill clearing had a strong financial incentive to see this play out 
while the evidence merrill clearing had the requisite purpose to induce market activity in overstock stock is attenuated,even weak evidence can permit an inference of unlawful intent or purpose,as intent and purpose are rarely established with direct evidence and are typically questions for the trier of fact.see page miracosta community college dist.th,a subjective state of mind is rarely susceptible of direct proof,and a trial court will usually have to infer it from circumstantial evidence.nazir united airlines,th,proof of discriminatory intent often depends on inferences rather than direct evidence such that very little evidence of such intent is necessary to defeat summary judgment thus summary judgment should not be granted unless the evidence can not support any reasonable inference for plaintiff.id.at intent cases are rarely appropriate for disposition on summary judgment,however liberalized summary judgment has become see also press chem.inv.servs.cir,the question of whether a plaintiff has established the requisite intent for a section b violation is a factual question appropriate for resolution by the trier of fact masri d,defendant manipulative intent can be inferred from the conduct itself and a defendant broker need not share the same nefarious intent as a client,so long as the intent is actionable.
here,plaintiffs presented evidence of opportunity and motive,which,when taken with all the other evidence of merrill knowing conduct,was at least for now sufficient to survive summary judgment.see bains moores th,timing and amount of stock transactions may bear on scienter of person accused of insider trading blech ii,supra.at pp.as to pleading scienter,allegations bear stearns was motivated to see prices rise because this would decrease its financial risks associated with blech transactions and remove debit balances on blech accounts was sufficient to state b claim compudyne shane.supp d,the fac has alleged a strong inference of fny millennium scienter based upon its own shorting of compudyne stock after being informed of the confidential pipe its continued shorting of compudyne stock after receipt of the purchase agreement that unequivocally prohibited any trading in compudyne stock and its naked unlawful shorting of compudyne stock in direct contravention of the purchase agreement.mcdaniel bear stearns,d,affirming arbitration award as supported by sufficient evidence of intent to aid and abet a violation of section b bear had both the motive and the opportunity to engage in baron fraud.one factor motivating bear was the simple desire to continue to collect clearing fees and other income it received from baron as part of the clearing agreement.citation.while the mere desire to prolong the benefits of an ordinary clearing relationship is not enough to support the scienter element of an aiding and abetting claim the panel also found that bear was motivated by its desire to recover from baron on loans above and beyond the normal clearing debt loans the panel described as extraordinary.
merrill clearing claims,of course,it was the one being deceived by the likes of hazan and arenstein,and believed these clients were engaged in legitimate options market making activity and therefore the firm could,under regulation sho,delegate its delivery obligations to them.b vi.however,a clearing firm can only reasonably delegate its delivery obligations.ibid.plaintiffs experts opined hazan,arenstein,and like traders were not plausibly acting as bona fide market makers and the voluminous,ongoing fails to deliver in overstock were not due to inadvertence,but were intentional.similarly,the sec and other sanctioning bodies easily concluded hazan and arenstein were not engaged in bona fide market making.moreover,the evidence supports an inference merrill clearing was sufficiently aware of the supposed market makers strategies to avoid regulation sho rolling short,such that any delegation of delivery obligations under that regulation would be unreasonable.
merrill clearing also views the evidence as showing no more than a desire to make additional fees and commissions,citing cases holding that is not enough to incur liability under the securities laws,louisiana pacific money market institutional inv.dealer,no.c jsw wl,the desire to earn commissions or fees is a common motive to all for profit enterprises,and that motive without more is insufficient to give rise to a strong inference of scienter,italics added pope investments ii llc deheng law firm,civ.lls wl,because plaintiffs do not allege that defendants possessed any motive other than receipt of professional fees,they do not plead that defendants had a motive to commit securities fraud.no doubt merrill was motivated to maximize fees and commissions.but that does not mean it necessarily had no intent to induce trading in overstock by others.rothman gregor cir,although virtually every company may have the desire to maintain a high bond or credit rating not every company has the desire to use its stock to acquire another company in a potentially manipulative way.
iii.there is a triable issue actionable conduct occurred in this state 
there must also be a triable issue the manipulative conduct engaged in for the purpose of inducing trading activity occurred in this state.diamond,supra,cal th at.
as we have recited in detail,cooper,who was in merrill clearing san francisco office,figures prominently in the manipulative trading schemes at issue.that other merrill clearing officers and employees,who interacted with cooper and the malfeasant traders,were located in merrill offices outside california,or that portions of the clearing and settlement processes may have occurred on computers elsewhere,does not mean the clear connection with california can be ignored.see diamond,supra,cal th at pp.fn.in this state does not operate to confine liability for violation of section to intrastate transactions.
further,plaintiffs expert,conner,based on merrill clearing records,declared part of the clearing process for numerous of the manipulative trades involved providing trade data to pacific clearing corporation,a regional clearing center located in california and affiliated with the pacific stock exchange the trial court ruled this expert testimony lacked foundation,and sustained an objection to it.this was error.conner testimony was based on his own established expertise and on confirmatory conversations with another expert with experience and also personal knowledge,having worked at goldman clearing,in particular.thus,there was adequate foundation for conner declaration testimony,and it is for the trier of fact to weigh the credibility of his opinion and any countervailing opinion or evidence of which there is currently none see howard entertainment,kudrow th,trial court erred in excluding expert testimony establishing an industry custom,and thus an understanding of a contract bauer experience in and knowledge of the entertainment industry is adequate for him to render an opinion on specific practices,even if he was not a personal manager at the time of the agreement in issue.crediting connor testimony for purposes of summary judgment,as we must,it shows merrill clearing clearing activity related to the sham reset transactions necessarily occurred,at least in part,in california 
we reject merrill assertion section controls when actionable conduct occurs in california.section defines when a n offer or sale of a security is made in this state and when a n offer to buy or a purchase of a security is made in this state,subd.a.it doe not address where a series of transactions are effected.see,subd.b.moreover,the phrases offer or sale and offer to buy or purchase pertain most clearly to the language of section,subdivisions c and e,which prohibit the inducement of certain sale and purchase activity.see diamond,supra,cal th at.t o the extent section,subdivisions a and b,prohibit selling or offering to sell or purchasing or offering to purchase,section may provide guidance on when that conduct occurs in this state.id.at.but to the extent these two subdivisions embrace other conduct necessary to effect,alone or with one or more other persons,a series of transactions,section does not address the term.see id.at pp.
iv.there is a triable issue as to causation and damages 
section,establishing a private right of action for violations of section,permits liability only when the plaintiff buys or sells a security at a price which was affected by such act or transaction and sustains damages.such damages shall be the difference between the price at which the plaintiff purchased or sold securities and the market value which such securities would otherwise have had ibid.
plaintiffs damages expert,shapiro,discussed two theories of causation and damages a quantity theory and a signaling theory.put simply,the quantity theory states overstock price declined because naked short sales affected the supply of overstock shares the signaling theory states overstock price declined because naked short sales falsely signaled to the market overstock was in a worse position than it really was.
under the quantity or supply and demand theory,shapiro concluded all fails to deliver cause harm and even if it is determined that some but not all of the fails are to be included in this case,i could readily calculate the damages to plaintiffs.
merrill clearing presented no expert testimony rebutting shapiro.instead,merrill contends his quantity theory is unsubstantiated conjecture,based solely on parroted allegations from plaintiffs complaint and without citation to authority.however,shapiro never quoted plaintiffs complaint and cited two academic publications,statements of witnesses in this case,and statements of government officials in support of his expert opinion that naked short sales create a false impression of increased supply without concomitantly changing demand,therefore lowering price.shapiro also described the process he would use to calculate damages flowing from the appearance of increased supply from particular fails to deliver 
this is not a case,then,where an expert failed to wrestle with other experts opinions or ignored inconvenient facts.see nardizzi harbor chrysler plymouth sales,th.nor did merrill challenge shapiro expertise and ability to opine on what appears to be a basic matter of economics indeed,cases suggest a supply and demand model can address both causation and damages,eldridge sales,azen manufacturing,wl burton city of alexander city,no.d e wl,fn.
especially given the lack of admissible expert testimony rebutting shapiro methods and conclusions,the trial court decision to admit his declaration as to the quantity theory,over defendants foundational objections,was proper.see imonex services,munzprufer dietmar trenner gmbh,imonex did not present any competent testimony of its own specifically addressing the reliability of expert testimony t herefore,this court detects no abuse of discretion in the district court admission of it.
since we conclude shapiro declaration as to the quantity effects theory is sufficient to defeat summary judgment on the matter of causation and damages,we need not determine whether his signaling effects theory,alone,would be adequate to do so.at a minimum,the trial court did not err in allowing his testimony on signaling effects as corroboration of his quantity effects theory.
merrill contends shapiro,in his analysis of signaling effects,improperly relied on a granger analysis,which some academics,asserts merrill,believe shows correlation but not directional causation.also,merrill complains that in his signaling effects analysis,shapiro though he allocated percent of defendants fails to merrill clearing and percent to goldman clearing assumed both firm fails to deliver were all abnormal and manipulative and grouped them,to measure signal strength,in one large clump,as combining the fails would amplify these effects.
there is nothing untoward,given the facts before us,about shapiro employing a granger analysis to corroborate his independent conclusion that fails to deliver were inject ing false information into the market and causing the observed price decline in overstock,based upon his review of market conditions,comparable companies,and events.see pickett ibp,no.civ a n wl,fn.the granger causality test should not be used in isolation to determine causation.when used with other tests and models,however,the granger test is an appropriate vehicle from which to base an opinion.
even if shapiro signaling effects analysis was weakened because it depended on measuring the aggregated signal from all fails to deliver,without accounting for whether they were manipulative,tied to california,or associated with any particular clearing firm,portions of the signaling effects model still offered corroboration for the conclusions of the quantity effects analysis.for example,shapiro event study demonstrated irregular forces unrelated to overstock performance and the performance of the larger market were aggravating the decline on overstock price.
accounting for causation and damages in a case so complex and fluid is no easy task,and shapiro declaration suitably acknowledged and accommodated for this,at least for purposes of defeating summary judgment.see cilp associates,pricewaterhouse coopers llp cir,cilp associates as to a section b claim,a high level of precision was not required to defeat summary judgment for the simple reason that the amount of overstatement relates to damages,not liability.to defeat summary judgment,the plaintiffs merely had to establish a genuine dispute as to whether they purchased their shares at inflated prices,regardless of the amount of the inflation.further,fact witnesses from defendants and third parties testified to a link between naked short sales and declining prices.
thus,while not a particularized showing by any means,plaintiffs provided enough evidence of causation and damages to raise a triable issue.see cilp associates,supra,at see also kurinij hanna morton th,causation is ordinarily a question of fact which can not be resolved by summary judgment and t he issue of causation may be decided as a question of law only if,under undisputed facts,there is no room for a reasonable difference of opinion ghk associates mayer group,d,where the fact of damages is certain,the amount of damages need not be calculated with absolute certainty.citations.the law requires only that some reasonable basis of computation of damages be used,and the damages may be computed even if the result reached is an approximation.
preemption 
merrill clearing also raises the specter of preemption and exclusive federal jurisdiction.it maintains california can not impose liability for conduct that otherwise complies with regulation sho and asserts federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over regulation sho claims.
merrill would be correct if plaintiffs simply alleged violations of regulation sho.section of the sea provides the district courts of the united states and the united states courts of any territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the united states shall have exclusive jurisdiction of violations of this title citation or the rules and regulations thereunder,and of all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by this title citation or the rules and regulations thereunder,subd.a see matsushita indus,epstein,lippitt raymond james financial services,cir,lippitt any claim that properly falls within the scope of is necessarily federal in character.
but section of the sea provides the rights and remedies provided by this chapter shall be in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that may exist at law or in equity except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter,nothing in this chapter shall affect the jurisdiction of the securities commission or any agency or officer performing like functions of any state over any security or any person insofar as it does not conflict with the provisions of this chapter or the rules and regulations thereunder lippitt,supra,at,quoting a.
on its face,preserves both common law and statutory authority over securities matters and thus reflects congressional recognition of state competence in the securities field.lippitt,supra,at gold blinder,robinson,the exclusive jurisdiction of federal courts over claims under the act does not bar a plaintiff from pursuing at its option cognate remedies based entirely upon state law.this has been recognized by california courts for as long as the modern corporate securities law has been in force.roskind morgan stanley dean witter th,roskind congress plainly contemplated the possibility of dual litigation in state and federal courts relating to securities transactions.twomey mitchum,jones templeton,d,as has already been pointed out,the rights and remedies provided by the securities exchange act of shall be in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that may exist at law or in equity.
in lippitt,defendants sought removal of plaintiff california unfair competition law claim,asserting it was a attempt to enforce new york stock exchange rules issued under the sea.lippitt,supra,at.although the plaintiffs complaint tracked the language of the nyse rules,defendants could not federalize the case on that basis.id.at.plaintiff had challenged defendants conduct solely under state law irrespective of whether it is legal under nyse rules.id.at.that the specific goal of protecting california customers from dishonest business practices,whether by brokers or otherwise,may comport with the broader regulatory goals of the exchange act and certain nyse rules and regulations is not enough to sweep lippitt complaint within the exclusive jurisdictional ambit of of the sea.id.at pp.see also dennis hart cir,complaint repeated references to federal law insufficient to confer jurisdiction when state,not federal claims alleged roskind morgan stanley dean witter d,granting motion to remand,as state common law and the ucl,not nasd rules,defined the scope of defendant liability violations of nasd rules are a method to assess defendant misconduct,but establishing a violation is not a necessary element of plaintiff claims.
although plaintiffs broadly discuss regulation sho,their claim under sections and remains a claim to prove market manipulation under section,there are a plethora of requirements,none of which is a predicate violation of regulation sho or any other federal securities statute or rule.state laws against purposeful market manipulation in no way conflict with the sea regime,including implementation of regulation sho

the standard of review on appeal from a dismissal following the sustaining of a demurrer without leave to amend is well established a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the complaint,and the granting of leave to amend involves the trial court discretion.therefore,an appellate court employs two separate standards of review on appeal.roman county of los angeles th.we review de novo the trial court order sustaining a demurrer.citation.we assume the truth of all facts properly pleaded,and we accept as true all facts that may be implied or reasonably inferred from facts expressly alleged,unless they are contradicted by judicially noticed facts.citations.we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation and we read it in context.citation.but we do not assume the truth of contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.citation.we will affirm an order sustaining a demurrer on any proper grounds,regardless of the basis for the trial court decision.cansino bank of america th,cansino.
the same is true in new jersey.state,of treasury,div.of inv.ex rel.mccormac qwest communications.also,fraudulent conduct,as an underlying predicate act to a rico offense,is distinguished from other elements of a rico claim,such as the existence of an enterprise or a pattern of racketeering activity,which need not be pleaded with the same level of specificity.accordingly,douglas superior court d,which plaintiffs cite,is inapposite.while that case addresses pleading a federal rico claim,it does not address the requirements for pleading a predicate act grounded on fraudulent conduct.indeed,the predicate acts mentioned,mail and wire fraud,must be pleaded with particularity in a rico case.people ex rel.sepulveda highland fed.savings loan th,applying federal rico sepulveda see also haroco,american nat.bank and trust of chicago cir,there can be little doubt that.b,which requires that allegations of fraud specify with particularity the circumstances of the alleged fraud,applies to fraud allegations in civil rico complaints.
moreover,because the allegations of securities fraud were so vague,it was impossible for the trial court to make heads or tails of plaintiffs statement that aspects of the conduct at issue occurred in new jersey substantially affected trade or commerce in new jersey.even though plaintiffs averred defendants effected transactions at issue and engaged in other conduct in new jersey,plaintiffs did not link these broad descriptors with any particular predicate acts of fraud in new jersey.
we therefore need not,and do not,reach defendants additional challenges to the new jersey rico claim.
the standard of review of a summary judgment is also well established.global hawk insurance company le th,global hawk.code of civil procedure section,subdivision c provides that summary judgment is properly granted when there is no triable issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.ibid.a moving defendant can meet its initial burden by presenting evidence showing plaintiffs causes of action have no merit or are precluded by an affirmative defense.moua,barker,abernathy,llp th,moua code civ,subd.p.if the defendant makes its initial showing,the burden shifts to plaintiffs to show a triable issue of material fact exists.global hawk,at code civ,subd.p.we review the trial court ruling de novo moua,at,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the opposition to the motion,and liberally constru ing the opposition evidence,while strictly scrutinizing the successful party evidence and resolving any evidentiary ambiguities in the opposition favor dameron hospital aaa northern california,nevada and utah insurance exchange th.we will affirm a summary judgment if it is correct on any ground,as we review the judgment,not its rationale.moua,at.
plaintiff fourth amended complaint alleged violations of subdivisions a and b.in their opening brief on appeal,plaintiffs,without providing a detailed analysis,continued to suggest defendants might face liability for violating subdivision a prohibition against effect ing any transaction in a security which involves no change in the beneficial ownership thereof.defendants,citing various sec regulations and cases,responded there was no evidence beneficial ownership was not changing hands in the trades at issue,and certainly no evidence of trades in which the same trader was buying or selling to himself.rather than respond to these points,plaintiffs,in reply,acknowledged the trades were actual trades and real,but argued even real trades can be manipulative under subdivision b if done for a prohibited purpose.we therefore conclude plaintiffs have abandoned any claim under subdivision a,and pursue a claim only under section,subdivision b.
section provides in pertinent part it shall be unlawful for any person,directly or indirectly,by the use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce,or of any facility of any national securities exchange,or for any member of a national securities exchange to effect,alone or with or more other persons,a series of transactions in any security registered on a national securities exchange,any security not so registered,or in connection with any swap or swap agreement with respect to such security creating actual or apparent active trading in such security,or raising or depressing the price of such security,for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others.a,italics added.

as defendants point out,there are substantive differences between section and section b of the sea for instance,the focus in section,subdivision b,is on effecting transactions in manipulated securities,whereas section b broadly prohibits any person from the knowing use of deceptive practices in connection with the purchase or sale of a security.b.however,that the conduct prohibited by section b may be broader,does not suggest the critical distinction between primary participants and aiders and abettors under that section is not helpful in defining these roles under california law.kamen,supra,th at,citing central bank,supra,at.indeed,the basic approach to drawing the line between primary and secondary liability should generally operate independently of particular substantive statutes.see freeman directv,cir,fn.it is the supreme court approach to interpreting the statute,not the actual statute itself,that is significant t hus,the fact that the court was interpreting a different act of congress the securities exchange act is inconsequential.
