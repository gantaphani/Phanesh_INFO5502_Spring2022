background 
the following facts are not in dispute.plaintiff is a,physician who holds an illinois license to practice medicine.plaintiff practiced medicine with the united states army from,when plaintiff graduated from medical school,until,when plaintiff relocated to the alton area.
on january,plaintiff entered into a physician services agreement agreement with ahi.ahi is a nonlicensed,corporation organized under the general not for profit corporation act of ilcs et west.two entities share equal ownership of ahi.ahi is owned by anthony health systems anthony.anthony is a,corporation which is wholly owned by the sisters of francis of the martyr george.anthony is not licensed as a hospital or medical services corporation.however,anthony does control two licensed hospitals located in the alton area anthony hospital and clare hospital.the president of anthony is william kessler,who is also the president of ahi.kessler is not a physician,and he does not hold a medical license.the remaining of ahi is owned by alton health care partnership partnership.the partnership does not have status.although the partnership is composed primarily of physician groups,it includes at least one nonphysician member.
the agreement entered into between plaintiff and ahi provided that plaintiff was to be employed by ahi on a basis as a physician,that plaintiff was to receive an annual salary from ahi,and that plaintiff would be eligible for certain bonuses.the agreement outlined plaintiff duties as a physician in ahi employ.for example,the agreement set forth ahi expectations with respect to the productivity of plaintiff practice,including the number of weekly patient appointments plaintiff was required to schedule,as well as guidelines plaintiff was expected to follow in requesting time off.the agreement also outlined the obligations of ahi as plaintiff employer.for example,the agreement stated that ahi was to provide plaintiff with office space and was to furnish plaintiff with the equipment,services,supplies,and personnel that ahi reasonably determines necessary for the operation of plaintiff medical practice.
by its terms,the agreement was valid for an initial period of three years and was to automatically renew for an additional period unless it was terminated in accordance with conditions specified within that document.the agreement provided that ahi had the right to immediately terminate the agreement for cause,as defined in the contract.in addition,the agreement provided that upon either party failure to cure a breach of a material provision of the agreement within days following receipt of written notice from the nonbreaching party,the nonbreaching party could terminate the agreement upon an additional days written notice.the agreement also contained a nonassignment clause,which provided that the agreement may not be amended or revised except with the written consent of the parties thereto,and may not be assigned by any party except with the written consent of the other party provided,however,that ahi may assign this agreement to a subsidiary or affiliate without the prior written consent of physician.
in addition,the agreement contained a noncompetition clause,which prohibited plaintiff from practicing medicine within miles of ahi offices for two years after her employment with ahi ended.this clause provided as follows 
during the term of this agreement and for a period of two years from the date this agreement is terminated for any reason the protected period,physician agrees that he or she will not,without the prior written consent of ahi,directly or indirectly i provide,or become associated with any other hospital group or other entity of any type engaged in the provision of medical or health care services or related administrative services within the medical practice area,which for purposes of this agreement is the area within a twenty mile radius of the office ii solicit,divert,take away,interfere with or contract to provide or render medical services to patients treated by physician during the term of this agreement or iii solicit any person who is now or is hereafter an employee of ahi or is now or hereafter engaged as an independent contractor of ahi to become an employee or to be engaged as an independent contractor of a hospital medical group or any other entity that is competitive with ahi.
the agreement between plaintiff and ahi became effective on april,when plaintiff began her employment as an ahi physician.however,relations between plaintiff and ahi soon became strained.on october,plaintiff sent a,letter to william kessler,president of ahi.in this letter,plaintiff informed kessler that she wanted to bring certain issues concerning my employment with ahi to his attention,and stated that she had discussed these matters on several occasions with ahi practice manager but that the issues had not been resolved.plaintiff then set forth,with specificity,five separate complaints with respect to her employment with ahi that,contrary to earlier assurances made by ahi that plaintiff would be able to fulfill her obligations to perform army reserve duty without negative repercussions,she was subsequently informed that she would be forced to use vacation time or take unpaid leave that plaintiff attendance at mandatory meetings set up by ahi reduced the amount of office time she could spend with patients that ahi failed to provide plaintiff with adequate staffing to set up and operate her medical practice that plaintiff had a dispute with ahi as to whether ahi had the right to compensation received by plaintiff as a result of her outside activity as a nursing home medical director and that although plaintiff had been assured by ahi that it would establish a retirement plan,she was concerned that ahi had taken no action to set up such a plan.in her letter,plaintiff stated that ahi interpretation of her employment contract was vastly different from the understanding i reached with ahi for the job of which i was recruited,and she requested that she be involved in issues and decisions involving my office that relate to the practice.
over nine months later,on july,plaintiff attorney sent a letter to counsel for ahi stating that representations made to plaintiff by ahi at the time plaintiff entered into the agreement have never been fulfilled.according to the letter,plaintiff concerns with respect to inadequate staffing had not been heard by ahi,and that plaintiff patients have voiced their concern upon observing plaintiff performing routine office duties such as setting up rooms,giving shots,and taking care of their needs when others are sitting around.in light of this situation,counsel for plaintiff proposed to negotiate an equitable s eparation a greement with ahi.to this end,plaintiff counsel stated that plaintiff would remain in the employ of ahi until september,and requested that the noncompetition provision of the agreement be modified to allow my client to practice medicine everywhere,including alton,illinois except exceedingly close to ahi.these issues were never resolved to the satisfaction of the parties.
in april,our appellate court rendered its decision in berlin sarah bush lincoln health center,d.a divided panel of the appellate court held that a restrictive covenant contained within an employment agreement between a surgeon and a licensed hospital was unenforceable because the hospital,through its employment agreement,was practicing medicine in violation of the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine.shortly thereafter,we agreed to review the decision of the appellate court in berlin and granted the hospital petition for leave to appeal.berlin sarah bush lincoln health center.
on january,ahi assigned all of its physician service agreements,including that of plaintiff,to community primary care physicians,cpcp,the other defendant at bar.cpcp is a medical services corporation,organized under the medical corporation act ilcs et west and incorporated on december.the sole shareholder of cpcp is a licensed medical doctor,george tucker the record reflects that plaintiff never consented in writing to the assignment of the agreement to cpcp.shortly after the purported assignment,cpcp tendered a new employment agreement to plaintiff.plaintiff did not sign the agreement tendered to her by cpcp and continued to work under the terms of her original agreement with ahi.
on january,plaintiff brought an action in the circuit court of madison county seeking a declaratory judgment that the employment agreement she entered into with ahi was invalid.in support of her position,plaintiff relied on the appellate court opinion in berlin and alleged that the provisions contained within the agreement,including the noncompetition clause,were not enforceable because ahi,through its employment agreement with her,was practicing medicine in violation of the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine.the record reflects that the parties refrained from actively pursuing this litigation while they were awaiting our review of the berlin decision.during this time,plaintiff continued to work for ahi and to negotiate their dispute.
approximately three months later,in a letter dated april,counsel for plaintiff advised kessler that plaintiff was providing notice of exercise of her right to terminate the physician services agreement because of breaches by ahi of material provisions of the agreement.this letter alleged three material breaches of the agreement by ahi ahi failure to provide office space and equipment reasonably necessary for the proper operation and conduct of plaintiff medical practice ahi failure to employ competent,adequately trained personnel necessary for the proper operation and conduct of plaintiff practice and ahi failure to timely and accurately bill for medical services provided by plaintiff practice.the letter concluded that ahi had not only materially breached the agreement,but also had significantly interfered with plaintiff ability to practice medicine in accordance with the professional and ethical standards to which she is held accountable and which,therefore,endangers the welfare of her patients.the letter stated that,in the near future,plaintiff must end her association with ahi.plaintiff,however,did not resign from ahi at this time and continued to perform medical services in accordance with the agreement.
on april,an attorney representing both ahi and cpcp wrote a letter to plaintiff attorney,stating that plaintiff had not properly communicated her intention to terminate the agreement in accordance with the agreement terms.in addition,defendants attorney construed plaintiff april letter as an anticipatory breach of the agreement,and counsel stated that,in the event of an actual breach,cpcp intended to pursue its remedies and enforce the termination provisions and covenants under the agreement.counsel for defendants then responded in writing to each claim made by plaintiff in her april letter.in the course of this response,counsel stated that most of the allegations simply do not constitute a breach of the agreement and f or those that arguably might,ahi and cpcp have corrected them or are in the process of correcting them.
in october,this court handed down its decision in berlin sarah bush lincoln health center.we reversed the judgment of the appellate court and held that a licensed hospital is exempt from the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine.we concluded,therefore,that a licensed hospital may employ licensed physicians to provide medical services.
on january,plaintiff wrote a letter to kessler,stating that she was sorry that we were not able to reach an accommodation to amicably resolve our differences and that her resignation from ahi was effective as of that day.following her resignation,plaintiff set up her own practice within the noncompetition area set forth in the agreement.
on february,ahi filed in the circuit court a counterclaim against plaintiff,seeking injunctive relief enforcing the noncompetition provision of the agreement.the counterclaim also sought monetary damages from plaintiff.cpcp thereafter moved to intervene in the case in response,plaintiff filed in the circuit court her own petition for injunctive relief,alleging that ahi and cpcp interfered with the medical practice she set up after leaving ahi.
in december,the circuit court conducted a hearing to resolve plaintiff original declaratory judgment action.in a written order and opinion entered on december,the circuit court held that plaintiff employment by ahi and cpcp did not violate the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine.first,the circuit court determined that plaintiff employment by cpcp from january,to january,was unquestionably valid.the circuit court noted that cpcp,as a medical services corporation formed under the medical corporation act ilcs et west,has been sanctioned by the legislature to employ licensed physicians.therefore,the court reasoned,the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine did not prohibit cpcp from employing plaintiff.the circuit court,however,did not specifically address whether the assignment of the agreement by ahi to cpcp was valid and effective.
second,with respect to plaintiff employment by ahi in and,the circuit court also found that no violation of the corporate practice doctrine occurred.relying upon our decision in berlin,the circuit court held that ahi fit within an exception to the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine on the sole basis that ahi is a nonprofit,charitable organization.accordingly,the circuit court held that the terms of plaintiff employment agreement were legal and enforceable.plaintiff thereafter filed a motion to certify the circuit court order for interlocutory appeal.the circuit court denied plaintiff certification motion.
defendants subsequently moved for partial summary judgment on their counterclaim for injunctive relief and for summary judgment on plaintiff injunctive relief action.on april,the circuit court granted defendants motions.the circuit court found that plaintiff letter dated april,was the only communication sent by plaintiff to ahi that explicitly referenced material breaches of the agreement.the circuit court held that this communication failed to properly invoke the agreement termination provisions,as it purported to terminate the agreement immediately upon the delivery of the letter.in addition,the court found that even if plaintiff letters did provide the requisite notice,the allegations made by plaintiff against defendants did not amount to breaches of the agreement.therefore,the court concluded that it was plaintiff who had breached the agreement,and that ahi and cpcp were entitled to summary judgment on this issue.the circuit court further found the noncompetition provision in the agreement to be reasonable and enforceable.accordingly,the circuit court enjoined plaintiff from practicing medicine within a radius of the offices of ahi.the circuit court,however,reserved ruling on the issue of what,if any,monetary damages were due defendants.with respect to plaintiff request for injunctive relief based on allegations that defendants interfered with her medical practice after leaving ahi,the circuit court held that in light of its grant of injunctive relief to defendants,the issue of injunctive relief to protect plaintiff practice is moot.upon plaintiff filing of an emergency motion for stay and a motion to reconsider,the circuit court modified its partial summary judgment order to interpret the area described in the noncompetition provision as driving distance rather than as a straight line on a map.
on appeal,the appellate court,in a opinion,reversed the judgment of the circuit court.d.in the portion of the opinion designated as part i,the appellate court construed our decision in berlin as reaffirming the viability of the corporate practice of medicine doctrine,and as creating a narrow exception to the application of the doctrine which arises only when a licensed hospital enter s into contracts with physicians.emphasis in original.d at.thus,the appellate court held that ahi,which is an unlicensed institute and which is controlled in part by a partnership of which one member is a nonphysician,did not fit within this narrow exception and was barred by the corporate practice of medicine doctrine from entering into an employment agreement with plaintiff.in the course of its ruling,the appellate court noted the conflict between plaintiff and william kessler,ahi nonphysician president,which,in the view of the appellate court,demonstrates the pitfalls of corporations practicing medicine.d at.accordingly,the appellate court held that,from its inception,the agreement between ahi and plaintiff was void,unenforceable,and unassignable.in the portion of the opinion designated as part ii,the appellate court went on to state that,even if it were assum ed arguendo that berlin applies to the facts in the instant case,the noncompetition covenant in the agreement between ahi and plaintiff was an unreasonable restraint of trade and is unenforceable on grounds.d at.the appellate court explained that an agreement restricting the right of a physician to practice medicine after leaving the employ of a provider limits not only the physician professional autonomy but also the patients freedom to chose a doctor.d at.
defendants petitioned this court for leave to appeal pursuant to rule a a.we granted defendants petition.
at issue in this appeal is whether the agreement entered into between ahi and plaintiff,including the noncompetition clause,is valid and enforceable.defendants contend that the appellate court erred in holding that the corporate practice of medicine doctrine barred ahi from employing physicians such as plaintiff.ahi advances the argument that,under our decision in berlin,a charitable nonprofit organization such as ahi is excepted from application of the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine,even if the organization is not licensed to practice medicine.plaintiff contends that the appellate court correctly declined to extend the berlin exception to unlicensed health centers such as ahi.we agree with plaintiff.
in berlin,the plaintiff physician entered into a employment agreement with the defendant,sarah bush lincoln health center.the defendant was a nonprofit corporation licensed under the hospital licensing act ilcs et west to operate a hospital.the employment agreement contained a noncompetition covenant which prohibited the plaintiff from providing health services within a radius of the defendant for two years after the end of the employment agreement.
after being in the employ of the defendant for two years,the plaintiff informed the defendant by letter that he was resigning and accepting another employment offer.after his resignation,the plaintiff immediately began working at a medical facility located one mile from the defendant.the defendant sought a preliminary injunction to prohibit the plaintiff from practicing at the competing facility based on the restrictive covenant contained within the employment agreement.in response,the plaintiff filed a complaint for declaratory judgment and a motion for summary judgment seeking to have the restrictive covenant invalidated on the basis that the defendant,by hiring the plaintiff to practice medicine as its employee,violated the proscription against a corporation practicing medicine.the circuit court agreed with the plaintiff,found the entire employment agreement unenforceable,and granted the plaintiff motion for summary judgment.as stated,a divided panel of the appellate court affirmed.berlin,d at.this court reversed the judgment of the appellate court.
the issue addressed by this court in berlin was framed narrowly whether the corporate practice doctrine,as set forth by this court in people ex rel.kerner united medical service,prohibits licensed hospitals from employing physicians to provide medical services.berlin,at.we began our analysis by reviewing the genesis of the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine.we observed that this doctrine is premised on the rationale that a corporation can not be licensed to practice medicine because only a human being can sustain the education,training,and which are prerequisites to receiving a professional license,and s ince a corporation can not receive a medical license,it follows that a corporation can not legally practice the profession.berlin,at.accordingly,it has long been held that the employment of physicians by corporations is illegal because the acts of the physicians are attributable to the corporate employer,which can not obtain a medical license.berlin,at.we further observed in berlin that the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine is also supported by several public policy arguments which espouse the dangers of lay control over professional judgment,the division of the physician loyalty between his patient and his profitmaking employer,and the commercialization of the profession.berlin,at.
we noted in berlin that this court first addressed the corporate practice doctrine as it pertained to medicine in the decision in people ex rel.kerner united medical service.in kerner,a general corporation operated a health clinic in which all medical services were rendered by physicians.the state alleged that the corporation was illegally engaged in the practice of medicine in violation of the medical practice act,ch,par.et.this court agreed with the state,and rejected the contention advanced by the defendant that the practice of medicine does not encompass the corporate ownership of a health clinic where treatment is rendered solely by licensed physician employees.berlin,at,citing kerner,at.
we observed in berlin that,since this court decision in kerner,no illinois court has applied the corporate practice of medicine doctrine or specifically addressed the issue of whether licensed hospitals are prohibited from employing physicians.berlin,at.therefore,we engaged in a survey of decisions from other jurisdictions with respect to the application of the corporate practice of medicine doctrine to hospitals and concluded that these rulings could be divided into three categories.first,we observed that some jurisdictions refused to adopt
