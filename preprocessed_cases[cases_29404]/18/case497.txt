appellant the cadle company cadle,the major creditor of the bankruptcy estate of james moore,iii moore,appeals the district court affirmance of the bankruptcy court approval of a settlement of estate claims over its objection and despite its offer to purchase the claims for higher value.we reverse and remand,concluding that the claims at issue could be sold as well as compromised and that the bankruptcy court failure to consider the effect of such a sale was an abuse of discretion.
cadle sued moore in state court more than a year before moore filed for bankruptcy,seeking to recover a judgment it owned against him.the complaint also named moore wife elizabeth moore elizabeth,jhm properties,jhm,and brunswick homes,llc brunswick in essence,cadle alleged that from to,moore used various business entities to shield his personal assets from creditors.specifically,cadle asserted claims of reverse against brunswick and jhm and fraudulent conveyance against jhm and elizabeth.it also sought a constructive trust against the assets of brunswick,jhm,and elizabeth.
summary judgment motions had been filed,and a ruling was pending when moore filed for bankruptcy,staying the litigation.the chapter trustee,jeffrey mims,inherited the case and retained cadle attorneys as special counsel.
cadle is the estate largest creditor.it filed proofs of claim for roughly million,or of the unsecured debt.because moore represented that he had no assets for distribution,asset recovery litigation was the only potential means for creditors to receive any payment.cadle thus continued to fund the litigation after it came under the trustee control.it advanced over in attorneys fees to the trustee former continue prosecution of the claims.
as the legal fees continued to mount without resolution,cadle sought a more active role.in january,it offered to purchase the claims from the trustee for.the trustee refused as to the amount but did not reject the possibility of a sale.instead,he proposed a counteroffer in cash of any gross recovery and waiver of cadle million in claims against the estate.
cadle refused that counteroffer but continued to negotiate.it asked the trustee either to sell the claims to it for or to auction them to the highest bidder.the trustee refused both options.cadle raised the cash offer to and continued to ask for an auction.the trustee again refused.
meanwhile,the bankruptcy court ruled on the summary judgment motions pending at the time of removal.it denied brunswick motion but was openly hostile to reverse as a viable theory under texas law.
after the court ruling,the case seemed to be on course for trial.the trustee asked cadle to fund a forensic accountant,but cadle refused unless the trustee could provide a cost estimate.apparently cadle withholding of carte blanche caused the trustee to the case.the trustee did not hire its own expert and instead began negotiating a settlement with defendants.he did not notify cadle of this change in strategy,though cadle had consistently demonstrated a strong desire to press the case to trial.the trustee eventually entered a proposed settlement of the claims with the defendants for.
cadle first learned of the proposed settlement once the trustee had filed his motion for approval with the bankruptcy court.cadle contacted the trustee and offered immediately to pay for the claims.it also filed an objection to the proposed settlement in the bankruptcy court,urging that the proposed settlement was essentially a sale of estate assets and that the trustee therefore had a duty to maximize the value of the claims.cadle argued that the trustee could not push through a settlement for a lesser amount than the major creditor was willing to pay the estate.cadle asked instead that the claims be sold to it or auctioned to the highest bidder.
at the hearing to approve the settlement,the trustee attorney characterized cadle offer as a substantial offer and stated that accepting it could be in the best interest of creditors.the trustee attorney also acknowledged that was substantially more than the settlement amount and that the objective of the trustee was to maximize the funds available to creditors in this case.finally,the attorney assured the court that either conducting an auction or selling the claims to cadle would dispose of them permanently,and the court would no longer have to face this issue.the court,however,was unconvinced that a sale was possible.it questioned whether a trustee can sell causes of action such as avoidance actions,particularly avoidance actions.
a second hearing was held,and cadle urged the same arguments.defendants responded that it would be unfair to them if the court were to upset the proposed settlement.
in a ruling from the bench,the bankruptcy court determined that the settlement was in the best interest of the estate.that conclusion was based in part on the court misgivings as to whether the trustee could sell these claims.it concluded as a matter of law that the claims could not be sold.
the court thus believed it had only two options approve the settlement or require the trustee to continue litigating the claims.the court questioned whether reverse is a legal theory,reasoned that litigation would be expensive for the estate,and suggested that the trustee would have difficulty collecting any judgment.the court also believed that the views of brunswick,as a contingent creditor,merited consideration,because brunswick had filed a million indemnity claim against the estate,the contingency being the success of the reverse claims.the district court affirmed the rulings of the bankruptcy court.
we review a district court affirmance of a bankruptcy court decision by applying the same standard of review to the bankruptcy court decision that the district court applied.barner saxon mort,in re barner,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.we review the bankruptcy court settlement approval for abuse of discretion and its conclusions of law de novo.life ins.united.fin.in re foster mort,cir.a lower court by definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.koon united states.accordingly,the abuse of discretion standard includes review to determine that the discretion was not guided by erroneous legal conclusions.browning mims in re coastal plains,cir quotation omitted.
the threshold question is whether the trustee could legally sell the claims.the bankruptcy court held that it could not and approved the proposed compromise on the basis that continued litigation offered little promise for the estate.cadle argues it can purchase the claims from the trustee and pursue them at its own risk and expense,paying the estate immediately for that right.it thus contends that the court analysis was in error because it failed to consider the sale alternative.
as a general matter,a trustee may sell causes of action belonging to the estate.section of the bankruptcy code governs the sale,use,or lease of property of the estate,allowing the trustee to sell property of the estate,other than in the ordinary course of business,after notice and a hearing.b.section defines property of the estate to include,among other things,all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.a.t he term all legal and equitable interests of the debtor in property is and includes rights of action as bestowed by either federal or state law.a trustee may sell litigation claims that belong to the estate,as it can other estate property,pursuant to b 
we now turn to whether the trustee may sell the particular claims in this case to cadle.a trustee may sell only assets that are property of the estate.in re cont l air lines,cir.cadle sought to purchase its original state law action from the trustee.in that action,it asserted claims of alter ego reverse and fraudulent conveyance it also requested a remedy.
a.the alter ego claims.
we have previously addressed whether alter ego claims brought by a creditor under texas state law are property of the estate within the meaning of.acquisition,at.we identified as operative the question whether a debtor corporation could assert an action against itself based upon alter ego.id.at.we recognized that alter ego claims are typically asserted by the debtor creditors but noted that theoretically nothing in texas law prohibits a corporation from asserting on its own an action based on alter ego and that in fact the underlying policy of the remedy supports this conclusion.id.at.we therefore held that the alter ego action brought by the creditor in fact belonged to the debtor and was property of the estate within the meaning of a.id.
our decision in acquisition alone,however,does not necessarily resolve the question whether the alter ego claims brought by cadle actually belong to the estate.that case dealt with a traditional claim,whereby a creditor attempts to hold liable a shareholders or its affiliated entities for the obligations of the.here,by contrast,cadle has brought a reverse claim that seeks to hold brunswick and jhm liable for the acts of the individual debtor,moore.
we have previously held that distinction to be one without a difference.in schimmelpenninck byrne in re schimmelpenninck,cir,we found error in the judgments of the bankruptcy and district courts that a creditor action based on of a corporate veil does not constitute property of the bankruptcy estate,id.at,and we concluded that the action belongs to the trustee,not to one individual creditor of the debtor,id.at.we recognize the tension between the rule and its application a reverse claim,unlike a traditional claim,does not allege harm to the debtor our decisions in acquisition and schimmelpenninck nevertheless control as to the alter ego claims those claims are property of the estate so the trustee may sell them to cadle pursuant to b.
b.the claims 
whether an action brought under state law belongs to the estate under a depends on whether the debtor could have brought that action at the commencement of the case at least one of our decisions reads mortgageamerica broadly to hold that claims brought under texas law are property of the estate under a 
that reading of mortgageamerica conflicts with acquisition 
in addressing the fraudulent transfer action,we held that under texas law this cause of action was assertable only by a creditor and did not belong to the debtor corporation citing mortgageamerica,at.even though this claim therefore could not be treated like the other two actions,which we held to be property of the estate,we nevertheless held that it also was stayed pursuant to section a.our reasoning was that while the defendant in the state court action was not the debtor,but a control person of the debtor,the creditor suit sought to recover property of the debtor estate.
acquisition,at 
our decision in educators nevertheless controls,because the above discussion in acquisition is dictum thus,under our precedent,the texas actions are property of the estate under a that the trustee may sell to cadle yet we hesitate to rest our decision entirely on that basis,because of the conflict between educators and acquisition and because of the tension between that result and the general rule that an action belongs to the estate under a only if the debtor could have brought that action at the commencement of the case 
but a is not the only provision under which property may become property of the estate.although that section often provides the bulk of estate assets and thus is the focus of property of the estate analysis,the trustee avoidance powers,allow the trustee to enlarge the property of the estate after commencement of the case.see gaudet babin in re zedda,cir.the relationship between property of the estate under and the powers of is one of the most important and least appreciated in all of bankruptcy law too often lawyers focus exclusively on and forget that does much of the work.douglas baird,elements of bankruptcy ed.
central to this bankruptcy is the trustee power under b,which allows him to succeed to the actual,allowable and unsecured claims of the estate creditors.see b.if an actual,unsecured creditor can,on the date of the bankruptcy,reach property that the debtor has transferred to a third party,the trustee may use b to step into the shoes of that creditor and avoid the debtor transfer.although the cause of action belonged to one creditor,any property the trustee recovers becomes estate property and is divided pro rata among all general creditors the trustee may recover the full extent of the fraudulently transferred property on the basis of one creditor claim.moore bay.in other words,an entire transfer may be set aside even though the creditor claim is nominal.collier on bankruptcy ed.
the trustee successor rights arise under federal law,but the extent of those rights depends entirely on applicable state law.that distinction creates important differences between fraudulent transfer actions brought under b and those pursued under.for example,a limitations period applies to fraudulent transfer actions brought under texas law,whereas the reachback period is limited to two years.compare.bus.ann.a with a.
cadle is an actual unsecured creditor that brought claims against defendants under texas law before commencement of the bankruptcy.because those claims sought to recover estate property,the provisions of a barred cadle from pursuing the claims individually once the petition was filed.see mortgageamerica,at.at the same time,the trustee stepped into cadle shoes under b and assumed control of the claims for the benefit of all general creditors.
the question we must next address is whether,by operation of b,those claims became property of the estate that may be sold.a split of authority exists as to whether the trustee may sell causes of action that arise from his avoidance powers 
we focus narrowly on the trustee ability to sell causes of action that he has inherited from creditors under b causes of action that exist independent of the bankruptcy proceeding.it is well established that a claim for fraudulent conveyance is included within estate property.t he right to recoup a fraudulent conveyance,which outside of bankruptcy may be invoked by a creditor,is property of the estate that only a trustee or debtor in possession may pursue once a bankruptcy is under way.tax credit partners,havlik,cir.although claims under texas state law could not be brought by the debtor,mortgageamerica,at,such claims become estate property once bankruptcy is under way by virtue of the trustee successor rights under b,havlik,at.the trustee may therefore sell these state law actions back to cadle 
allowing a trustee to sell b rights of action is in accord with the trustee existing powers.in chapter cases,for instance,a party other than the debtor or the trustee may be authorized by a plan of reorganization to exercise avoidance powers.mcfarland leyh in re.petroleum,cir.outside the context of a reorganization plan,we have consistently recognized that a single creditor may bring a chapter avoidance action on behalf of the trustee after court approval the bankruptcy code permits an individual creditor to pursue a action,for the benefit of the estate,in the name of the trustee but at the creditor own risk and expense 
moreover,a sale of assets under requires notice and a hearing and is subject to court approval.see cont l,at.courts will look to the trustee articulated business justification or sound business reasons for the proposed sale.id.any sale of b actions would therefore undergo careful judicial scrutiny pursuant to existing b requirements 
we conclude,therefore,that the claims are property of the estate under a per educators,at.in the alternative,the claims became estate property under b other estate be sold pursuant to b 
the bankruptcy court ruling that the claims could not be sold was legal error,and its approval of the proposed settlement was an abuse of discretion.the court failure to consider the consequences to the estate of a sale was also an abuse of discretion 
c.the remedy.
under texas law,a constructive trust is an equitable remedy imposed by law to prevent unjust enrichment resulting from an unconscionable act.haber oil swinehart in re haber oil,cir.a constructive trust is not a cause of action under texas law.the remedy is appropriate on a showing of actual fraud or breach of a confidential or fiduciary relationship.id.at citations omitted.the burden of establishing the existence of the constructive trust rests on the claimant,as does the burden of identifying and tracing the trust property.id.at citations omitted.
if cadle had demonstrated its entitlement to a constructive trust in the disputed properties by the time moore filed for bankruptcy,those properties would belong exclusively to cadle and would not be subject to pro rata distribution among all estate creditors.see also d.but that did not occur at the filing of the petition,cadle and the defendants had only filed for summary judgment.the remedy is therefore intertwined with the alter ego and claims.like the underlying claims,that remedy belongs to the estate.cadle may thus acquire the remedy if it successfully purchases the underlying causes of action.
whether a trustee proposed compromise of estate claims can constitute a proposed sale of estate property that triggers sale provisions is an issue of first impression in this circuit.the bankruptcy court power to approve a proposed settlement or compromise of the estate claims arises under rule of the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure.a proposed settlement must be fair and equitable and in the best interests of the estate.am.can herpel in re jackson brewing,cir.five factors inform the fair and equitable analysis the probability of success in the litigation,with due consideration for the uncertainty in fact and law the complexity and likely duration of the litigation and any attendant expense,inconvenience,and delay,including the difficulties,if any,to be encountered in the matter of collection the paramount interest of the creditors and a proper deference to their respective views the extent to which the settlement is truly the product of arm length bargaining and not fraud or collusion and all other factors bearing on the wisdom of the compromise.see foster,at.
a sale of assets under,as implemented by rule,requires notice and a hearing and is subject to court approval and must be supported by an articulated business justification,good business judgment,or sound business reasons.see cont l,at.a trustee has the duty to maximize the value of the estate.commodity futures trading comm weintraub.as a general matter,the trustee must demonstrate that the proposed sale price is the highest and best offer,though a bankruptcy court may accept a lower bid in the presence of sound business reasons,such as substantial doubt that the higher bidder can raise the cash necessary to complete the deal.collier on bankruptcy f ed.
we must decide whether cadle overbid required the bankruptcy court to scrutinize the proposed compromise under and rule,in addition to rule a.the issue has given rise to a circuit split 
the cases are mixed on whether the settlement of a claim that the estate owns is a sale that is,disposition of property of the estate citing hicks,muse,brandt in re healthco int l,cir deciding that settlement is not a sale,goodwin mickey thompson entm t group,in re mickey thompson entm t group,cir stating that settlement is a sale in re dow corning,same.the point may be academic for purposes of whether court approval is required,because rule requires notice and a hearing and court approval of settlements,independent of section b.however,there may be other consequences,such as whether overbids are permitted.citing mickey thompson.
collier on bankruptcy,supra.
the trustee argues that a bankruptcy court need not consider overbids,because a proposed settlement amount need only be reasonable.cadle urges that the court should have considered an auction of these claims in light of its higher offer.it asks us to adopt the reasoning of goodwin mickey thompson entertainment group,in re mickey thompson entertainment group,cir.under nearly indistinguishable factual circumstances,that court held as follows 
when confronted with a motion to approve a settlement under rule a,a bankruptcy court is obliged to consider,as part of the fair and equitable analysis,whether any property of the estate that would be disposed of in connection with the settlement might draw a higher price through a competitive process and be the proper subject of a section sale.
the first circuit has held,without analysis,that a settlement is not a sale.see hicks,muse brandt in re healthco int l,cir.that decision represents the less defensible side of the circuit split.courts in the third,sixth,and seventh circuits,in addition to the mickey thompson court,have taken the position that a settlement may trigger requirements in dow corning,at,the court held that the settlements at issue were the same as a sale of assets under b.in telesphere,at,the court stated,the settlement of a cause of action held by the estate is plainly the equivalent of a sale of that claim.
the collier treatise has sided with mickey thompson and other courts that have construed settlements as the equivalent of the sale of estate assets 
compromises of estate claims which should have been noticed as a sale 
a compromise of a claim of the estate is in essence the sale of that claim to the defendant.in most compromises,the procedures of rule and the substance of code section will not be implicated.however,if other parties indicate that they are willing to pay more for the claim,or if it is otherwise shown that a bidding procedure would be appropriate,then the trustee must proceed under section and procedures described herein citing mickey thompson.
collier on bankruptcy,supra.
we adopt the reasoning of mickey thompson.the proposed compromise was a disposition of estate property.cadle higher offer obligated the bankruptcy court to consider whether an auction and sale were appropriate.whether to impose formal sale procedures is ultimately a matter of discretion that we leave to bankruptcy courts.mickey thompson,at.
the trustee points out that brunswick has agreed to waive its million indemnity claim against the estate as a part of the proposed settlement.the trustee argues that the proposed settlement is therefore a true compromise,unlike the situation in mickey thompson brunswick indemnity claim is a contingent claim that would be triggered only if the reverse claims against it were to prevail.that would not occur,however,unless it were shown that brunswick and moore are the same entity.
the merits of the indemnity claim are not before us,so we do not express any opinion as to whether brunswick can hold an indemnity claim against itself.on remand,the bankruptcy court should compare the value to the estate of the release of that claim,if any,against the value of cadle higher bid.bankruptcy courts should not allow defendants to settle estate claims at a discount and avoid scrutiny by filing large,frivolous claims against the estate in any event,there is no logical reason why cadle can not assume the liability of that indemnity claim as a part of its bid for the action.
cadle bid was indeed a substantial offer.moreover,entertaining overbids often triggers a bidding sequence that may lead to a much higher price.mickey thompson,at.because the bankruptcy court did not entertain cadle offer and did not hold an auction,the true value of the claims is undetermined.
the trustee administrative expenses are also unknown,though cadle has already paid the trustee attorneys fees.thus it remains to be seen what the estate will recover from a sale or compromise of these claims.it certainly can not be presumed that any sale price,no matter the amount,will fail to translate to more money for the estate.
on remand,the bankruptcy court must afford proper deference to the views of cadle,as the estate majority creditor and the only creditor to take an interest in the claims our caselaw recognizes the paramount interest of creditors and requires deference to their reasonable views concerning proposed settlements.jackson brewing,at.a bankruptcy court may not ignore creditors overwhelming opposition to a settlement.foster,at.in a case such as this,litigation claims represent the last prospect of recovery for the estate.after paying over to the trustee attorneys to prepare the case for trial,cadle had every reason to demand that the trustee maximize the value of the claims through an auction.
if the bankruptcy court were to upset the proposed settlement in the interest of maximizing the value of estate assets,it would not work an injustice on defendants.everyone who deals with a bankruptcy trustee in a transaction that is not in the ordinary course of business is charged with the knowledge that the law may require court approval mickey thompson,at.a proposed settlement may bind the parties,but it does not bind the courts otherwise,the approval process would be meaningless.
in the event an auction is held and the trustee selects defendants offer,the bankruptcy court must assess the transaction as both a proposed sale under and a proposed compromise under rule procedures under that rule would not be invoked,however,were the trustee to accept cadle bid,because the transaction would not constitute a proposed settlement.
in summary,the claims at issue are assets of the estate that can be sold to cadle.the bankruptcy court decision to the contrary was an error of law and therefore an abuse of discretion.we adopt mickey thompson.the proposed settlement was a disposition of estate assets,and cadle overbid required the court to consider the appropriateness of an auction and sale procedures.its failure to consider those alternatives was also an abuse of discretion.
on remand,the bankruptcy court must determine whether the claims are the proper subject of an auction and sale.in reaching that decision,it should analyze the merit of brunswick indemnity claim.
the judgment of the district court,affirming the decisions of the bankruptcy court,is reversed,and this matter is remanded to the district court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
