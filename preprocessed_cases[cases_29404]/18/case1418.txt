statement of the facts and case 
in,pellegrini learned about the availability of approximately acres of undeveloped property in the santa cruz mountains named telford ranch.pellegrini approached weiss about the telford ranch as an investment opportunity.
the telford ranch was owned by a corporation known as telford,which was a wholly owned subsidiary of the corporation ckm.ckm,owned only telford,which in turn owned only telford ranch there were no other assets in either ckm,or telford.
the only two shareholders in ckm,were randy cook,who owned percent of the outstanding shares,and ken marks,who owned the remaining percent of shares.cook and marks were interested in selling telford ranch,but wanted to structure the sale as one for stock in ckm,rather than a straight sale of the real property.specifically,cook wanted the buyers to purchase his shares for cash,while marks wanted a stock exchange.in addition,marks and his wife wanted to retain a separate fee simple interest in a portion of the telford ranch after subdivision in exchange for their shares of ckm,stock.
following a year of negotiations,the terms of the sale were agreed upon among the parties.cook and marks agreed to sell percent of the stock in ckm,for a sum of cash to cook,and a specifically designated fee simple interest in the telford ranch to marks.the parties prepared a stock option agreement for the purchase of percent of the stock in ckm,that included an amendment specifying the parameters of the plot of land that would be conveyed to marks.the amended stock option agreement granted marks an exclusive easement as to a portion of the telford ranch allowing him to construct a minimum of square foot home and a garage on a specified site,a percent tenancy in common interest in the property,trail rights on the existing roads and a share in the water system.
in order to effectuate the creation of fee simple interest in the property that marks negotiated at the outset,marks shares of ckm,stock were placed in trust,and weiss and pellegrini were named as.the only trust corpus was the shares of ckm,inc,stock,and all decisions with regard to that corpus required the unanimous agreement of weiss and pellegrini.after the telford ranch was subdivided and marks received his fee simple deed in the land,the voting trust would be terminated,and pellegrini and weiss would receive full ownership of the remaining shares of the ckm,stock.
while these negotiations with cook and marks were being finalized,in november,pellegrini and weiss formalized their joint venture agreement in a memorandum of understanding mou.the relevant portions of the mou specifying the investments and sharing of profits are as follows david weiss and george pellegrini voluntarily agree to enter into a joint venture agreement to purchase stock of the corporation owing the telford ranch described as approximately acres of land located in the hills of aptos,california the anticipated profits shall be divided as follows.percent to the three investors contributing thousand,and percent shall be divided as follows or each between george pellegrini and david weiss.in addition,the commission paid by the seller to century cheshire,after the deduction of the century fee and deduction of the century cheshire share shall be divided as follows to george pellegrini and to david weiss.all other professional fees to carry out this joint venture shall be the cost of the corporation.
on november,pellegrini and weiss notified cook and marks that they wished to exercise their option to the cook shares and the voting rights to marks share.pursuant to the stock option agreement,pellegrini was paid as a commission for the transaction,and in turn,pellegrini paid weiss his share of the commission pursuant to the mou.
on december,pellegrini and weiss executed both stock option agreements,and according to the terms of those agreements,each took title equally to the shares in ckm,formerly owned by cook.pellegrini and weiss were granted shares each of ckm,stock.in addition,pellegrini and weiss executed the voting trust agreement,and became to shares of stock in ckm,owned by marks.
in february,acting as an attorney for telford,inc,weiss filed a statement of domestic stock corporation with the california secretary of state,naming himself and pellegrini as sole directors of telford.pellegrini was named chief executive officer,and weiss was named secretary and chief financial officer.in addition,weiss,acting as attorney for ckm,inc,filed a statement of domestic stock corporation with the secretary of state,naming himself and pellegrini as sole directors of ckm.weiss was named chief executive officer and chief financial officer,and pellegrini was named secretary of ckm.
in february,weiss contacted robert schalk,an attorney certified as a specialist in tax to address taxation and corporate issues related to telford,inc,and ckm.pellegrini,weiss and schalk had a meeting on february,to discuss schalk opinion on the matter.schalk recommended that they immediately transfer telford ranch from telford,to ckm,and dissolve telford.following that transaction,ckm,would be dissolved and the telford ranch would be deeded to the telford investors in their individual names.schalk also recommended that the telford investors hold the property for a period of time and then convey their interests to an to be formed in the future.although both schalk and weiss tried to convince pellegrini to agree to the recommended course of action,pellegrini did not acquiesce.
in july,weiss asked pellegrini to sign documents to add the names of the telford investors to the stock they owned,as was recommended by schalk.pellegrini refused to do this,believing it would dilute his interest in the corporation.this became a considerable source of conflict between the parties.weiss expressed concern to pellegrini because they had not put any money up in the transaction,and weiss believed he had a duty to the telford investors to have their names on the certificates.
on september,weiss sent a certified letter to pellegrini in which he expressed his interest in terminating their venture.in the letter,weiss stated it has become very obvious to me that i will not be able to work with you on the telford property.i have discussed the problem with my investors and they have authorized me to offer the following proposal.you buy my investors and me out of the land deal or.we buy you out of the land deal.if we do not get a written response to our proposal within days of your receipt of this letter,my investors have authorized me to take whatever legal action is necessary to get you out of the project.i hope that you will cooperate with us to end our association,but your cooperation is not necessary for my investors to succeed.
pellegrini responded on october,expressing his dissatisfaction with weiss letter.pellegrini did not agree to any of the terms proposed in the letter.in light of pellegrini response,weiss sent another letter to pellegrini on october,stating i am in receipt of your letter dated october.unfortunately you did not respond to my initial request,so i will make our position very clear.we will not be able to continue under our contract to work together on the telford property.since you did not respond to our offer to buy you out we are offering you one of the following options a.we will buy out your contractual.interest for the total sum of as soon as possible.b.we do not buy you out now and you wait until the land is developed and sold to get your.profit,which may take three to ten years.however,you must agree not to interfere with the investors or me in completing our objectives.you will have no management or decision making duties and you will not represent yourself in any way as having such authority.also you will not contact any former sellers,attorneys,title companies or santa cruz county or city officials of any kind.in other words,you will remain silent as to all aspects of this project.if you do not agree to one of the above options,the investors have authorized me to proceed legally to protect their respective interest.
pellegrini did not accept any of the provisions put forth by weiss.in november,weiss informed pellegrini that he was in the process of preparing a lawsuit against him,that he should not set foot on the property,and that he should not represent that he was an owner.

weiss voided pellegrini stock certificate,which represented shares of ckm,inc,and withdrew money from the corporate bank account,removing and placing it into an account to which pellegrini had no access.weiss purported to transfer interests in the telford ranch into the individual names of the telford investors in proportion to their investments,and a percent interest to the markses.

discussion 
weiss appeal of the judgment in favor of pellegrini for breach of fiduciary 
in his appeal,weiss attacks the judgment finding he breached his fiduciary duty to pellegrini.weiss asserts there was not substantial evidence to support the judgment the trial court erred in amending the complaint to conform to proof the trial court erred in declaring pellegrini had no liability for future title problems on the telford ranch the trial court erred in ruling in limine to exclude evidence of pellegrini associates corporation status the verdict was inconsistent the amount of damages awarded was excessive and the date set by the trial court for running the interest on the damages award was incorrect.each issue is discussed separately below.
substantial evidence to support the verdict for breach of fiduciary duty 
in resolving the issue of the sufficiency of the evidence,we are bound by the established rules of appellate review that all factual matters will be viewed most favorably to the prevailing party citations and in support of the judgment citation.all issues of credibility are likewise within the province of the trier of fact.citation.in brief,the appellate court ordinarily looks only at the evidence supporting the successful party,and disregards the contrary showing.citation.all conflicts,therefore,must be resolved in favor of the respondent.nestle city of santa monica cal d.we also bear in mind that the jury properly may reject part of the testimony of a witness,though not directly contradicted,and combine the accepted portions with bits of testimony or inferences from the testimony of other witnesses thus weaving a cloth of truth out of selected available material.citations.stevens parke,davis cal d.
the elements of a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty are the existence of a fiduciary duty a breach of the fiduciary duty and resulting damage.city of atascadero merrill,lynch,pierce,fenner smith,th,d.
the existence of a fiduciary duty here depends on whether the parties were in a joint venture with each other,since partners or joint venturers have a fiduciary duty to act with the highest good faith towards each other regarding affairs of the partnership or joint venture.equitable life assurance society th,d laux freed cal d.the essential element of a joint venture is an undertaking by two or more persons to carry out a single business enterprise jointly for profit.nelson abraham cal d.the rights and liabilities of joint adventurers,as between themselves,are governed by the same rules which apply to partnerships.boyd bevilacqua d.a joint venture agreement may be informal or oral.fitzgerald provines d.whether a joint venture relationship exists is a question of fact,depending on the intention of the parties.april enterprises,kttv d.boyd bevilacqua,supra,d at.
the evidence produced at trial supports a finding of a fiduciary duty between weiss and pellegrini through the formation of a joint venture.both pellegrini and weiss testified that they came together for the common purpose of developing real estate for profit.the agreement between the parties shows that pellegrini was charged with identifying the property to be developed,had a relationship with the seller of that property,and had expertise in how to develop and subdivide the property.weiss was to provide the capital for the investment,as well as the development and sale of the property with pellegrini.
evidence of the existence of a fiduciary duty can be found not only in the testimony of the parties,but also in the mou executed by the parties memorializing their understanding the agreement.the mou clearly stated that pellegrini and weiss would work together toward the common goal of acquiring,developing and selling the telford ranch property,and provided for a specific profit sharing formula.
it is notable that only now on appeal does weiss argue the lack of a fiduciary duty owed to pellegrini.indeed,at trial the parties stipulated to a joint jury instruction on the breach of fiduciary duty claim that acknowledges the existence of a fiduciary duty owed between the parties based upon their joint venture that stated as follows george pellegrini and david weiss each claim that they were harmed because each other breached fiduciary duties owed as a venturer,and officer and director.in this respect,each of the parties is agent and trustee of the other and they must account in accordance with the terms of the agreement between them.each was required to act in the highest good faith toward one another,to not act for the unilateral benefit of himself or the telford investors,and to not fail to disclose the material facts.the law imposes on george pellegrini,as a real estate broker,the same obligation of undivided service and loyalty that it imposes on trustee in favor of his beneficiary.to establish this claim,a party must prove all of the following.that the other party breached the duty to act in the highest good faith toward them.that they were harmed and.that the other party conduct was a substantial factor in causing that harm.
there was substantial evidence produced in the trial court to demonstrate that weiss breached his fiduciary duty to pellegrini through their joint venture,and that pellegrini suffered harm as a result.once pellegrini refused to take the action to dissolve the corporations as suggested by schalk,weiss took unilateral action,including offering to buy pellegrini out of his share of the corporation,and his expected percent profit pursuant to the agreement for.this sum was not reasonable in light of the value of the projected endeavor,as weiss himself testified to at trial,as over million.
moreover,once pellegrini refused weiss offer,weiss took steps to dissolve the corporations,going so far as to offer what appear to be false statements to the california secretary of state about the status of telford,and ckm.weiss presented no substantial evidence at trial in the form of corporate minutes or resolutions authorizing him to oust pellegrini as ceo of telford,and secretary of ckm,and replacing pellegrini with his wife in both capacities.nor did weiss offer substantial evidence to justify his act of cancelling pellegrini stock certificate for shares of ckm,or of withdrawing funds from the corporate bank account in the amount of and placing them in an account that pellegrini had no access to.
weiss focuses heavily in his appeal on the fact that pellegrini was not a licensed real estate broker in his individual capacity at the time of the transaction,asserting the mou was enforceable in its entirety as a result.weiss also implies pellegrini lack of appropriate individual licensure also somehow justified his actions in ousting him from the corporations and cancelling his stock certificates.however,the trial court specifically found that pellegrini associates was a valid corporation in california,had a corporate broker license,and that pellegrini was acting as the corporation appointed agent.during motions in limine,the court took judicial notice of documents showing pellegrini associates had been issued a certificate of revivor from the state of california,showing the corporation to be in good standing,as well as a certificate of relief form contract voidability from the franchise tax board that granted relief from july,to may,covering the period of time for the transactions in this case.
while pellegrini may not have had an individual real estate license at the time of this transaction,and the mou represented that he did,this fact is not fatal to the case,and certainly does not justify weiss conduct.pellegrini service as a real estate agent was clearly contemplated by the parties,and he did in fact serve in that role to a degree.however,he was doing so under the authority of pellegrini associates,a licensed real estate broker,as its designated agent.
moreover,contrary to weiss assertions,the joint venture was more than an agreement for pellegrini to provide broker services for which he would be compensated.the mou clearly provided that both pellegrini and weiss would purchase stock in the landowning corporation,direct a future corporation,and share in profits.the fact that pellegrini was not licensed as an individual is not relevant to whether or not weiss breached his fiduciary duty.
based on our review of the record,we find substantial evidence to support the jury finding that weiss breached his fiduciary duty to pellegrini arising out of their joint venture.
trial court amendment to conform to proof 
weiss asserts on appeal that the trial court erred in amending the complaint at the close of evidence to add pellegrini associates as plaintiff to conform to proof.the general rule is that a mendments to conform to proof should be liberally granted.citations.century cigarette vendors shaheen d.however,the allowance of amendments to conform to the proof rests largely in the discretion of the trial court and its determination will not be disturbed on appeal unless it clearly appears that such discretion has been abused.citations.trafton youngblood cal d.
weiss argues the amendment was improper because pellegrini associates were not parties to the mou,and therefore,there was no fiduciary duty owed to them,and even if they were parties to the mou,their corporate status was suspended at the time of the transaction.even in light of these assertions,weiss does not demonstrate how the court order allowing the addition of pellegrini associates as a plaintiff was a manifest abuse of discretion,or more importantly,how the amendment prejudiced weiss.indeed,the court noted that weiss brought pellegrini associates into the action when they were named as defendants in their complaint.
moreover,weiss offers nothing to demonstrate how he and the telford investors would be in a different,better position had the court not added pellegrini associates to conform to proof.the jury found weiss breached a fiduciary duty to pellegrini,and awarded him in damages.there is nothing to indicate the jury would have decided the case differently had pellegrini associates not been added as plaintiffs.
trial court denial of weiss request for restitution from pellegrini 
weiss asserts on appeal the trial court erred in denying their equitable claim for restitution of paid to pellegrini in brokerage fees.
in its statement of decision regarding the restitution claim,the court stated the weiss defendants failed to prove their claim for restitution of brokerage fees earned by pellegrini.the court found that pellegrini associates realtors,a plaintiff and defendant in this action,is a properly licensed real estate broker.the court found that pellegrini associates,is a corporation in good standing with the department of real estate and the secretary of state.the weiss defendant claim for restitution is denied.
weiss argues the trial court erred because its finding that pellegrini associates was licensed did not give pellegrini the right to collect a real estate commission.in the alternative,weiss asserts even if pellegrini was licensed individually,he breached his fiduciary duties,barring him from recovery of fees.neither of these arguments supports this court reversal of the order denying restitution 
initially,the court concluded that pellegrini was appointed by pellegrini associates to serve as a broker in the transaction.therefore,the fact that pellegrini associates was not a party to the mou is immaterial for the purpose of payment of the commission,as is the fact that pellegrini was not licensed as a broker in his individual capacity.
with regard to the second claim that pellegrini breached his fiduciary duty requiring him to return the commission paid,weiss asserts the jury never resolved this issue,and there are no findings in the statement of decision or judgment addressing it.however,weiss did not address this claimed deficiency in the trial court.in in re marriage of arceneaux cal d,our supreme court concluded that a litigant who fails to bring alleged deficiencies in the trial court statement of decision to its attention waives the right to complain of such errors on appeal,with the consequence that the reviewing court will imply findings that are supported in the record in the prevailing party favor.id.at.
therefore,the issue of the deficiency of the decision is waived,and we will imply findings supported by the record in the prevailing party favor.in re marriage of arceneaux,supra,cal d at.we find no error in the trial court decision to deny restitution to weiss of pellegrini commission.
the trial court finding absolving pellegrini of liability for potential future title problems 
weiss asserts on appeal that the trial court erred in declaring that pellegrini is not responsible or liable for any defect in title of any portion of the telford ranch.the primary basis for weiss argument is the lack of guidance from the jury verdict,coupled with the trial court failure to make factual findings and communicate them in the statement of decision justifying the equitable relief granted to pellegrini.
the question whether declaratory relief is appropriate in a given case is addressed to the trial court discretion.application group,hunter group,th,d.whether a determination is proper in an action for declaratory relief is a matter within the trial court discretion and the court decision to grant or deny relief will not be disturbed on appeal unless it be clearly shown that the discretion was abused.hannula hacienda homes cal d.
as with the issue of pellegrini alleged breach of fiduciary duty discussed above,and weiss complaint that the trial court failed to make certain factual findings in its statement of decision,here,weiss also argues the trial court failed to make appropriate factual findings justifying its grant of equitable relief in favor of pellegrini.weiss again makes reference to the statement of decision omitting critical facts.however,as above,weiss did not bring the perceived deficiency in the decision to the trial court attention below.as a result,the deficiency is waived,and we will imply findings that are supported in the record in pellegrini favor.in re marriage of arceneaux,supra,cal d at.
the implied findings in pellegrini favor,coupled with the broad discretion enjoyed by the trial court in granting declaratory relief leads us to the conclusion the trial court did no error in is order absolving pellegrini of any future defects in title in the telford ranch.
the trial court in limine ruling excluding evidence 
weiss asserts the trial court erred in excluding evidence that pellegrini associates was disqualified from doing business as a california corporation at the time of the transaction in this case.
generally speaking,in limine motions are disfavored in cases in which they are used not to determine in advance the court projected ruling if presented with an evidentiary objection during trial,but instead to serve as a substitute for a dispositive statutory motion.the increasing prevalence of the practice of using in limine motions in this way produces substantial risk of reversal,particularly in situations in which the constitutional rights to jury trial and confrontation are implicated.as we stated in the recent case of amtower photon dynamics,th,d t he disadvantages of such shortcuts are obvious.they circumvent procedural protections provided by the statutory motions or by trial on the merits they risk blindsiding the nonmoving party and,in some cases,they could infringe a litigant right to a jury trial.cal,art.i.ibid.the better practice in nearly every case is to afford the litigant the protections provided by trial or by the statutory processes.id.at,d see also miller campbell,warburton,fitzsimmons,smith,mendel pastore th,d.
in the present case,however,it appears pellegrini motion in limine was used for its proper a ruling in advance of an evidentiary objection that was bound to come up during the course of the trial.
here,pellegrini moved in limine to exclude all evidence of or reference to weiss affirmative defense that pellegrini associates was not qualified to do business in the state of california.the court granted pellegrini motion,and ordered the evidence excluded.in doing so,the court took judicial notice of documents showing pellegrini associates had been issued a certificate of revivor from the state of california,showing the corporation to be in good standing,as well as a certificate of relief form contract voidability from the franchise tax board that granted relief from july,to may,covering the period of time for the transactions in this case.consequently,the court determined evidence of the corporation qualification to do business was irrelevant for trial.
broadly speaking,an appellate court reviews any ruling by a trial court as to the admissibility of evidence for abuse of discretion.citation.t his standard of review applies to a trial court determination of the relevance of evidence,as well as to whether the evidence probative value is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect.citations.the trial court discretion is only abused where there is a clear showing it exceeded the bounds of reason,all of the circumstances being considered.citation.people ex rel.bill lockyer sun pacific farming th,d.
considering the fact that pellegrini associates was qualified to do business in california during the period of this transaction,albeit retroactively,evidence of the fact that pellegrini associates was at one time suspended as a corporation was irrelevant to the issues of the this trial.indeed,the only reason we can see that weiss would want to introduce this evidence to the jury would be to besmirch the reputation of pellegrini,and sully him and his business in their eyes.such evidence,with little probative value,and the potential of high prejudicial effect was the proper subject of an in limine motion,and was properly excluded by the court,
the consistency of the verdict 
weiss argues the verdict in this case is inconsistent.citing shaw hughes aircraft th,d shaw,weiss asserts that because the jury found there was no breach of contract on weiss part,yet found weiss breached his fiduciary duty to pellegrini,the result is inconsistent.the premise flowing from that argument is that the fiduciary duty is implied in the joint venture,and therefore is a term of the contract.as a result,a breach of fiduciary duty would by definition be a breach of contract.
in shaw,a wrongful termination action,the court
