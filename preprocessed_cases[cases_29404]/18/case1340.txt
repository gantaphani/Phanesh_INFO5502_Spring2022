defendants and appellants marvin gelfand gelfand,steven glaser glaser,gelfand rappaport glaser llp grg and gelfand glaser llp gg,the successor to grg,appeal a judgment in favor of plaintiff and respondent jerry rappaport rappaport following a bench trial to determine the buyout price of a dissociating partner interest in a law firm pursuant to corporations code section,subd.b that section is part of the uniform partnership act of upa et,which applies to law partnerships.
in this apparent case of first impression in california,we are called upon to construe section,subdivision b,which provides,the buyout price of a dissociated partner interest is the amount that would have been distributable to the dissociating partner under subdivision b of section if,on the date of dissociation,the assets of the partnership were sold at a price equal to the greater of the liquidation value or the value based on a sale of the entire business as a going concern without the dissociated partner and the partnership was wound up as of that date.interest shall be paid from the date of dissociation to the date of payment.
here,the trial court ruled that b ecause of the peculiar relationship between dissociation and the process when applied in the law firm context,a construct is created to calculate a value as of october,based upon individual assets being liquidated over time,and then bringing the value back to the date of dissociation.the trial court interpretation of section is correct and its creating a construct based on individual assets being liquidated over time is a reasonable application of the statute.it awarded judgment in favor of rappaport and against all of the appellants,based on percent of the liquidation value of the partnership as determined by expert testimony.see fn,post.
the trial court further found that appellants gelfand and glaser were individually liable,in addition to the limited liability partnerships of grg and gg for the amount of the buyout payment to rappaport.although we affirm the trial court interpretation and application of section,subdivision b,we reverse the trial court finding of individual liability on the part of gelfand and glaser.
in addition,our review of the record indicates that the trial court made a relatively minor mathematical error which we will correct by modifying the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
the partnership and rappaport dissociation therefrom 
the instant action arises from the dissociation of rappaport from the law firm of grg.gelfand and glaser were the original partners of the firm and had been so since.in,rappaport joined gelfand and glaser to form grg.gelfand held a percent share in the practice rappaport share was percent and glaser had the remaining percent share.there was no oral or written partnership agreement governing the terms of any partner dissociation.
in,rappaport indicated he wished to dissociate from the grg limited liability partnership.gelfand and glaser wished to continue their partnership and did so for approximately months thereafter.the three partners agreed the effective date of dissociation would be october.from october of through february of,the parties attempted to negotiate the terms of rappaport dissociation.on february,after negotiations broke down,rappaport made a written demand for compensation for his partnership interest in accordance with section,which controls and provides that i am to receive the greater of the liquidation or going concern value.
proceedings 
on december,rappaport filed suit against gelfand,glaser,grg and gg collectively,appellants,seeking,inter alia,damages for breach of section,subdivision b.gg,the successor to grg,filed a against rappaport for money had and received and for conversion.on february,the matter came on for trial.
the three major assets of grg in issue during the trial were general accounts receivable possible recovery of a contingency fee in a case identified as hughes foodservice hughes litigation and receivables due from work in four separate litigation matters on behalf of a client,morry waksberg waksberg litigation.also in dispute was the amount of liability that should be attributed to rappaport under the office space lease.
at trial,rappaport presented expert testimony by jan goren goren,a certified public accountant,and paul kelley kelley,a civil litigator who was specifically retained to value the hughes litigation and waksberg litigation receivables.grg presented expert testimony by david nolte nolte of fulcrum financial inquiry.
trial court ruling 
the trial court issued an extensive statement of decision which set forth the valuation methodology that it adopted and applied to the various assets and liabilities in issue.it began its analysis as follows section permits an individual to dissociate from the partnership while permitting the remaining partners the option of buying out the departing partner as of a given date,while continuing the partnership essentially,neither the departing partner nor the remaining partners should obtain an advantage by the dissociation.the basic policy judgment is that the departing partner should get the same amount through the buyout that he or she would get if the business were wound up.italics added.
while the statute sets forth two alternatives for valuing the dissociating partner interest,there remains some question whether the concept of sale as of the entire business is theoretically possible when applied to a law practice as applied to the instant case,the parties agree upon which assets must be valued to determine rappaport share as of october.the disagreement lies in the method of valuation.
the trial court reasoned,because of the peculiar relationship between dissociation and the process when applied in the law firm context,a construct is created to calculate a value as of october,based upon individual assets being liquidated over time,and then bringing the value back to the date of dissociation.the trial court was persuaded by the testimony of rappaport expert,goren,who opined that in assessing value,one would calculate an amount on october,based upon individual assets being liquidated over time,calculating risk,and then bringing the value back to the date of dissociation.whether looking at sale of the business as a whole,or by liquidation of assets,goren assumed all partners were attempting to maximize the value of the assets.he did not view liquidation as assuming the sale of all assets on one date.
with respect to the three major assets of grg and the lease liability,the trial court ruled as follows 
general accounts receivable 
on the date of rappaport dissociation,grg,like most law firms,had a number of accounts receivable.nolte,for the defense,valued the general accounts receivable at percent of face value for accounts under days,and of no value thereafter,for a total valuation of.nolte reasoned as follows due to the nature of most service businesses,a strict liquidation assumption provides a serious discount when compared to the face amount of a receivable.service receivables are not the result of a transfer of acceptable physical goods,but are instead subject to claims that the billed services were not desired,of poor quality.in this situation there is almost no market for the sale of service receivables,especially where the service provide r is not providing ongoing work that the debtor needs.as a result,the receivables of a service business have almost no value under the treatment prescribed by law in the case of a withdrawing partner.
goren,in turn,valued day receivables at percent of face value,day receivables at percent of face value,and agreed that receivables had no value if they exceeded days,for a total valuation of.goren noted the assessment of accounts receivable was particularly difficult in the context of a statutory dissociation because in a partnership windup,there is an orderly process over time,where under section,one must make an assumption as to an orderly process,yet value the asset at a particular point in time.goren based his valuation of the receivables upon grg percent collection rate for the year to date.
the trial court fully credited goren testimony in this regard and found rappaport had met his burden as to the accounts receivable analysis.
b.the contingency fee in the hughes litigation 
in july of,rappaport was retained on a contingency fee basis to represent craig hughes,a former employee of foodservice,in an employment discrimination action,et filed in federal court.the district court entered judgment in hughes favor following a bench trial and awarded him damages,statutory attorney fees consisting of a lodestar and multiplier,costs and interest.the defendant appealed to the ninth circuit court of appeals.as of the statutory buyout date of october,appellate briefing had been completed and the case was awaiting a date for oral argument.
kelley,on behalf of rappaport,opined that given his experience as a litigator,the case had a buyout value ranging from,from which he chose a buyout value of of the recovery on october in essence,a risk of loss in the ninth circuit.kelley based the high market value on three factors the standard governing the issues was the deferential substantial evidence standard the major issue on appeal,which involved exclusion of certain evidence,was not well briefed and was,thus,unlikely to result in reversal and,with respect to mitigation of damages,the had failed to meet its burden to show the availability of comparable or substantially similar employment.further,there was no risk regarding the satisfaction of a judgment because the employer was a solvent corporation and had posted an appeal bond.
with respect to the hughes litigation,rappaport other expert,goren,opined that settlement value was frankly the only reasonable value one can place upon ongoing litigation in the context of a buyout value under section.nolte,for the defense,objected to use of a settlement figure as the buyout value.nolte opined the buyout value of the hughes litigation was percent of the value of the judgment.
the trial court credited rappaport expert testimony and found it was appropriate to base the valuation of the hughes litigation contingency fee on its settlement value,in that anyone experienced in settlement negotiations recognizes such a value as that in which each side has,at least in theory,recognized the value of the case based upon its risks and strengths,much as market decisions are made.in accordance with rappaport valuation,the trial court found the hughes receivable has a buyout value of of minus the fee reduction,or.
c.the waksberg litigation 
in september of,grg entered into what the trial court characterized as a stormy litigation relationship with morry waksberg,a career litigator.waksberg was involved in substantial litigation with the united states government and transamerica life insurance company,and was also prosecuting lawsuits against three prominent law firms which had represented him in the past.grg knew waksberg was difficult but believed the firm could manage him.grg undertook to represent waksberg based on the belief that the transamerica litigation was about to settle for approximately million.waksberg apparently indicated an inability to pay attorney fees to grg pending settlement with transamerica.grg agreed to await payment and included in the retainer agreement a clause that provided grg with times its normal hourly rate pending settlement and payment,after which grg would bill at its normal hourly rate.
the trial court found that grg had no greater ability to manage waksberg than did prior counsel.grg was relieved as waksberg counsel in late,and grg subsequently filed lien notices in waksberg pending cases for fees and costs he owed.as of the buyout date,grg billings to waksberg,including the fee multiplier,amounted to.
as of the date rappaport left grg,the firm had four matters pending involving waksberg an arbitration initiated by grg to establish and reduce to judgment the amount of fees and costs owed a lawsuit filed by waksberg seeking to invalidate grg lien rights,void the retainer agreement,and enjoin the arbitration proceedings an interpleader filed by transamerica and a dollar action for malpractice against grg.
kelley,for rappaport,opined the buyout value of the uncollected waksberg litigation fees of as of october,at percent of their value,or,of which rappaport was entitled to percent,or.kelley considered the buyout value appropriate because of the strength of the lien.
in contrast,nolte valued the buyout value of the uncollected the waksberg litigation fees at zero.unlike kelley,who analyzed the waksberg litigation fees apart from the contingent liability presented by waksberg malpractice claim,nolte viewed them as one consolidated package.nolte opined the liability portion of waksberg offset the value of the lien such that absent purchase of buyout insurance,the receivable,when coupled with the malpractice claim was unsalable.
the trial court found nolte approach essentially concludes that the seller would be willing to give the asset away,and rejected the notion that in a market with a willing buyer,and willing seller,waksberg would be wholly without value as an asset.the trial court found,based upon the kelley testimony and the court review of the facts presented,that the legal malpractice claim does not present a substantial impediment to obtaining some net financial recovery from the lien filed on behalf of grg and thus,the waksberg litigation receivable did have value contrary to nolte conclusion.
although the trial court found value in the waksberg litigation receivable,it found no evidentiary basis for kelley conclusion that the buyout price for the receivable was percent of total fees as of october.because the evidence did support the conclusion that the waksberg litigation receivable had value but did not support the specific valuations assigned by the competing experts,the trial court adopted the mean value of the receivable,that is,percent of,or.
d.the office space lease liability 
rappaport expert,goren,determined that rappaport portion of the liability for the firm office space totaled.nolte,appellants expert,found that rappaport liability totaled.without elaboration,the trial court determined that the total lease liability that should be apportioned to rappaport was.
judgment and appeal 
on november,the trial court entered judgment in favor of rappaport for his percent share of the partnership in the sum of plus interest from november,to the date of judgment,subd.b.although the trial court did not include an explanation of how the final judgment amount was calculated in its statement of decision,we were able to recreate the calculation based on information from the record,including the parties experts testimony.our calculations show that the trial court made a small mathematical error in the sum of 
the trial court further held that both gelfand and glaser,individually,as well as both limited liability partnership entities,gg and grg,were liable for the buyout price due to rappaport.the trial court also found in favor rappaport on the,finding that gg had failed to meet its burden to establish the elements of its causes of action for money had and received and for conversion 
appellants filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment.
contentions 
appellants contend that the trial court erred in its interpretation of section,subdivision b,which requires the buyout price to be calculated by valuing the limited liability partnership assets as if sold for liquidation value on the date of dissociation instead,the trial court erroneously created a construct based upon individual assets being liquidated over time and then bringing the value back to october,the date of dissociation.
appellants also contend that the trial court erred in entering judgment against the individual defendants because both gg and grg are limited liability partnerships and individual limited partners in a limited liability partnership are not liable for such partnership obligations.
discussion 
statutory formula for determining buyout price of 
dissociating partner interest 
there is no dispute that this matter is governed by the upa.et the upa definition of business as including every trade,occupation,and profession,subd,precludes an exception for law partnerships.jewel boxer d,jewel.the upa defines partnership to include a registered limited liability partnership,subd.thus,the provision at issue,section,applies to registered limited liability partnerships such as gg and grg.
under the upa,if there is a dissociation of a partner,as contrasted with a dissolution of the partnership,the remaining partners have a right to continue the business and the dissociated partner has a right to be paid the buyout price of his or her partnership interest,subd.a.section addresses the buyout of a partner interest pursuant to the upa when the partnership business is not wound up.section provides in pertinent part a if a partner is dissociated from a partnership,the partnership shall cause the dissociated partner interest in the partnership to be purchased for a buyout price determined pursuant to subdivision b.b the buyout price of a dissociated partner interest is the amount that would have been distributable to the dissociating partner under subdivision b of section if,on the date of dissociation,the assets of the partnership were sold at a price equal to the greater of the liquidation value or the value based on a sale of the entire business as a going concern without the dissociated partner and the partnership was wound up as of that date.interest shall be paid from the date of dissociation to the date of payment.italics added.
the upa allows partners to deviate from its default provisions by negotiating such deviations in a contractual partnership agreement.section states at subdivision a except as otherwise provided in subdivision b,relations among the partners and between the partners and the partnership are governed by the partnership agreement.to the extent the partnership agreement does not otherwise provide,this chapter governs relations among the partners and between the partners and the partnership.
thus,parties are free to enter into their own agreements concerning the buyout of a dissociating partner interest.however,in the absence of such an agreement,the buyout of a departing partner interest in the partnership business is governed by section.as there is no oral or written partnership agreement between the parties that governs dissociation,rappaport dissociation is governed by the default provisions found in section.
the trial court interpretation of section is correct and 
its application of the statute was both reasonable and consistent 
with the statutory language 
the focus of this appeal is section,subdivision b,which states in pertinent part the buyout price of a dissociated partner interest is the amount that would have been distributable to the dissociating partner if,on the date of dissociation,the assets of the partnership were sold at a price equal to the greater of the liquidation value or the value based on a sale of the entire business as a going concern without the dissociated partner and the partnership was wound up as of that date.italics added.
appellants contend that the trial court erred as a matter of law in its interpretation of section,subdivision b.specifically,appellants make five separate arguments in support of their contention the trial court erred in permitting rappaport to offer testimony from an accountant and a lawyer regarding the proper method of valuing grg assets and liabilities the trial court erred by looking to external sources of information to construe section,subdivision b,because the statute is not ambiguous the trial court erred in attempting to conform its interpretation and application of section,subdivision b,to the process a law firm would follow in an orderly dissolution the trial court erred when it failed to value the assets as if they were sold for liquidation value on the date of dissociation and the trial court abused its discretion when it admitted testimony of goren and kelley regarding the interpretation of section,subdivision b,and such admission is prejudicial.
the majority of appellants arguments need not be addressed separately,as each can be dispensed with based on our analysis of the interpretation of the relevant statutory language.issues involving statutory construction are questions of law and are,thus,reviewed de novo.sbam partners,llc wang th.as the matter is a question of law,we are not bound by evidence on the question presented below or by the lower court interpretation.citation.the rules governing statutory construction are well settled.we begin with the fundamental premise that the objective of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.citation.in determining intent,we look first to the language of the statute,giving effect to its plain meaning.citation.although we may properly rely on extrinsic aids,we should first turn to the words of the statute to determine the intent of the legislature.citation.where the words of the statute are clear,we may not add to or alter them to accomplish a purpose that does not appear on the face of the statute or from its legislative history.citation.burden snowden cal th.
the plain language of the statute clearly states that the buyout price to be paid a dissociating partner is the greater of the liquidation value or the value based on the sale of the entire entity as a going concern,with some restrictions,on the date of the dissociation,which,in this case,is october.however,in order to comply with the provisions of the statute,it is important to understand what is meant by the term liquidation value.as that term is not defined within the statute,it is ambiguous and we turn to extrinsic aids in interpreting such term.
although the legislative history around the statute adoption is not helpful,the comments to the revised uniform partnership act rupa,on which california upa is based,explain how the buyout price in section,subdivision b,the provision identical to our section,subdivision b is to be determined.they state,in relevant part,the terms fair market value or fair value were not used because they are often considered terms of art having a special meaning depending on the context,such as in tax or corporate law.buyout price is a new term.it is intended that the term be developed as an independent concept appropriate to the partnership buyout situation,while drawing on valuation principles developed elsewhere.liquidation value is not intended to mean distress sale value.under general principles of valuation,the hypothetical selling price in either case should be the price that a willing and informed buyer would pay a willing and informed seller,with neither being under any compulsion to deal revised uniform partnership act,com,italics added.
review of section,subdivision b,and the interpretation of the term liquidation value are issues of first impression in this state.as there are no california cases interpreting section,subdivision b,we may look to other jurisdictions for guidance.ameron internat.insurance of state of pennsylvania cal th.of the several states that have adopted the rupa,we have found only one that has interpreted the rupa section,subdivision b,term liquidation value.
based on our reading of section,subdivision b,and the comments to rupa section,subdivision b,we interpret liquidation value to mean,in this context,the sale price of the separate assets based upon their market value as determined by a willing and knowledgeable buyer and a willing and knowledgeable seller,neither of which is under any compulsion to buy or sell.thus,for purposes of section,subdivision b,liquidation value does not incorporate the common definition of liquidation,which generally implies some urgency for immediate cash.under the remaining language of section,subdivision b,the buyout price is the liquidation value,as defined above,discounted to present value as of the date the partner dissociated.
based on the foregoing,we conclude that the trial court application of section,subdivision b,is consistent with this interpretation.our interpretation contemplates variations that may result from experts utilizing differing appraisal techniques under varying business circumstances,which we find consistent with the rupa drafters intent to develop the term buyout price as an independent concept.goren testimony detailed exactly how he determined the buyout price for each separate asset based on his 
the trial court valuation of the limited liability partnership assets presents factual issues subject to substantial evidence review.in re marriage of duncan th,in re marriage of hewitson d.as we find that there is substantial evidence in the record supporting the trial court determination of the value of each asset in dispute,we will affirm the trial court judgment with respect to this issue 
the only remaining issue raised by appellants with respect to the issue of statutory interpretation is that the trial court abused its discretion when it admitted testimony of goren and kelley regarding the interpretation of section,subdivision b,and that such admission was prejudicial.the trial court determinations on the admissibility of expert evidence are subject to review under the deferential abuse of discretion standard.mardirossian associates,ersoff th.the erroneous admission of evidence requires reversal of a judgment only when it results in a miscarriage of justice,subd.b.the admission of improper evidence results in a miscarriage of justice only if it is reasonably probable that a result more favorable to the appealing party would have been reached in the absence of the error.cassim allstate ins.cal th.
appellants contend that rappaport experts were allowed to offer opinions on legal questions and testify to valuation methodologies that fail to conform to the mandates of section,subdivision b.we find no merit in this argument as we have determined that goren testified as to the specific appraisal technique he used from an accounting perspective,which the trial court found to be consistent with section,subdivision b,and was not providing a legal opinion as to the meaning of the statute.similarly,kelley testified that he had not even read the statute at issue and there is no evidence that he offered an opinion on its meaning.therefore,there is no basis for concluding that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the testimony of either goren or kelley.
the trial court erred in holding gelfand and glaser individually liable 
for the buyout payment due to rappaport 
gelfand and glaser also contend that the trial court erred in holding them individually liable for the limited liability partnerships obligations to pay the buyout price to rappaport.we agree and will reverse the judgment as to those individual appellants.
section,subdivision a,provides that i f a partner is dissociated from a partnership,the partnership shall cause the dissociated partner interest to be purchased for a buyout price pursuant to subdivision b.section,subdivision i,states that a dissociated partner may maintain an action against the partnership,pursuant to subparagraph b of paragraph of subdivision b of section,to determine the buyout price of that partner interest italics added.neither of these provisions provides for a suit against individual partners of the partnership.
despite the clear language of section,rappaport argues that the trial court holding gelfand and glaser liable was not in error.he relies on section,subdivision b,which states in relevant part a partner may maintain an action against the partnership or another partner for legal or equitable relief,with or without an accounting as to partnership business,to do any of the following enforce the partner rights under this chapter,including all of the following b the partner right on dissociation to have the partner interest in the partnership purchased pursuant to section or,or to enforce any other right under article commencing with section or commencing with section.italics added.
this provision,however,is not dispositive of the issue as it can not be construed in a vacuum.section instead must be interpreted in the context of the various kinds of partnerships that are allowed under california law.specifically,section must be construed in the context of the upa provisions that apply to limited liability partnerships,which are entirely different from general partnerships,given the restrictive rules regarding the liability of limited partners that are set out in other provisions of the upa.
the upa provision on point is section,subdivision c,which states,n otwithstanding any other section of this chapter,a partner in a registered limited liability partnership is not liable or accountable,directly or indirectly,for debts,obligations,or liabilities of or chargeable to the partnership or another partner in the partnership section,subdivision d,goes on to state that all or certain specified partners of a registered limited liability partnership,if the specified partners agree,may be liable in their capacity as partners for all or specified debts,obligations,or liabilities of the registered limited liability partnership if the partners possessing a majority of the interests of the partners in the current profits of the partnership,or a different vote as may be required in the partnership agreement,specifically agreed to the specified debts,obligations,or liabilities in writing,prior to the debt,obligation,or liability being incurred.moreover,subdivision g provides that a partner in a registered limited liability partnership is not a proper party to a proceeding by or against a registered limited liability partnership in which personal liability for partnership debts,obligations,or liabilities is asserted against the partner,unless that partner is personally liable under subdivision d or e.
the purchase of a dissociating partner interest pursuant to section is clearly an obligation of the limited liability partnership that falls under section and,as such,only those limited partners who previously agreed to the imposition of debt,obligation or liability being incurred can be held personally liable under section,subd.c.there is no evidence in the record that either gelfand or glaser agreed to be personally liable for any debts,obligations or liabilities of gg or grg and therefore,neither can be held so liable pursuant to section.
in reviewing the evidence on appeal,all conflicts must be resolved in favor of the judgment,and all legitimate and reasonable inferences indulged in to uphold the judgment if possible.western states petroleum superior court cal th,crawford southern pacific cal d.w e do not reweigh the evidence,but rather determine whether,after resolving all conflicts favorably to the prevailing party,and according the prevailing party the benefit of all reasonable inferences,there is substantial evidence to support the judgment.scott pacific gas electric cal th.however,where there is no substantial evidence presented,the judgment must be reversed.lane pyron,gibbs d,stating t here being no substantial evidence to support the implied findings upon which the judgment must rest,the judgment must be reversed see also andreotti andreotti d,and krause apodaca d.
in the instant case,gelfand and glaser objected to the trial court finding that they were each individually liable for the buyout price due to rappaport.rappaport,in turn,argued that they were so liable.however,there is no evidence in the record whatsoever that either gelfand or glaser ever agreed to be personally liable for any debts,obligations or liabilities of gg or grg,as required under section,subdivision d.because there was no evidence satisfying this statutory requirement presented to the trial court,its finding as to such individual liability can not stand.

the one case that we have found interpreting rupa section,subdivision b,is warnick warnick warnick.in warnick,the wyoming supreme court reviewed wyoming statute section,subdivision b,which is substantially similar to rupa section,subdivision b,and our section,subdivision b,in the context of the valuation of dissociating partner randall warnick interest in the partnership of warnick ranches.wyoming statute section,subdivision b,incorporates the comments to the rupa involving willing and knowledgeable buyers and sellers under no compulsion to buy or sell,which comments are not included in the actual language of rupa section,subdivision b.the precise issue before the court in warnick was whether to deduct in hypothetical sale expenses in calculating the hypothetical liquidation value of the partnership business.the warnick court concluded that the deduction should not be made because the business was not actually liquidated.instead,the assets were retained by warnick ranches,and randall warnick dissociation from the partnership did not require the winding up of the partnership.warnick warnick,supra,at.the warnick court explained that the common understanding of liquidation,is t he act or process of converting assets into cash,citation but that in this context,the term liquidation value does not mean the amount of cash that would remain following a sale because such interpretation is not supported by the pertinent statutory language warnick warnick,supra,at italics added.the warnick court continued,i f we were to interpret the term liquidation value in isolation,we might envision an amount representing the net proceeds resulting from a distress sale which is clearly precluded by the drafters comments.warnick warnick,supra,at.by providing two approaches for valuing partnership assets,the statute contemplates variations that could result from differing appraisal techniques and varying business circumstances we find the meaning of liquidation value is best understood by comparing it to the other method provided.when contrasted with going concern value it is clear that liquidation value simply means the sale of the separate assets rather than the value of the business as a whole.warnick warnick,supra,at.the one case that we have found interpreting rupa section,subdivision b,is warnick warnick warnick.in warnick,the wyoming supreme court reviewed wyoming statute section,subdivision b,which is substantially similar to rupa section,subdivision b,and our section,subdivision b,in the context of the valuation of dissociating
