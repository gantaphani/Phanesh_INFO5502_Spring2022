karl kapps,individually and as trustee,brian peterson,jorge vargas,doris klega,and helen foster appeal the district court dismissal of their complaint by its grant of the rule b motion filed by the,torch offshore,and certain of its officers and underwriters.we affirm.
facts and proceedings below 
torch offshore,torch is a service provider that installs and maintains underwater oil and natural gas pipelines and related infrastructure on the gulf of mexico continental shelf.torch customers include major energy companies and independent oil and natural gas producers.
commencing on june,torch conducted an initial public offering ipo during which it sold shares of its common stock at per share,raising million.the ipo was conducted pursuant to a registration statement and prospectus dated june,which torch filed with the securities and exchange commission sec.
in the prospectus,torch disclosed the volatile nature of oil and natural gas prices,the dependence of torch business upon oil and natural gas prices,and the time lags between the prices and the demand for torch services 
the prospectus asserted,truthfully,that natural gas prices had increased by approximately from february through june.however,during the some five and months immediately preceding the june,ipo,natural gas prices had in fact declined approximately.that information was not included anywhere in the prospectus.though it did discuss the volatile nature of oil and natural gas prices,the prospectus made no mention of any particular decline in the price of natural gas.
during the two month period after the issuance of the ipo,torch share prices declined to below per share.on august,torch issued a press release stating that during the period after the ipo,domestic natural gas and crude oil prices declined.the press release also noted that torch had begun to note delays in the completion of shallow water drilling projects.
on march,kapps filed a putative class action suit on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased torch common stock between june,and august,the plaintiffs alleged violations of sections and of the securities act of the securities act,and.an amended complaint was filed june.the plaintiffs named as defendants torch,certain of its corporate officers,and the underwriters for the ipo.torch and other defendants filed motions to dismiss under rule b for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted on august and october.plaintiffs never sought any leave to further amend.
the district court granted the motions to dismiss on december,holding that federal securities laws do not impose a duty on issuers to disclose trends or publicly available information.the plaintiffs timely appealed.

appellants arguments 
in this appeal,appellants set forth three main arguments,taking issue with disclosures that were and were not made in the prospectus.they base their claims on violations of section of the securities act 
first,they argue that the statement in the prospectus revealing that natural gas prices have increased by approximately between february and the day before the ipo was materially misleading because,though technically accurate,it failed to mention the fact that there had been an approximately drop in the price of natural gas in the some five and months immediately preceding the ipo.
second,appellants assert that the torch statement in the prospectus that there had been recent increases in natural gas prices was not only materially misleading but also false when made in light of the above noted fact that the price of natural gas had actually decreased prior to the ipo.
finally,the appellants claim that in any event,torch should have mentioned the noted decrease in the price of natural gas because it was a trend that could reasonably be expected to have a material impact on torch operations,and therefore its disclosure was required pursuant to item of the sec regulation.
we will address each contention in turn.
prospectus statements were not materially misleading 
a portion of the prospectus states that natural gas prices have increased by approximately between february and june,the day before the ipo although admittedly a factually correct and true statement,appellants assert that it was materially misleading because it failed to mention the fact that there had been an approximately drop in the price of natural gas in the five and months immediately preceding the ipo.the amended complaint reflects that between february and december,the price of natural gas rose from to per btu,including a sharp upward spike from approximately to approximately during november and december.then,in what torch characterizes as a correction,there was a sharp downward spike from december,through most of february from approximately to approximately,followed by a gradual decline to june,during which natural gas prices fell to approximately per btu.
we do not find the statement that the price of natural gas increased by approximately to be materially misleading when read in the context of the prospectus as a whole the statement correctly set forth the increase in the price of natural gas during a specified period of time.
the statement was not 
appellants rely on lucia prospect street high income portfolio,cir,to establish that it was materially misleading for the prospectus to omit the fact that natural gas prices had decreased in the some five and a third months preceding the ipo.lucia concerned a public offering of shares in a mutual fund that invested in corporate junk bonds.the prospectus in lucia truthfully stated that the average yields of certain junk bonds over the ten year period preceding the mutual fund offering were higher than the yields of treasury bonds during that same ten year period.at.
the plaintiffs in lucia asserted that although those statements in the prospectus were true,they were misleading to a reasonable investor,because the prospectus failed to disclose that during the six years immediately preceding the offering,the yield of the junk bonds had in fact been lower than the yield of treasury bonds.id.at.the first circuit reversed the district court conclusion that the representations were not misleading because they were literally true,and held that a determination of whether the prospectus statements were misleading due to failure to disclose the rates in the six year time period was a factual question,and therefore inappropriate for resolution on a motion to dismiss.the court stated 
the six years at issue are the six years leading up to the fund public offering.moreover,while any one or two years might favor treasury securities without amounting to an unfavorable trend,we think that a comparison favoring treasury securities is substantial enough to cast some doubt on the reliability of the reported figure w e can not say as a matter of law that the undisclosed information about the period would not alter the total mix of facts available to the investor.id.at.
here,the appellants claim that stating there was a increase when in reality the price had declined in the months preceding the prospectus was misleading for the same reasons set forth by the lucia court.however,the first circuit specifically stated that their decision might have been different had they only been dealing with a one or two year time period.in that case,the treasury bonds were better during a six year period,and specifically,they were better during six of the ten years that were referenced in the prospectus.this means that during of the time at issue,the treasury bonds in fact performed better than the junk bonds.therefore,the court found the omission of that fact to be a question for the jury to consider.
in the case sub judice,not only are we dealing with a significantly shorter time period five and of and one half months as compared to six of ten years,but we are also dealing with a much smaller percentage of the total time nearly twenty percent,as opposed to sixty percent moreover,approximately of the drop in price occurred during january and february,just after the initial rapid increase in november and december.thus,from november through february there was a brief sharp spike up immediately followed by a brief sharp spike down.nothing in the prospectus indicated that the rise in price was steady or unsteady,and during the entire period referenced in the challenged prospectus statement the price never fell to its february level.in fact,as the prospectus states,the then current price was more than twice what it had been in february.
the time period at issue in lucia was nearly twelve times as long as the one here,and the undisclosed treasury bond advantage occurred during more than half of the time discussed.therefore,lucia,with which we have no disagreement,does not support appellants.moreover,the lucia court specifically held only that there was a jury question,and that the unfavorable figure did not necessarily render the comparison misleading.id.at.
the public domain and the section element of materiality 
it appears that the district court granted the motions to dismiss on the ground that the price of natural gas is publicly available information,and therefore,the defendants could not have been in violation of section if this is the interpretation intended by the district court,it is incorrect.specifically,we hold that the definition of material under section is not strictly limited to information that is and.while all material information need not be included in the registration statement,an issuer is not free to make material misrepresentations,or to omit material information that is either required to be disclosed by law or that is necessary to disclose in order to prevent statements made in the registration statement from being misleading.
a fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important in making an investment decision.basic levinson,d,quoting tsc industries,northway,d.for an omission to be material,there must be a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.id.at emphasis added.this court must determine whether the information allegedly omitted or misrepresented in the prospectus was material,in the sense that it would have altered the way a reasonable investor would have perceived the total mix of information available in the prospectus as a whole.krim banctexas group,cir holding that certain omitted information was not material,but based on the ground that the substance of the information was adequately set forth in the prospectus,not simply because the information was not or was publicly available.but see ward succession of freeman,cir 
in addition to the fact that natural gas prices were in the readily available public domain,torch made cautionary statements regarding the volatility of gas prices.the prospectus specifically emphasized the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and the risks posed thereby see olkey hyperion term trust,cir because assurances in prospectus were balanced by cautionary language which warned investors of the risk that the plaintiffs claim was not disclosed,a reasonable investor would not have been materially misled,and statements were not misleading klein general nutrition,cir holding that certain omitted information was not material,observing that a determination of materiality takes into account considerations as to the certainty of the information,its availability in the public domain,and the need for the information in light of cautionary statements being made.see trump,at,emphasis added 
in wielgos commonwealth edison,cir,the court stated,issuers of securities must reveal information.investors combine this with public information to derive estimates about the securities value.it is pointless and costly to compel firms to reprint information already in the public domain.id.at.contrary to the way the district court may have understood that passage,we conclude that the wielgos court likely did not mean for it to be taken as a strict rule that securities laws never require disclosure of any information that is not or that is publicly available.for example,as we will discuss in more detail below,the sec requires an issuer to disclose certain trends that could affect its business,and in appropriate circumstances this requirement may extend to certain trends that are not or are publicly available.moreover,the court in wielgos stated that it was not addressing the question of whether omitted facts were material,but was rather ruling on whether the disclosures complied with sec rules.
the appellants emphasize that the case sub judice deals with section,not section b which places a burden on the plaintiffs to show scienter.while it is true that scienter is not required here,many cases say that materiality,as it is used in section,in effect means the same thing as it does in section b.see rosenzweig azurix,cir holding that plaintiffs claims under section fail because none of the challenged representations were material,and e ven though the district court did not explicitly consider the materiality issue with respect to,its analysis would be identical to that under section see also in re donald trump casino sec,cir because our analysis here is predicated on the materiality requirement,which is common to plaintiffs section b,and claims,we do not here distinguish between those provisions.klein,at 
appellants claim that materiality should be a question of fact for the jury,but many section cases have been properly dismissed on the pleadings for lack of materiality.see,rosenzweig,at klein,at trump,at although materiality is a mixed question of law and fact which the trier of fact ordinarily decides,see tsc,at.if the alleged misrepresentations or omissions are so obviously unimportant to an investor that reasonable minds can not differ on the question of materiality it is appropriate for the district court to rule that the allegations are inactionable as a matter of law.internal citations omitted krim,at.
though in a section case,the fifth circuit has defined materiality as a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider the challenged statements to have significantly altered the total mix of information.citing basic.at.nathenson zonagen,cir emphasis added.the total mix of information normally includes information that is and has been in the readily available general public domain and facts known or reasonably available to the shareholders.united paperworkers intern.union international paper,cir.
natural gas prices are listed in daily papers the wall street journal,for example,compares the day price with the price one year ago and historic daily prices are also available through other sources,such as the new york mercantile exchange,or nymex.while not of itself necessarily dispositive,such common public ready availability must be considered in determining whether the total mix of information was altered because the price decline was not included in the prospectus.when viewed in context,and taking into consideration the cautionary language used in relation to the volatility of natural gas prices and the ready public availability of natural gas prices,neither of the statements at issue were materially misleading.it was not materially misleading for the prospectus to state that over the specified period the price had increased by,or,in the particular context where the language appears,that there had been recent increases in the price of natural gas,not simply because the omitted information was not or was publicly available,but because there is no substantial likelihood that including the fact that the price of natural gas had declined since december,would have significantly altered a reasonable investor perception of the total mix of information available in the prospectus as a whole.krim,at.
b recent increases in the price of natural gas and falsity 
appellants assert that the torch statement in the prospectus that there had been recent increases in natural gas prices was not only materially misleading but also false when made in light of the fact that the price of natural gas had actually decreased since december.
the section of the prospectus at issue stated,d omestic natural gas supply and production capacity have declined due to the depletion of reservoirs and the reduction in drilling activity during the recent period of low oil and natural gas prices in and,leading to a limited supply of natural gas.this imbalance between supply and demand has led to recent increases in natural gas prices.emphasis added when read in context,the prospectus clearly sets forth a temporal reference,using the word recent to describe prices prevailing and resultant events taking place in and.therefore,one may not reasonably conclude that it was false for the june prospectus,in the very next sentence of the same paragraph,to use the word recent to characterize the price increase in the previous some two and years.
accordingly,in light of the immediately preceding sentence of the same paragraph that also uses recent in reference to natural gas prices,and taking into consideration the public nature of the price of natural gas,and the fact that the decrease prior to the ipo only occurred during of the total time period at issue,we hold that the challenged statement was neither false nor materially misleading.
c trends and item 
appellants assert that,regardless of whether the statements in the prospectus were misleading,torch should have mentioned the post december decrease in the price of natural gas in its prospectus because it was a trend that could reasonably be expected to have a material impact on torch operations,and was therefore a disclosure required pursuant to item of the sec regulation.
section of the securities act is violated if the prospectus omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein.a.item a ii of sec regulation requires a public offering prospectus to disclose 
any known trends or uncertainties that have had or that the registrant reasonably expects will have a material favorable or unfavorable impact on net sales or revenue or income from continuing operations.if the registrant knows of events that will cause a material change in the relationship between costs and revenues such as known future increases in costs of labor or materials or price increases or inventory adjustments,the change in the relationship shall be disclosed.a ii.
the court in oxford asset management,jaharis,cir,interpreted this regulation,stating a s regards trends,we interpret this element to require an assessment of whether an observed pattern accurately reflects persistent conditions of the particular registrant business environment we interpret this language as establishing a negligence standard.the oxford court continued,
t he discussion and analysis shall focus specifically on material events and uncertainties known to management that would cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating results or of future financial condition.this would include descriptions and amounts of a matters that would have an impact on future operations and have not had an impact in the past,and b matters that have had an impact on reported operations and are not expected to have an impact upon future operations.item a ii essentially says to a registrant if there has been an important change in your company business or environment that significantly or materially decreases the predictive value of your reported results,explain this change in the prospectus.id.at 
we must address whether the decrease in the price of natural gas during the months before the prospectus was issued was indeed a trend disclosure of which was required by item.although the drop continued for five and months before the issuance of the june prospectus,we again note that there was a precipitous drop in the two months immediately following a two month sharp increase the price dropped the most rapidly in january and february,after which it only gradually declined.
the prospectus was issued on june,and included the first quarter unaudited returns we assume that torch correctly reported first quarter returns,as the appellants alleged no misstatements or misleading information as to those numbers.although it is unclear why,in their response to the motion to dismiss below,the appellants included torch form,filed with the sec,for the quarter that ended june.this form gives the comparable quarter of the previous year.we know from the prospectus that revenues were million for the first quarter of,and from the that they were million for the second quarter of.accordingly,at the time of the ipo,it was not unreasonable to consider the decline in natural gas prices as not yet constituting a trend,having not significantly impacted torch gross revenue 
however,we must then consider the appellants lag time argument.before torch services are required,torch customers generally first set up capital budgets which tend to increase after the price of natural gas and oil increases.they then conduct exploration drilling,and,if successful,they start preparation for production activities.only then do they hire torch to lay the pipe and carry the product to shore.therefore,torch acknowledges that demand for their services does not occur at the precise time drilling begins,or is delayed.this lag time was revealed in the prospectus because the downward spike in the price of natural gas did not immediately affect torch revenues,torch management viewed it as an anomaly,believing instead that the long term fluctuations,increases,and decreases would dictate demand for torch services.
on august,torch issued a press release stating that during the period after the ipo,domestic natural gas and crude oil prices declined.the press release also recited that torch had begun to note delays in the completion of shallow water drilling projects l ate in the second quarter.in their complaint,appellants alleged that because torch knew,during a period of time before the ipo,that completion of some shallow drilling projects had been delayed,and in turn that these delays could have an impact on demand for their services,therefore the price decrease,which appellants allege led to the delays,was an event that will cause a material change in the relationship between costs and revenues,and accordingly should have been revealed as a trend.a ii.
in oxford,the court said,t he obvious focus of item a ii is on preventing the latest reported results from misleading potential investors,thereby promoting a more accurate picture of the registrant future prospects.at.the court went on to state,
t he prospectus stated that the company had lost almost million since its inception and that there could be no assurance that the company would ever be profitable.if booming sales of a particular drug had carried the company for the previous several reported quarters but suddenly and significantly declined,a potential investor could be mislead by those reported results unless the company disclosed the importance of that drug and discussed the downward trend in its sales.that is the type of situation item a ii was designed to address.id.
essentially,the company would be at fault for being negligent in failing to discuss that sort of information.however,we conclude that the appellants here have not alleged enough to meet such a requirement.
in the august,press release,torch announced that revenues for the second quarter of were million,up from million for the quarter,a matter appellants do not dispute.however,the appellants allege that the press release also lends them support.the press release reveals that 
f ollowing the company ipo,domestic natural gas and crude oil prices experienced a decline.this created caution throughout the industry with a resultant dampening of market growth.late in the second quarter the company started to note delays in the completion of shallow water drilling projects.however,there are more drilling rigs operating than was the case during the last market peak the company believes that these working rigs are simply taking longer to complete individual wells,partially a result of drilling deeper at each new well location.
it appears that torch attributes the dampening of market growth and delays not only to decreased prices,as the appellants would have us believe,but also to the deeper well depths.appellants allege nothing to suggest the incorrectness,much less the impropriety,of such attribution 
appellants also discuss the contents of torch january,draft prospectus filed with the sec but later withdrawn and never issued.they note that that draft prospectus included the following statement significant or prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices would likely depress offshore drilling and development activity.appellants suggest that this statement in the draft prospectus reflects that torch anticipated that decreases in natural gas prices preceding the ipo would have a material adverse impact on their revenue within the meaning of item.however,the statement is also included in the here challenged prospectus,giving warning that torch revenue would be impacted by a decline in natural gas prices.it was not a predictive statement,but rather a cautionary one.
finally,appellants note that the january,draft prospectus indicated that it would include a graph reflecting nymex closing natural gas prices from approximately through approximately.they argue that had a similar graph,extending to june,been included in the june,prospectus it would have reflected the decline in prices between december and early june.we conclude that this adds nothing to appellants other arguments.the prospectus at issue here,that of june,included no graph or table or statement of daily or weekly or monthly natural gas prices over any period of time it merely correctly stated that f rom two year lows in february to june,nymex closing current natural gas contract prices have increased by approximately,and it specifically noted the volatile nature of gas prices and that they had varied substantially moreover,such prices were a part of the readily available public domain information.
in a similar case,zucker quasha,aff,table cir,a prospectus issued three days before the close of the first quarter of.the issuer was a retailer whose policy allowed customers to return unsold merchandise,and the prospectus gave the previous year rate of returns,which was.however,plaintiffs claimed that during the first quarter of,the rate of returns had increased to.the court determined that the retailer did not have to include this information in its prospectus,and dismissed plaintiffs claim that the accurate representation of the return rate for the last full year before the public offering was misleading.
though it did not expressly address trends in item,we find zucker to be informative.like torch disclosures,the zucker court noted that the return rate,which was accurate,was not a prediction but a statement of historical performance the retailer did not predict future return rates or suggest that the rate was expected to continue.therefore,the subsequent increase in the return rate during the first quarter of,in progress at the time of the public offering,did not render this statement of historical fact illegally false or misleading.at.
the court also stated,data concerning a quarter that is in progress is necessarily incomplete.id.at.although here the decrease in the price of natural gas had been occurring since december,there was no complete picture,nor did torch make representations or infer that the price would continue,either up or down,but rather highlighted its volatility.we hold that the referenced decrease in the price of natural gas was not a trend required to be disclosed by item.see also in re worlds of wonder securities litigation,cir court did not impose liability based upon corporate official failure to disclose financial data for the fiscal quarter in progress where claim alleged that the prospectus failed to disclose how far sales were lagging behind internal sales projections for the quarter in progress during ipo.
section claim 
it is questionable whether appellants adequately briefed their section claim,to this court regardless,because they have failed to allege a section violation,their section claim must fail as well.see klein general nutrition companies,cir.
conclusion 
the district court properly granted defendants motions to dismiss because the statements in the prospectus concerning natural gas prices were neither false nor materially misleading.furthermore,the decrease in the price of natural gas was not a trend required to be disclosed by item of sec regulation.
for the foregoing reasons,the district court grant of defendants rule b motions to dismiss is 
although in their original complaint,the plaintiffs alleged omissions related to oil as well as natural gas,the only allegations now before this court relate to the price levels of and disclosures pertaining to natural gas.the specific disclosures made in the prospectus are addressed more fully in the discussion section below.
plaintiffs chose august,as the end of the class period because torch stated in its august,press release that it had noticed delays in the completion of some shallow water drilling projects.though torch in its press release did not attribute those delays to the decrease in natural gas prices,the plaintiffs believed that this correlation could be made.
section of the securities act provides in relevant part a in case any part of the registration statement contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,any person acquiring such security unless it is proved that at the time of such acquisition he knew of such untruth or omission may,either at law or in equity,in any court of competent jurisdiction,sue every person who signed the registration statement every underwriter with respect to such security.
the prospectus addressed the fact that the price of natural gas was an important component in assessing the success or failure of torch business,stating the price levels of oil and natural gas are the primary determinants of offshore exploration and development activity.from two year lows in february to june,nymex closing current oil contract prices have increased by approximately and nymex closing current natural gas contract prices have increased by approximately.as oil and natural gas prices increase or remain at favorable levels,our customers generally increase their capital budgets for additional offshore exploration and development t he number of active drilling rigs on the shelf has increased from a low of in april to in april.demand for our services on the shelf generally follows successful drilling activities by three to months.prospectus.
though it will be addressed specifically later in this opinion,the following analysis also applies to appellants contention that it was materially misleading for the prospectus to state that there were recent increases in natural gas prices.
in oxford asset management jaharis,cir,the court held that there was no duty to disclose in the prospectus all information material to the offering,but only that material information necessary to make the statements in the prospectus not misleading and that material information specifically required by the securities laws to be included.the court also approved the statement in shaw digital equipment,cir that the mere possession of material nonpubl
