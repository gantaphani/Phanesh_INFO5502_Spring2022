the original complaint states that the prediwave was organized and exists under the laws of the state of california with its principal place of business in fremont,california.according to the complaint,defendants began representing prediwave in early may.defendants also represented prediwave,its affiliated companies,and ceo qu in litigation with new world tmt limited new world.in june,defendants withdrew as counsel for prediwave,its companies,and qu.defendant law firm received million for representing prediwave.
the complaint alleges that qu perpetrated fraud upon new world by making false representations and withholding material information regarding prediwave products.qu allegedly induced new world to purchase all prediwave preferred shares for million,to spend over million to purchase prediwave defective video on demand vod set top box stb and related hardware and software,and to invest million in the purchase of all the preferred shares of affiliated companies.
the complaint alleges that,pursuant to the prediwave preferred stock purchase agreement,new world appointed two board directors,douglas chan and fu sze shing fu to prediwave board of directors and they served from to april.according to the complaint,on april,new world chairman,henry cheng,cancelled new world outstanding vod stb order and,on april,new world replaced chan with jimmy li as its second outside director.
the complaint indicates that directors li and fu became aware of purported board resolutions approving bonuses of over million to qu and other corporate spending for qu benefit and alleged that the two directors became concerned that qu was diverting millions of dollars in assets from prediwave.it states that,on april,the two directors sent a letter to qu informing him that they were exercising their right as prediwave directors to inspect prediwave books and records pursuant to the california corporations code.on april,they sent letters to prediwave financial institutions informing them that they were commencing an audit and any withdrawal over was required to be cosigned by a new world representative and requesting a summary of prediwave accounts and notice of withdrawals exceeding referred to in the complaint as the bank letters.
the complaint states on may and,new world sent additional letters to prediwave rejecting revoking its acceptance of the vod stbs and all other goods supporting the vod stbs,and notifying prediwave that it was in breach of the parties agreements and warranties.
the complaint indicates that,after being hired,defendants conferred with qu and the common stock board members and,on may,defendants filed a peremptory lawsuit in los angeles county the action against the two outside directors instead of investigating their claims or recommending to the board that an independent investigation of the merits of their allegations be conducted.according to the complaint,the action falsely accused the two directors of breaching their fiduciary duties to prediwave by requesting to inspect prediwave books and records and seeking to investigate fraud by prediwave management and by sending the bank letters.the action sought to block their inspection of corporate books and records.the present complaint alleges that the next day,may,defendants sought a temporary restraining order tro and preliminary injunction against the two outside directors and these aggressive tactics were designed to impede li and fu investigation.according to the complaint,the trial court denied the tro and defendants subsequently withdrew the application for a preliminary injunction.
the complaint further alleges that,when director li was en route to prediwave offices on may,for an arranged inspection of prediwave books and records,defendants notified li that permission to inspect would be denied unless li signed an agreement imposing strict limits on his use of the books and records limits far more draconian that those involving trade secrets and confidential information to which li counsel had agreed in principle.when li did not agree,defendants refused to permit li access to prediwave books and records.
the complaint indicates that,on may,new world filed a lawsuit against prediwave,its affiliated companies,and qu in santa clara county the santa clara action.it avers that new world santa clara action alleged fraud,breach of contract,negligent misrepresentation,and breach of fiduciary duties by qu and prediwave and specified,among other things,that qu had looted prediwave and its affiliates of more than million in unearned bonuses and other abusive perquisites and had defrauded new world into investing in prediwave and its affiliates 
the complaint in this case states that li was forced to file a petition for writ of mandate to enforce his right to inspect prediwave books and records.defendants unsuccessfully sought to disqualify li counsel in that proceeding and prediwave appealed the ruling,allegedly as a tactic to further delay inspection of prediwave books and records.
the complaint states that the defendants stonewalled discovery in the action to prevent li and fu from obtaining documentary evidence of qu theft of funds,thereby enabling qu fraud.the complaint alleges that defendants adopted a strategy of delaying and blocking written and oral discovery in the los angeles and santa clara actions.this led to significant motion practice,which resulted in significant delay and concomitant cost to prediwave,and facilitated qu continued fraud and theft of prediwave assets.it asserts that the irreconcilable conflict of interest obstructed li and fu attempts to uncover qu fraud and theft of funds,enabled qu to continue looting prediwave,and unnecessarily extended litigation that should have been resolved without incurring millions in legal fees.
after a court issued a writ of mandate,documents were produced but defendants stamped them confidential and took the position that the documents could not be used in the and santa clara actions.the present complaint states that the pleading in the action was amended to claim erroneously that li also breached his fiduciary duty to prediwave by conducting a review of prediwave corporate documents pursuant to his rights under the california corporations code.
the complaint recites that,in july,new world appointed bruce keiser as a prediwave director,a replacement for fu.
the complaint indicates that,in august,prediwave paid qu a million bonus that had allegedly been approved by prediwave board in january.the complaint also states that qu caused himself to be paid a million bonus in december.
the complaint indicates that,at his may,deposition in the los angeles action,qu,while being represented by defendants,denied that prediwave transactions with a company called modern office technology mot constituted fraud despite being presented with certain documents suggesting mot had ties to qu family.according to the complaint,it was eventually proven in new world santa clara action that mot was a dummy company through which qu inflated the price of component parts to the prediwave system and the prices accrued to the benefit of mot,which held bank accounts in china opened by qu mother.it states that b loated profits of approximately million were generated by mot and t his scheme defrauded both prediwave and new world.the complaint alleges that defendants failed to investigate whether qu and his family or friends controlled mot,whether mot in fact existed as a real business,and whether the mot transactions were legitimate,or sham transactions costing prediwave and new world millions of dollars.
according to the complaint,in december,when defendants were no longer representing prediwave or qu,qu transferred million from his merrill lynch account in san francisco to an overseas account.
the complaint indicates that,on march,new world obtained a preliminary injunction against prediwave and several prediwave companies and a writ of attachment and it then levied on prediwave bank accounts.on april,prediwave filed for bankruptcy protection it is alleged that,on july,new world obtained relief from the automatic bankruptcy stay in order to prosecute its claims.
the complaint alleges that,in july and august,qu sold two of his real properties for a total of million.

the complaint further alleges that defendants acted against prediwave best interests by taking direction from qu and by tailor ing the defense of the santa clara action and other legal actions to favor qu it further states that defendants failed to protect prediwave by,at a minimum,requiring an arrangement with qu to ensure that qu would reimburse prediwave for attorneys fees advanced for qu defense 
the complaint also states that defendant did nothing to stop prediwave from paying the million bonus to qu in august.it alleges that defendants failure to disclose qu illicit activities to the prediwave board,or to take any affirmative action to otherwise protect prediwave enabled qu to transfer million out of the country in december a date subsequent to defendants withdrawal as counsel.it charges defendants with refusing to take steps to preserve prediwave assets and claims against qu and failing to resolve the lawsuit with new world because of the conflict of interest.the complaint states that the conflict of interest unnecessarily extended litigation that should have been resolved without incurring millions in legal fees.
the individual causes of action incorporate by reference the general allegations.the first cause of action alleges that,by reason of the acts and omissions alleged herein,defendants breached their fiduciary duty to act in prediwave best interests in representing the corporation,to protect prediwave,and to fully disclose qu wrongful conduct to prediwave.the alleged damages include the legal fees paid to defendants,the bonuses paid to qu,the over million taken by qu who had been protected from any meaningful internal investigation by defendants,and additional unnecessary attorney fees in excess of million.
the second cause of action for constructive fraud alleges that defendants had a fiduciary duty to make full disclosure to prediwave of all material facts in connection with their representation of prediwave,qu,and the prediwave companies,including the conflicts of interest,and all information with respect to qu wrongful conduct.this cause of action avers that defendants abused prediwave trust and confidence by reason of the acts alleged herein.it alleges that defendants failed to inform prediwave that a nonwaivable conflict existed between prediwave and qu based on the nature of the allegations made against qu and take steps to insure that prediwave was represented by separate,independent,and unconflicted counsel and defendants failed to fully disclose potential and actual conflicts of interest to the entire board of prediwave and failed to inform the entire board of prediwave of the desirability and necessity of obtaining separate and independent legal advice.according to the second cause of action,defendants nondisclosures and breaches of fiduciary duties caused prediwave to incur attorney fees.
the third cause of action for malpractice alleges that defendants breached their duties,as set forth in the complaint,to competently represent prediwave,to act in prediwave best interests,to avoid and fully disclose conflicts of interest,to independently investigate qu,and to fully disclose qu wrongful conduct to prediwave entire board so that prediwave could make an informed decision.it charges defendants with violating the rules of professional conduct,rules failing to act competently,avoiding interests adverse to a client,avoiding the representation of adverse interests,communication,organization as client,termination of employment it avers that,if defendants had competently represented prediwave,prediwave would not have incurred millions of dollars in legal fees,qu would not have been paid bonuses exceeding million,qu would not have misappropriated over million and transferred funds out of the country,prediwave would not have sustained a judgment over billion,and prediwave would not have been forced to file for bankruptcy protection.
the fourth cause of action for violation of business and professions code section et alleges that a conflict of interest resulted from defendant law firm simultaneously representing prediwave and qu in the face of serious allegations that qu was looting prediwave.it avers that defendant law firm failed to disclose material information to prediwave,covered up qu fraudulent conduct,and failed to take reasonable action to protect prediwave.it alleges that the law firm failure to disclose its cover up of qu fraudulent conduct,its conflict of interest,and its actions and inactions constitute a fraudulent,deceptive,and unfair business practice.
after the complaint was filed,defendants filed a special motion to strike under the statute,arguing that the causes of action were based upon protected speech and petitioning activity in the underlying lawsuits.they asserted that the complaint seeks to impose liability on defendants for filing pleadings and other motions and their conduct of the litigation.they contended that peregrine funding,sheppard mullin richter hampton llp th,d peregrine was directly on point and,as in peregrine,the plaintiff claims were subject to a motion to strike because they arose from protected petitioning activity.
the motion was opposed by declarations and incorporated exhibits.a retainer letter,dated june,confirmed that defendant law firm would represent and advise prediwave in connection with its legal and business disputes with new world.it also indicated that the client included the associated companies listed on schedule a associated companies and any individual officers,directors or shareholders of these associated companies that become named parties in any litigation matters with new world.prediwave sought to obtain its client files and property from defendant law firm in april.defendant law firm stated,in an april,letter to prediwave current counsel,that the files and property had been transferred to latham watkins between july,and august.latham watkins subsequently delivered those documents to prediwave current counsel.
those documents included,among others,an outline of interview questions for a december,internal interview of qu,the written results of the december,interview,labeled as privileged attorney,a march,private investigative report regarding six individuals including qu,and an april,internal memo to the file,labeled attorney work product,which discusses the relationship between prediwave and mot and identifies potential areas of concern,including apparent inconsistencies between tony qu rendition of events and the documentary record.
bruce keiser declaration states that new world appointed him as a prediwave director on about july,and,on about april,prediwave board of directors appointed him as its chief financial officer and secretary and granted him the powers and duties of management generally vested in a chief executive officer ceo.according to the declaration,he first became of aware of defendant law firm internal documents,identified above,in about june.he states that neither he nor prediwave board was ever notified that defendant law firm had conducted an internal investigation into mot revealing qu fraud against prediwave.
the trial court granted the motion.it determined that t he claims asserted against defendants are based in significant part upon protected petitioning activities,citing peregrine,supra,th,d,and that there was no reasonable probability that plaintiff will prevail because the claims were time barred under section.

in benasra mitchell silberberg knupp llp th,d,plaintiffs sued attorneys,which had previously represented them,for breach of the duty of loyalty in subsequently representing a rival in an arbitration proceeding.id.at,d.the trial court granted the defendants motion.id.at,d.the appellate court rejected the argument that plaintiffs claims were based on written or oral statements made in the arbitration.id.at,d.it determined that plaintiffs claims were based on rule c of the state bar rules of professional conduct,which provides that an attorney shall not,without the informed written consent of each client accept representation of more than one client in a matter in which the interests of the clients potentially conflict or accept or continue representation of more than one client in a matter in which the interests of the clients actually conflict or represent a client in a matter and at the same time in a separate matter accept as a client a person or entity whose interest in the first matter is adverse to the client in the first matter,and on rule e,which provides that an attorney shall not,without the informed written consent of the client or former client,accept employment adverse to the client or former client where,by reason of the representation of the client or former client,the member has obtained confidential information material to the employment.id.at,d.
the appellate court further determined that,under applicable law,breach of the duty of loyalty occurs not when the attorney steps into court to represent the new client,but when he or she abandons the old client.id.at,d.it reasoned o nce the attorney accepts a representation in which confidences disclosed by a former client may benefit the new client due to the relationship between the new matter and the old,he or she has breached a duty of loyalty.the breach of fiduciary duty lawsuit may follow litigation pursued against the former client,but does not arise from it.evidence that confidential information was actually used against the former client in litigation would help support damages,but is not the basis for the claim.ibid.the court concluded that the trial court erred in granting the motion.ibid.
in freeman schack th,d,p laintiffs sued attorney schack for breach of contract,professional negligence and breach of fiduciary duty based on allegations that he had entered into a contract by which he assumed duties toward plaintiffs but abandoned them in order to represent adverse interests in the same and different litigation,thus breaching the contract as well as the fiduciary duties owed them.plaintiffs maintained that attorney schack violated the state bar rules of professional conduct providing for the avoidance of representation of adverse interests,specifically rules c and e.id.at,d.
the appellate court in freeman schack determined that the activity giving rise to attorney schack alleged liability was his undertaking to represent a party with interests adverse to plaintiffs,in violation of the duty of loyalty he assertedly owed them and the litigation related allegations were merely incidental to the allegations of breach of contract,negligence in failing to properly represent their interests,and breach of fiduciary duty arising from his representation of clients with adverse interests.id.at,d.the court concluded that the plaintiffs causes of action were not based on,and d id not arise from,an exercise of the constitutional rights of petition or free speech as enumerated in section,subdivision e.id.at,d.

in contrast to the foregoing cases,the appellate court in peregrine determined that causes of action against a law firm were subject to the statute.the peregrine case involved investors who had lost millions of dollars in a large ponzi scheme carried out by pinnfund usa,pinnfund,a company that was established by james hillman and another person and that was disguised as a successful mortgage lending business.peregrine,supra,th at,d.one of the plaintiffs was a bankruptcy trustee representing entities that were used to perpetrate the scheme id.at,d.the entities under bankruptcy protection included three businesses created by hillman to solicit funds for investment in pinnfund mortgages funding entities and peregrine funding,peregrine,which managed the funding entities and which was controlled by hillman and his wife.id.at,fn,d.other plaintiffs were investors asserting claims on behalf of themselves and a putative class of bilked investors.id.at,fn,d.the plaintiffs sued the law firm sheppard mullin richter hampton llp sheppard,claiming its negligence and affirmative misconduct helped the perpetrators of the scheme avoid detection and prosecution by securities regulators.id.at,d.
in peregrine,the law firm,which represented hillman,peregrine,the funding entities,failed to cooperate with an sec investigation during february and march and the sec filed a lawsuit on march.peregrine,supra,th at,d.on april,the law firm gave notice it was withdrawing as counsel for the funding entities but it continued to represent hillman through the duration of the sec action.id.at,d.
the plaintiffs in peregrine asserted two causes of action,one for legal malpractice and another for aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty.id.at,d.their claims were based on transactional legal advice,set forth in letters,given to hillman that peregrine and the then existing funding entities were not required to register under applicable law and the law firm allegedly conflicted representation of adverse parties in the sec action alleging violation of federal securities laws.ibid.the complaint alleged that the law firm,before it withdrew as counsel for the funding entities,continued to represent the funding entities and peregrine but acted to their detriment in serving the needs of its hillman,by opposing provisional relief sought by the government,fighting appointment of a receiver,and by threatening to put the funding entities into bankruptcy if the government insisted that hillman testify.id.at,d.plaintiffs also claim ed they were damaged by the law firm representation of hillman in the sec action in that the firm blocked the sec investigation and delayed provisional relief and assisted hillman exit from the ponzi scheme by helping him implement a dividend reinvestment program that recycled investor returns instead of distributing them to investors.id.at,d.
the appellate court first determined that the legal opinion letters,which were not issued in connection to any litigation,were not writings made before a judicial proceeding,or in connection with an issue under review by a court,subd.e.peregrine,supra,th at,d,italics added.it also agreed that some of the law firm challenged conduct did not involve speech or petitioning activities,such as the law firm failure to disclose potential conflicts of interest or obtain informed consent from all clients to its joint representation id.at,d.but the appellate court found the law firm opposition to the sec efforts to obtain restraining orders and to appoint a receiver in a lawsuit necessarily involved written or oral statement s made before a judicial proceeding,subd.e and the law firm alleged litigation tactics,which included conduct such as stopping deposition testimony and withholding documents,constitute d conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition,subd.e id.at,d.
the appellate court in peregrine,supra,th,d determined that the allegations of loss resulting from protected activity distinguish ed the case from other cases finding certain claims against lawyers were not subject to a motion to strike under section.id.at,d.although it acknowledged that the overarching thrust of plaintiffs claims was that the law firm conduct facilitated the ponzi scheme,it also observed that some of the specific conduct complained o
