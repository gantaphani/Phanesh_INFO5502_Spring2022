texas rule of civil procedure permits a partnership doing business under an assumed name to file suit in that name.civ.however,before judgment,the partnership correct legal name must be substituted for its assumed name.the first issue in this case is whether there is legally sufficient evidence that sixth rma partners,used rma partners,as an assumed name so that the original petition filed under the name rma partners,was effective to commence suit on behalf of sixth rma partners.the second issue is whether sixth rma partners,second supplemental pleadings were effective to substitute its correct legal name.the final issue is whether sixth rma partners,is prohibited from prosecuting its claims in texas courts because it has never filed an assumed name certificate.after a bench trial,the trial court rendered judgment in favor of sixth rma partners.the court of appeals,holding that sixth rma partners,was never made a plaintiff,reversed the trial court judgment and rendered judgment that sixth rma partners,take nothing.we conclude that some evidence supports the trial court implied finding that sixth rma partners,used the name rma partners,as an assumed name sixth rma partners,second supplemental pleadings were effective to substitute its correct legal name and any challenge that sixth rma partners,failure to file the required assumed name certificate precludes its suit was waived because it was not properly raised in the trial court.accordingly,we reverse the court of appeals judgment and remand the case to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

the original answer filed by rma partners,contained a general denial and asserted that the declaratory judgment action was improper because sibley was merely asserting affirmative defenses to rma suit on two promissory notes.sibley original answer contained a general denial,three affirmative defenses,and a plea in abatement based on the pendency of the declaratory judgment action.the affirmative defenses were that the plaintiff was not a holder in due course setoff and limitations because the debts plaintiff claims are owed by defendant occurred more than four years before plaintiff filed the petition in this action.

while plaintiff supplemental petition sets forth that it was filed to include an designation for plaintiff,that rma partners,was also known as sixth rma partners,the correct designation should be sixth rma partners,also known as rma partners.in other words,the terms rma or rma partners,are sometimes used to collect debts owned and held by sixth rma partners,the owner and holder of the notes at issue in this case.therefore,the correct designation and name for plaintiff is sixth rma partners,rma partners,for that reason,this petition is supplemented to include the correct designation.
