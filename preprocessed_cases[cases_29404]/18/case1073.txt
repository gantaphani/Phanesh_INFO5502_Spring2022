background 
joint council pension trust fund filed a securities fraud class action in the united states district court for the district of arizona on behalf of itself and investors who purchased publicly traded class b common stock of holdings during the class period november,to september.plaintiffs alleged that holdings and its subsidiary,america west airlines,collectively referred to as america west,made misleading statements to artificially inflate the value of america west stock while their controlling shareholders engaged in insider trading of over million worth of stock.
defendants in this case are america west,numerous america west officers and directors and its two largest shareholders during the class period.the shareholders were defendants tpg partners,tpg genpar,tpg advisors,and texas pacific group,collectively referred to as tpg and defendant continental airlines,continental.defendant james coulter was director and vice president of tpg and director of america west.defendant richard schifter was vice president of tpg and director of america west.
bankruptcy reorganization of america west 
on june,america west filed for chapter bankruptcy reorganization.several investors,including tpg and continental,were involved in the reorganization plan.in return for their equity,the investors received several million shares of class a and class b stock,as well as warrants to purchase class b common stock.although the economic rights were identical between the two,class a stock entitled the shareholder to votes per share,whereas class b common stock entitled the shareholder to one vote per share.
under the reorganization plan,tpg obtained nearly shares of class a stock,more than million shares of class b stock,and approximately million warrants to purchase additional class b stock.consequently,tpg held of the class a stock,and continental held of the class a stock.both tpg and continental entered into a stockholder agreement with america west,which contained a provision,requiring that the investors retain two shares of class b stock for every share of class a stock until may.class a stock could be converted to class b stock at any point.
the stockholder agreement also provided that the shareholders would select nine out of the fifteen board directors by virtue of their ownership of the supervoting class a stock,tpg and continental constituted a majority of the stockholders.tpg and continental allegedly chose directors who were favorable to their interests.for example,coulter,a tpg officer,was appointed a director of america west and served on its executive committee,which exercised all powers of the board of directors between the full board meetings.schifter,another tpg officer,was also appointed to the board of directors and served on the compensation committee,which determined the promotion,salaries,and bonuses of american west officers 
outsourcing of aircraft maintenance related operational problems 
on january,defendant william franke became chief executive officer ceo of america west.plaintiffs allege that aircraft maintenance deteriorated dramatically during his term as ceo and later as president of the company.plaintiffs assert that franke instituted a policy known as do gold plate the plane,maintenance workers should only do the minimum and discontinued and practices with the federal aviation administration faa.
in december,america west fired aircraft mechanics,half of the maintenance work force,and its maintenance to tramco.in an internal email dated june,an faa officer described the maintenance saga that began in december.the faa officer stated that tramco was not properly doing maintenance and that the faa was fighting an ongoing battle to educate the upper management of america west that it was,in fact,responsible for oversight.the faa began an aggressive enforcement program,which included inspections,warning letters,and meetings.some of these efforts included 
a december,letter from the faa to america west stating that tramco was not in compliance with the maintenance policies and procedures manual 
a series of incident reports regarding use of improper lubricant,failure to complete all maintenance check requirements,and operation of aircraft without installation of needed equipment such as hydraulic system pressure lights 
a february,meeting between thomas derieg,america west senior vice president of operations,and the faa to discuss concerns regarding tramco 
subsequent meetings between america west,tramco,and the faa regarding tramco failure to follow proper procedures 
a july,faa report,in which the faa discussed the results of its main base inspection of america west and cited faulty procedures and multiple violations and 
a december,faa letter to aramini,senior vice president of operations of america west,stating that senior management of america west must understand and take seriously their complete and total responsibility for the administration,oversight,and control of their continuous airworthiness maintenance program.
throughout,the faa continued to conduct inspections,find violations,and issue warnings to america west regarding its maintenance operations.in a meeting with america west,the faa described these maintenance issues as a systematic problem.america west incident rate was above average for the industry in the second and third quarters of.by the fourth quarter of,the number of service difficulty reports sdrs had increased from to per quarter,in contrast to other major carriers average of sdrs per quarter.
america west maintenance issues led to operational problems,including canceled or delayed flights and slower maintenance cycles,and resulted in performance compared to the s p index of other airline stocks.for example,america west suffered a loss of million in.during this quarter,the company stock fell to,half the previous value of the shares.by october,the stock was trading at about to per share.
throughout this period,america west assured investors that the maintenance issues were being addressed.in its annual report,the company reported that it had improved its operational reliability by establishing two new overnight maintenance facilities operations,hiring approximately new mechanics and acquiring an additional spare aircraft,as well as committing additional funds for parts.in june,goodmanson,then president and ceo of america west,assured investors that the company had explored in great detail what went well and what went wrong,and we have fixes in place.
beginning of class period 
the low performance of america west stock obviously affected both its shareholders and officers who held stock options.in response,tpg and continental allegedly decided to raise the stock price by may,the date on which they could freely sell their stock under the stockholder agreement.to accomplish this goal,tpg and continental allegedly joined forces to exert undue influence on america west officers,taking advantage of their position as majority owners who controlled the board of directors and related committees.
in particular,plaintiffs allege that,under the influence of tpg and continental,america west redoubled its efforts to push the stock price higher by peppering the market with false statements about the company outlook,launching a campaign to secure favorable recommendations from analysts by misinforming them that operational problems had been fixed,and representing that the improved financial returns were due to exceptionally efficient management,rather than unsafe maintenance practices.plaintiffs also allege that,in its statements and financial documents,america west overstated its operating income by maintenance and repairs expenses.
some examples of the statements made by america west during this time period include 
on november,senior management represented to donaldson,lufkin jenrette dlj that bright revenue prospects were ahead and that the maintenance issues caused by outsourcing were behind the company.dlj issued a report the following day.
on january,america west issued a report,headlined america west holdings corporation reports best financial results in company history.
on january,america west held a conference call with analysts,portfolio managers,and other investors.franke and parker,the chief financial officer,discussed the increase in fourth quarter income of and indicated that america west maintenance expenses would not increase in.following this conference call,morgan stanley dean witter raised its rating on america west to out perform.
contrary to america west representations,its maintenance problems,as well as the faa resulting enforcement actions and warnings,continued to occur.examples include 
a january,faa letter to goodmanson and related case report,stating that america west failure to ensure the effectiveness of the radio communication system on airplanes is indicative of the systemic problems that are deeply integrated within the airline procedures lack thereof and 
a february,faa letter to goodmanson and related case report,stating that america west lack of methods and procedures regarding dispatch releases perpetuates the attitude of this carrier management that safety and regulatory requirements are secondary to the continued movement of aircraft within the carrier route system.
by failing to perform the required inspections and routine maintenance,america west allegedly achieved artificially high utilization rates,the number of hours flown by an aircraft per day,which in turn increased their revenues.plaintiffs allege that america west,tpg,and continental all knew that america west would eventually bear the brunt of these deferred costs.
plaintiffs also allege that tpg and continental caused america west to repurchase its own stock as a manipulative device designed to further inflate its price.during the second and third quarters of,america west spent million repurchasing million shares on the open market.in total,america west spent nearly million repurchasing million shares.
plaintiffs assert that the scheme to raise the stock price succeeded by overstating the company operating income,ignoring maintenance and operational problems,failing to inform investors and the public of its ongoing structural problems,and repurchasing stock.by december,the stock hit,its highest price in months.by march,america west stock reached,the highest price since its bankruptcy reorganization.by april,america west stock soared to an high of.in the annual report released on may,franke and goodmanson stated that america west had produced the best financial results in its history and realized substantial improvements in its operational performance.the report also emphasized that safety will continue to be a foremost priority.
from april,to may,several america west insiders,including outside directors bollenbach,fraser,and ryan,sold shares at as high as per stock,netting million in proceeds.as noted earlier,under the stockholder agreement,tpg and continental could begin selling their class b stock,without selling any of their supervoting class a stock,beginning on may.on may,tpg sold approximately of its class b stock shares at approximately per share,totaling over million.on june,continental sold all of its class b stock shares at per share,totaling over million.by the end of july,insiders had sold million shares for over million.
faa settlement agreement 
by may,america west had begun secret settlement negotiations with the faa.in a june,meeting,goodmanson verbally promised faa officials that america west would resolve its maintenance problems.the terms of the agreement were discussed in a series of meetings held on june,and.
on june,the day after continental sold its class b stock,the wall street journal reported that america west face d the prospect of substantial federal sanctions for failing to properly oversee the work of outside maintenance contractors on its jetliners.the faa is seeking to impose at least million in civil penalties.the article also stated that separate from the prospect of sanctions the faa put america west on its watch list june because of labor unrest among maintenance workers and flight attendants the airline spokeswoman said the enhanced surveillance has turned up any significant maintenance or operational problems.on june,the tribune business news published an article entitled america west brass calls faa scrutiny routine.in the article,goodmanson stated that the increased surveillance was routine faa procedure when an airline is involved in labor negotiations,and reiterated that no significant maintenance or operating problems had been discovered.plaintiffs allege that these types of reassurances kept the stock value high.
on july,the faa and america west reached a settlement agreement under which the company agreed to pay million for violating the faa aircraft inspection and maintenance rules.the agreement stated that b oth the faa and america west recognize that organizational changes are required to ensure that america west can conduct such operations at the highest level of safety.under the terms of the agreement,america west was required to devise comprehensive corrective actions for problems discovered,at minimum,in the following areas oversight of contract maintenance performance of maintenance in accordance with appropriate procedures minimum equipment list compliance,including deferred maintenance and training programs in carrying out these actions,america west was required to demonstrate that it had sufficient numbers of experienced maintenance and inspection personnel,quality assurance personnel,ground support personnel,materials,and equipment.
plaintiffs allege that,during this period,america west continued to reassure the public and its investors that the faa actions would not have a negative impact on the company.goodmanson and other america west officers assured multiple money and portfolio managers,shareholders,and analysts,that america west did not anticipate any major increase in maintenance costs or the cost of oversights.on the day that the settlement agreement was announced,american west issued a statement that problems cited have been fully addressed and that the settlement agreement provisions will not have a material adverse affect on the company operations or financial results.in a july,conference call with analysts,managers,investors,and shareholders,goodmanson stated that america west was not anticipating any major increase in maintenance costs or the cost of oversights going forward as a result of the faa settlement.that same day,america west issued a release entitled america west reports increase in second quarter earnings the best quarterly results in company history.the operating income was once again overstated by approximately because of the adjusted maintenance costs.plaintiffs allege that,in reality,america west deferred its maintenance and inspection costs,thus artificially depressing its operating costs in order to maintain higher operating income and to mislead investors.
drop in stock prices 
america west stock began to decline in late july.the stock value dropped from per share on july,to on august.the following day,america west announced a new program,authorizing the repurchase of up to five million shares in the company release regarding the new program,franke stated that it reflected america west belief that its stock was an attractive investment.
however,on september,america west announced that it would not meet third quarter earnings estimates because of unsatisfactory operational performance.america west revealed that it was in the process of purchasing two additional spare airplanes,increasing the number of cities from four to thirteen where overnight maintenance capabilities would be available,increasing its inventory of spare parts,and hiring more than mechanics.the stock immediately fell over six points,from the previous day per share,to per share on september.the stock continued to fall,reaching a low of in early october.
immediately after the september,announcement,analysts slashed the forecast for america west third and fourth quarters of.oppenheimer downgraded america west because of operational disruptions that were negatively affecting dispatch reliability,performance and therefore earnings.dlj securities issued a report stating that the cause of america west earnings deficiencies appeared to be operational and that these problems were the result of ongoing labor issues and a far more smothering presence of the faa on the property than we had understood.the report noted that t wo disturbing aspects of yesterday announcement were the facts that the current scenario is reminiscent of earnings shortfalls in,and that we had no inkling from the company of the problems 
procedural history 
after the certification of the putative class,plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint against defendants,alleging violations of section b of the act and rule.plaintiffs also alleged that individual officers and directors,as well as the controlling shareholders,were liable under section a of the act.
on october,the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint with leave for plaintiffs to amend.the district court granted defendants motion,concluding that the plaintiffs had failed to satisfy the pleading requirements of the pslra because plaintiffs had failed to sufficiently support their allegations of false and misleading statements with great detail and all relevant circumstances and plaintiffs had failed to state with particularity facts that gave rise to a strong inference of deliberate recklessness or actual intent.the district court admonished plaintiffs that another unsuccessful attempt at pleading their claims will result in dismissal with prejudice plaintiffs need to focus their complaint on pleading the factual allegations,if any,that support their claims of securities fraud against each defendant named in this action.
on january,plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint.plaintiffs alleged that defendants artificially inflated the price of america west stock by issuing misleading statements and omitting material information about the company maintenance and operations problems,as well as the faa investigation,and causing america west to repurchase millions of shares at million.on june,the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss with prejudice for failure to state a claim under federal rule of civil procedure b and failure to meet the heightened pleading requirements of the plsra.on june,plaintiffs filed this timely appeal.

discussion 
on appeal,we must address whether plaintiffs have stated a claim against defendants under section b of the act section b and rule,in accordance with the heightened pleading requirements of the pslra and whether plaintiffs have stated a claim against tpg and continental under section a of the act section a.because our inquiry is governed by the pslra,we begin with a discussion of its requirements.
a.the private securities litigation reform act 
in an effort to deter abusive and frivolous securities fraud claims,congress enacted the pslra,which amended the act and raised the pleading standards for private securities fraud claims.silicon graphics,at.the pslra altered the pleading requirements for private litigants by requiring that a complaint plead with particularity both falsity and scienter.ronconi larkin,cir noting that the pleading requirement only required that falsity be pled with particularity as required under.b.
pursuant to the pslra,the complaint must specify each statement alleged to have been misleading,the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading,and if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief,the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which the belief is formed.b.in addition,the pslra requires that the complaint state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.id.b.in this circuit the required state of mind is one of deliberate or conscious recklessness.silicon graphics,at however,if the challenged act is a statement,the required state of mind is actual knowledge that the statement was false or misleading.c.if a plaintiff fails to plead either the alleged misleading statements or scienter with particularity,his or her complaint must be dismissed.id.b a.
section b and rule 
plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in dismissing their claim under section b and rule.section b states,in relevant part 
it shall be unlawful for any person,directly or indirectly,by the use of any facility of any national securities exchange t o use or employ,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security registered on a national securities,any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.
b.rule provides that it is unlawful to use any facility of the national securities exchange t o employ any device,scheme,or artifice to defraud.a.it further provides that it is unlawful t o make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading.id.b.
in considering whether a private securities fraud complaint can survive dismissal under rule b,we must determine whether particular facts in the complaint,taken as a whole,raise a strong inference that defendants intentionally or with deliberate recklessness made false or misleading statements.ronconi,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted noting that the pleading requirements under the pslra can be collapsed into a single inquiry because analysis of both requirements involve the same set of facts.
in evaluating plaintiffs section b and rule claim,the district court found that the plaintiffs had failed to sufficiently allege any omissions,misrepresentations,or an overall scheme that would form the basis of their securities fraud claim,and failed to raise a strong inference of the required scienter,that defendants made these statements or employed such devices with actual intent or deliberate recklessness.although this circuit generally examines the falsity and scienter requirements at the same time,we follow the district court framework in order to fully discuss the issues raised.
sufficiency of factual allegations supporting claim 
plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in determining that they failed to sufficiently allege misleading omissions and misrepresentations as required by section b and rule.plaintiffs allege that defendants schemed to artificially inflate america west stock price by may,the date on which the major shareholders could freely sell their class b stock under the stockholder agreement.plaintiffs allege that,in order to accomplish this goal,defendants deferred maintenance costs and operational expenses while overstating america west operating income and making numerous optimistic statements regarding its financial condition.these statements failed to inform investors of america west continuing maintenance problems its deferral of maintenance costs the ongoing faa investigations,and the settlement negotiations.in addition,plaintiffs allege that defendants misrepresented that the original maintenance issues and operational problems caused by its outsourcing to tramco had been solved.
plaintiffs further contend that,following the public announcement of the million settlement agreement on july,defendants made misleading and false statements reassuring investors that america west remained an attractive investment and that the settlement agreement would not have a substantial effect on the company.for example,on the day of the announcement,america west issued a press release,stating that all of the problems cited by the faa had been fully addressed and that the settlement agreement provisions would not have a material adverse effect on the company operations or financial results.on july,goodmanson stated that america west was not anticipating any major increase in maintenance costs or cost of oversight as a result of the settlement agreement.
in support of its allegations,plaintiffs cite to press releases and reports published by america west statements made by america west officials america west financial statements various correspondence from faa employees to america west officials internal email messages between faa employees discussing the maintenance issues at america west analyst reports regarding the financial condition of america west portions of the settlement agreement comparisons of america west maintenance and repair costs between and and comparisons of inspection costs and aircraft utilization rates with those of other airlines america west announcement on september,that it would not meet third quarter earnings because of unsatisfactory operational performance and analyst reactions to the announcement.
despite these allegations,the district court determined that plaintiffs failed to provide a sufficient factual basis for its fraud claim.in particular,the district court found that any alleged omissions regarding the maintenance issues,faa negotiations,and the settlement agreement were immaterial because the market failed to react immediately to the public announcement on july.in addition,the district court concluded that the plaintiffs failed to adequately account for the effects of the labor dispute between america west and its maintenance workers during the class period and its effects on america west third quarter earnings.because the parties briefs primarily address the district court findings,we discuss each in turn.
materiality of statements prior to july,
the district court found that the alleged omissions and misrepresentations regarding america west maintenance issues,the faa investigation,and the faa settlement agreement were immaterial as a matter of law because the market did not immediately react,either after the june,wall street journal disclosure of the potential faa fines or after the july,announcement that the faa had levied a million fine.in doing so,the district court applied the bright line rule suggested by the third circuit in oran stafford,cir.id.at finding that misrepresentations or omissions are immaterial as a matter of law if the market does not react immediately upon disclosure of the information.
defendants urge us to adopt this per se rule,if there has been no immediate change in the stock price,the alleged misrepresentations or omissions must have been immaterial.however,we decline to do so because adoption of such a rule would contravene the supreme court holdings in basic,levinson,d and tsc industries,northway,d.
in basic,the supreme court expressly adopted the reasonable investor standard set forth in tsc industries for determining materiality in the section b and rule context.at.the court held that a fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important in his or her decision making.id.at.quoting tsc,at.the court explained that,to fulfill the materiality requirement,there must be a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.id.at.citation omitted.in other words,materiality depends on the significance the reasonable investor would place on the withheld or misrepresented information.id.at.see united states bilzerian,cir.
pursuant to basic,we reject defendants argument for adoption of a rule requiring an immediate market reaction.the market is subject to distortions that prevent the ideal of a free and open public market from occurring.at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.as recognized by the supreme court,these distortions may not be corrected immediately.see id.at.because of these distortions,adoption of a rule assuming that the stock price will instantly react would fail to address the realities of the market.thus,we decline to adopt a rule,and,instead,engage in the inquiry set forth in basic id.at.
applying this inquiry to the present case,plaintiffs have sufficiently pleaded the materiality of america west misrepresentations regarding its maintenance issues,the faa investigation,and the faa settlement agreement.see warshaw xoma,cir finding that the company optimistic statements,which failed to disclose concerns regarding the safety of a product and unlikelihood of agency of approval,were material.a reasonable investor would find significant the information regarding a company deferred maintenance costs,unsafe maintenance practices,and possible sanction.in addition,a reasonable investor would consider the potential effects of each of these facts on the overall economic health of the company as significantly alter ing the total mix of information made available.tsc,at.moreover,although america west disclosures of the settlement agreement had no immediate effect on the market price,its stock price dropped on september,when the full economic effects of the settlement agreement and the ongoing maintenance problems were finally disclosed to the market.this reaction,even if slightly delayed,further supports a finding of materiality.this is particularly true because plaintiffs offer a reason for the delay,america west continued to reassure analysts that the settlement agreement and compliance therewith would not have noticeable economic effects on the company 
b.other potential causes 
in determining that the plaintiffs factual allegations were insufficient,the district court reasoned that plaintiffs completely ignore d the other factual events that occurred during the class period and the impact of those events on america west and its stock prices.in particular,the district court expressed its concern that plaintiffs had overlooked the labor dispute between america west and its maintenance workers during the class period in determining what factors caused america west to miss its forecasted third quarter earnings.
however,in reaching this finding,the district court failed to accept plaintiffs allegations as true and construe them in the light most favorable to plaintiffs.see silicon graphics,at.in their second amended complaint,plaintiffs pleaded with sufficient particularity its allegations that america west missed earnings were caused in part by its deferral of maintenance costs and then its later obligation under the settlement agreement to alleviate the problems caused by its unsafe practices.plaintiffs adequately allege that numerous maintenance issues were caused by outsourcing of maintenance,faulty maintenance procedures and practices,inadequate supervision,lack of spare parts and airplanes,and overutilization of airplanes.beyond the million fine,plaintiffs further support their claim by citing to remedial actions taken by america west and statements made by it in the third quarter.
moreover,although the lower than expected earnings may be partially attributable to the labor disputes,other alleged operational problems can not be explained solely by this factor.for example,in its september,announcement regarding its third quarter earnings,america west admitted to unsatisfactory operational performance and described its purchase of parts and airplanes,its hiring of additional maintenance employees,and its increase in the number of maintenance facilities to address the problems it faced.contemporary opinions of analysts indicate the labor issues,the faa presence due to the company safety problems,and operational problems contributed to decreased earnings.although not the sole cause,it appears that the ongoing maintenance issues cited by plaintiffs may have played a substantial role.thus,the district court erred in finding that the existence of other factors,such as the labor disputes,precluded plaintiffs argument that systemic maintenance issues also contributed to america west failure to meet its forecasted third quarter earnings 
c.other arguments 
defendants raise two additional arguments regarding whether plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged omissions,misrepresentations,or an overall scheme.specifically,america west asserts that two of its allegedly misleading statements fall within the safe harbor provisions of the act,while tpg and continental assert that they are not liable because plaintiffs failed to specifically plead their involvement in the alleged fraud.
safe harbor provision 
on appeal,america west contends that two allegedly misleading statements are protected under the safe harbor provisions of the act because they are statements.c a i.the provisions provide that a person shall not be liable for any statement that is identified as such,and is accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the statement.id.a statement is any statement regarding financial projections,plans and objectives of management for future operations,future economic performance,or the assumptions underlying or related to any of these issues.id.i.however,a person may be held liable if the statement is made with actual knowledge that the statement was false or misleading.id.c b.
the two statements for which america west seeks safe harbor protection are the july,america west press release,which disclosed the faa settlement agreement and fine,stating that the settlement agreement provisions will not have a material adverse affect on the company operations or financial results and the july,conference call with analysts,during which goodmanson stated,w e are not anticipating any major increase in maintenance costs or the cost of oversights going forward as a result of the settlement agreement.
we need not reach the questions as to what type of meaningful cautionary statements qualifies for safe harbor under the statute because the statements by america west do not constitute statements.each is a disclosure of the fine imposed by the settlement agreement for past violations of faa regulations and a description of the present effects of their imposition on the company.moreover,even if we were to find them to be,neither statement is accompanied by the requisite meaningful cautionary statement.
if we allow america west to shield itself from liability based on these statements,any corporation could shield itself from future exposure for past misconduct by making statements regarding the misconduct and its effects on the corporation such blanket protection would eviscerate the act altogether.
adequacy of fraud allegations against tpg and continental 
tpg and continental both argue that they are not liable under section b and rule because plaintiffs failed to specifically plead their involvement in the alleged fraud,as required by federal rule civil procedure b and the pslra.both parties also note that they did not make any of the allegedly misleading statements.these arguments are unavailing,however,because both tpg and continental were insiders in the relevant transactions.
section b and rule are not limited to misrepresentations or omissions of material fact.they also make it unlawful for any person directly or indirectly t o employ any device,scheme,or artifice to defraud in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.trading on material,nonpublic information qualifies as a deceptive device under b because a relationship of trust and confidence exists between the shareholders of a corporation and those insiders who have obtained confidential information by reason of their position with that corporation.united states,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted alterations in original holding that a person who trades for personal profit,using confidential information misappropriated in the breach of a fiduciary duty,is guilty of violating section b and rule.individuals or corporations that engage in insider trading can be held liable under section b and rule.see herman maclean huddleston,d.thus,the fact that neither continental or tpg or its officers made any of the allegedly misleading statements does not shield them from liability.
sufficiency of scienter allegations 
plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in concluding that the second amended complaint failed to raise a strong inference of scienter.in this circuit,the required scienter is deliberate or conscious recklessness.silicon graphics,at.mere motive and opportunity are insufficient.id.under silicon graphics and its progeny,we examine all the circumstances in determining whether a strong inference of scienter has been raised.see id.at examining the plaintiff allegations regarding internal reports and stock sales see also in re vantive.sec,cir examining the plaintiffs allegations of misrepresentations,accounting manipulations,stock sales,and corporate transactions.each allegation should be supported by particularized facts and corroborating details.silicon graphics,at.beyond each individual allegation,we also consider whether the total of plaintiffs allegations,even though individually lacking,are sufficient to create a strong inference that defendants acted with deliberate or conscious recklessness.lipton,at.in doing so,we must consider all reasonable inferences to be drawn from the allegations,including inferences unfavorable to the plaintiffs.gompper visx,cir emphasis in original discussing the tension between rule b and the heightened pleading standard set forth under the pslra.
stock sales 
plaintiffs allege that numerous individuals and the two controlling shareholders engaged in massive insider trading during a three month time period.in particular,plaintiffs alleged that four of america west top vice president of public affairs,aramini senior vice president of operations,garel senior vice president of marketing and sales,and carreon vice president and controller and three of america west,fraser,and over shares for over million.plaintiffs also allege that coulter and schifter,both of whom served as officers for tpg and directors for america west,sold shares for over million.in addition,plaintiffs allege that continental sold of its class b stock of its publicly traded stock for almost million,based on insider information.finally,plaintiffs assert that tpg sold shares of its publicly traded class b stock over of its stock for over million,also based on insider information.
the district court concluded that the stock sales by the officers,directors,and controlling shareholders were not suspicious and failed to raise a strong inference of scienter.as to the individuals,the district court found it dispositive that none of the officers or directors outside of aramini who allegedly engaged in insider trading made any of the false or misleading statements.as to the controlling shareholders,the district court found the restrictions imposed by the stockholder agreement rendered the sale unsuspicious.we disagree and find that the allegations raised a strong inference.
u nusual or suspicious stock sales by corporate insiders may constitute circumstantial evidence of scienter silicon graphics,at citation omitted.however,insider stock sales are only suspicious when they are dramatically out of line with prior trading practices at times calculated to maximize the personal benefit from undisclosed inside information.id.quoting in re apple computer sec,cir.among the relevant factors to consider are the amount and percentage of shares sold by insiders the timing of the sales and whether the sales were consistent with the insider prior trading history.id.citing provenz miller,cir.in addition,in determining whether the trading pattern is suspicious,we may consider an insider ability to trade.ronconi,at citation omitted.
before applying these factors to the individual defendants,we note that the district court erred in summarily dismissing plaintiffs argument based solely on the fact that most of the individual officers and directors had not made the alleged misrepresentations or misleading omissions.an insider silence as to the statements is not dispositive.rather,it is merely another factor that should be considered in determining whether a strong inference of scienter has been raised.see vantive,at considering the defendant failure to utter a word as one factor silicon graphics,at.
turning to the relevant factors,the stock sales by individual defendants appear dramatically out of line with their prior trading practices at times calculated to maximize personal benefit from undisclosed inside information.first,the amount and percentage of shares sold by individual insiders was suspicious.most of the individuals sold of their shares,with the lowest percentage being.the proceeds from these sales totaled over million.for each defendant,plaintiffs outlined the individual holdings,his class period sales,when the sales occurred,the percentage of owned shares that were sold,and the total proceeds that were generated from the sale.
although large numbers and percentages do not necessarily create a strong inference of fraud,the numbers and percentages presented by plaintiffs are troubling.vantive,at emphasis added holding that,although a sale of was suspicious,a strong inference was not raised because analysis of the remaining factors did not raise suspicion.
second,the timing of the sales also raises suspicions.unlike other cases where there were timing gaps between the sales or where only one insider did the trading,here all nine of the individuals sales occurred in succession over a three month period when america west officials were making optimistic statements regarding the company financial outlook and reassuring analysts that the settlement agreement would have no economic effect ronconi,at one insider sales do not support the strong inference required by the statute where the rest of the equally knowledgeable insiders act in a way inconsistent with the inference that the favorable characterizations of the company affairs were known to be false when made.equally troubling is the fact that the stocks were sold between to per share,near the stock peak at,and just prior to the stock decline to on august,and subsequent plunge to on september.vantive,at noting that there was no strong inference of scienter when the majority of the shares were sold for per share and the stock price increased for several months,peaking at ronconi,at finding no strong inference when insiders miss ed the boat by selling shares for per share,even though the price ultimately rose to.
third,the prior trading history of each defendant indicates that the sales during the class period was unusual and suspicious.none of the individual defendants sold stocks during the twenty months preceding the ten month class period.see apple computer sec,at examining ten months preceding the ten month class period.nor did they sell for at least four months following the class period.thus,the sudden flurry of massive insider trading over this three month period of time,after an extended period of inactivity,appears unusual.
given the large number and percentages of stocks traded,the timing of the sales,and the prior trading history of each defendant,the stock sales that occurred were clearly calculated to maximize the personal benefit from undisclosed inside information.silicon graphics,at.accordingly,the stock sales by the individual defendants were unusual and suspicious and give rise to a strong inference of scienter.
we next examine the stock sales by the controlling shareholders.the number and percentage of shares sold by them and the timing of the sales were suspicious.plaintiffs allege that tpg sold shares of class b stock over of its class b stock at approximately per share,for proceeds of over million.plaintiffs allege that continental sold shares of class b stock of its class b stock at per share,for proceeds over million.these sales occurred during the same three month period discussed above given the massive volume and the timing of the sales,the first two factors indicate suspicious and unusual trading.
both tpg and continental contend,however,that the sales are consistent with their prior trading history,especially in light of the restrictions provided in the stockholder agreement.our prior decisions have noted that restrictions on an insider ability to trade are important in determining whether the trading pattern is suspicious.ronconi,at.in silicon graphics,we held that one reason that an insider who traded of his holdings had not engaged in suspicious trading was because he was legally forbidden to trade for the period before the alleged insider trading.at emphasis added.similarly,in ronconi,we held that the seven month trading period prior to the class period offered by plaintiffs to prove the defendants pattern of trading does not prove much about their trading habits,since they were not able to trade during some or much of that time under sec regulations.at.
the restriction in this case was clearly less stringent than the prohibitions in silicon graphics and ronconi.the stockholder agreement required that both tpg and continental retain two shares of class b common stock for every share of supervoting class a stock until may.during the restricted period,both companies could have sold their class b stock,as long as they maintained the ratio.in addition,they could have converted their class a stock into class b stock at any point,thus allowing them to sell a greater percentage of stocks prior to the may,expiration of the restriction.unlike silicon graphics or ronconi,neither defendant was legally forbidden from selling stock.thus,the restriction in the stockholder agreement does not meaningfully detract from the strong inference of scienter that arises from the massive stock sales.
tpg and continental argument that they had engaged in stock sales prior to the class period is equally ineffective in undermining the inference of scienter.both tpg and continental argue that their prior sales of class b stock and warrants demonstrate their effort to reduce their equity stake in america west they assert that the sale of almost million shares in may and june were merely part of this continuing effort to protect themselves from exposure.
in response,plaintiffs urge us to limit our review to the ten months prior to the class period,citing to apple computer securities litigation,at,in which we compared sales that occurred during the class period with the sales during the ten months preceding.in light of our prior caselaw,we accept this limitation as appropriate.see vantive,at comparing sales during the nine months preceding the class period.therefore,the only sale relevant to our discussion is tpg warrant sale to america west in march.under this analysis,the prior trading history of tpg and continental indicates that their sales during the class period were suspicious.
however,even without limiting our discussion to the ten months preceding,the sales during the class period appear suspicious.none of the prior sales were comparable to those that occurred during the class period.for example,warrants are merely options,and these warrant sales did not occur on the open market.rather,they occurred in a private transaction with america west.the same concern is borne out in the private sales of class b stock to the underwriters.because none of the previous sales were comparable to those that occurred during the class period,they are less relevant in determining whether the may and june sales were unusual.
viewing the relevant facts in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,tpg and continental sales of stock during the class period appear dramatically out of line with prior trading practices and calculated to maximize the personal benefit from undisclosed insider information,thus supporting a strong inference of scienter.ronconi,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.although it is possible that the controlling shareholders were trying to limit their equity exposure through their sales in may and june,this is a question for the jury,or at least one that should be explored during discovery.
knowledge of ongoing maintenance problems 
in addition to the suspicious sales,one of plaintiffs major contentions is that the individual defendants and controlling shareholders knew of the ongoing maintenance problems and deferred expenses and,thus,knew that the statements to analysts and the public were allegedly false or misleading.in their second amended complaint,plaintiffs allege that the shortfall in the third quarter of was caused by both systemic operational problems and the faa inspection and investigation of america west,which defendants hid from investors through misleading statements and omissions while individual defendants and the controlling shareholders engaged in insider trading.
plaintiffs proffered the following evidence of defendants knowledge of these problems internal reports including the identity of the person who directed the preparation of the reports meetings with the faa including the dates,content,and participants faa letters to america west regarding the ongoing maintenance problems and the agency increasing frustration with the company including the dates,case numbers of the investigations,content,and who they were sent to and the settlement agreement.they also proffer the following evidence that the problem was severe enough that defendants must have been aware of it faa reports regarding the severity of the problems including case numbers of the investigations and content faa letters describing penalties arising from investigations of specific incidents including the dates,case numbers of the investigations,content,and to whom they were sent and charts documenting maintenance difficulties.these charts show the scope and the effects of the deferred maintenance and compare the company performance to that of other major commercial carriers.the charts also compare the number of maintenance labor hours,the rate of maintenance deferred items,hours spent conducting quality assurance,the amount expended on parts inventory,the amount expended on inspection of airplanes,the failed inspection rate,the aircraft utilization rate,the percentage of arrivals,and the number of faa enforcement actions.
as required under the pslra,plaintiffs have set forth adequate corroborating details and facts to support their allegations.silicon graphics,at it is not sufficient for a plaintiff pleadings to set forth a belief that certain unspecified sources will reveal,after appropriate discovery,facts that will validate her claim.viewing the allegations as a whole,we find that they raise a strong inference that defendants knew that the maintenance problems were ongoing and,thus,that the statements made by america west officers were false.
both tpg and continental argue that the second amended complaint fails to allege any facts showing that either company or any of their officers knew about america west maintenance issues or communications with the faa.as to tpg,this argument is without merit.two tpg officers,coulter director and vice president and schifter vice president,served as members of america west board of directors.the board held eleven meetings in,of which coulter and schifter attended and respectively,and the board held nine meetings in.coulter was also a member of the executive committee in and.schifter served as one of the four directors on the compensation committee,which met six times in.in light of these facts and the general allegations set forth above,plaintiffs provide sufficient and particularized factual allegations that tpg and its officers knew about the maintenance and operational problems and the misstatements made by america west officers 
however,the issue of whether plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged scienter as to continental is more troubling.plaintiffs allege that continental held of the class a stock,making it america west second largest shareholder continental,in conjunction with tpg,was able to select nine of the fifteen board directors and three out of the four directors on the compensation committee because of its shareholding power continental and america west shared a special relationship because continental helped america west emerge from bankruptcy continental constantly monitored america west operations by way of conversations and internal reports and the form statement regarding the possibility of influence by controlling shareholders.alone,these facts may be insufficient to raise a strong inference of scienter.however,in light of the large sale of stocks discussed above,we hold that plaintiffs have sufficiently raised a strong inference of deliberate recklessness on the part of continental.accord florida state bd.of admin.green tree fin,cir finding that,in insider trading cases,the timing of trades shows circumstantial evidence of scienter.
knowledge of third quarter shortfall 
another premise of plaintiffs claim is that defendants knew that america west would have to spend millions of dollars by the end of to comply with the july settlement.the district court found that plaintiffs have failed to provide any factual support for this allegation.we disagree.
plaintiffs provide circumstantial evidence that leads to a strong inference of defendants knowledge that the faa fine imposed in the settlement agreement would be costly.plaintiffs cite to certified letters that goodmanson received from the faa for each infraction that occurred during and prior to the settlement agreement.in june,the faa sent a letter to goodmanson,proposing civil penalties of up to million as a result of these investigations.during the settlement negotiations,america west was informed that the maintenance problems caused by the outsourcing had not been solved and that the present problems were extensive.in its briefs,america west admits that it received the faa investigation file with the full incident reports as early as june.these reports indicate that the faa had extensive concerns regarding america west policies,practices,procedures,and the attitude of upper management regarding these concerns.later,america west agreed to settle for a fine of million,the largest faa fine in history.finally,the settlement agreement recognized that organizational changes are required,and that america west needed to devise comprehensive corrective actions for problems discovered.these allegations indicate that defendants were aware that fulfilling its duties under the settlement agreement would be extremely costly.
motive of america west officers 
one of the district court overall concerns with plaintiffs allegations was that the america west officers who made the alleged misstatements were not the same persons who engaged in insider trading.thus,the district court found it illogical that they would make deliberately misleading statements.we disagree.
scienter can be established even if the officers who made the misleading statements did not sell stock during the class period.hanon dataprods,cir provenz,at finding a genuine issue of material fact regarding the scienter of an individual defendant who made many allegedly false and misleading statements,even though he sold a minimal number of shares.in other words,the lack of stock sales by a defendant is not dispositive as to scienter.
although franke,goodmanson,and parker the america west officers who made the alleged misstatements did not engage in insider trading,a strong inference of scienter can be inferred from plaintiffs allegations.plaintiffs assert that franke,goodmanson,and parker were motivated to inflate america west financial results and stock prices because their eligibility for stock options and executive bonuses were based principally on the company financial performance.none of the executive officers received options awards in for the previous year.in contrast,america west awarded franke options in february and america west awarded options to goodmanson,options to parker,and options to garel in march in addition,the compensation committee three out of four of whose members were chosen by tpg and continental reviewed all aspects of compensation and promotion of the officers who made the alleged misrepresentations.as controlling shareholders,tpg and continental could easily choose three of its four members.in fact,as aforementioned,tpg vice president schifter was a member of the compensation committee.although generalized assertions of motive,without more,are inadequate to meet the heightened pleading requirements of silicon graphics,plaintiffs have provided specific,particularized allegations.lipton,at.
plaintiffs also offer one other possible motive,which we find insufficient to establish scienter.they argue that franke,goodmanson,and parker all knew that america west would become much less profitable once it complied with the faa mandated requirements and settlement agreement.thus,they contend that the officers planned to sell the troubled airline and reap a multimillion dollar windfall under the change in control provisions of their employment contracts and incentive compensation plans.the change in control provisions would have allowed franke,goodmanson,and parker to be paid over million.in support of this allegation,plaintiffs proffer evidence that,in january,america west had been contacted by several airlines,including united airlines,regarding the possibility of merger or creation of alliances.the district court summarily rejected this golden parachute argument.we also reject this argument because the allegations are too generalized to establish scienter.
plaintiffs allegations as a whole 
in sum,although recognizing that some of plaintiffs allegations are individually lacking,we hold that the allegations in their totality are sufficient to meet the stringent pleading standard set forth in the plsra.thus,the district court erred in dismissing plaintiffs claim under section b and rule.
defendants tpg and continental assert that they are not liable as controlling persons under section a.a.section a provides joint and several liability for controlling persons who aid and abet violations of the act absent a finding of good faith and lack of inducement 
in order to prove a prima facie case under section a,a plaintiff must prove a primary violation of federal securities law and that the defendant exercised actual power or control over the primary violator.howard everex,cir.i n order to make out a prima facie case,it is not necessary to show actual participation or the exercise of power however,a defendant is entitled to a good faith defense if he can show no scienter and an effective lack of participation.id.
whether the defendant is a controlling person is an intensely factual question,involving scrutiny of the defendant participation in the affairs of the corporation and the defendant power to control corporate actions.id.alterations in original quoting kaplan rose,cir.control is defined in the regulations as the possession,direct or indirect,of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person,whether through the ownership of voting securities,by contract,or otherwise.emphasis added.
defendants argue that plaintiffs can not meet the prima facie showing that the tpg and continental are controlling persons under section a.our prior cases suggest otherwise.in paracor finance,general electric capital,cir,we held that a lender in a leveraged buyout transaction was not a controlling person because none of the traditional indicia of control,such as having a prior lending relationship,owning stock in the target company,or having a seat on the board,were present.id.at affirming grant of summary judgment for the lender.in the present case,all three of these indicia of control are present.id.first,tpg and continental had a shareholder relationship with america west,which began in.second,tpg and continental were the largest stockholders of america west,controlling approximately of the total voting power.third,they had the power to elect the majority of the members of america west board of directors and committees established by the board.in addition,they had some of their own officers seated on america west board of directors.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,plaintiffs have established a prima facie showing that tpg and continental were controlling persons under section a pursuant to analysis in paracor.
conclusion 
securities fraud class actions are not all good or all bad.in a large public securities market,dishonest insiders may be able to cover their tracks fairly well,and falsely claim to be as surprised as the ribbon clerks,when they take the market for a ride.unless reasonable inferences from circumstances suffice to get a case to a jury,the welfare of victimized investors and the integrity of the stock market may be insufficiently protected from deceptive manipulators.
ronconi,at.in this era of corporate scandal,when insiders manipulate the market with the complicity of lawyers and accountants,we are cautious not to raise the bar of the pslra any higher than that which is required under its mandates.the district court failure to accept plaintiffs allegations as true and construe them in the light most favorable to plaintiffs does just that.the district court erred in finding that plaintiffs second amended complaint failed to raise a strong inference that defendants made false or misleading statements with actual knowledge or deliberate recklessness.we hold that plaintiffs sufficiently pleaded a securities fraud claim under section b and rule and established a prima facie showing that tpg and continental are controlling persons under section a.
reversed and remanded.
the private securities litigation reform act reform act imposes strict requirements on plaintiffs pleading securities fraud claims.these include obligations to plead that a defendant made an untrue statement of material fact specify each statement alleged to have been misleading and the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading and state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b.i respectfully dissent from the majority ruling that the plaintiffs complaint has met these stringent standards.
the majority critically errs by swiftly dismissing the key fact that the revelations of the maintenance problems and faa settlement had no significant effect on america west stock price.
on june,america west stock closed at.the wall street journal first reported on june,that the faa was contemplating penalties against america west for its failures in supervising maintenance contractors.this was the first public disclosure of this information.that day,america west stock rose to close at.
the next disclosure of purported material information occurred on july.that day,america west announced that it had reached a compromise with the faa paying the faa million in fines.after this disclosure,america west stock closed at,higher than the previous day closing price of.
the last disclosure of allegedly material information occurred on july,when air safety week published key provisions of the settlement agreement between the faa and america west.america west stock closed down,from on july to on july.
the market collective yawn to the allegedly material news is fatal to plaintiffs ability to successfully establish the reliance element of their cause of action when their complaint is founded upon a theory.the majority analysis is contrary to what the supreme court and our sister circuits have said in similar cases.
in basic levinson,d,the supreme court adopted for section b and rule claims,the materiality standard articulated in tsc industries,northway,d.under basic,an omitted fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.at.internal quotation marks omitted.
basic also considered another required element of a securities fraud claim reliance.the supreme court adopted the rebuttable presumption created by the theory.id.at.the premise of this theory is that in a modern and efficient securities market,the market price of a stock incorporates all available public information.id.at.therefore,any person who trades shares relies on the integrity of the market price.id.at.because of this,the supreme court created a rebuttable presumption of reliance by plaintiffs who traded stock while that stock price reflected inaccurate information.id.at.basic cited with approval the test laid out by the sixth circuit 
i n order to invoke the presumption,a plaintiff must allege and prove that the defendant made public misrepresentations that the misrepresentations were material that the shares were traded on an efficient market that the misrepresentation would induce a reasonable,relying investor to misjudge the value of the shares and that the plaintiff traded the shares between the time the misrepresentations were made and the time the truth was revealed 
given today decision regarding the definition of materiality as to preliminary merger discussions,elements and may collapse into one.
id.at.emphasis added and citation omitted.the sixth circuit test contemplates that,to invoke the theory,a reasonable investor would have misjudged the value of the shares.how a reasonable investor would judge a stock value based on misinformation collapse s into the reasonable investor standard for materiality.they are not separate and unrelated concepts in securities law.though basic refused in the context to formulate tests for materiality,the supreme court obviously understood the relationships between materiality,reliance,market value,and market price.
these relationships have not been ignored by our sister circuits.the third circuit has held that in an efficient market,the concept of materiality translates into information that alters the price of the firm stock.in re burlington coat factory sec,cir.the third circuit observed that since efficient markets are those in which information important to reasonable investors is immediately incorporated into stock prices,information not important to reasonable investors will have a negligible effect on the stock price.see also oran stafford,cir following burlington and holding that when a stock is traded in an efficient market,the materiality of disclosed information may be measured post hoc by looking to the movement,in the period immediately following disclosure,of the price of the firm stock.
the fifth following the analysis in elaborated that the third circuit requirement that the misrepresentation affect the stock price is more properly rooted in the reliance element of stock fraud than the materiality element.nathenson zonagen,cir.though grounded in reliance,the fifth circuit still requires a showing that the misrepresentation affected a stock price in cases.abc arbitrage plaintiffs group tchuruk,cir.
the first circuit,also recognizing that basic employed the theory only for reliance,has nonetheless found that in such cases the failure of the market to react to previously undisclosed information also controls the materiality inquiry 
this presumption of investor reliance on the integrity of stock prices has the primary effect of obviating the need for plaintiff purchasers to plead individual reliance.but by its underlying rationale,the presumption also shifts the critical focus of the materiality inquiry.in a case the hypothetical reasonable investor,by reference to whom materiality is gauged,must be the market itself,because it is the market,not any single investor,that determines the price of a publicly traded security.
shaw digital equipment,cir.
these cases are instructive.the fifth circuit placement of the stock price in the context of reliance more faithfully follows the supreme court decision in basic.indeed,the theory is premised on the fact that a misrepresentation has affected the stock price incongruently to the stock true value.at.only then is detrimental reliance presumed because a plaintiff traded stock relying on the integrity of the market price.but if information later revealed does not significantly affect a stock price,it follows that there was no difference between the stock price and the stock true value at the time of the misrepresentation.there is then no reliance causing injury.under these circumstances,as the fifth circuit has held,the failure of newly released information to change stock prices prevents recovery for plaintiffs in a case.nathenson,at.
stock price lack also relevant to the determination of materiality.as the first and third circuits have recognized,the fact that a stock price does or does not change is interconnected with the materiality analysis in cases.the basic materiality test asks what a reasonable investor would consider significant the market demonstrates the reactions of reasonable investors.at a minimum,the static or dynamic nature of a stock price after the disclosure of previously withheld information is strong evidence of how reasonable investors view the significance of the information.
to successfully plead a securities fraud claim under the theory,a plaintiff must establish that a defendant made a material misrepresentation of fact which affected a stock market price and the plaintiff detrimentally traded the stock during the period in which the stock price reflected the material misrepresentation.evidence of whether a stock price significantly changes following the disclosure of alleged previously misrepresented facts is relevant to two required elements in stock fraud causes of action.in cases,the failure of a stock price to significantly change following disclosure eliminates the reliance presumption.nathenson,at see also basic,at.unless other facts supporting reliance are pled,a claim relying on the presumption fails unless the stock price reacts to the information when it is finally disclosed.
no significant change in the stock price is also strong evidence that the information was immaterial.conversely,the fact that a firm stock price does significantly change is strong evidence of materiality.in re apple computer sec,cir dramatic stock price movements in response to an optimistic statement would provide a strong indication that the statement itself was material.
the district court was right to dismiss the complaint before us.there is no question that plaintiffs relied on the theory to establish reliance.the plaintiffs allege in their complaint that america west stock is traded in an efficient market on the new york stock exchange and that class members were damaged because i n reliance on the integrity of the market,they paid artificially inflated prices for america west stock.emphasis added.there is simply no dispute that,following the public disclosure of the information that is now alleged to have been withheld,america west stock price did not significantly move in reaction to the news.
the plaintiffs complaint fails to plead sufficient facts establishing both reliance and materiality.regarding the reliance element,the plaintiffs here can not invoke the theory since the information america west allegedly withheld did not affect america west stock price when it was revealed to the market.the plaintiffs suffered no detrimental reliance since the alleged misrepresentations did not skew the stock price in relation to the stock true value.the plaintiffs have not alleged any other theory of reliance other than the theory.therefore,their claims fail as a matter of law.
similarly,the fact that the stock price did not significantly change undermines the plaintiffs allegation that the misrepresentations were material.examining how the mark
