this appeal represents the culmination of a protracted condemnation proceeding the length of which calls dickens bleak house to mind.detroit international bridge company dibco appeals from a jury verdict that determined the value of two parcels of land owned by the company and located near the ambassador bridge,which connects detroit to windsor,canada.in,the general services administration gsa,acting on behalf of the customs service,initiated a condemnation action.the crux of this appeal involves a dispute over the proper method of valuing the property at issue,as well as the amount of interest owing on the judgment.
as one might expect,a quarter century of litigation has spawned a number of related judicial opinions.although the history of this case is extensive,for our purposes the facts as summarized by the district court in provide a good starting point 
defendant dibc o owns the ambassador bridge connecting the united states with canada,as well as the current bridge plaza on the side.the plaza,which was built in,is incapable of handling the heavy traffic load.it is particularly congested because customs requires approximately percent of the trucks crossing the bridge to submit to a secondary inspection.this means that these trucks must pull over and park.prior to the condemnation of the land in question,trucks were required to park on the present plaza to await secondary inspection,causing traffic congestion,long waits,and dangerous conditions.
united states certain land situated in the city of detroit.gsa sought to obtain three parcels of land located near the bridge through eminent domain.id.dibco owned two of the parcels,which it had acquired in the with an eye towards alleviating bridge congestion the larger of the parcels,which it purchased for million,had housed a truck terminal used by the previous owner,corporation.
before purchasing the overland parcel,dibco informed gsa of its intentions,and the agency responded favorably on behalf of the customs service,which contemplated leasing space on the property to carry out secondary inspections.after negotiations between dibco and gsa broke down,however,gsa filed a declaration of taking in and took possession of the property in,even though it did not move secondary inspections there until.
initially,gsa valued the two parcels at,which dibco points out was less than it had paid to acquire the larger parcel three years earlier.in any event,the district court ordered that amount deposited with the clerk of court when gsa assumed control over the property that sum was paid to dibco in february.since then,the company has sought further compensation through litigation and its attendant settlement negotiations.an opinion of this court issued three years ago picks up the story 
in,the united states and dibco agreed to settle the condemnation proceeding.they agreed to a memorandum of agreement moa under which the united states agreed to enlarge the scope of its expansion and condemn third party property,including the totality of a lot owned by commodities export and walter lubienski commodities.dibco agreed to compensate the united states for the costs of condemnation.dibco claims that the moa gave it the right to be consulted regarding the costs of condemnation,and that it only required dibco to pay condemnation costs that were reasonable in light of federal regulations.
in,the united states brought a condemnation action against commodities.dibco counsel was in attendance at conferences in that action at which the united states indicated that it would not seek to condemn the entirety of commodities land.dibco regarded the failure to condemn all of commodities land as a breach of the moa,but it did not seek to intervene in this condemnation proceeding.instead,dibco sought to reopen the condemnation action on the grounds that the moa had been breached.the action went to trial,and on february,a jury awarded dibco nearly million in compensation for its land.
united states certain land situated in the city of detroit,cir.
as indicated above,the suit that has generated this appeal was tried to a jury in.in addition to the trial itself,the district court issued two opinions that are at the heart of this appeal.the first,united states certain land situated in the city of detroit,d,memorialized the court ruling on contested motions issues,including theories of valuation the second,united states certain land situated in the city of detroit,d,concerned the amount of interest due on the judgment.
the jury returned a verdict awarding dibco,which the company contends is inadequate.after the verdict,the parties disagreed upon the amount of interest owed to dibco on the difference between the jury award and the amount that the united states had paid in the course of the litigation.the district court held that the proper calculation of the interest owed on the deficiency is based upon the declaration of taking act,the united states then deposited with the district court clerk to fulfill the judgment.this appeal followed.
did the district court err in limiting the theories that the jury could consider when calculating its compensation award 
because it has been long settled that there is no constitutional right to a jury in eminent domain proceedings,it is not the seventh amendment but rule of civil procedure that controls how the district court resolves claims like the one before us.united states reynolds,d.rule h provides for a trial by jury of the issue of just compensation under certain conditions except for just compensation,however,t rial of all issues shall otherwise be by the court.the court in reynolds construed the scope of the jury power as follows 
w e think the rule basic structure makes clear that a jury in federal condemnation proceedings is to be confined to the performance of a single narrow but important determination of a compensation award within ground rules established by the trial judge w hen a jury is afforded,the sweeping language of the final sentence of the rule discloses a clear intent to give the district judge a role in condemnation proceedings much broader than he occupies in a conventional jury trial.it is for him to decide all issues other than the precise issue of the amount of compensation to be awarded.it follows that it is for the judge to tell the jury the criteria it must follow in determining what amounts will constitute just compensation,and that in order to do so he must decide the issue as a preliminary matter.
reynolds,at.the issue in reynolds concerned whether certain lands condemned by the government were within the original scope of the project the construction of a reservoir.id.at.although the property owners argued that the scope of the project presented a jury question,the court held otherwise.id.at.
analogously,dibco takes the position that the condemned property effectively constituted part of the ambassador bridge.if viewed in this light,then the condemnation represents a partial taking,justifying severance damages.as set out below,the district court elected to exclude certain valuation evidence that dibco introduced from consideration by the jury.the company takes issue with the following reasoning of the district court 
dibco seeks to offer evidence of lost profits allegedly suffered by the bridge the diminution in the value of its property after the taking,the difference between the before and after taking value of the bridge and the adjacent taken property contending that the highest and best use of the condemned parcel of property adjacent to the bridge is its use as part of the ambassador bridge.in support of its position regarding severance damages and diminution of value,dibco relies principally upon united states acres,more or less in keeler township,van buren county,contending that the relevant facts of this action are identical to those in the van buren county case.
in van buren county,the government took in fee a small part of one parcel of defendant property and an easement over a substantial part of the remainder of that parcel.the property was used for farming,specifically for growing corn.the parcel had a central pivot irrigation system
