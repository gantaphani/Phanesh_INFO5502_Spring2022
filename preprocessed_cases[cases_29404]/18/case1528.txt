introduction 
in and,respondents driver,a partnership,and driver,a corporation collectively,driver constructed an apartment building in orange county for huntington breakers apartments,a limited partnership hbal.at the time,appellant joseph mayer iii mayer was a general partner of hbal,and appellant eleanor mayer,his wife mayer,was a limited partner.in driver stopped work and sued hbal and mayer individually as general partner for payment of money due and foreclosure of a mechanic lien the driver action.hbal,the mayers,and other partners for construction defects.in hbal assigned its rights in the lawsuit the then pending driver action and all successor and replacement actions and suits to the individual partners,but in the same document those individual partners appointed another entity,huntington breakers managing partnership hbmp,irrevocably and coupled with an interest,as their having authority to take all actions in connection with the lawsuit.
the dispute was submitted to arbitration under the terms of the construction contract.driver obtained an award against hbal and mayer as general partner hbal,through hbmp,settled with driver over mayer objection the mayers attempted to continue prosecuting their in the driver action in their own names.ultimately,driver obtained a judgment against hbal and mayer as general partner consistent with the settlement agreement and a judgment against the mayers on their in the driver action.
in the mayers as individuals filed the present action,purportedly as assignees of hbal,for latent construction defects discovered in the preceding three years,against driver and others.by nonjury bifurcated trial on driver affirmative defense,the court found that the mayers have no standing to bring the present action.the court found the mayers have no standing as partners of hbal,they did not prove an oral assignment,and although the present action is a successor and replacement action within the meaning of the assignment of hbal interest in the driver action,the mayers are bound by their appointment of hbmp,irrevocably and coupled with an interest,as their for the purpose of pursuing or not pursuing this action.
the mayers appeal from the judgment.relying on the assignment to them of hbal interests in the driver action and successor actions,they contend that the present action is a successor and replacement action to the driver action,but that their appointment of hbmp as their was not binding.they assert that the appointment was not irrevocable or coupled with an interest,or that they revoked this appointment,or that they have standing even if bringing the present action violated their agreement to such appointment.they also contend they have standing independent of the assignment.driver from orders denying driver motions to change one of the findings in the statement of decision and for an award of contractual attorney fees.driver contends the trial court should have found the present action is not a successor to the driver action,or,if the present action is a successor action,the court should have awarded driver contractual attorney fees.
we affirm the judgment.the present action is not a successor and replacement of the driver action.although the trial court erroneously concluded it is a successor action,the trial court reached the correct result that the mayers lack standing under the assignment or any other basis therefore,the trial court judgment will be affirmed.the trial court also reached the correct conclusion driver is not entitled to attorney fees in the present action.
factual and procedural background 
hbal was formed in for the purpose of developing real property.the general partners were mayer and wilmore city development,a corporation,of which steven semingson was president.the limited partners were mayer,rose marie semingson,and daniel young.
in may,hbal contracted with driver for construction of a apartment complex.a certain guarantee and indemnity agreement in favor of driver was executed by mayer,steven semingson,and daniel young,each individually and on behalf of hbal,and by mayer and rose marie semingson,each individually.
in august,a first amended and restated agreement of limited partnership added a new limited partner,pacifica,reformulated the percentage interests of various partners,and named hbmp to function as the managing general partner hbmp as managing general partner had exclusive control of the business affairs of the partnership and exclusive rights and powers of a general partner.hbmp obtained a percent ownership interest.
in october driver filed a mechanic lien claim,and in december filed the driver action,a complaint against hbal and its partners and guarantors to foreclose a mechanic lien and to compel arbitration pursuant to the arbitration agreement in the construction contract.hbal and its partners and guarantors filed a,essentially for breach of contract and defective construction.the driver action was in arbitration between march and october.the arbitration award was in favor of driver on its claim and against the.
during proceedings to confirm the arbitration award,a settlement was reached by parties other than the mayers,in which driver would obtain judgment against hbal,and the others would dismiss their in the driver action.hbmp agreed to the settlement over mayer dissenting vote.driver moved to enforce the settlement agreement and obtained judgment thereon in december.the mayers refused to dismiss their in the driver action,and in august the orange county superior court ordered summary judgment in favor of driver on the as to the mayers.the mayers appealed the judgments enforcing the settlement agreement and against them on their.ultimately,in june,these judgments were affirmed on appeal by the court of appeal for the fourth appellate district,division three.
while the driver action was in arbitration,hbal was reorganized in order to bring in capital and a new partner,the august fund viii august,pursuant to the second amended and restated agreement of limited partnership of december.august became the managing general partner with exclusive control of the affairs of hbal.august did not wish to become involved in the driver action.to meet august requirements,an assignment of hbal interest in the driver action was concurrently executed on december.this is the assignment on which the mayers primarily rely on this appeal.
the december,assignment provides as follows the assignment is by hbal as assignor,to the following assignees wilmore city development,mayer,mayer,rose marie semingson,hbmp,and daniel young.it recites,assignor hbal is a party to that certain legal action the lawsuit described as driver huntington breakers apartments,et,orange county superior court,american association a rbitration,and all successor and replacement actions and suits,and august is negotiating to purchase a general partnership interest in assignor,and assignor and assignee desire to enter into this assignment to provide for the transfer of all of assignor right,title and interest in and to the lawsuit prior to the admission of august to assignor.therefore,for valuable consideration,assignor hereby assigns,transfers and conveys to assignee all of assignor right,title and interest in and to the lawsuit,with each assignee receiving designated percentages of undivided interest in the lawsuit.the parties acknowledge and agree that the lawsuit may be a liability or an asset and that assignor makes no representations as to the value of the lawsuit.in consideration of such assignment,assignee s and each of the persons constituting assignee,jointly and severally agree to indemnify,defend,protect and hold assignor and august harmless from and against any and all losses,damages,claims,obligations,liabilities and expenses and all actions,proceedings,judgments and attorneys fees incident thereto arising from or relating to the lawsuit,the mechanics liens and any other claims which form the basis thereof,and the obligations of assignor under this assignment.each assignee hereby irrevocably appoints and constitutes hbmp as its true and lawful in connection with the lawsuit,in his,her,or its name,place and stead to take all actions that said deems necessary,desirable or appropriate in connection with the lawsuit,including but not limited to the right to settle or compromise the lawsuit or the issues contained therein.it is expressly intended by each assignee that this appointment is irrevocable and coupled with an interest.
in may,the mayers in propria persona filed the present action.in their original complaint they alleged that hbal assigned its rights regarding this action to plaintiffs as reflected in the assignment dated december,which was attached as an exhibit.they alleged they had revoked the provision of that assignment.after a demurrer and after obtaining counsel,they alleged,in the operative second amended complaint,only generally that hbal assigned to plaintiffs all its rights and interest with respect to the claims being set forth herein.
the mayers sued driver and numerous other contractors or subcontractors involved in construction of the huntington breakers apartment project in a first cause of action for strict liability,the mayers alleged that within the past three years,they discovered the project has certain designated construction defects,not previously known or apparent by reasonable inspection.a second cause of action asserted negligence.the third and fourth causes of action alleged breach of implied warranty of merchantability and fitness.a fifth cause of action asserted the mayers suffered emotional distress as a result of these deficiencies.
the trial court conducted a bifurcated nonjury trial on the issue of the mayers standing to bring this action.the parties submitted original and supplemental trial briefs on the standing issue.the mayers asserted mayer as a general partner of hbal had a personal stake in the action sufficient to support standing,hbal assigned its rights to them as individuals in the assignment,and the appointment of hbmp as was not irrevocable or did not defeat their standing,and the current managing general partner of hbal orally assigned the causes of action to the mayers.driver contended the mayers have no standing as individuals to assert rights of hbal,the appointment of hbmp as in the assignment was irrevocable,and there was no oral assignment.
after conducting a trial upon testimonial and documentary evidence,the trial court issued a tentative statement of decision finding that the mayers have no standing as partners or based on their stake in the litigation,the mayers did not prove an oral assignment,and although this lawsuit qualifies as a successor and replacement action and therefore was assigned to the mayers in the written assignment,the mayers can not revoke their appointment of hbmp as their having the controlling authority to decide whether or not to bring this action.
after the trial court directed driver to prepare a proposed statement of decision,driver proposed language that even assuming that this action is somehow a successor and replacement action to the driver lawsuit and arbitration,the mayers lack standing because of the irrevocable appointment of hbmp as.the mayers objected that this did not reflect what the court had actually decided.the court did not adopt driver proposed statement of decision but rather adopted its tentative statement as its statement of decision.
after the mayers moved for a new trial,driver moved the court pursuant to code of civil procedure section to change its statement of decision and find that this action is not a successor and replacement action within the meaning of the assignment.driver also moved to be awarded attorney fees,based on the guarantee executed by the mayers.after receiving opposition by the mayers,the court denied driver motions to change the statement of decision and to award contractual attorney fees.
the mayers appeal from the judgment.driver appeals from the postjudgment orders denying the motion to change the statement of decision and denying attorney fees.
the mayers appeal 
the mayers lack standing under the assignment,because the present action is not a successor and replacement of the driver action 
the mayers argued,and the trial court agreed,that the present action is a successor and replacement action within the meaning of the assignment,and therefore the right to bring it was assigned to the mayers and other assignees in that document.on their appeal the mayers argue the trial court thereafter erred by concluding the mayers appointment,in the same document,of hbmp as their precluded their standing.
driver contends the initial premise in the mayers argument is wrong driver contends the present action is not a successor and replacement of the driver action,thus the assignment does not apply,and therefore the mayers have no standing as assignees under the assignment,aside from the irrevocable appointment issue.even without having regarding the trial court statement of decision on this issue,driver could properly raise this argument in its capacity as respondent on the mayers appeal in response to the mayers appeal driver may and does show the trial court reached the right result judgment against the mayers even if on the wrong theory.code civ,witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.
this issue involves interpretation of written documents.unless resolution depends on the credibility of conflicting extrinsic evidence,the interpretation of a writing involves a question of law for de novo review by the appellate court.parsons bristol development cal d.we exercise our de novo review,rather than substantial evidence review,because the mayers fail to show the trial court decision was based on credibility of conflicting extrinsic evidence.appleton waessil th,d.the trial court statement of decision recites that it is based on undisputed facts.
the present action is to recover damages for latent defects in the apartment project construction that,according to the mayers own allegations,were first discovered in the period immediately preceding filing and were not previously known or apparent upon reasonable inspection.the right to recover for such defects,absent assignment,would naturally be held by the owner of the project,the hbal partnership.
the mayers contend,however,that the right to recover for such defects was assigned by hbal in the assignment.what was assigned in the assignment is determined primarily by its language and also by the surrounding circumstances.the assignment assigned hbal right,title and interest in and to the lawsuit.the lawsuit was defined as that certain legal action identified by its title,driver huntington breakers apartments,et,and its superior court and arbitration numbers,and all successor and replacement actions and suits.
at the time,the driver action was a known piece of litigation that had been ordered into arbitration.the assignor and assignees knew or were bound to know the claims asserted on both sides.the present case,on the other hand,involves construction defects that were unknown at the time of the assignment and not apparent by reasonable inspection.the mayers would interpret the assignment as if hbal had assigned to the individual assignees all causes of action that hbal had or might have in the future,known and unknown,so long as they arose from the construction of the project.there is no such language in the assignment itself.there is only a reference to successor and replacement actions and suits in the definition of the lawsuit.
the mayers argument that this action is a successor and replacement action merely because it also arises from the initial construction of the project unduly stretches the ordinary meaning of successor and replacement actions and suits.a successor is one who takes the place that another has left,and sustains the like part or character.perez sutter partners d,fn,italics omitted black law dictionary ed.replace means to supplant with a substitute or equivalent.black law,supra.the present action does not replace the driver action nor does it partake of the same character.the present action does not succeed or take the place of the driver action,because the driver action specifically identified in the assignment was still pending on appeal by the mayers from jud
