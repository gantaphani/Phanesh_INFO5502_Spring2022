facts and prior proceedings 
the metcalfs and wernerdal formed adbox in.the metcalfs agreed to pay the company expenses until it became,and wernerdal agreed to run the business as a salaried employee.the metcalfs and wernerdal jointly operated the business under this arrangement until,when they decided to separate.the parties agreed that wernerdal would become the sole owner of adbox and that the metcalfs would receive as the purchase price for their interest in adbox,and for the performance of certain consulting services.
wernerdal then took control of adbox,but instead of paying the metcalfs the full amount due under their agreements,wernerdal and adbox sued the metcalfs in los angeles superior court alleging usury and seeking a declaratory judgment that the consulting agreement was unenforceable.after a bench trial,the court found that the consulting agreement was valid and enforceable,but that it only entitled the metcalfs to,rather than the originally claimed.the court also found unenforceable the provision of the agreement entitling the metcalfs to attorney fees as the prevailing party in the litigation.wernerdal paid the metcalfs the purchase price during the course of the litigation,and adbox paid the required after the trial court ruling.all parties appealed.
in may,the state appellate court reversed the trial court on the amount adbox to pay the full originally the attorney fees provision enforceable,and remanded for a determination of fees and costs.on remand,the trial court ordered adbox to pay the metcalfs in attorney fees and costs.
adbox did not have sufficient funds to pay the difference between the original and modified judgment with to pay the attorney fees owed.about that time,wernerdal sought an loan from ulf ernetoft of accenta display corporation,a canadian company interested in adbox business.accenta agreed to make the requested loan and deposited in wernerdal personal account on june.two days later,robin the in adbox general account.also on june,accenta made a separate payment of to adbox.
on june,adbox paid its debt to the metcalfs in a series of transactions.specifically,it wired the precise amount outstanding under the consulting agreement to its attorney who,in turn,sent the same amount to the metcalfs along with a letter explaining that the money was in satisfaction of the decision of the court of appeals,including the amount of,plus interest.adbox did not,however,pay the attorney fees award.
on september,than days after the payment to the caused adbox to file for bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code in the central district of california.appellee jeffrey golden was appointed trustee of the adbox bankruptcy estate.in his capacity as trustee,golden filed a preference action under and a to recover the that adbox had paid to the metcalfs.in response,the metcalfs filed a counterclaim against golden alleging that adbox conduct prior to filing for bankruptcy constituted tortious interference with prospective economic advantage,violation of california civil code,and conspiracy to do so.golden moved to dismiss the counterclaim and later moved for summary judgment in the preference action.after a hearing on golden motion to dismiss the counterclaim,the bankruptcy court construed it as a motion for summary judgment and granted it.after a separate hearing on golden motion for summary judgment in the preference action,the bankruptcy court granted that motion as well.

discussion 
dismissal of the counterclaim 
federal rule of bankruptcy procedure and federal rule of civil procedure govern the propriety of counterclaims in a bankruptcy context.according to rule 
rule applies in adversary proceedings,except that a party sued by a trustee or debtor in possession need not state as a counterclaim any claim that the party has against the debtor,the debtor property,or the estate,unless the claim arose after the entry of an order for relief.
a counterclaim under rule must be against an opposing party.a,b.thus,a party sued by a trustee may assert a counterclaim against that trustee,but only if the trustee is an opposing party within the meaning of rule.
it is that when a party sues in his representative capacity,he is not subject to counterclaims against him in his individual capacity.see pioche mines,trust,cir,cert.denied.recognizing the rule that a counterclaim against a trustee in his individual capacity,where he has sued as a fiduciary only,is not permissible inasmuch as it is not a counterclaim against an opposing party,as contemplated by rule see also charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure ed bender williamsport area sch,d acts performed by the same person in two different capacities are generally treated as the transactions of two different legal personages.quoting james hazard,civil procedure ed internal quotation marks omitted.
the question presented here,however,is whether the trustee is an opposing party when he has brought a preference action that belongs to the bankruptcy estate and not to the debtor,but the counterclaim alleges causes of action that could have been brought against the debtor prior to its bankruptcy filing.we hold that he is not.the metcalfs styled their counterclaim as against golden in his capacity as chapter trustee for the estate of adbox,but their allegations concerned the conduct of wernerdal and adbox prior to adbox bankruptcy filing.while the metcalfs presumably sought to recover from adbox assets in bankruptcy,the trustee would have to stand in the shoes of the debtor to defend against the counterclaim.this would be a representative capacity different from the representative capacity in which a trustee brings a preference action,because a preference action belongs specifically to the bankruptcy trustee and could not have been brought by the debtor prior to its bankruptcy filing.moreover,if the metcalfs allegations are correct,and adbox did transfer assets in order to shield them from its creditors,then it was the trustee duty to represent the interests of all creditors to the adbox estate including the metcalfs interest by recovering those assets through a fraudulent transfer action under.in his preference action,however,the trustee was not representing all of the creditors interests,but rather the interests of all of the creditors other than the metcalfs.therefore,under the allegations of the metcalfs counterclaim,the trustee was not an opposing party within the meaning of rule and the counterclaim was properly dismissed 
ii.the motion for summary judgment in the preference action 
under the bankruptcy trustee may recover certain transfers made by the debtor within days before filing for bankr
