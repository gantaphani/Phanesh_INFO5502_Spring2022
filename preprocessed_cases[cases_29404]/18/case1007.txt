we consider whether plaintiffs adequately pled a claim of securities that is much harder now than in days gone by.
plaintiffs bought stock in applied signal technology,during the six months before the company revealed that its revenue had fallen from the preceding quarter.immediately following this disclosure,the stock price dropped.plaintiffs sued the company and two of its officers under securities exchange act b,b,and rule.
applied signal customers are almost all agencies of the federal government.two civilian agencies together account for of the company revenue military agencies account for most of the rest.according to plaintiffs,these government customers can,at any time and for any reason,order the company to stop working on existing contracts for up to days.compl.see a model contract provision id.b agencies may use this provision.the company only gets paid for work it actually performs,so when the government issues a order,applied signal immediately ceases to earn money.and,because stopped work often is eventually cancelled altogether,a order signals a heightened risk that the company never will earn the money.see compl.a after issuing a order,agencies may unilaterally modify or cancel the contract.according to plaintiffs,the precipitous drop in applied signal revenue was caused by four orders the company received,which halted tens of millions of dollars of work it had contracted to do.investors were surprised by the drop in revenue,plaintiffs claim,because applied signal continued to count the stopped work as part of its backlog a term the company defines as the dollar value of the work it has contracted to do but has yet performed.plaintiffs claim that the company backlog reports misled them into believing that applied signal was likely to perform work that,in reality,had been halted and was likely to be lost forever.
the district court dismissed the complaint on several grounds and plaintiffs,naturally,appeal.
we first consider whether plaintiffs have pled with sufficient particularity the existence,content and effect of the orders.we then discuss whether defendants alleged practice of counting stopped work as backlog was misleading,before weighing plaintiffs allegations of scienter and loss causation.finally,we ponder whether the backlog reports are immune from liability as statements.
b and the requirement of particularity 
defendants claim that plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to show that the company ever received three of the four orders,or that these orders halted any work that was later reported as backlog,and that plaintiffs therefore have pled with particularity the reasons why the backlog figures were misleading.b.b.
but the complaint identifies four confidential witnesses who worked for applied signal and who allegedly will testify to the existence and effect of the orders.defendants quibble that these witnesses were in a position to see the orders because they were engineers or technical editors rather than managers.but any number of company employees would be in a position to infer the issuance of orders,which would have had the very obvious effect of putting numerous employees out of work.it entirely plausible that engineers or technical editors would know,or could reasonably deduce,that the company had suffered such setbacks.see in re daou,cir complaint described confidential witnesses with sufficient particularity to support the probability that they knew about the fraud.
the complaint also alleges with particularity that defendants counted stopped work as backlog.defendants admitted as much in two conference calls with analysts transcripts of which were included in the company sec filings.see infra.and the complaint alleges that the orders were still in effect when defendants touted the company backlog defendants arguments to the contrary simply misread the complaint defendants suggest that the orders may have expired and work may have resumed before they announced the backlog,and they speculate that two of the orders may have actually been renewals of an earlier order.but plaintiffs confidential witnesses suggest otherwise,so these disputes must at least await discovery.
ruminations on misleading 
defendants argue that,even if they did count stopped work as backlog,this could have misled reasonable investors,who would have understood that this was just what defendants were doing.see brody transitional hospitals,cir a statement is misleading if it would give a reasonable investor the impression of a state of affairs that differs in a material way from the one that actually exists.reasonable investors,defendants claim,would grasp that stopped work was included in backlog upon reading the following paragraph in the company sec filings 
our backlog consists of anticipated revenues from the uncompleted portions of existing contracts anticipated revenues included in backlog may be realized over a period.we include a contract in backlog when the contract is signed by us and by our customer.we believe the backlog figures are firm,subject only to the cancellation and modification provisions contained in our contracts because of possible future changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of orders,backlog at any particular date is not necessarily representative of actual sales to be expected for any succeeding period,and actual sales for the year may not meet or exceed the backlog represented.we may experience significant contract cancellations that were previously booked and included in backlog.
emphasis added.according to defendants,reasonable investors would interpret the emphasized phrase to mean that backlog includes stopped work because a order does actually cancel the contract,the contract continues to exist and because stopped work is perforce uncompleted,it still counts as backlog,even though applied signal may never get to complete it.
while this is a conceivable interpretation of this paragraph,it is hardly the even the most.it is just as likely that investors would interpret the underlined phrase as limited to work still in progress or work yet to be started on ongoing contracts.and,though the paragraph refers to customers rights to cancel or modif y existing contracts,it says nothing about the right to simply stop work and thus immediately interrupt the company revenue stream.the passage,moreover,speaks entirely of risks and contingencies.nothing alerts the reader that some of these risks may already have come to fruition,and that what the company refers to as backlog includes work that is substantially delayed and at serious risk of being cancelled altogether.
in ruling otherwise,the district court thought it significant that in a conference call with analysts one defendant hinted that stopped work counted as backlog.as discussed above,see supra,this conversation supports plaintiffs allegation that applied signal did count stopped work as backlog.the brief exchange went as follows 
o ne more question for you please.does the million of backlog that net of any potential debooking 
a.that includes the million that has not been debooked.
q.so it not net of any potential debooking includes 
that right.
with the benefit of hindsight and some help from the briefs we can see how this exchange might be interpreted to communicate that defendants counted stopped work as backlog.the million figure matches the amount of work halted by the first order which the company had disclosed some three months earlier and the company representative who was one of the two individual defendants admits that backlog still i ncludes this stopped work.but it far from clear that a reasonable investor could have decoded this meaning at the time.neither speaker made clear what million was being referred to,nor said anything about orders,nor explained what the words debook and potential debooking mean.absent undisputed evidence that these were terms of art that investors would have understood to refer to orders,we can not find,as a matter of law,that defendants disclosed that backlog included a significant amount of work that had been halted by the company customers.
defendants also argue that reasonable investors would have
