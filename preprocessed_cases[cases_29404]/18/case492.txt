richmond dellastatious brought this securities fraud action against donald williams and raymond kelly claiming that they were liable as control persons under the securities exchange act of and the virginia securities act.see a c.the district court granted williams and kelly motion for summary judgment,holding that they were not control persons and that they satisfied the statutes defense.because williams and kelly were corporate directors who acted in good faith reliance on a corporate process,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
laservision technologies,developed a camera system that created souvenirs for fans at sporting events.in,laservision formed surroundvision advanced imaging,llc,sail,to finance the marketing of the technology.laservision was sail corporate parent and a managing member of sail.adrian gluck,the president of laservision,served as ceo,president,and director of sail.defendant donald williams,a director of laservision,served as a manager of sail.defendant raymond kelly had no connection to sail except by virtue of his role as an outside director of laservision.despite its connections to laservision,sail also had some of its own officers.for instance,craig novak served as sail executive vice president and director,and howard kessel served as sail chief financial officer.
in october,gluck invited plaintiff richmond dellastatious to become an equity investor in sail.in november,sail sent dellastatious offering documents regarding the sale of the sail securities november offering memorandum.on december,dellastatious invested in sail.he subsequently purchased an additional worth of sail shares.
in reaching his decision to invest in sail,dellastatious relied,at least in part,on the november offering memorandum.an earlier draft of this offering document had been prepared for sail by gluck,novak,kessel,and isaac cohen,laservision attorney.sometime prior to november,one of laservision directors,larry berkowitz,reviewed and criticized the draft memorandum.berkowitz had previously been a securities lawyer with the securities and exchange commission.laservision directors were informed that the problems with the memorandum were technical in nature and would be corrected in accordance with berkowitz wishes.the memorandum was then revised effective november.this was the november offering memorandum that sail sent to dellastatious.there is no evidence that,after this revision,berkowitz had any further objections to the november offering memorandum.
sometime near the beginning of december,sail offering memorandum was revised again.at the previous month meeting,a committee had been formed to review sail offering memorandum.gluck,berkowitz,and williams were named to serve on the committee.according to the minutes from laservision december meeting,the memorandum was revised so that sail could raise an additional million in equity capital.the final revision to the offering memorandum was completed in march.it was mailed to dellastatious at this time.shortly thereafter,however,sail ceased operations.dellastatious shares are now worthless.
on november,dellastatious and frank romano,another sail shareholder,sued in federal district court.named as defendants in the complaint were sail,three of sail officers gluck,novak,and kessel,laservision,and two outside directors of laservision williams and kelly.the gravamen of plaintiffs complaint was that sail november offering memorandum was misleading in several material respects.first,plaintiffs alleged that the memorandum the closeness of the relationship between laservision and sail.plaintiffs argued that sail was essentially a shell corporation run by laservision and laservision directors.plaintiffs also alleged that the november offering memorandum grossly overstated sail projected revenues and misrepresented the nature of sail assets.finally,plaintiffs alleged that williams and kelly,although perhaps not directly responsible for the securities fraud,were liable as control persons under section of the securities exchange act of,a,and the virginia securities act,c.
on october,the district court granted williams and kelly motion for summary judgment.the court assumed that plaintiffs could prove that one of the other defendants was primarily liable for securities fraud violations.however,the court determined that neither williams nor kelly were control persons of any liable party.
the court also held that williams and kelly lacked the requisite culpability for control person liability.williams and kelly subsequently moved for sanctions and attorneys fees against plaintiffs and their counsel.the district court denied this motion.
in october,dellastatious and romano settled their claims against the three sail officers,novak,gluck,and kessel.on april,the court ordered that judgment against sail and laservision be entered in favor of dellastatious.the court awarded dellastatious for his claims under of the virginia code and for his common law fraud claim.in addition,the court granted judgment against romano in favor of sail and laservision.
dellastatious now appeals the district court holding that williams and kelly were not liable as control persons under either the state or federal securities laws.williams and kelly the district court denial of their motion for sanctions.
section a of the securities exchange act of,a,provides for derivative liability of persons who control those who are primarily liable under the exchange act however,control persons may escape liability by proving that they acted in good faith with regard to the securities violation.see a.to determine whether the affirmative defense has been satisfied under section a,defendants must show that they did not act recklessly.negligence on the part of defendants is insufficient to establish liability.see carpenter harris,upham,cir.o ur task is to examine what the defendants could have done under the circumstances to prevent the violation,and then ask whether the that they could take such not to.this is just to say that we are to determine whether there is a genuine issue of fact regarding the defendants recklessness.donohoe consolidated operating prod,cir see also thompson partridge,cir to qualify for the defense,controlling persons must establish that they did not act recklessly.
the virginia securities act,c,also establishes a defense for control persons.the statute allows control persons to avoid liability if they can prove that they did not know,and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known,of the existence of the facts by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist.c dellastatious argues that the virginia defense is stricter than its federal counterpart because it requires defendants to prove that they were not negligent,as opposed to not reckless.for purposes of this appeal we will assume that defendants must show that they acted reasonably in order to satisfy virginia defense.
dellastatious contends that williams and kelly are liable as control persons under both federal and virginia law for the fraud committed by sail.see a c.we shall assume,without deciding,that williams and kelly were control persons under both the federal and state laws.see a extending liability to e very person who,directly or indirectly,controls one liable for securities violations c extending liability to e very person who directly or indirectly controls one liable for securities violations,including every partner,officer,or director of such a person.
dellastatious argues that,at the very least,there is a genuine issue of fact regarding whether williams and kelly acted in good faith.we disagree.williams and kelly have carried their burden of proving that they acted reasonably.as a result,they are entitled to the affirmative defense under both federal law and virginia allegedly standard.
a defendant can satisfy the defense by demonstrating that he used reasonable care to prevent the securities violation.see donohoe,at interpreting a see also c.one way to determine whether williams and kelly acted with reasonable care pursuant to c,is to consider whether they complied with the duties established for directors under state law virgini
