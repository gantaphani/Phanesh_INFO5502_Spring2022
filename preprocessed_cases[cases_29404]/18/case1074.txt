falotti had worked in geneva,switzerland,since.in,oracle contacted at the time was an executive with at a job offer.nothing arose from this initial contact,but talks resumed in.falotti eventually signed an offer letter from oracle on july,july letter agreement.
under the july letter agreement,falotti agreed to work from geneva as oracle senior vice president for europe,the middle east,and africa with incentives,he earned one million dollars a year in salary.he was also promised that if he remained continuously employed,oracle would grant him an option,over time and in specified periodic installments,to purchase an initial shares of oracle common stock.the july letter agreement also stated that following falotti acceptance,oracle and falotti would enter into an employment contract subject to swiss law.
the july letter agreement was for an indefinite term,and oracle could terminate falotti with or without cause.termination without cause,however,entitled falotti to a severance package of one million dollars and accelerated vesting of of the stock options described in the july letter agreement.
on august,oracle and falotti signed another letter agreement august letter agreement.this agreement stated that falotti employment would be governed by the laws of switzerland.the august letter agreement also said that falotti employment with oracle shall be subject to the terms of the attached employee agreement.falotti signed the referenced swiss law employment agreement.
a few days later,on september,oracle and falotti consummated another letter agreement september letter agreement.the september letter agreement states that if there is a conflict between the july letter agreement and swiss law,the july letter agreement would control.the september letter agreement also states that any notice payable for termination without cause payable under your swiss employment agreement shall be waived providing the payment due under the july letter agreement shall have been paid.
none of these later three august letter agreement,the employment agreement,or the september letter any reference to stock options.
during falotti employment,all grants were governed by oracle equity incentive plan.oracle made individual grants under a grant agreement,and employees exercised their rights under an exercise notice agreement.the exercise notice agreement contains a california provision.additionally,all three grant and exercise agreements as well as the equity incentive plan collectively the stock option agreement incorporate each other by reference.
the stock option agreement states that an employee is not entitled to vest any remaining stock options once they cease to be employed.any dispute regarding the interpretation of a grant is reviewed by oracle compensation committee.the compensation committee decision is binding on both oracle and the employee.
in addition to the initial shares due falotti under the july letter agreement,oracle issued falotti more individual grants during the course of his employment.these grants were made periodically at the discretion of oracle,and were governed by the stock option agreement.of significance here,between june,and september,dates during which falotti alleges he is entitled to was scheduled to vest another two million shares.
while falotti was traveling to italy on may,an oracle representative called falotti and informed him,on authority from oracle ceo larry ellison,that falotti was terminated immediately.falotti called ellison that night,and ellison confirmed falotti termination.falotti informed ellison during this conversation that under swiss law falotti could not be fired because he was ill and unable to work.after may,falotti was neither paid a salary by oracle nor was he given any further stock options.thereafter,falotti performed no services for oracle.
on june,oracle compensation committee held a special meeting to determine when falotti ceased to be employed for purposes of his grants.outside counsel theodore rhodes attended the compensation committee meeting.rhodes advised that the compensation committee had broad discretion under the equity incentive plan to determine when an employee ceased to be employed and thus became ineligible to vest stock options.rhodes also advised that the compensation committee should make its decision according to the equity incentive plan regardless of swiss employment law.the compensation committee unanimously decided that falotti ceased to be employed on may,and could not exercise any stock options after that date.
three days after the compensation committee meeting,oracle filed a complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of california.the complaint sought declaratory relief regarding oracle rights and obligations under the various contracts with falotti.specifically,oracle sought a declaration that falotti could not exercise stock options that vested after may,and that he was not entitled to any damages in lieu of the unexercised options.
falotti asserted eleven counterclaims.the district court dismissed some of the counterclaims,sparing only counterclaims for benefits under swiss law,declaratory judgment,breach of written and oral contract,and promissory estoppel.
oracle then moved for summary judgment on its claim for declaratory relief,falotti swiss law claims to the extent they sought stock options or their equivalent value as damages,and falotti oral contract and promissory estoppel claims.falotti in turn sought summary judgment on his claim that he was entitled to vest stock options between may,and september.the district court granted summary judgment for oracle and denied summary judgment for falotti oracle falotti,

before an employee can be terminated,swiss law accords employees a notice period during which the employee is entitled to wages and benefits.swiss code of obligations sco.for an employee who has been with an employer for between two and nine years,the notice period is two months.id.additionally,swiss law prohibits the termination of an employee while that employee is unable to work.sco.
the district court held that the severance provision in the july letter agreement precluded falotti from receiving stock options or damages.falotti,d at.the district court reasoned that because the september letter agreement stated that the july letter agreement trumped the swiss law employment agreement in the case of a conflict,the severance clause in the july letter agreement was the only entitlement remaining after may.id.
the district court analysis on this point is flawed because falotti is not seeking stock options as part of a severance,but instead as part of damages incurred while he was still employed by oracle under swiss law.in other words,under swiss law and thus the employment agreement,falotti was not terminated until after the end of the applicable notice periods.see sco describing termination as occurring after a notice period sco prohibiting termination while a person is incapacitated sco stating that in certain circumstances severance must be paid after termination.only after termination did the severance benefit accrue.
furthermore,because the severance provision only applies after termination,there is no conflict between the severance provision and the notice periods that would cause the severance agreement to trump swiss law as incorporated into the employment agreement.oracle attempt to label the severance provision as explicitly replacing the notice period is unpersuasive.by its terms,the waiver clause in the septembe
