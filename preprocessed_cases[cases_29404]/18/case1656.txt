this is a consolidated appeal from a final judgment entered by the court of chancery pursuant to rule b.this proceeding involves competing requests for relief under section of the delaware general corporation law the dgcl at issue is which of two competing factions lawfully controls the board of directors the board of emak worldwide,emak.
prior to december,the board had six directors and one vacancy.on december,one director resigned,creating a second vacancy.the contend that on december and,take back emak,llc tbe delivered sufficient consents the tbe consents to remove two additional directors without cause,and fill three of the resulting vacancies with philip kleweno,michael konig,and lloyd sems.incumbent director donald kurz kurz is a member of tbe.if valid,the tbe consents would establish a new board majority.
the contend that on december,crown emak partners,llc crown delivered sufficient consents the crown consents to amend emak bylaws the bylaw amendments in two important ways.first,the crown consents purportedly amended section of the bylaws new section to reduce the size of the board to three directors.because crown has the right to appoint two directors under the terms of emak series aa preferred stock,a reducing the board to three,if valid,would give crown a board majority.second,the crown consents purportedly added a new section to the bylaws new section providing that if the number of sitting directors exceeds three,then the emak ceo will call a special meeting of stockholders to elect the third director,who will take office as the singular successor to his multiple predecessors.the defendants contend that the bylaw amendments are valid and that the next step is for the emak ceo to call a special meeting under new section.
the court of chancery concluded that the tbe consents validly effected corporate action and that,therefore,the lawful board consists of incumbent directors kurz,jeffrey deutschman,and jason ackerman,and newly elected directors kleweno,konig,and sems.consequently,one vacancy remains.the court of chancery also concluded that the bylaw amendments adopted through the crown consents conflict with the dgcl and are void.therefore,the court held,the crown consents were ineffective either to reduce the size of the board or to require the calling of a special meeting.
the appellants raise three claims in this appeal.first,the appellants submit that the court of chancery erred in concluding that kurz did not engage in impermissible vote buying.in the alternative,they contend kurz purported purchase of the outcome determinative shares from peter boutros boutros was an improper transfer under the plain language of a restricted stock grant agreement between emak and boutros.second,they argue that the court of chancery erred when it held that cede breakdowns should be deemed part of the stock ledger under title,section of the delaware code with the result that the member depository banks and brokers are record holders.they submit that a proxy from dtc,as the only undisputed record holder of shares in street name,was required to count the votes of those banks and brokers.since tbe failed to obtain a proxy from dtc,those votes were invalid and improperly counted.third,they argue that the court of chancery erred when it held that the crown consent was void because the amendments to the bylaws conflict with delaware law.
we hold that kurz did not engage in improper vote buying,but that his purchase of shares from boutros was an improper transfer that was prohibited by a restricted stock agreement between boutros and emak.because the boutros shares could not be voted,that deprived the kurz faction of the votes required to elect their nominees.we therefore do not reach the issue of whether the cede breakdowns are part of the stock ledger under title,section of the delaware code.for reasons more fully discussed in this opinion,the court of chancery interpretation of stock ledger under section should be regarded as obiter dictum and without precedential effect.finally,we hold that the crown bylaw amendments were invalid because they conflict with delaware law.
therefore,the judgments of the court of chancery are affirmed in part and reversed in part.this matter is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.
factual background 
emak capital structure 
emak is a delaware corporation based in los angeles,california.emak has two classes of stock common shares and the series aa preferred stock.
emak has issued and outstanding shares of common stock.emak common shares traded on nasdaq from until april,when trading was suspended.on june,emak was delisted.emak subsequently deregistered,although its common shares continue to trade on the pink sheets.
emak has issued and outstanding shares of series aa preferred stock,all held by crown.the series aa preferred has the right to elect two directors to the board,plus a third director if the board expands to more than eight members.the series aa preferred does not vote in the election of directors.it does vote on an basis with the common stock on all other matters.the series aa preferred can convert into common shares and carries of emak total voting power on matters where it votes with the common stock.
tbe consent solicitation and exchange transaction 
on monday,october,tbe delivered an initial consent to emak,thereby launching its consent solicitation the tbe consent solicitation.under section c of emak bylaws the bylaws,the board had the power to set a record date for the tbe consent solicitation.during a meeting held on october,the board set october as the record date.had the board not exercised its authority,the record date would have been october,the date of delivery of the initial tbe consent.at the october meeting,the board also approved a transaction in which crown exchanged its series aa preferred for new series b preferred stock the exchange transaction.unlike the series aa preferred,the series b preferred voted on an basis with the common stock on all matters,including the election of directors.the exchange transaction thus conferred on crown the right to wield of the total voting power in an election of directors.the october record date enabled emak to place the new series b preferred into crown hands for the tbe consent solicitation.
on october,the plaintiffs filed suit challenging the exchange transaction and sought an expedited hearing on an application for preliminary injunction.during the scheduling conference,the parties agreed that the deadline for delivering consents in the tbe consent solicitation would be december,and the court of chancery entered an order implementing that agreement.the court of chancery granted the motion to expedite and scheduled a hearing on the plaintiffs injunction application for december.
to bolster the defendants litigation position,emak solicited consents to ratify the exchange transaction the ratification solicitation.ultimately,however,the court of chancery did not have to rule on either the exchange transaction or the ratification strategy because on december,the day before the hearing,emak and crown rescinded the exchange transaction.
the plaintiffs responded to the rescission of the exchange transaction by filing an amended complaint challenging the disclosures made in the ratification solicitation.on december,the individual defendants and emak filed counterclaims and a third party complaint challenging the disclosures made in the tbe consent solicitation.on december,the parties agreed to defer litigating their disclosures and fight it out at the ballot box.they agreed to resume any litigation on december,after the deadline for the tbe consent solicitation.
three simultaneous consent solicitations 
during december,solicitation activity intensified,because three simultaneous consent solicitations were under way.tbe continued its solicitation activities and issued a series of press releases and public statements in support of the tbe consent solicitation.on december,emak began soliciting consent revocations and issued a series of press releases and public statements in support of its efforts.
after the rescission of the exchange transaction,crown designated jason ackerman as the second director authorized by the series aa preferred stock.then,crown began soliciting consents to amend the bylaws in the following manner 
resolved article iii,section of the company bylaws is amended to read as follows 
section.number and term of office.the board of directors shall consist of three members.as provided for in the amended and restated certificate of designation of the series aa senior cumulative convertible preferred stock,two directors shall be elected by the holders of the series aa senior cumulative convertible preferred stock.the directors shall be elected at the annual meeting of the stockholders,except as provided elsewhere in this article iii,and each director elected shall hold office until his successor is elected and qualified.directors need not be stockholders,residents of delaware,or citizens of the united states.
resolved article iii,section is added to the company bylaws 
section if at any time the number of members of the board of directors shall be greater than three,unless a sufficient number of directors resign to reduce the number of members of the board of directors to three,the chief executive officer shall promptly call a special meeting of the common stockholders of the corporation,which meeting shall be held not later than days following the first date on which the number of directors was greater than three or in the case of the adoption of the bylaw establishing a board of directors,days after such bylaw amendment became effective,for purposes of electing the one director to be elected by the common stockholders of the corporation,who shall be the successor to all directors previously elected by the common stockholders of the corporation.
in its opinion,the court of chancery referred to these provisions as the bylaw amendments.
dtc and broadridge roles in tbe consent solicitation 
tbe conducted a solicitation in which it sought to obtain consents from a large number of individual emak stockholders.since emak shares were publicly traded for fourteen years,a significant number of emak stockholders owned their shares in street name.this practice is summarized in a leading treatise 
the vast majority of publicly traded shares in the united states are registered on the companies books not in the name of beneficial,those investors who paid for,and have the right to vote and dispose of,the rather in the name of cede,the name used by the depository trust company dtc.
shares registered in this manner are commonly referred to as being held in street name.dtc holds the shares on behalf of banks and brokers,which in turn hold on behalf of their clients who are the underlying beneficial owners or other intermediaries 
the roles of dtc and the investor communications solutions division of broadridge financial services,broadridge are important in this case.broadridge role has been summarized as follows 
for many years,banks and brokers maintained their own proxy departments to handle the administrative processes of distributing proxy materials and tabulating voting instructions from their clients.today,however,the overwhelming majority have eliminated their proxy departments and subcontracted these processes out to broadridge.for many years,these proxy processing services were provided by automatic data processing,adp,but on march,adp spun off its brokerage services group into a new independent company,broadridge,which now provides these services to most banks and brokers.
to make these arrangements work,broadridge bank and broker clients formally transfer to broadridge the proxy authority they receive from dtc via the dtc omnibus proxy via written powers of attorney.on behalf of the brokers and banks,broadridge delivers directly to each beneficial owner a proxy statement and,importantly,a voting instruction form referred to as a vif rather than a proxy card.beneficial owners do not receive proxy cards because they are not vested with the right to vote shares or to grant proxy rights belong only to the legal owners or their designees.beneficial owners merely have the right to instruct how their shares are to be voted by broadridge of the dtc participants,which they accomplish by returning a vif 
dtc is generally regarded as the entity having the power under delaware law to vote the shares that it holds on deposit for the banks and brokers who are members of dtc.through the dtc omnibus proxy,dtc transfers its voting authority to those member banks and brokers.the banks and brokers then transfer the voting authority to broadridge,which votes the shares held at dtc by each bank and broker in proportion to the aggregate voting instructions received from the ultimate beneficial owners.
for the tbe consent solicitation,broadridge collected,recorded,and totaled the voting instructions it received from the beneficial owners of emak shares held in street name.there is no dispute that the banks and brokers properly authorized broadridge to vote the emak shares held on their behalf by dtc.
what no one ever obtained,and what dtc never provided,was the dtc omnibus proxy.the evidence conflicts as to who had the responsibility to get the dtc omnibus proxy.the court of chancery found that neither party clearly had the obligation to secure the dtc omnibus proxy,although both could have done more,neither acted improperly or inequitably with respect to this aspect of the case.
delivery of the consents 
on december,crown delivered the crown consents to emak,along with a certification required by section e of the bylaws attesting to crown good faith belief that crown had received sufficient consents to take corporate action.given the nearly voting power that crown could wield on matters other than the election of directors,crown needed only another to reach the necessary majority of emak outstanding voting power.crown obtained that majority from emak management and one large institutional holder.with only a few consents to deliver,crown sidestepped the need for a dtc omnibus proxy by having dtc execute the consents in the name of cede,a procedure dtc offers to beneficial holders akin to the issuance of appraisal demands in cede name.this approach is not practical for a solicitation such as that which tbe conducted.
boutros purchase agreement 
with the december,deadline looming,tbe and its principals were working feverishly to round up the final consents.on thursday,december,sems emailed kurz we need to buy someone s shares this weekend.
one person whose vote remained undecided was boutros,a former employee and current consultant of emak who lived in australia.boutros owned shares of restricted stock,all entitled to vote.both sides sought boutros support.on thursday,december,boutros told kurz that he would support crown.kurz responded that he would contact boutros that weekend and encouraged boutros to reconsider before the december deadline.
as of friday,december,king,tbe proxy solicitor,showed tbe having consents for approximately of the common shares.to prevail,tbe needed another votes.
between friday,december and sunday,december,kurz had a series of telephone calls with boutros.on sunday,kurz had additional calls with boutros counsel.the result was a purchase agreement dated as of december,the purchase agreement,in which boutros sold to kurz 
a all shares of common stock of emak worldwide,a delaware corporation the company that seller owns and is entitled or permitted to sell,transfer or assign as of the date hereof the shares,and b all rights to receive all other shares of the company that the seller is or may hereafter be entitled or permitted to sell,transfer or assign,for a total purchase price of the purchase price,with the purchase price to be paid by wire transfer to an account designated by seller upon full execution of this agreement.
boutros originally asked for per share.kurz felt that was too high and bargained boutros down.kurz believed he obtained the economic and voting rights albeit not legal title to shares,resulting in a price of per share.at the time,emak stock was trading on the pink sheets for around per share.
the description of what boutros sold and kurz bought reflects their efforts to contract around transfer restrictions.a restricted stock grant agreement dated march,governed of boutros shares.section of that agreement provided prior to march,boutros shall not be entitled to transfer,sell,pledge,hypothecate or assign any shares of restricted stock.under section of that agreement,if boutros was still employed by emak on march,then the transfer restrictions would lapse.if boutros was terminated without cause before march,then the restrictions would lapse upon termination.if boutros was terminated for cause or resigned before march,then he would forfeit the shares.the cover letter from emak that conveyed the grant stated the stock will vest equally per year over a three year period.the court of chancery found that it was odd to use the term vest,because under section,the transfer restrictions and forfeiture provisions seemingly applied to all shares until march.
boutros remaining shares were governed by a resale restriction agreement dated november.that latter agreement contains a different form of transfer restriction,which provides boutros agrees not to sell,contract to sell,grant any option to purchase,transfer the economic risk of ownership in,make any short sale of,pledge or otherwise transfer or dispose of any shares or any interest in any shares until the shares have been released from the foregoing restrictions on or before november.
the parties dispute what was actually transferred.of the shares governed by the restricted stock grant agreement,the contended boutros could transfer shares immediately,another on march,and the final on march.the contended kurz got nothing and shares if boutros still holds them on march.for purposes of its opinion,the court of chancery assumed the latter to be true.
section of the purchase agreement was critical to kurz.it provides 
proxies.as a material part of the consideration for this agreement,and an express condition precedent to the effectiveness hereof,seller agrees to execute and deliver to buyer by facsimile transmittal on the date hereof,time being of the essence,with originals to follow immediately by express delivery,a this agreement,b an irrevocable proxy,c the revocation,and d the white consent card solicited by take back emak,llc,each in the form attached hereto.
with boutros votes in hand,kurz believed tbe had the consents it needed to prevail.
late in the evening on december,kurz counsel sent by email to emak general counsel an initial broadridge omnibus consent dated november,reflecting voting instructions received through that date the initial broadridge omnibus consent.kurz counsel also sent written consent cards for record holders and a certification attesting to the soliciting parties good faith belief that they had received valid and unrevoked consents sufficient to take corporate action.the question whether kurz,tbe,and the other soliciting parties could have held that good faith belief on december.the court of chancery found that the certification was properly given,based on the consents tbe had in hand and the information tbe had from its proxy solicitor about how the street name vote came in.
on the morning of december,the same documents were to emak registered office in delaware.that morning,tbe ordered a supplemental omnibus consent from broadridge dated december,the supplemental broadridge omnibus consent,showing additional votes,net of revocations,since november.the supplemental broadridge omnibus consent was to emak registered office later that day.tbe also delivered additional consent cards from registered holders to emak registered office.
the ivs reports 
on december,ivs issued its preliminary tabulation report on the crown consents.ivs reported that crown had delivered consents representing of emak outstanding voting power,sufficient to amend the bylaws.on december,emak informed ivs that it was not challenging the preliminary tabulation report.that same day,ivs issued its final report confirming its preliminary tally.
on december,ivs issued its preliminary tabulation report on the tbe consents.ivs reported that record holders of shares expressed consent in favor of the tbe consent solicitation and that street name holders of shares consented through the broadridge omnibus consents.the combined tally of shares represented a majority of the common shares outstanding on the record date.the ivs preliminary report,however,treated the street votes as invalid due to the lack of a dtc omnibus proxy on file.
on january,tbe delivered a written challenge to the ivs preliminary report.tbe contended that i the consents for shares held in street name should be counted and ii the tally in favor of tbe should include additional consents delivered on december.
on january,ivs issued its final report.ivs revised its tally to take into account consent cards delivered on december,and now reported that record holders of shares expressed consents in favor of the tbe consent solicitation.ivs declined to count the street name consents,however.
as of october,emak had shares outstanding.in order to prevail,tbe needed to obtain consents for shares.backing out the consents for shares that tbe received from record holders would leave a balance of votes required for victory.
the ivs preliminary report showed that tbe received consents from street name holders of shares,which was more than sufficient.table a shows for each proposal i the votes received by tbe through the initial broadridge omnibus consent and ii the additional votes,net of revocations,received by tbe through the supplemental broadridge omnibus consent.on each issue,the broadridge omnibus consents provided tbe with sufficient votes from shares held in street name for tbe to prevail.
but there was one more step in the process.the sequence of events at the beginning of the tbe consent solicitation created confusion about what was the record date.tbe first delivered a consent that would have set october,as the record date,but then the board exercised its authority to set the record date for october.the broadridge omnibus consents reflected an incorrect record date of october.the court of chancery ruled that a consent need not identify the record date,and the fact that broadridge included an incorrect piece of extraneous information on its omnibus consents did not affect their validity.
the court of chancery found it necessary,however,to review the number of shares voted by the broadridge omnibus consents and count only the number of shares actually held by the banks and brokers on the true record date of october.if dtc holds shares of a corporation on behalf of banks and brokers,then the corporation can ask dtc to provide what is technically known as a participant listing and informally referred to as a cede breakdown.the cede breakdown for a particular date identifies by name each bank or broker that holds shares with dtc as of that date and the number of shares held,respectively,by each.in contrast to the dtc omnibus proxy,which is not governed by any legal authority,federal regulations require dtc to furnish a cede breakdown promptly when an issuer corporation requests it.
in november,emak obtained cede breakdowns for both october and october.the cede breakdowns show the aggregate decline in the share positions of each of the banks and brokers who held emak shares through dtc.the total reduction was shares,less than the margin of victory on each issue.the same calculation can be derived by cutting back the overvote on a basis.assuming conservatively that even if tbe lost one consent for each share by which the position of a consenting bank or broker declined,tbe still prevailed.table b shows the calculations.
the court of chancery found,as fact,that if all of the tbe consents are counted,including the street votes from the broadridge omnibus consents,then tbe delivered sufficient consents to emak to take valid corporate action.
improper vote buying concern 
shareholder voting differs from voting in public elections,in that the shares on which the shareholders vote depends can be bought and sold vote buying in the context of corporate elections and other shareholder actions has been and continues to be an important issue several commentators have addressed the corporate voting process and techniques by which shareholder voting rights can be manipulated 
the court of chancery characterized vote buying that does not involve the use of corporate resources as third party vote buying.here,although kurz is a director of emak,he used his own resources to acquire boutros shares.accordingly,kurz actions as a third party do not involve the problem of insiders using corporate resources to buy votes 
vote buying has been described as disenfranchising when it delivers the swing votes in this case,the court of chancery opined that third party vote buying merits judicial review if it is disenfranchising,if it actually affects the outcome of the vote applying those principles to this case,the court of chancery concluded that the purchase agreement between kurz and boutros was potentially disenfranchising and should be subjected to a vote buying analysis,because the purchase agreement provided tbe with the votes they sic needed to prevail and disenfranchised what would have been a silent majority against the tbe consent solicitation.therefore,it determined that the purchase agreement should be scrutinized closely.
the court of chancery noted a scholarly analysis of shareholder voting which concluded i t is not possible to separate the voting right from the equity interest and that s omeone who wants to buy a vote must buy the stock too.the court of chancery also recognized,however,that over the last years i nnovations in technology and finance have made it easier to separate voting from the financial claims of shares.today,the market permits providers to slice and dice the shareholder interest in a variety of ways,and investors are willing to buy these separate interests.
according to a recent scholarly study of corporate voting by professors robert thompson and paul edelman,a disconnect between voting rights and the economic interests of shares compromises the ability of voting to perform its assigned role.they concluded that a decisionmaking system that relies on votes to determine the decision of the group necessarily requires that the voters interest be aligned with the collective interest.therefore,i t remains important to require an alignment between share voting and the financial interest of the shares.
no improper vote buying 
for many years,delaware decisions have expressed consistent concerns about transactions that create a misalignment between the voting interest and the economic interest of shares.as then now chief justice steele explained,g enerally speaking,courts closely scrutinize because a shareholder who divorces property interest from voting interest fails to serve the community of interest among all shareholders,since the bought shareholder votes may not reflect rational,economic arguably common to all shareholders.again,in this case,the court of chancery recognized that w hat legitimizes the stockholder vote as a mechanism is the premise that stockholders with economic ownership are expressing their collective view as to whether a particular course of action serves the corporate goal of stockholder wealth maximization.
accordingly,the court of chancery held that p olicing vote buying does not rest on the outdated notion that every stockholder owes every other stockholder a duty to use its best judgment while voting.it flows instead from the legitimating conditions necessary for meaningful stockholder voting the court of chancery concluded that 
because transactions in which economic interests are fully aligned with voting rights do not raise concern,delaware law does not restrict a soliciting party from buying shares and getting a proxy to bolster the solicitation chance of success.delaware law presumes that in the sale of the underlying stock,the seller sells and assigns all of its rights,title and interest,including its right to grant a consent or a revocation with respect to a past record date commonwealth assocs.providence health care,at.delaware law further presumes that upon request the seller will,in good faith,take such ministerial steps as are necessary,granting proxies to effectuate the transfer.id.such transactions are common.john wilcox,john purcell iii,choi,street name registration the proxy solicitation process,at in amy goodman,et,a practical guide to sec proxy and compensation rules ed supp.o ver the course of a proxy contest,it is not uncommon for contestants to attempt to increase their voting power by purchasing additional shares robert thompson paul edelman,corporate voting,vand,a corporate voter who has intense feelings about the matter to be determined can influence,if not control,the outcome by purchasing shares.
guided by these principles,the court of chancery scrutinized the purchase agreement as follows 
i find no evidence of fraud in the transaction.the record indicates that boutros was fully informed about the ongoing consent solicitations.both factions had made multiple attempts to get him to commit to their side.although there is no direct evidence establishing that boutros knew his shares were the swing shares,i conclude that he must have been cognizant of this fact.he cut his deal with kurz over the weekend before the monday on which the tbe consent solicitation ended.at a time when emak stock was trading on the pink sheets for less than a dollar,boutros asked for per share and received per share.boutros was advised by counsel and bargained to obtain specific terms for the deal,including an absence of representations and warranties and contractual indemnification from kurz.these are the hallmarks of a transaction in which boutros understood what he was selling,the circumstances under which he was selling it,and what he was getting in return.
this brings me to the alignment of interests.although kurz did not take title to the shares that boutros owned,and although i assume the restricted stock grant agreement prohibits boutros from transferring title to kurz until march,boutros nevertheless transferred to kurz,and kurz now bears,of the economic risk from the shares.if the value of emak shares drops further,then kurz will suffer.if emak goes bankrupt and its shares become worthless,then kurz will have a paper souvenir.conversely,if emak turns itself around and prospers,then kurz will benefit.kurz has already paid boutros.kurz only interest lies in how emak performs.
because kurz now holds the economic interest in the shares,delaware law presumes that he should and will exercise the right to vote.commonwealth assocs.providence health care,at see len fuller,wl,at.may,barring record holder from voting shares by written consent after corporation exercised option to acquire shares freeman fabiniak,wl,at,i t would be inequitable to allow a holder of record who holds mere legal title to stock to act by consent in a manner contrary to the wishes of the true owner.the proxy boutros granted to kurz under the purchase agreement comports with what our law expects.see generally john wilcox,john purcell iii,choi,street name registration the proxy solicitation process at in amy goodman,et,a practical guide to sec proxy and compensation rules ed.supp.explaining that a purchaser typically obtains an irrevocable proxy when shares are acquired from a registered holder 
we hold that the court of chancery correctly concluded that there was no improper vote buying,because the economic interests and the voting interests of the shares remained aligned since both sets of interests were transferred from boutros to kurz by the purchase agreement.
restricted stock grant agreement violated 
the next argue that,even if the purchase agreement did not constitute improper vote buying,kurz should not be allowed to vote the boutros shares,because by entering into the purchase agreement,boutros breached the transfer restrictions in the restricted stock grant agreement.the restricted stock grant agreement provided that p rior to march,boutros shall not be entitled to transfer,sell,pledge,hypothecate or assign any shares of restricted stock.the court of chancery assumed that the restrictions are operative and binding.
the factual findings made by the court of chancery are important.on thursday,december,kurz was told we need to buy someone shares this weekend.as of friday,tbe had consents for approximately of the common shares and needed another votes to prevail.boutros owned shares of restricted stock,all of which were all entitled to vote.kurz was provided with copies of both of boutros stock restriction agreements on sunday,december,before entering into the purchase agreement.
kurz read the agreements and parsed the restrictions.he focused on the language in the resale restriction agreement that extended beyond any sale to encompass any contract to sell,any option to purchase,and any transfer of the economic risk of ownership.he noted that the restricted stock grant agreement did not contain similar language and appeared to restrict only an actual sale,transfer,pledge,hypothecation,or assignment.kurz concluded that he could contract with boutros to buy however many shares boutros could sell at the time,and to obtain in the future however many shares boutros eventually could transfer,if and when boutros became able to transfer them.
the court of chancery held that kurz and boutros had successfully contracted around the sale and transfer restrictions,because the restricted stock grant agreement does not prohibit boutros from agreeing to take those actions at a future date.the record supports the court of chancery conclusion that kurz did not engage in illegal vote buying because that court found that,along with the votes,kurz simultaneously purchased and immediately received the full economic interests associated with the boutros shares.that finding,however,leads inexorably to the conclusion that the purchase agreement violated the restricted stock grant agreement.the court of chancery determination that there was no actual sale or transfer is not supported by the record,the language and purpose of the restricted stock grant agreement,or the court own findings.
in their comprehensive analysis of new vote buying and its corporate governance implications,professors henry hu and bernard black have examined modern vote buying techniques.in doing so they defined three terms that are relevant to our review of what was actually transferred immediately by the purchase agreement between kurz and boutros.
f ormal voting rights the legal right to vote shares under company law as supplemented by sec and stock exchange rules governing voting of shares held in street name,including the legal power to instruct someone else how to vote.
e conomic ownership the economic returns associated with shares.this ownership can be achieved directly by holding shares,or indirectly by holding a coupled asset,which conveys returns that relate directly to the returns on the shares.economic ownership can either be same direction as the return on opposite direction from the return on shares.
full ownership consist s of voting ownership plus direct economic ownership 
professors hu and black also noted 
our system of record ownership already decouples economic ownership from formal voting rights.the record owner is typically at least two persons removed from the economic owner of the shares.shares held in street name are generally held of record by depository trust company or another securities depository,which holds the shares on behalf of another intermediary such as a or bank,which holds the shares for economic owners.our legal system has responded by partly recoupling voting and economic ownership.depositories pass voting rights to their bank and broker clients,who must request voting instructions from economic owners.if the customer does not provide instructions,new york stock exchange rule allows a bank or broker to vote on routine matters,but not on a contested matter or on a merger or similar transaction which may substantially affect the value of the shares professors hu and black concluded that the foregoing rules on when record owners can vote provide precedent for an effort to reconnect voting rights to economic ownership,when technology has severed them.
those observations helpfully aid our analysis of the purchase agreement.kurz paid boutros for the immediate receipt of all economic interest in the shares.the restricted stock grant agreement,however,required the continued decoupling of the formal voting rights,by requiring that boutros remain as the record owner until.nevertheless,kurz was able to connect the economic rights he purchased from boutros with the formal voting rights that boutros would otherwise retain by requiring boutros to execute an irrevocable proxy.
therefore,unlike other beneficial owners,kurz could vote the shares on any future corporate matter without ever again contacting the record owner,boutros,for another proxy.by reconnecting the voting rights to the economic ownership via the irrevocable proxy,the purchase agreement immediately conferred upon kurz the functional equivalent of full ownership,in consideration for the he paid to boutros.there was nothing for boutros to transfer to kurz in the future,other than the bare legal title.
the court of chancery found that kurz believed he obtained the economic and voting rights albeit not legal title to shares for a price of per share.kurz testified that when he entered into the purchase agreement,the financial results and forecasts he received suggested he was overpaying boutros for his shares.in rejecting the defendants insider trading arguments the court of chancery concluded that kurz testimony was credible and that kurz bought boutros shares because tbe needed another votes to win.
the purpose of the restricted stock grant agreement was to provid e employees and consultants of emak with a proprietary interest in pursuing the growth,profitability and financial success of the corporation.that is consistent with the purpose of restricted stock agreements generally the structure of the restricted stock agreement,providing that restricted stock will fully vest in boutros only after three years of continued employment beyond the grant date,is also consistent with this purpose.
the court of chancery found that although kurz did not take title to the shares that boutros owned,and although i assume the restricted stock grant agreement prohibits boutros from transferring title to kurz until march,boutros nevertheless transferred to kurz,and kurz now bears,of the economic risk from the shares.boutros immediate divestiture of all voting and economic rights in his shares frustrates the purpose of the restricted stock grant agreement,because bare legal title,alone and without more,does not give boutros a stake in the corporation future.
the restricted stock agreement prohibits any transfer,sale,pledge or hypothecat ion of boutros restricted emak shares.the court of chancery found that the odd framing of what boutros sold and kurz bought reflects their efforts to contract around those transfer restrictions.the purchase agreement recites that boutros agrees to sell all shares that he owns and is permitted to sell,transfer or assign by its very terms,the restricted stock grant agreement prohibits what the purchase agreement purports to do,sell,transfer or assign his shares.therefore,we hold that the purchase agreement did not operate as a legally valid sale or transfer of boutros shares,and that kurz was not entitled to vote those shares.
written consent must be executed by a record holder 
the defendants also argue the tbe consents can not be effective because of the absence of a dtc omnibus proxy.section a of the dgcl provides 
unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation,any action required by this chapter to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of a corporation,or any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders,may be taken without a meeting,without prior notice and without a vote,if a consent or consents in writing,setting forth the action so taken,shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in this state,its principal place of business or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded.
section c requires that each consent bear the date of signature of each stockholder and that to be effective,consents signed by a sufficient number of holders must be delivered to the corporation within days of the earliest dated consent.
in the court of chancery,the plaintiffs initial response to the lack of a dtc omnibus proxy was to argue that a written consent need not be executed by a stockholder of record.in two decisions,freeman and grynberg burke the court of chancery previously held that only a stockholder of record can execute a written consent.the plaintiffs asked the court of chancery not to follow the holdings in those prior opinions,which the plaintiffs contend betray an unfounded hostility towards the use of written consents in control contests and an unjustified preference for the traditional stockholder meeting.in this case,the court of chancery rejected the plaintiffs arguments both as a matter of statutory analysis and for policy reasons.instead it adhered to the holdings of freeman and grynberg that only a stockholder of record can execute a written consent.
section c of the dgcl provides that t he stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled by this section to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.the ledger is a compilation of the transfers by and to each individual shareholder,with each transaction separately posted to separately maintained shareholder accounts.the ledger is different from a stocklist,which is a compilation of the currently effective entries in the stock ledger.under section a,at least days before every meeting of stockholders,the officer in charge of the stock ledger must prepare and make a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting.
more than fifty years ago,this court held that only registered stockholders may exercise the power to vote in a delaware corporation in the american hardware case,savage arms sought stockholder approval of a acquisition and sent out the notice of meeting and proxy statement sixteen days before the meeting date.american hardware objected,arguing that because of the outstanding shares were held in brokers accounts,the time allowed for all the stockholders to receive and consider the opposition proxy material was insufficient.this court rejected that argument,stating that t he answer to this point is simple.
under the general corporation law,no one but a registered stockholder is,as a matter of right,entitled to vote,with certain exceptions not pertinent here.if an owner of stock chooses to register his shares in the name of a nominee,he takes the risks attendant upon such an arrangement,including the risk that he may not receive notice of corporate proceedings,or be able to obtain a proxy from his nominee.the corporation,except in special cases,is entitled to recognize the exclusive right of the registered owner to vote the corporation has ordinarily discharged its obligation under delaware law when it mails notice to the record owner 
section a incorporates the concept of record ownership that governs voting at a meeting of stockholders by framing the taking of action by written consent in terms of the holders of outstanding stock who would have sufficient votes to take similar action at a meeting where all shares entitled to vote are present.in this case,the court of chancery held section is thus appropriately interpreted as requiring that a written consent be executed by a stockholder of record.the court of chancery also relied on section e to reinforce that interpretation 
section e requires that prompt notice of corporate action taken by less than unanimous written consent be provided to stockholders who,if the action had been taken at a meeting,would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date for notice of such meeting had been the date that written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders were delivered to the corporation by defining the notice obligation for written consents in terms of what would be required for a hypothetical meeting,section e strengthens the connection between voting by consent and voting at a meeting.the court of chancery also relied on section b,which provides that e ach stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy 
in this case,the court of chancery explained why it decided to adhere to the holdings in freeman and grynberg that a written consent must be executed by a stockholder of record.
by treating stockholders identically for purposes of granting proxy authority,regardless of whether the vote is at a meeting or by written consent,section b indicates that the same principles should apply in both instances.just as only a stockholder of record can vote at a meeting,only a stockholder of record can execute a written consent.
as a matter of delaware public policy,there is much to be said for requiring a written consent to be executed by a record holder,which allows the corporation or an inspector of elections to determine from readily available records whether the consent was valid.certainty and efficiency are critical values when determining how stockholder voting rights have been exercised.williams sterling oil of,fork,toal,blasius,atlas.this is particularly true for consents,which are effective upon delivery to the corporation of a sufficient number of valid consents 
the court of chancery holding that a written consent must be executed by a stockholder of record did not end its analysis of how to define who is a record holder on the stock ledger.
court of chancery redefines stock ledger 
the statutory mandate in section c provides that only stockholders of record who appear on the stock ledger can vote.therefore,the court of chancery continued its analysis by considering whether the cede breakdown should be part of the stock ledger for purposes of section c.it concluded 
there is a straightforward basis for doing so,namely our law long recognition that the cede breakdown is part of the stock ledger for purposes of section b.if the cede breakdown is part of the stock ledger,then the banks and brokers who appear on the cede breakdown have the power to vote as record holders at a meeting of stockholders or for purposes of taking action by written consent.
the history of the depository system is set forth on dtc website the holding of securities through dtc has significance under delaware law because it is cede,not the banks and brokers,that appears on the stock ledger of a delaware corporation.the court of chancery noted that cede is typically the largest record holder on the stock ledger of most publicly traded delaware corporations.under delaware law,only stockholders who appear on the stock ledger have authority to vote at a meeting or express consent.
the dtc omnibus proxy currently serves as the mechanism by which the federally mandated depository system of indirect ownership through dtc comports with delaware system of direct ownership evidenced through the stock ledger.the dtc omnibus proxy operates to ensure the transfer of dtc voting authority to the participant members.as one treatise explains because dtc has no beneficial interest in its shares,it has devised a mechanism to pass on its voting rights.this mechanism,called the omnibus proxy,provides for the transfer of dtc voting right to its bank and broker participants.
the record reflects that dtc issues the omnibus proxy as a matter of course during the interactions between issuers and dtc that are compelled by the federal securities laws.when preparing for a meeting of stockholders or a consent solicitation,issuers are required by federal law to go through dtc to identify the participant banks and brokers for purposes of distributing voting cards and solicitation materials an issuer typically starts the process by requesting a cede breakdown so that it can send out the broker search cards when the entire process is complete,the issuer provides each bank and broker with sufficient copies of the proxy statement,card,and other materials for distribution to the beneficial owners 
thirty years ago,when the depository system was still new,the court of chancery held that a stockholder was entitled to a cede breakdown under section when the stockholder sought a stocklist subsequent delaware decisions have consistently ordered the production of a cede breakdown as part of the section stocklist materials in this case,the court of chancery reasoned that if a cede breakdown is part of the stock ledger for purposes of section b,it logically should be part of the stock ledger for purposes of section c and should be used to create the stocklist under section a.
the court of chancery acknowledged that this conclusion was contrary to the established understanding among practitioners,evidenced by our case law,that dtc through cede is the record holder and that everyone above dtc is a beneficial holder.the court of chancery reached that conclusion by characterizing the relationship between dtc and its participant banks and brokers as fundamentally different from the relationships further up the chain.consequently,the court did not believe that there are any practical or impediments to treating the cede breakdown as part of the stock ledger.nevertheless,it concluded 
my ruling does not alter the traditional distinction between record and beneficial ownership.the analysis i have followed does not apply to any entity other than dtc in its role as a federally registered clearing agency.the view from the top of the beneficial ownership chain remains as always beneficial holders are not record holders.
having completed its analysis,the court of chancery declined to follow prior precedents construing the meaning of the term record holder and announced a new interpretation of stock ledger under section of the dgcl 
the cede breakdown showing the banks and brokers who held emak stock at dtc as of october,was part of emak stock ledger for purposes of section c.those banks and brokers were therefore stockholders of record entitled to express consent to corporate action without a meeting under section a.accordingly,the broadridge omnibus consents validly voted the shares held by those banks and brokers,without the need for a dtc omnibus proxy.
the court of chancery acknowledged that under section c it is the stock ledger that determines who are the record holders.it concluded,however,that the cede breakdown should be considered part of the stock ledger for purposes of section c,just as the cede breakdown has long been part of the stock ledger for purposes of section b.the court of chancery recognized that its new interpretation represents a change in how delaware practitioners understand the stock ledger for purposes of voting in fact,based upon prior delaware precedents,the court of chancery acknowledged that its own initial view was that the absence of a dtc omnibus proxy would be dispositive.
the court of chancery noted that the dtc system usually works well.the record reflects that the dtc omnibus proxy is routinely obtained and simply becomes another item on a preparation checklist.in this case,the absence of a dtc omnibus proxy did not result from a breakdown in the dtc system.the failure in this case was attributable to human oversight on someone party by not making a proper and timely request.the court of chancery concluded that insisting on the dtc omnibus proxy would disenfranchise the beneficial owners.to avoid that result it decided that delaware law would benefit from treating the cede breakdown as part of the stock ledger for purposes of section c.
the parties have extensively briefed and argued both sides of the issue of whether the cede breakdown is or is not part of the stock ledger for section purposes.given our ruling invalidating the votes attributable to the boutros shares,it is unnecessary for this court to decide that issue,because a decision either way would not alter the result we have reached nor would a gratuitous statutory interpretation resolving this difficult issue be prudent.the human failures that occurred in this case are easily avoidable in the future and may be a anomaly that may not again occur.
moreover,and in any event,a legislative cure is preferable.the dgcl is a comprehensive and carefully crafted statutory scheme that is periodically reviewed by the general assembly.indeed,the general assembly made coordinated amendments to section and section in.any adjustment to the intricate scheme of which section is but a part should be accomplished by the general assembly through a coordinated amendment process.therefore,the court of chancery interpretation of stock ledger in section is obiter dictum and without precedential effect.
crown bylaw amendments are invalid 
the court of chancery held that the crown consents are ineffective because they purported to amend the bylaws in a manner that conflicts with the dgcl.section b of the dgcl provides that the bylaws of a delaware corporation may contain any provision,not inconsistent with law or with the certificate of incorporation,relating to the business of the corporation,the conduct of its affairs,and its rights or powers or the rights or powers of its stockholders,directors,officers or employees.therefore,a bylaw provision that conflicts with the dgcl is void.
through the bylaw amendment to section,crown tried to reduce the board size below the number of currently sitting directors.generally,in a contested election,an insurgent first removes the challenged directors,then reduces the number of directorships,and then fills the vacancies we hold that was the legally proper sequence for accomplishing crown objective in this case.
crown could not follow that approach,however,because crown was not entitled to vote the series aa preferred to remove directors.under section k of the dgcl,shares can vote to remove directors only if they can vote to elect directors the series aa preferred does not vote to elect directors consequently,it can not vote to remove directors.
section b of the dgcl provides that t he number of directors shall be fixed by,or in the manner provided in,the bylaws,unless the certificate of incorporation fixes the number of directors,in which case a change in the number of directors shall be made only by amendment of the certificate.the emak charter does not fix the number of directors,which instead is addressed in section of the bylaws.therefore,the defendants correctly assert that stockholders exercising a majority of emak outstanding voting power,including the series aa preferred,can alter the size of the board through a bylaw amendment.
the dgcl addresses what happens with the directorships where the size of the board is increased.under section a,unless otherwise specified in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws,newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors elected by all of the stockholders having the right to vote as a single class may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office,although less than a quorum.although emak charter is silent on this point,section of its bylaws provides that the board may fill newly created directorships.under delaware case law,newly created directorships also may be filled by the stockholders 
the court of chancery recognized that this a reduction in the size of the an issue of first impression 
our law has not addressed what happens when a bylaw amendment would shrink the number of board seats below the number of sitting directors.the dgcl does not address it.no delaware court has considered it.none of the leading treatises on delaware law mention it indeed,no one seems to have contemplated it.
new section would reduce the board to three directorships at a time when five directors are legally in office.the court of chancery identified two possible scen
