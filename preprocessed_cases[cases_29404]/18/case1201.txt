the united states appeals from a district court order denying its motion to compel dow chemical company independent auditor,deloitte touche usa,llp to produce three documents in connection with ongoing tax litigation between dow and the government.the district court ruled that all three documents were protected from discovery under the doctrine.on appeal,the government contends that one of the documents is not work product because it was prepared by deloitte during the audit process.in addition,while it concedes that the other two documents are work product,it argues that dow waived protection when it disclosed them to deloitte.we vacate the district court decision that the document prepared by deloitte is work product and remand for in camera review to determine whether it is entirely work product.with respect to the other two documents,we affirm the district court decision that dow did not waive protection when it disclosed them to deloitte.
background 
this discovery dispute arises from ongoing tax litigation in the district court for the middle district of louisiana.the litigation concerns the tax treatment of two partnerships owned by dow chemical company and two of its subsidiaries.the first of these partnerships was chemtech royalty associates,chemtech i it was succeeded by chemtech ii,chemtech ii.in,dow filed a civil suit challenging irs adjustments to partnership returns filed by chemtech i and chemtech ii.chemtech royalty,united states,filed july.during discovery,the government subpoenaed documents from dow independent auditor,deloitte touche usa,llp.since the subpoena sought production in washington,it issued from the district court for the district of columbia.deloitte produced a number of documents,but refused to produce three documents dow identified as attorney work product.in response,the government filed a motion to compel production.
the three disputed documents are described in dow privilege log and in a declaration by william curry,dow director of taxes.the first document is a draft memorandum prepared by deloitte that summarizes a meeting between dow employees,dow outside counsel,and deloitte employees about the possibility of litigation over the chemtech i partnership,and the necessity of accounting for such a possibility in an ongoing audit.this meeting took place after dow informed deloitte about the likelihood of litigation over the chemtech i transaction.the second is a memorandum and flow chart prepared by two dow accountant and an attorney.the third is a tax opinion prepared by dow outside counsel.curry declaration explains that the second and third documents were disclosed to deloitte so that it could review the adequacy of dow contingency reserves for the chemtech transactions.according to curry,deloitte compelled dow production of these documents by informing the company that access to these documents was required in order to provide dow with an unqualified audit opinion for its public financial statements.the privilege log describes the subject matter of these documents as t ax issues related to the chemtech partnership and states that each one is a d ocument prepared in anticipation of litigation.we will refer to the first document,which was prepared by deloitte,as the deloitte memorandum,and the second and third documents,which were created by dow,as the dow documents.
the district court denied the government motion to compel without reviewing the disputed documents in camera.united states deloitte touche usa llp,d.it concluded that the deloitte memorandum was work product because it was prepared because of the prospect of litigation with the irs over the tax treatment of chemtech.id.at.the court further concluded that,although the document was created by deloitte,it was nonetheless dow work product because its contents record the thoughts of dow counsel regarding the prospect of litigation.id.in addition,the court rejected the government contention that dow had waived protection for the three documents.the court acknowledged that disclosing work product to a third party can waive protection if that disclosure is inconsistent with the maintenance of secrecy from the disclosing party adversary,id.at quoting rockwell int l dep t of justice,but concluded that dow disclosure to deloitte was not inconsistent with maintaining secrecy because deloitte was not a potential adversary and nothing suggested that it was unreasonable for dow to expect deloitte to maintain confidentiality,id.the government appeals this ruling,and dow has intervened to assert protection.since the government motion to compel was the sole issue before the district court,its disposition of that motion was an appealable final judgment.in re rim prods.liab.
ii.analysis 
the government contends that the deloitte memorandum is not attorney work product.alternatively,it argues that even if the deloitte memorandum is work product,dow waived protection when it orally disclosed the information recorded therein to deloitte.turning to the dow documents,the government concedes they are attorney work product,but argues that dow waived protection when it gave them to deloitte.we generally review the district court discovery orders for abuse of discretion.united states williams.if the district court applied an incorrect legal standard,however,we review de novo.in re sealed case.
a.the doctrine 
the supreme court established the doctrine in hickman taylor,which held that an attorney notes recording his interviews with witnesses to the incident were protected from discovery.id.at.the court recognized that to prepare for litigation,an attorney must assemble information,sift what he considers to be the relevant from the irrelevant facts,prepare his legal theories and plan his strategy without undue and needless interference.id.at.this preparation is reflected in interviews,statements,memoranda,correspondence,briefs,mental impressions,personal beliefs,and countless other tangible and intangible ways.id.the court reasoned that giving opposing counsel access to such work product would cause significant problems 
m uch of what is now put down in writing would remain unwritten.an attorney thoughts,heretofore inviolate,would not be his own.inefficiency,unfairness and sharp practices would inevitably develop in the giving of legal advice and in the preparation of cases for trial.the effect on the legal profession would be demoralizing.and the interests of the clients and the cause of justice would be poorly served.
id.consequently,the court concluded that attorney work product is protected from discovery unless the one who would invade that privacy carries the burden of establish ing adequate reasons to justify production through a subpoena or court order.id.at.
the doctrine announced in hickman was subsequently partially codified in federal rule of civil procedure b,which states 
a documents and tangible things.ordinarily,a party may not discover documents and tangible things that are prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial by or for another party or its representative including the other party attorney,consultant,surety,indemnitor,insurer,or agent.
b a.rule b allows a court to order disclosure when the requesting party can show a substantial need for the material and an inability to procure equivalent information without undue hardship.b a ii.when a court orders disclosure under this exception,however,it must still protect against disclosure of the mental impressions,conclusions,opinions,or legal theories of a party attorney or other representative concerning the litigation.b b.this type of work product,which is often described as opinion work product,is virtually undiscoverable,office of thrift supervision vinson elkins,llp.
b.the deloitte memorandum 
the government makes two categorical arguments that the deloitte memorandum can not be work product.first,it argues that the deloitte memorandum can not be work product because it was created by deloitte,not dow or its representative.second,it argues that the deloitte memorandum can not be work product because it was generated as part of the routine audit process,not in anticipation of litigation.if either argument is correct,the deloitte memorandum can not be work product,regardless of its contents.we reject both arguments,but nevertheless conclude that the district court lacked sufficient information to determine that the entire deloitte memorandum is work product.
the government first contends that dow can not claim protection for the deloitte memorandum because it was prepared by deloitte.rule b only protects documents and tangible things that are prepared by or for another party or its representative.b a.given this language,the government argues that the deloitte memorandum is not work product because deloitte is not dow representative.it relies principally on united states arthur young,in which the supreme court refused to recognize an accountant privilege.in arthur young,the court contrasted the role of an attorney with that of an accountant,explaining that an attorney is a loyal representative whose duty it is to present the client case in the most favorable possible light,whereas an independent certified public accountant has a public responsibility and owes ultimate allegiance to the corporation creditors and stockholders,as well as to the investing public.id.at.in the government view,arthur young demonstrates that deloitte can not be dow representative,which in turn means that the deloitte memorandum can not be work product under the plain language of rule b.dow counters that the representative for purposes of rule b is its counsel,whose thoughts and opinions are recorded in the document.in addition,it argues that the deloitte memorandum is work product because it contains the same type of opinion work product that is found in the dow documents,which the government concedes are work product.
even if the government is correct in asserting that the deloitte memorandum falls outside the definition given by rule b,this does not conclusively establish that it is not work product.the government mistakenly assumes that rule b provides an exhaustive definition of what constitutes work product.on the contrary,rule b only partially codifies the doctrine announced in hickman.rule b addresses only documents and tangible things,but hickman definition of work product extends to intangible things.at.moreover,in hickman,the court explained that the attorney mental impressions were protected from discovery,so that he could not be forced to repeat or write out that information in discovery.id.at.thus hickman provides protection for intangible work product independent of rule b.accord in re seagate,llc,in re cendant.sec,cir united states tonawanda trail,cir.
the government focuses on deloitte role in creating the document and on its relationship to dow.under hickman,however,the question is not who created the document or how they are related to the party asserting protection,but whether the document contains work thoughts and opinions of counsel developed in anticipation of litigation.the district court found that the memorandum records those thoughts,even though deloitte and not dow or its attorney committed them to paper.the work product privilege does not depend on whether the thoughts and opinions were communicated orally or in writing,but on whether they were prepared in anticipation of litigation.thus deloitte preparation of the document does not exclude the possibility that it contains dow work product.
the government next contends that the deloitte memorandum can not be work product because it was generated during an annual audit,not prepared in anticipation of litigation.the courts are not unanimous on the proper test for determining whether a document was prepared in anticipation of litigation.under the test adopted by most circuits,the question is whether the document was created because of the anticipated litigation.see,sandra berwyn sch.dist,cir in re prof ls direct ins,cir in re grand jury subpoena,cir pepsico,baird,kurtz dobson llp,cir maine dep t of the interior,cir montgomery county micro vote,cir united states adlman,cir union fire ins.murray sheet metal,cir.the fifth circuit,however,requires that anticipation of litigation be the primary motivating purpose behind the document creation.united states el paso,cir.
like most circuits,we apply the because of test,asking whether,in light of the nature of the document and the factual situation in the particular case,the document can fairly be said to have been prepared or obtained because of the prospect of litigation.in re sealed case,at quotation omitted.in addition,while this standard addresses a document,it applies equally to work product in other forms.thus for the deloitte memorandum,the question is whether it records information prepared by dow or its representatives because of the prospect of litigation.
in the government view,the deloitte memorandum was prepared not because of the prospect of litigation,but as part of the routine audit process.the government asserts that a document function,not its content,determines whether it is work product.for this proposition the government relies on delaney,migdail young,chartered irs.in delaney,a law firm sought to obtain under the freedom of information act memoranda and supporting documents relating to the government legal analysis of an internal revenue service program concerning the use of statistical sampling in auditing large accounts.in that case it was the irs that asserted protection.the court held that the documents were work product because they advise d the agency of the types of legal challenges likely to be mounted against a proposed program,potential defenses available to the agency,and the likely outcome.id.at.in its reasoning,the court noted that a previous decision had identified the function of the documents as the critical issue.id.at citing coastal states gas dep t of energy.the government seizes on this language,arguing that the deloitte memorandum is not work product because its function was to facilitate deloitte audit,not to prepare dow for litigation.
we think the government misreads delaney.while delaney used the term function,it was not considering any distinction between function and content in determining whether a document constituted work product.on the contrary,the court evaluated the function of the irs documents at issue by examining their contents.it contrasted the documents at issue in the coastal states case,which were like an agency manual,fleshing out the meaning of the statute it was authorized to enforce,with the documents at issue in delaney,which were memoranda describing potential legal challenges,possible defenses,and likely outcomes.id.delaney does not support the proposition that we should look solely to a document function divorced from its contents in determining its status as work product.
the government also relies on two decisions holding that a corporation tax accrual workpapers were not prepared in anticipation of litigation.in el paso,the fifth circuit applied the primary motivating purpose standard and concluded that el paso tax accrual workpapers were not work product because the company primary motivation in creating them was to bring its financial books into conformity with generally accepted auditing principles as required by federal securities laws.at.the court reasoned that the primary motivating force was not to ready el paso for litigation over its tax returns,but to anticipate,for financial reporting purposes,what the impact of litigation might be on the company tax liability.id.
in united states textron,cir en banc,the first circuit likewise held that a corporation tax accrual workpapers were not prepared in anticipation of litigation.applying the because of test,the court concluded that the workpapers were tax documents and not case preparation materials that were prepared in the ordinary course of business and that their only purpose was to support a financial statement and the independent audit of it.id.at.it found no evidence that the workpapers were prepared for potential use in litigation or that they would in fact serve any useful purpose for textron in conducting litigation if it arose.id.at.
the government argues that el paso and textron demonstrate that when a document is created as part of an independent audit,as the deloitte memorandum was,its sole function is to facilitate that audit,which means it was not prepared in anticipation of litigation.neither case convinces us.el paso was decided under the primary motivating purpose test,which is more demanding than the because of test we employ.under the more lenient because of test,material generated in anticipation of litigation may also be used for ordinary business purposes without losing its protected status.for example,in adlman,the second circuit considered whether a document containing legal analysis about possible future litigation qualified as work product when it was procured to assist the parties in deciding whether to go through with a proposed merger.the court held that 
a document created because of anticipated litigation,which tends to reveal mental impressions,conclusions,opinions or theories concerning the litigation,does not lose protection merely because it is intended to assist in the making of a business decision influenced by the likely outcome of the anticipated litigation.where a document was created because of anticipated litigation,and would not have been prepared in substantially similar form but for the prospect of that litigation,it falls within rule b.
at.under this same reasoning,material developed in anticipation of litigation can be incorporated into a document produced during an audit without ceasing to be work product.textron,which did apply the because of standard,is distinguishable because it turned on the court examination of the particular documents at issue.while the court concluded that those documents were not work product,it did not exclude the possibility that other documents prepared during the audit process might warrant protection.moreover,judge torruella dissenting opinion in textron makes a strong argument that while the court said it was applying the because of test,it actually asked whether the documents were prepared for use in possible litigation,a much more exacting standard.at.
in short,a document can contain protected material even though it serves multiple purposes,so long as the protected material was prepared because of the prospect of litigation.
rejecting the government categorical arguments establishes only that the deloitte memorandum may be protected work product under the law we must now determine whether it is.on examination of the record,we conclude that the district court did not have a sufficient evidentiary foundation for its holding that the memorandum was purely work product.according to the record,the document was created during deloitte preparation of an audit report which in deloitte view required consideration of potential litigation.the meeting generating the document included both deloitte and dow employees,as well as dow outside counsel.the document itself was prepared by a third party.while none of this negates the possibility of privilege,it could make it likely that the document includes other information that is not work product.according to dow privilege log and the curry declaration,the memorandum does contain thoughts and analyses by legal counsel,but this does not rule out or even render unlikely the possibility that it also includes other facts,other thoughts,other analyses by which may not be so intertwined with the legal analysis as to warrant protection under the doctrine.we will therefore remand this question to the district court for the purpose of independently assessing whether the document was entirely work product,or whether a partial or redacted version of the document could have been disclosed.accordingly,we vacate the district court decision that the deloitte memorandum was work product and remand so that the district court can examine the document in camera to determine whether it is entirely work product.see in re sealed case,at remanding for in camera review to determine whether documents were prepared in anticipation of litigation in re sealed case,f d,same.
c.the dow documents 
although the government concedes that the dow documents are work product,it contends that dow waived protection by disclosing them to deloitte.to the best of our knowledge,no circuit has addressed whether disclosing work product to an independent auditor constitutes waiver.among the district courts that have addressed this issue,most have found no waiver,regions fin.united states,wl,at.may,slip op.lawrence jaffe pension plan household int l,in re jds uniphase.sec,no.cw,wl,at,unpublished decision am.owners mut.prot.indem.ass alcoa,wl,at,unpublished decision frank betz,jim walter homes,merrill lynch,allegheny energy,in re honeywell int l.sec.litig,gutter dupont de nemours,wl,at.may,unpublished decision in re pfizer.sec.litig,civ,wl,at,unpublished decision.at least two courts have found waiver.medinol,boston scientific,in re diasonics sec,no,wl,at cal.june,unpublished decision.
while voluntary disclosure waives the privilege,it does not necessarily waive protection.united states am,at t.as we explained in at t,the privilege and the doctrine serve different purposes the former protects the relationship by safeguarding confidential communications,whereas the latter promotes the adversary process by insulating an attorney litigation preparation from discovery.id.voluntary disclosure waives the privilege because it is inconsistent with the confidential relationship.id.voluntary disclosure does not necessarily waive protection,however,because it does not necessarily undercut the adversary process.id.nevertheless,disclosing work product to a third party can waive protection if such disclosure,under the circumstances,is inconsistent with the maintenance of secrecy from the disclosing party adversary.rockwell int l dep t of justice,quoting at t,at.under this standard,the voluntary disclosure of attorney work product to an adversary or a conduit to an adversary waives protection for that material.
applying this standard,the government contends that dow has waived protection for the dow documents because deloitte is a potential adversary and a conduit to other adversaries.we reject both contentions and conclude that dow has not waived the protection.
the government contends that deloitte is a potential adversary of dow because disputes sometimes arise between independent auditors and their clients and because independent auditors have the power to issue opinions that adversely affect their clients.neither argument demonstrates that deloitte is a potential adversary for purposes of waiver analysis.first,as an independent auditor,deloitte can not be dow adversary.even the threat of litigation between an independent auditor and its client can compromise the auditor independence and necessitate withdrawal.see american institute of certified public accountants aicpa,aicpa professional standards,code of professional conduct hereinafter aicpa code of professional conduct discussing the effect of actual and threatened litigation on auditor independence.further,deloitte power to issue an adverse opinion,while significant,does not make it the sort of litigation adversary contemplated by the waiver standard.similarly,any tension between an auditor and a corporation that arises from an auditor need to scrutinize and investigate a corporation records and practices simply is not the equivalent of an adversarial relationship contemplated by the work product doctrine.merrill lynch,at.second,the possibility of a future dispute between deloitte and dow does not render deloitte a potential adversary for the present purpose.if it did,any voluntary disclosure would constitute waiver.yet the doctrine allows disclosures as long as they do not undercut the adversary process.see at t,at.
here,the question is not whether deloitte could be dow adversary in any conceivable future litigation,but whether deloitte could be dow adversary in the sort of litigation the dow documents address.we conclude that the answer must be no.in preparing the dow documents,dow anticipated a dispute with the irs,not a dispute with deloitte.the documents,which concern the tax implications of the chemtech partnerships,would
