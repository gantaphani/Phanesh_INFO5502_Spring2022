introduction 
kaswa corporation kaswa appeals from an amended judgment entered after the trial court granted the motion of postal instant press,pip,to add kaswa as a debtor.pip had obtained the judgment against shahid rangoonwala,a former shareholder of kaswa,for claims arising out of a franchise agreement to which kaswa was not a party.in this case of first impression in california,we analyze authorities nationwide and hold a third party creditor may not pierce the corporate veil to reach corporate assets to satisfy a shareholder personal liability.accordingly,we reverse.
under the standard alter ego doctrine,in appropriate circumstances the corporate form may be disregarded and the corporate veil pierced so that an individual shareholder may be held personally liable for claims against the corporation.some courts have recognized a variant of the alter ego doctrine,called third party or outside reverse piercing of the corporate veil,by which the corporate veil is pierced to permit a third party creditor to reach corporate assets to satisfy claims against an individual shareholder.
the reasoning of the cases adopting outside reverse piercing of the corporate veil is flawed,and we join other courts declining to accept it.as we will explain,outside reverse piercing is not a logical extension of the standard alter ego doctrine but instead addresses significantly different concerns.outside reverse piercing can harm innocent shareholders and corporate creditors,and allow judgment creditors to bypass normal judgment collection procedures.legal theories such as agency or respondeat superior and legal remedies such as claims for conversion or fraudulent conveyance adequately protect judgment creditors without the need to distort theories of corporate liability.
to address the many concerns created by outside reverse piercing,the courts recognizing the doctrine have created significant qualifications to its application.these qualifications swallow the rule in practice.pip failed to satisfy at least two of those of legal remedies and no harm to innocent,as a result,we would reverse even if we accepted the doctrine of outside reverse piercing.
in,rangoonwala and syed saeed ahmed purchased a pip franchise from the franchisee.on july,rangoonwala and ahmed executed an agreement and consent to assignment of the franchise.pip was a party to this assignment agreement and consented to the assignment of the franchise to rangoonwala and ahmed.rangoonwala and ahmed assumed the written contract the franchise agreement dated july,governing the relationship with pip and held the pip franchise as general partners.in may,rangoonwala and ahmed formed kaswa as a corporation and initially capitalized it with.kaswa was not a party to the franchise agreement or the assignment agreement.
sometime in,ahmed left the partnership that held the pip franchise and sold his equity interest in it to rangoonwala for.however,in october,rangoonwala signed an ownership structure addendum verifying both he and ahmed owned the franchise as a general partnership,with each having a percent equity interest in the franchise.
in late september or early october,after ahmed had left the partnership,rangoonwala asked pip director of credit and collections,edward longo,if kaswa could replace rangoonwala as the franchisee on the franchise agreement.longo refused.in a letter to rangoonwala,dated october,longo stated,a s soon as your new articles of incorporation are completed,please forward a copy to our legal department and they will make the necessary revisions to the franchise agreement.on october,rangoonwala,individually as the franchisee,signed an amendment to the franchise agreement.
in,pip filed a financing statement to perfect a security interest in certain property owned by rangoonwala,including machinery,equipment,and trade fixtures.
in september,a dispute arose between pip and rangoonwala concerning payment of royalties by rangoonwala to pip under the franchise agreement.pip and rangoonwala submitted the dispute to arbitration,as required by the franchise agreement.in february,the arbitrator issued an award of in pip favor and against rangoonwala.in june,the trial court granted pip petition to confirm the arbitration award,and judgment was entered against rangoonwala in the amount of,with postjudgment interest at the rate of percent per year.on the date judgment was entered,the pip franchise was owned solely by rangoonwala.
as part of its judgment collection efforts,pip hired a private investigator to investigate rangoonwala background and finances.during the course of the investigation,pip learned rangoonwala had a new partner named michael haxton and the two had sold all of the franchise assets to a company called definite impressions,a sole proprietorship owned by ward johnson.pip served johnson with a notice of levy on money,credit or debts belonging or owing to rangoonwala.pip also conducted an public records search on rangoonwala.
pip conducted a judgment debtor examination of rangoonwala in february.rangoonwala testified at the judgment debtor examination that kaswa had been formed for the purpose of operating the pip franchise and that kaswa owned the franchise assets.in,after ahmed had left the business,kaswa merged with a company called the print works,which was owned by haxton.the resulting company,which retained the name kaswa,continued to operate the pip franchise.according to rangoonwala,he no longer owned shares of kaswa,having walk ed away to put everything behind me.he did continue,however,to receive monthly draws of from the pip franchise through august.
soon after entry of the judgment against rangoonwala,kaswa sold the franchise assets to ward johnson and susan johnson the johnsons,doing business as definite impressions.according to rangoonwala,ward johnson basically came in and emptied out whatever was there basically in the business he took i just did want anything to do with it.
rangoonwala testified pip knew about kaswa because in he had asked pip to allow him to substitute kaswa as the franchisee.according to rangoonwala,pip declined,but told him he could add kaswa as an additional franchisee.rangoonwala was not interested in merely adding kaswa to the franchise agreement because in that case he would remain personally liable under the franchise agreement.in a declaration submitted in opposition to the motion to add kaswa as a judgment debtor,rangoonwala stated he was not opposed to adding kaswa to the franchise agreement,but pip did not pursue the matter.
in july,pip conducted a judgment debtor examination of haxton,who testified he was the sole shareholder and president of kaswa.haxton testified that rangoonwala had been the secretary and possibly a of kaswa,as well as a shareholder,but had walked away from kaswa several years earlier while owing the company for draws on his equity.haxton testified that kaswa sold its assets in august to the johnsons,doing business as definite impressions,for a price of and produced a copy of the written sale agreement.the agreement,dated august,called for a down payment of and installment payments for the balance over the next months.
in a declaration submitted in opposition to pip motion to amend the judgment to add kaswa as a judgment debtor,haxton stated he purchased ahmed interest in kaswa for since,rangoonwala personal assets were not commingled with kaswa kaswa and the print works merged in after the merger,haxton exercised control over kaswa and rangoonwala continued to operate the pip franchise,but did not participate in kaswa operation.according to haxton declaration,o ther than some minor equipment purchased by rangoonwala and a list of customers rangoonwala had acquired,k aswa contributed nothing significant to the merger and the new business except its name.
the johnsons made the down payment and five installment payments to kaswa.they stopped making payments sometime after january,when they learned of the judgment against rangoonwala.the johnsons believed the judgment constituted a breach of the agreement to purchase kaswa assets.
as of july,haxton was the only shareholder of kaswa.its only asset was the right to receive about from the johnsons under the agreement to purchase kaswa assets.kaswa conducted no business,did not maintain corporate records,and did not conduct shareholder meetings.
motion to add judgment debtor 
in october,after taking the judgment debtor examinations,pip moved pursuant to code of civil procedure section to amend the judgment to add kaswa as a judgment debtor.on december,the trial court heard oral argument,and,after addressing kaswa evidentiary objections,took the matter under submission 
on january,the trial court issued an order granting pip motion,concluding rangoonwala and kaswa were alter egos of each other.the court explained rangoonwala claims that he was no longer participating in kaswa at the time the underlying litigati o n commenced.however,as kaswa owned all of the printing equipment and rangoonwala was still a shareholder,this claim rings hollow.also,rangoonwala stated that the initial was used to purchase the franchise,for working capital,and to survive off of this shows that the capitalization of the company was inadequate and that kaswa money was used to purchase the franchise that was supposed to have been owned and operated by rangoonwala and ahmed.this also shows that the corporate assets were freely commingled with shareholder assets.the sole purpose in creating kaswa was to operate the postal instant press,inc.franchise therefore,by appearing in the underlying litigation,in which postal instant press,inc.was seeking royalty fees and advertising fund fees under the franchise agreement,rangoonwala was essentially defending both himself and kaswa against postal instant press,inc.allegations.kaswa claim that it would have asserted defenses in the arbitration is pure hindsight and speculation with no factual basis.
an amended judgment adding kaswa as a judgment debtor was entered on february.kaswa timely appealed from the amended judgment.
discussion 
code of civil procedure section authorizes a trial court to amend a judgment to add judgment debtors.hall,goodhue,haisley barker,marconi conf.center bd.th,d.kaswa argues the trial court erred by adding it as a judgment debtor because the alter ego doctrine may be used only to pierce the corporate veil to hold corporate officers and shareholders liable for the corporation debts and may not be used,as it was here,to hold the corporation liable for the debts of a shareholder.pip counters by arguing the alter ego doctrine may be used in either reach shareholder assets to satisfy corporate debts,or to reach corporate assets to satisfy shareholder debts.
neither here nor in the trial court did kaswa or pip cite the breadth of authorities we discuss in this opinion indeed,neither one has cited a single case accepting or rejecting the doctrine of outside reverse piercing of the corporate veil.our independent research and analysis lead us to reject outside reverse piercing.
government code section has been satisfied because pip knew of the outside reverse piercing issue and had full opportunity to brief it.section does not require that a party actually have briefed an issue it requires only that the party had the opportunity to do so.people alice cal th,d.both kaswa and pip argue outside reverse piercing of the corporate veil in their appellate briefs albeit without mentioning the doctrine by name.at pages of the respondent brief,pip specifically stated kaswa argues that the alter ego doctrine allows a court to disregard the corporate shield when an individual tries to shield personal assets by loading liability into the corporation,but not when the individual accepts the liability but loads the assets into the corporation.this distinction is a distinction without a difference.pip thus recognized the issue but stopped short of fully briefing it.by failing to cite pertinent authority to the trial court,kaswa and pip placed the trial court in the unacceptable position of having to make a difficult decision on an issue of first impression without the benefit of the parties presentation of adequate research and analysis.
outside reverse corporate piercing of the corporate and status in california 
the alter ego doctrine traditionally is applied to pierce the corporate veil so that a shareholder may be held liable for the debts or conduct of the corporation.some courts recognize the corporate veil may be pierced in reverse so that a corporation may be held liable for the debts or conduct of a shareholder.see,acceptance and application of reverse claimant.the typical reverse pierce case involves a corporate insider,or someone claiming through such individual,attempting to pierce the corporate veil from within so that the corporate entity and the individual will be considered one and the same.fletcher cyclopedia of the law of corporations.this is sometimes called i nside reverse piercing.in re phillips.
a variant of the reverse piercing theory,sometimes called outside or third party reverse piercing,occurs when a third party outsider seeks to reach corporate assets to satisfy claims against an individual shareholder.in re phillips,supra,at fletcher cyclopedia of the law of corporations,supra,acceptance and application of reverse claimant,supra.perhaps the oldest reverse piercing case is kingston dry dock lake champlain transp.cir kingston opn.by hand.there,the court recognized as a matter of federal law the possibility a parent corporation may be liable for the acts of its subsidiary corporation when the parent corporation directly intervened in the transaction,ignoring the subsidiary paraphernalia of incorporation,directors and officers.id.at.the court cautioned,however,that such instances,if possible at all,must be extremely rare.ibid.
the california supreme court has not spoken on the issue of outside reverse piercing of the corporate veil.whether to accept or reject the doctrine is an issue of first impression in this state.in support of holding kaswa liable for the judgment against rangoonwala,pip relies on a passage from a law review article published in and quoted in mesler bragg management cal d,mesler as the separate personality of the corporation is a statutory privilege,it must be used for legitimate business purposes and must not be perverted.when it is abused it will be disregarded and the corporation looked at as a collection or association of individuals,so that the corporation will be liable for acts of the stockholders or the stockholders liable for acts done in the name of the corporation.in this passage,the mesler court was quoting from a law review article entitled comment,corporations disregarding corporate entity one man company cal,which was published even before the kingston case.mesler was a traditional alter ego case,not a reverse piercing case,and therefore does not compel us to accept reverse piercing 
in taylor newton d,the court of appeal concluded a corporation was liable on a judgment against the corporation sole stockholder because the evidence supported a finding of alter ego.the court did not discuss the doctrine of reverse piercing or any of the problems it raises.rather,the court relied on traditional alter ego law to conclude that adherence to the fiction of a separate corporate existence would promote an injustice to the stockholder creditors.id.at.
pip argues nec electronics hurt d.supports imposition of liability on the corporation for a debt of a shareholder.that case was a traditional alter ego case the plaintiff secured a judgment against the corporate defendant,then moved to amend the judgment to add the corporation sole shareholder as a judgment debtor.id.at.the trial court granted the motion,but the appellate court reversed on the ground there was insufficient evidence to show the shareholder had an opportunity to litigate the underlying action between the plaintiff and the corporation.id.at.
ii.cases rejecting outside reverse piercing of the corporate veil 
we agree with the sound reasoning and analysis of the cases rejecting outside reverse piercing of the corporate veil.the court in olympic capital newman,described outside reverse piercing as a complete distortion of the alter ego doctrine.the court continued that doc
