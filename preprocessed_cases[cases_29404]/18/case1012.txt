glazer capital management,lp and glazer offshore fund glazer appeal from the district court august,judgment of dismissal.glazer claims arose after invision technologies,invision announced,in march,that it had entered into a merger agreement with general electric ge.several months later,in july,invision issued a press release,casting doubt on the merger because of the discovery of potential violations of the foreign corrupt practices act of fcpa.although the proposed merger ultimately was consummated,the july announcement resulted in an immediate drop in invision share price.a class action complaint was filed by invision shareholders and glazer was appointed lead plaintiff.
to support the shareholders claim,glazer focused on three alleged misstatements in the merger agreement,which invision had included as an attachment to its form filed pursuant to section of the securities exchange act of exchange act.those alleged misstatements appeared in the representations and warranties section of the merger agreement.the district court concluded that glazer had not adequately pled either falsity or scienter with respect to these alleged misstatements and dismissed glazer action.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we affirm.
prior to,invision was a publicly traded company engaged in the manufacture and sale of explosives detection systems eds.invision sold eds to airports for use in screening checked baggage.from the company inception in through,it shipped more than eds to customers in the united states and abroad.approximately of invision sales were made domestically,while were made to foreign clients in many parts of the world.for sales outside the united states,invision marketed its products through the use of authorized foreign agents and distributors.
invision business grew steadily during the company first decade.after september,however,demand for eds increased dramatically worldwide.in,invision entered into discussions regarding a possible merger with ge.on march,invision formally announced that it would be acquired by ge in a cash transaction for per share.the press release announcing the merger stated that the acquisition is subject to normal closing conditions,including customary regulatory approval.that same day,the company filed a form and attached a copy of its merger agreement.the merger agreement was signed by sergio magistri,invision president and chief executive officer ceo,and donald mattson,its chief operating officer coo.
several months later,on july,invision issued a press release stating that an internal investigation had revealed possible violations of the fcpa in connection with certain foreign sales transactions.invision announced that it had voluntarily reported the activities to the securities and exchange commission sec and the department of justice doj,but warned that subsequent investigations could potentially delay or terminate the merger.following the announcement,the price of invision stock dropped by more than six dollars per share.
a few days after invision announcement,shareholders filed a class action complaint in the northern district of california.glazer was appointed lead plaintiff,representing a putative class of investors who purchased invision stock between march,when invision announced the merger,and july,when it announced the potential fcpa violations.
on december,invision announced that it had entered into a agreement with the doj and had agreed to pay a fine of.the announcement also reported that invision had submitted an offer of settlement to the sec,which the sec staff had agreed to recommend.that same day,ge consummated the merger.
on february,the sec issued a order formally accepting invision settlement offer.the sec order gave specific details about invision fcpa violations,including that it authorized payments to foreign sales agents in china,the philippines,and thailand,despite knowing the high probability that those funds would be used to make improper payments to local government officials.the sec also faulted invision for failing to maintain proper internal controls and for failing to train its foreign distributors and sales agents adequately.
following the sec announcement,glazer filed an amended consolidated complaint with citations to the fcpa settlements.on january,the district court granted invision motion to dismiss the complaint,but allowed glazer leave to amend.glazer filed a second amended consolidated complaint on february.invision again moved to dismiss,and the district court heard arguments.a few weeks later,the sec announced that it had settled charges against invision former senior vice president for sales and marketing,david pillor,for his role in the company fcpa violations.ten days later,glazer sought leave to amend its complaint for a third time,in order to add allegations against pillor.the district court denied glazer request to amend its complaint,dismissed the second amended consolidated complaint,and entered a judgment dismissing the action.the present appeal followed.
glazer alleges that invision,along with its ceo and chief financial officer cfo,violated section b of the exchange act and rule promulgated thereunder.b.to state a claim under rule,a plaintiff must demonstrate a material misrepresentation or omission of fact,scienter,a connection with the purchase or sale of a security,transaction and loss causation,and economic loss.sparling daou in re daou,cir.under the heightened pleading standard of the private securities litigation reform act of pslra,b,complaints alleging misrepresentations or omissions under must specify each statement alleged to have been misleading,the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading,and,if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief,the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.
we first consider invision argument that the mere context of the three alleged misstatements renders them legally incapable of supporting a securities fraud claim,and that we need go no further.invision contends that because the statements appeared in the representations and warranties section of a private merger agreement directed solely to ge,the statements could not reasonably have been interpreted as factual communications to investors.to support this argument,invision refers to a passage in the merger agreement which provides that the agreement was not intended to confer upon any p erson other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.invision also refers to a separate section of the merger agreement,which rendered the entire agreement expressly subject to a disclosure schedule.because that disclosure schedule was never released to the public,invision argues that no reasonable investor would have relied on the representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement.
the context of invision alleged misstatements is certainly relevant to the issue of scienter,as discussed later.however,we do not accept invision argument that the mere context of the statements is enough to render these statements inactionable as a matter of law.invision proposed merger with ge was a very significant event for the company.invision could have expected intense investor interest in the details of the merger,particularly from institutional investors like glazer.the mere fact that the company chose to communicate the details of the merger in the form of an attachment to its form,as opposed to in the body of the document itself,can not work as a per se bar to securities law liability.moreover,that the merger agreement was a private document and included reference to a disclosure schedule would not,as a matter of law,prevent a reasonable investor from relying on its terms.therefore,we must move on to examine the substance of glazer pleading.
the first step in our analysis requires us to determine whether glazer has adequately pled facts showing invision representations to be false or misleading.glazer identifies three alleged misstatements in the merger agreement.
first,section a of the agreement broadly warrants that invision is in compliance in all material respects with all laws second,section d provides that invision is in compliance with the books and records provision of section b of the exchange act,b.finally,section d provides neither the company nor,to the knowledge of the company,any director,officer,agent,employee or other person acting on behalf of the company has violated the provisions of section of the exchange act.
to plead falsity properly under the pslra,glazer was required to specify each statement alleged to have been misleading,and provide the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading.b.if we were to accept the sweeping scope of the warranty contained in sections a,glazer could probably meet this standard merely by demonstrating that invision was in violation of any law at the time the warranty was made.
the district court,however,did not read section a so broadly.the court held that the broad representation at the start of section a was implicitly modified by the following sentence,which appeared later in the same section of the agreement 
since january,neither the company nor any of its subsidiaries has received written notice to the effect that a governmental authority claimed or alleged that the company was not in compliance with any law applicable to the company 
the district court read this section as welding a knowledge element onto the broad warranty contained at the start of section a.under this interpretation,invision was not warranting that it was in compliance with all laws merely that it was in compliance with all laws,as far as it knew then.this interpretation is not directly supported by the text of the merger agreement,and it appears to conflate the issue of scienter with the issue of falsity.moreover,the district court did not address the other alleged misstatements contained in section d.
under the plain language of the merger agreement,invision warranted that it was in compliance in all material respects with all laws,and more specifically,that it was in compliance in all material respects with the provisions of section b of the exchange act.glazer has pled facts demonstrating that invision was not in compliance with section b of the exchange act at the time the warranties were made the sec cease and desist order of february,stated that invision violated section b a by improperly recording in its books and records payments it made in violation of the fcpa and that invision violated section b b by failing to devise and maintain an effective system of internal controls to prevent and detect violations of the fcpa.therefore,we conclude that glazer has satisfied the pleading requirements of the pslra with respect to the issue of falsity.
whether glazer has adequately pled falsity with respect to invision third alleged misstatement in section d is a closer question,but it is a question we need not decide.as discussed later,even if glazer properly pled falsity,the district court dismissal would still be appropriate if glazer failed to plead scienter adequately with respect to the three statements.
the next step in our analysis is to determine whether glazer has properly pled the element of scienter,defined as a mental state embracing intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud.ernst ernst hochfelder,d.to plead scienter properly under the pslra,glazer was required to state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b.such an inference must be more than merely plausible or must be cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference of nonfraudulent intent.tellabs,makor issues rights,d.as we described in janas mccracken in re silicon graphics.securities litigation,plaintiffs proceeding under the pslra can no longer aver intent in general terms of mere motive and opportunity or recklessness,but rather,must state specific facts indicating no less than a degree of recklessness that strongly suggests actual intent,cir.
the three alleged misstatements on which glazer relies to show scienter all appeared in the merger agreement.the agreement was signed by two invision officers,but glazer has alleged scienter only on the part of one of them,sergio magistri.glazer also alleges scienter on the part of ross mulholland,invision cfo,based on his sworn certification included with invision form.we will discuss later whether this certification is sufficient to meet the scienter pleading requirements of the pslra.
the first issue we must consider,then,is whether glazer was required to plead scienter as to magistri as an individual,or whether it can rely on a theory of collective scienter,which would hold the company as a whole responsible for the statements contained in the merger agreement.
glazer urges us to follow the second and seventh circuits in adopting a theory of collective scienter for purposes of pslra pleading.as the second circuit described in teamsters local freight division pension fund dynex capital,
in most cases,the most straightforward way to raise an inference of scienter for a corporate defendant will be to plead it for an individual defendant.but it is possible to raise the required inference with regard to a corporate defendant without doing so with regard to a specific individual defendant.
cir.the seventh circuit reached a similar conclusion in makor issues rights,tellabs,holding that it is possible to draw a strong inference of corporate scienter without being able to name the individuals who concocted and disseminated the fraud,cir.to illustrate the point,the court gave the following example 
suppose general motors announced that it had sold one million suvs in,and the actual number was zero.there would be a strong inference of corporate scienter,since so dramatic an announcement would have been approved by corporate officials sufficiently knowledgeable about the company to know that the announcement was false.
see also caterpillar,great am.ins,cir stating,in dictum,there are conceivable situations where the individual actors would not be liable but their corporate employer would be,for example where a case depends on the collective scienter of its employees.
other circuits have disagreed with the collective scienter theory of liability.in southland securities inspire insurance solutions,the fifth circuit rejected the concept of group pleading whereby plaintiffs could presume that statements in prospectuses,registration statements,annual reports,press releases,or other information,are the collective work of those individuals with direct involvement in the everyday business of the company,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the court concluded that the group pleading doctrine conflicts with the scienter requirement of the pslra because the pslra requires plaintiffs to distinguish among those they sue and enlighten each defendant as to his or her particular part in the alleged fraud.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the eleventh circuit reached a similar conclusion in phillips,when it stated in dictum that the most plausible reading of the pslra in light of congressional intent is that a plaintiff,to proceed beyond the pleading stage,must allege facts sufficiently demonstrating each defendant state of mind regarding his or her alleged violations,cir footnote omitted.
our circuit has not previously adopted a theory of collective scienter.in nordstrom,chubb son,we touched on the issue indirectly in the context of an insurance dispute.cir.there the plaintiff sought to compel payment on an insurance policy covering the actions of its directors and officers.the dispute arose after a group of shareholders brought suit against the directors and officers of nordstrom and successfully obtained a million settlement.the defendant insurance company refused to cover of the settlement on the ground that the shareholders lawsuit had named both the directors and officers,who were insured,as well as nordstrom,which was not insured.the defendant argued that because nordstrom could have been found liable independent of the actions of its directors and officers,the insurance policy covered only of the settlement.we rejected this argument and held that there is no case law supporting an indepen
