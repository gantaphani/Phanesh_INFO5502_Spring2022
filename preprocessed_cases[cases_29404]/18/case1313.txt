in this appeal plaintiff miguel leyte vidal challenges an order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend in his shareholder derivative action against officers and directors of,a publicly traded company incorporated in delaware and headquartered in sunnyvale.plaintiff contends that he adequately pleaded facts excusing the requirement of a demand on the board of directors to pursue litigation on the corporation behalf.we agree with the superior court,however,that plaintiff failed to allege demand futility with the particularity required under delaware law.accordingly,we will affirm the judgment dismissing the action.
procedural background 
plaintiff initiated this action on july,asserting five causes of action against individual defendants associated with one day earlier plaintiff had dismissed a similar lawsuit he had maintained in federal district court in his original complaint in superior court he alleged insider selling,in violation of corporations code section breach of fiduciary duty for improper financial reporting,insider selling,and misappropriation of material nonpublic information abuse of control,gross mismanagement and waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment.these claims were based on losses caused by false statements to the public that did not reflect true financial picture,the company failure to control click fraud affecting internet advertisers and the delay in implementing project panama,a technology platform that was intended to help compete with google.in addition,several of the individual defendants were accused of illegal insider trading,having sold stock while in possession of undisclosed material adverse information.
three amendments followed,in the wake of successive orders sustaining each of defendants demurrers with leave to amend.on each occasion the superior court ruled that plaintiff had failed to allege facts specifically directed at demand futility with respect to at least half of the directors plaintiff claimed to be interested or not independent.consequently,plaintiff lacked standing to bring the action as a derivative lawsuit.finally,in its september,order,the court again sustained defendants demurrer but determined that plaintiff repeated failure to allege sufficient facts to establish his standing compelled it to conclude that there was no reasonable possibility that this defect could be cured by further amendment.from the ensuing judgment on december,plaintiff filed this timely appeal.
discussion 
standard of review 
a demurrer is properly sustained when the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.code civ,subd.e.as we noted in bader anderson th,d,it is not the ordinary function of a demurrer to test the truth of the plaintiff allegations or the accuracy with which he describes the defendant conduct.a demurrer tests only the legal sufficiency of the pleading.citation.thus,the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true,however improbable they may be.citations.on appeal from a dismissal following the sustaining of a demurrer,this court examines the complaint de novo to determine whether it alleges facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.like the trial court,we assume the truth of all properly pleaded factual allegations.whether the plaintiff will be able to prove these allegations is not relevant our focus is on the legal sufficiency of the complaint.los altos golf and country club county of santa clara th,d see also landmark screens,llc morgan,lewis bockius,llp th,d.further,we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.blank kirwan cal d.we do not,however,assume the truth of mere contentions or assertions contradicted by judicially noticeable facts.evans city of berkeley cal th,d,see also blatty new york times cal d,when the allegations of the complaint contradict or are inconsistent with such facts,we accept the latter and reject the former.
standing to assert a shareholder derivative action 
the parties agree that delaware law controls the outcome of this case and in particular,the adequacy of plaintiff pleading.a basic principle of the general corporation law of the state of delaware is that directors,rather than shareholders,manage the business and affairs of the corporation.citations.the decision to bring a law suit or to refrain from litigating a claim on behalf of a corporation is a decision concerning the management of the corporation.citation.consequently,such decisions are part of the responsibility of the board of directors.spiegel buntrock.
the derivative action developed in equity to enable shareholders to sue in the corporation name where those in control of the company refused to assert a claim belonging to it.the nature of the action is.first,it is the equivalent of a suit by the shareholders to compel the corporation to sue.second,it is a suit by the corporation,asserted by the shareholders on its behalf,against those liable to it.aronson lewis,aronson,overruled on another point in brehm eisner.
a derivative action,however,is in essence a challenge to a board of directors managerial power spiegel buntrock,supra,at,and thus it impinges on the managerial freedom of directors.aronson,supra,at see also south baker,in derivative action shareholder seeks to displace the board authority.in aronson the delaware supreme court expressed the view that the entire question of demand futility is inextricably bound to issues of business judgment and the standards of that doctrine applicability.the business judgment rule is an acknowledgment of the managerial prerogatives of delaware it is a presumption that in making a business decision the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis,in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company.citations.absent an abuse of discretion,that judgment will be respected by the courts.the burden is on the party challenging the decision to establish facts rebutting the presumption.at see also beam ex rel.martha stewart living omnimedia,stewart,beam plaintiff has burden to overcome presumption that directors were faithful to their fiduciary duties.thus,absent an allegation of interestedness or disloyalty to the corporation,the business judgment rule prevents a judge or jury from second guessing director decisions if they were the product of a rational process and the directors availed themselves of all material and reasonably available information.in re citigroup.shareholder derivative litigation.
the key principle underlying judicial analysis of a pleading asserting a derivative action is that the directors are entitled to a presumption that they were faithful to their fiduciary duties.beam,supra,at.because a shareholder in a derivative action contests the business judgment of corporate directors,shareholders seeking to assert a claim on behalf of the corporation must first exhaust intracorporate remedies by making a demand on the directors to obtain the action desired,or plead with particularity why demand is excused.spiegel buntrock,supra,at see.chancery court rule.the purpose of demand is to en sure that the stockholder affords the corporation the opportunity to address an alleged wrong without litigation,to decide whether to invest the resources of the corporation in litigation,and to control any litigation that does occur.spiegel buntrock,supra,at accord,brehm eisner,supra,at.
in order to be excused from the demand prerequisite to a derivative action,a shareholder must demonstrate through his or her pleading that a demand would have been futile.kaplan peat,marwick,mitchell.a showing of demand futility requires that the plaintiff allege with particularity why the stockholder was justified in having made no effort to obtain board action.king verifone holdings.as explained in aronson lewis,one ground for alleging demand futility is that a reasonable doubt exists as to whether the board is capable of making an independent decision to assert the claim if demand were made other reasons for showing demand excusal would be a majority of the board has a material financial or familial interest a majority of the board is incapable of acting independently for some other reason such as domination or control or the underlying transaction is not the product of a valid exercise of business judgment.id.at,fn.
the reasonable doubt that the plaintiff must raise to create demand futility depends on whether he or she is challenging a conscious decision by directors to act or refrain from acting or,in the absence of board action,whether the board that would be addressing the demand can impartially consider its merits without being influenced by improper considerations.rales blasband,rales.if a decision of the board to act or decline to act is under scrutiny,we use the aronson test described above the business judgment of the board is at issue.id.at.in those cases the pleading rules in delaware require the shareholder plaintiff to allege with particularity facts raising a reasonable doubt that the corporate action being questioned was properly the product of its business judgment.brehm eisner,supra,at.chancery court rule is not satisfied by conclusory statements or mere notice pleading.on the other hand,the pleader is not required to plead evidence.what the pleader must set forth are particularized factual statements that are essential to the claim.such facts are sometimes referred to as ultimate facts,principal facts or elemental facts.a prolix complaint larded with conclusory language does not comply with these fundamental pleading mandates.brehm eisner,supra,at,fn.omitted.
on the other hand,w here there is no conscious decision by directors to act or refrain from acting,the business judgment rule has no application.rales,supra,at.the absence of board action,therefore,makes it impossible to perform the essential inquiry contemplated by aronson whether the directors have acted in conformity with the business judgment rule in approving the challenged transaction.ibid.accordingly,in that case a court must determine whether or not the particularized factual allegations of a derivative stockholder complaint create a reasonable doubt that,as of the time the complaint is filed,the board of directors could have properly exercised its independent and disinterested business judgment in responding to a demand.id.at.
in this case the parties disagree as to which test of demand futility applies to plaintiff claims.plaintiff urges us to apply the aronson test,based on his allegations of insider selling and dissemination of false and misleading information to the public.defendants maintain that rales provides the applicable standard.the debate is largely academic.to satisfy either test,a plaintiff must comply with stringent requirements of factual particularity of court of chancery rule.wood baum,citing brehm eisner,supra,at.in any event,plaintiff insists that even under rales he adequately pleaded demand futility because he raised a reasonable doubt that six or more directors were able to independently consider a demand.we consider plaintiff position in light of the allegations of the operative pleading,the third amended complaint.as will become evident,the outcome is the same under either aronson or rales.
demand futility in the third amended complaint 
following demurrer on plaintiff original complaint in superior court,plaintiff eliminated all causes of action except the first two,which alleged violation of corporations code section and breach of fiduciary duty,both based on alleged insider trading by the insider selling defendants.the third amended complaint,however,added back the original claims of breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment.this final pleading asserted violation of corporations code section by the insider selling defendants breach of fiduciary duty and misappropriation of information by those same defendants,who sold stock while knowing that the company financial condition was materially overstated to the public breach of fiduciary duty against all defendants for allowing the dissemination of misleading and inaccurate financial information to shareholders breach of fiduciary duty against four of the defendants joshi,kern,bostock,and wilson for failing to ensure the accuracy of press releases and financial statements and for allowing insider selling to occur and unjust enrichment by the insider selling defendants.
plaintiff demand futility allegations consisted of the following concerns about each director.yang could not independently consider a demand because of his uniquely close relationship with the company,having and served as the chief from the company inception until his departure in.plaintiff also alleged that yang faced a substantial likelihood of liability for having engaged in insider selling.
bostock,according to plaintiff,had also participated in insider selling moreover,he knowingly authorized permitted the publication of false and misleading statements to the public,to securities analysts,and to shareholders.in addition,as a board member and member of the audit committee,bostock failed to remedy problems involving advertising services,the company acquisition of overture services,overture,development of the project panama technology,and improvement of software to prevent click fraud.in his capacity as a member of the compensation committee,bostock completely abdicated his duty to determine appropriate compensation for executives by approving the outrageous compensation of semel,the company chairman of the board and ceo.finally,bostock lack of independence was illustrated by his blind and unreasonable support of yang rejection of microsoft offer out of hand and his opposition to carl icahn proposal to replace the incumbent board with independent directors.
kern was not disinterested and independent,according to the complaint,for the same reasons described in the allegations regarding bostock.kern also had allegedly engaged in insider trading and had failed to adhere to his duties as a member of both the audit committee and the compensation committee.and,like bostock,kern was dominated and controlled by yang and had thwarted icahn efforts to replace board members.
the allegations as to hippeau overlapped those pertaining to bostock and kern.he,too,had engaged in illegal insider selling and had authorized permitted the issuance of false and misleading statements.further,as a board member,he had failed to act in the best interests of the company public shareholders in the face of the problems with project panama,the overture acquisition,and the software.
the picture was similar as to wilson he had participated in insider selling,and he had abdicated his duties as a member of the compensation and audit committees for the same reasons as had his colleagues.
the superior court assumed,for purposes of discussion,that plaintiff had adequately pleaded insider trading in the first and second causes of action but of the insider selling defendants,only five were directors at the time plaintiff action commenced yang,bostock,hippeau,kern,and wilson.because plaintiff could not plead facts indicating that at least six of the directors were interested because they had themselves engaged in insider trading,he had to identify at least one other director who was not disinterested and independent in order for him to show that demand would have been futile.
plaintiff efforts to allege demand futility with respect to the remaining directors focused on two of them burkle and joshi,neither of whom was accused of insider trading.the allegations targeting burkle otherwise were almost identical to those directed at bostock,kern,and hippeau in that burkle knowingly authorized permitted the publication of false statements disseminated directly to the public or made directly to securities analysts and which were made available and distributed to shareholders.like the other three,burkle benefitted from these statements by selling his stock at artificially inflated prices,although burkle was not identified as an defendant.also like the other three,burkle allegedly failed to take any action to correct problems associated with project panama,the acquisition of overture,or prevention software.burkle,too,was a member of the compensation committee,an
