for the purpose of preventing the unfair use of information which may have been obtained by a director by reason of his relationship to the issuer,any profit realized by him from any purchase and sale of any equity security of such issuer within any period of less than six months shall inure to and be recoverable by the issuer,irrespective of any intention on the part of such director in entering into such transaction suit to recover such profit may be instituted at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction by the owner of any security of the issuer in the name and in behalf of the issuer 
the united states district court for the southern district of new york harold baer,judge dismissed the complaint after determining that the individual defendants receipt and sale of shire securities,despite having wholly occurred within a period of less than six months,nonetheless fell within three different exemptions to section b prohibition against profit taking by issuer insiders.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court based on rule d,the exemption for transactions approved by the issuer board of directors.
background 
the securities transactions that are the subject of this lawsuit are rooted in a corporate merger wherein roberts pharmaceutical corporation roberts became a subsidiary of shire the merger prior to the became effective at on december,individual defendants were stock option holders and directors of roberts.one of the changes wrought by the merger was that the individual defendants became directors of shire,although the parties dispute whether that event technically occurred instantaneously with or subsequent to the merger.additionally,the agreement and plan of merger among shire and roberts the merger agreement called for all existing roberts stock options to be automatically converted into shire options at the moment the merger became effective 
at the effective time,shire shall assume or replace such options or fraction thereof so that each holder of an option an optionee shall have such optionee option apply to that number of ordinary shares adjusted to the nearest whole share equal to the product of i the number of all options of such optionee immediately prior to the effective time and ii the exchange ratio.the exercise price per share for each optionee options adjusted to the nearest pence assumed or replaced will equal the old exercise price per share of common stock divided by the exchange ratio without limiting the foregoing,the duration and other terms of each assumed or replaced option immediately after the effective time shall be the same as the corresponding options that were in effect immediately before the effective time,except that all references to roberts in the roberts option plans and the corresponding references in each option agreement documenting each such option shall be deemed to be references to shire or the surviving corporation,as applicable 
merger agreement art.vi,a.it is undisputed that less than six months after acquiring their converted shire options,each of the individual defendants exercised all or a portion thereof and sold those shares for a profit.
the plaintiffs filed this stockholder derivative action on december,in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.pursuant to section b of the securities exchange act,b,the plaintiffs sought to compel the individual defendants to disgorge profits realized through the sale of shire shares.
the individual defendants moved on march,to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.they argued that the securities transactions in question qualified for three separate exemptions to section b liability rule a the exemption for transactions by a person prior to his becoming an officer or director of the issuer,a rule b the exemption for transactions involving securities of a foreign private issuer,b and rule d the exemption for transactions approved by the issuer board of directors,d.the individual defendants also contended that receiving converted stock options as a result of a merger does not constitute the purchase of a security within the meaning of section b.
oral argument on the motion to dismiss was held on june and july.in a written decision dated august,the district court agreed that the individual defendants were exempt from section b liability under all three of the exemptions raised,but declined to determine whether the acquisition of converted stock options during a merger constitutes the purchase of a security covered by section b.
the plaintiffs appeal the district court ruling as to the applicability of all three exemptions to section b liability,while the individual defendants reassert their argument concerning the meaning of purchase under section b.because each of the three exemptions is an independent ground for dismissing the complaint,we affirm the dismissal based solely on rule d,the exemption for transactions approved by the issuer board of directors.in so doing,we express no opinion in respect of the other two exemptions relied upon by the district court and we assume,but do not decide,that receiving converted stock options in the context of a merger amounts to the purchase of a security as required for section b liability.

we review de novo a district court grant of a motion to dismiss a complaint made pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.see york ass of the bar of the city of,cir.in assessing the sufficiency of the complaint,we must accept the allegations contained therein as true and draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in favor of the plaintiff.see king am.airlines,cir.we are also free to consider documents that are incorporated into the complaint by reference or attached to the complaint as exhibits,or whose terms and effect are relied upon by the plaintiff in drafting the complaint.see chambers time warner,cir.dismissal is inappropriate unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts which would entitle him or her to relief.sweet sheahan,cir.
the issue we consider on appeal is whether,by operation of rule d,the individual defendants acquisition and sale of shire securities is exempt from section b of the securities exchange act and its ban against profit taking by issuer insiders.rule d provides,in relevant part,that any transaction involving a grant,award or other acquisition of issuer equity securities shall be exempt from section b liability if the transaction is approved by the board of directors of the issuer.d.accordingly,there are three requirements for a securities transaction to qualify for what we hereinafter refer to as the board approval exemption 
the transaction must involve the defendant acquiring issuer equity securities from the issuer 
the defendant must be a director or officer of the issuer at the time of the transaction and 
the transaction must be approved in advance by the issuer board of directors 
we examine each element of the board approval exemption in turn.
acquisition of issuer equity securities from the issuer 
here,all of the individual defendants received shire stock options as part of the merger.although each option only gave its holder the right to receive from shire a predetermined number of shares of shire stock,for purposes of the rules promulgated under section b the acquisition of a securities option is deemed to be equivalent to the acquisition of the security underlying that option.see ownership reports trading by officers,dirs.principal sec.holders,exchange act release transfer binder,fed.sec.cch,at,hereinafter release.
