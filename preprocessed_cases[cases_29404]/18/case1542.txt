the wagners and the jones es formed a partnership to buy an oxnard beach front townhouse in.
by the terms of their agreement,the partnership agreed to and did purchase the townhouse for.
the wagners agreed to and did contribute in cash for the down payment.jones es agreed to and did contribute in cash and promised to make all payments on a mortgage.
since the jones es cash,plus their promise to make the monthly mortgage payments added up to,the parties agreed to equalize their capital contributions.thus,the wagners paid an additional as set forth in the jamestown agreement.
before,property values dropped.
beginning december of,no further payments were made on the mortgage.
jones es requested the wagners utilize funds from a joint bank account to make mortgage payments.the wagners refused.
on a notice of default was recorded against the townhome.as of that date,the sum of was due on the mortgage.
delinquent installments on the mortgage eventually reached a balance due of and the bank foreclosed on the property on august.
both jones and wagner attended the foreclosure sale.a bid on the property by wagner pension trust and profit sharing trust was successful and the trusts purchased the townhouse at the foreclosure sale for sales price documentary tax trustee deed.
a notice to surrender possession was served on the jones es.
thereafter jones es vacated the premises.
the furniture and furnishings removed from the townhome were placed in storage.
alleged constructive fraud 
and jones first contend that the trial court erred in not finding the wagners committed constructive fraud.the specific conduct relied on to establish fraud is the wagners refusal to pay the delinquent mortgage from a partnership bank account the prepayment of property taxes on the town home from that account,allegedly depleting it so funds were not available to pay the mortgage and the wagners payment to themselves of the sum of from the partnership account.
and jones argue that the actions of the wagners led to the foreclosure and thus deprived the partnership of its main asset,the town home.they further contend that the actions of the wagners breached their fiduciary duties to and jones,as their partners,and that the wagners schemed to get the property into foreclosure so that their pension plans could buy it,thus eliminating the ownership interest of and jones in the property.
and jones rely on civil code section constructive fraud consists.in any breach of duty which,without an actually fraudulent intent,gains an advantage to the person in fault,or any one claiming under him,by misleading another to his prejudice,or to the prejudice of any one claiming under him or.in any such act or omission as the law specially declares to be fraudulent,without respect to actual fraud.
and jones cite byrum brand d,in which an investment adviser was sued for fraud and breach of fiduciary duty.the court noted that constructive fraud may be presumed from the parties confidential relationship or the circumstances of their dealings id.at,original emphasis.since this species of fraud does not depend on the existence of an actual fraudulent intent,it can be shown by breach of a fiduciary duty.id.at.thus,byrum held that it was error to give the jury a special verdict form which required finding of an intentional failure to disclose certain facts.id.at.
and jones also cite salahutdin valley of california,th,d,a real estate broker case in which the court found substantial evidence to support the trial court conclusion that the broker committed a constructive fraud by breaching his fiduciary duty to and salahutdin.the court said a s a general principle constructive fraud comprises any act,omission or concealment involving a breach of legal or equitable duty,trust or confidence which results in damage to another even though the conduct is not otherwise fraudulent.most acts by an agent in breach of his fiduciary duties constitute constructive fraud.the failure of the fiduciary to disclose a material fact to his principal which might affect the fiduciary motives or the principal decision,which is known or should be known to the fiduciary,may constitute constructive fraud.also,a careless misstatement may constitute constructive fraud even though there is no fraudulent intent.citation.id.at,d.later,the court said t here is no clear line establishing when a fiduciary breach of the duty of care will be merely negligent and when it may be characterized as constructive fraud.however,a breach of a fiduciary duty usually constitutes constructive fraud.citation.id.at,d,original emphasis.
there were unquestionably fiduciary duties among the partners here,as in all partnerships.the issue is whether there is substantial evidence to support the trial court conclusion that the wagners did not breach their fiduciary duties first,the trial court found that there was no legal or fiduciary obligation for the wagners to use partnership funds to pay the individual liability of jones for the jones es agreed capital contribution to the partnership.second,the trial court found t here was no duty on the part of the wagners to prevent the partnership property from going into foreclosure.third,the trial court found that the wagners were entitled to bid on and buy the property at the foreclosure sale through their pension trusts.
we agree with the wagners that the evidence is clearly sufficient to support the trial court findings.with regard to contributions,corporations code section provides that each partner has an account which is credited with the contributions made by the partner.the parties stipulated that and jones promised to make all the payments on the mortgage,but that they failed to do so,beginning in december.if the wagners paid these sums,they would,in effect,make contributions in excess of a percent capital contribution to the partnership,despite the agreement of the parties that contributions should be on a basis.
the wagners cite danelian mcloney d,to support their position.in that case,the parties formed a joint venture to acquire certain real property.id.at.one party agreed to pay the down payment,and the other agreed to pay principal payments on two trust deeds until had been paid.at that point,the party paying on the trust deeds would receive a interest in the properties.ibid.losses were to be divided equally,and the contract specifically provided that,if the one party failed to make the trust deed payments,the other could do so and thereby become sole owner of the property.id.at.no payments were made on the trust deeds,the property was sold at a substantial loss,and the defaulting party attempted to avoid liability by arguing that the other party was the owner of the property.the court found that the other party had not invoked the provisions allowing it to make payments for the defaulting party and that,as a result,the paragraph requiring equal sharing of losses applied.
in the present case,there was no comparable agreement allowing one party to pay contributions owed by the other party,and there was no provision allowing one party to make a contribution for the other more importantly,there was no agreement requiring such a payment for any reason,including preservation of the partnership property.nor have and jones cited any statutory or case authority that even suggests that a partner has the fiduciary duty to pay delinquent capital contributions for the other partner,fiduciary duties of partners.we emphasize that the parties only agreed to make capital contributions.neither agreed to be responsible for the capital contributions of the other under any circumstances,and their agreement that the contributions would be equal would be violated if any such contributions were made.
although the wagners would have been entitled to reimbursement from the partnership funds if they used their own money to pay to preserve the partnership property,subd.c,they were under no obligation to do so.the agreement of the parties was that and jones would pay the mortgage,and they breached the partnership agreement by failing to do so.we therefore agree with the wagners that substantial evidence supports the conclusion that they had no legal or equitable duty to make additional partnership contributions upon their partner failure to do so.
with regard to foreclosure,the evidence supports the conclusion that the partnership could not retain the town home indefinitely if and jones were not making their mortgage payments.even if,as and jones argue,the account was sufficient to make some payments to avoid foreclosure,the bank would obviously be forced to foreclose at some point if the mortgage payments were not being made.clearly,the foreclosure was caused by the failure of and jones to make the mortgage payments as promised,not by any actions of the wagners.
with regard to the wagners purchase of the property at the foreclosure sale,the law is equally clear that anyone,including a former partner,may bid at a foreclosure sale miller starr,cal.real estate ed.corporations code section,subdivision e specifically provides a partner does not violate a duty or obligation under this chapter or under the partnership agreement merely because the partner conduct furthers the partner own interest.
the wagners cite the venerable case of gunter laffan cal,in which our supreme court stated even if the parties were,or partners,there is no rule of law which would forbid one partner or from purchasing at a judicial sale,particularly under a judgment not obtained by him.id.at see also mcnutt nuevo land cal,in re levy schwab cal.shortly after gunter was decided,our supreme court said there can be no doubt that one partner may purchase with his own funds and on his own account the interest of his copartner in real estate at public sale,if there be no circumstances of fraud or of a trust,apart from this relation,and so purchasing hold the property as a stranger might.it is true,that partners occupy confidential relations towards each other,but this is in respect to the firm business but this relation does not forbid one from buying of another,when both have an equal opportunity and means of knowing the value of the property and its condition.the fact that the sheriff sale is public and open,is itself prima facie proof that no advantage is taken and no reasons of policy exist to restrain bidding by other partners than the defendant,and who would be more disposed to bid,probably,than strangers.bradbury barnes cal.
and jones do not cite any contrary authority.we agree with the trial court conclusion that i t was not a violation of any duty owed by the wagners to the jones for these employee trusts to acquire the property at foreclosure sale.
in summary,we agree with and jones that the wagners had fiduciary duties.corporations code section defines those duties as the duty of loyalty and the duty of care in the conduct of partnership business.nevertheless,we agree with the wagners that no breach of those duties was shown or,at least,that substantial evidence supports the trial court decision that there was no breach of any duty by the wagners that would justify an award of damages for constructive fraud 
objections to the accounting 
and jones next contend the trial court erred in overruling their objections to the accounting.first,they argue that the trial court erred by not requiring the accountant,wayne,to disclose the evidence that he reviewed and relied on as the basis for the accounting.they cite rice brown d,it would seem axiomatic that a referee can not make decisions based upon information or matters which would be inadmissible before court.id.at.the court then said what books and records of jack brown,et,were examined are not identified and there is no way of telling what the referee means as to other supporting evidence which he examined.id.at.
we are not persuaded.the reference in rice was considerably broader than the reference here.it included the power to examine witnesses,including the parties to the action.in the face of this reference,the court held that the reference order contemplated proceedings,that the referee would hold hearings,that any testimony given before him would be under oath and that any document received in evidence would be identified upon the oath of witnesses.rice brown,supra,d.accordingly,the court held that the findings had to be based on evidence admitted at the hearing.id.at.
in this case,the reference did not contemplate hearings or the taking of evidence.the court merely appointed wayne to render an accounting under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,and ordered the parties to deliver to him all books and accounting and bank records of the partnership,or any other documentation requested by the accountant.wayne report recaps the capital accounts of the parties,and it contains a number of schedules on various topics.however,it does not state what documents were received or reviewed.and jones contend that such a list was necessary in order for them to fully review and object to the accounting.
the wagners rely on de guere universal city studios,th,d.in that case,the court analyzed the reference provisions and cases in some detail.it noted that a reference for an accounting under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a is based on the rationale that t he reference is allowed because a trained accountant is generally better able to efficiently and inexpensively examine a long account than a trial court judge is able to do through adversarial court proceedings.the tension in this area is over how much latitude the accountant referee may exercise in making factual determinations.it does not matter that a particular referee has legal training.the scope of the reference is set by the constitutional limitations on delegation of judicial power to a referee.to do a proper examination of a long account,a referee needs to know two things each of which is within the proper ambit of his or her authority.first,the referee must know the proper accounting methodology to be applied.second,the referee must have the accounting records at issue.the parties must obtain the necessary records though discovery to enable the referee to perform the examination.deguere,at,d.
the duty to account to the partnership is part of each partner duty of loyalty,subd.b.to examine a long account under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,the accountant may examine the books and records of the partnership,and the partnership is required to make its books and records available to partners and their agents.such books and records are business records and therefore qualify as an exception to the hearsay rule.in addition,the accountant may contact the partners and third parties to obtain and verify information,and to fill in omissions in order to audit and reconstruct the books and records of the partnership.because of their fiduciary relationship,the records sought by plaintiffs herein were not the private property of defendant,but were subject to the rights guaranteed to the other partners to have access to all information pertaining to partnership affairs.mccain phoenix resources,d.in order to examine a long account under a code of civil procedure section,subdivision a reference,the accountant should therefore be given access to all information he or she deems nece
