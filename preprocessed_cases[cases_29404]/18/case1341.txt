glenn moss,appeals the dismissal of his action against robert kroner and robert kroner insurance services,collectively,the kroner defendants after they successfully demurred to his fourth amended complaint and the trial court denied leave to amend.we reverse the judgment,conclude that moss stated two viable causes of action under the corporations code,and remand the matter to the trial court.
factual and procedural background 
for the purposes of reviewing a dismissal after a sustained demurrer,we take all pleaded facts in the complaint as true.cobb th.in his fourth amended complaint,moss alleged that as a result of the solicitations of the kroner defendants and others,he invested in a diversified lending group,dlg secured investment note.dlg later was shut down by the securities and exchange commission for running a ponzi scheme.
moss did not sue dlg due to a federal court stay preventing it and its president,bruce friedman,from being named in lawsuits nor is he currently suing the person who actually sold him the note,scott plamondon,with whom he has previously settled his claims.instead,he sued the kroner defendants,who are alleged to have,inter alia,acted as the middle step in moss purchase of the note.robert kroner and milton belfer,both insurance agents,were allegedly principals of the corporate planning group cpg.in most instances in the fourth amended complaint,moss treated kroner and belfer,their respective insurance companies,and cpg as one entity,which he called the defendants.
moss alleged that cpg and dlg entered into a strategic alliance and joint marketing agreement by which cpg would promote dlg investment products and become the gatekeeper of transactions and relationships with dlg.as belfer wrote to dlg president,a ny business written must go thru sic kroner and me.we are controlling the activity so that your program is properly promoted cpg redesigned an investment program for dlg,prepared marketing materials for that program,and then disseminated the materials and discussed dlg,its president,and dlg notes at a roll out meeting for that program.plamondon attended the roll out meeting and later presented to moss the information he received there from belfer,kroner,and cpg.this information included six representations that moss has claimed to have been false 
dlg notes had zero risk 
dlg notes offered guaranteed returns of percent or percent,depending on the program 
dlg had never missed a payment to an investor 
dlg invested only in income stream properties 
dlg had been operating for more than years and 
dlg had more than million in assets under management.
plamondon conveyed these representations to moss on may,in the course of pitching the dlg investment.these representations,moss alleged,were material to his decision to invest in dlg.
moss asserted that the kroner defendants acted as gatekeepers for investments in dlg.they marketed dlg investment products and made arrangements with entities such as plamondon alleged employer,highland insurance,by which highland agents would encourage investments in dlg,collect applications and funds for those investments,and transmit them to belfer and kroner,who would in turn forward those materials to dlg.belfer and kroner would then share the commissions they received from dlg with the selling agents.
kroner and belfer,moss claimed,knew or should have known long before moss invested that something was wrong with dlg investments.the first sign of a problem,according to moss,was a communication from nfp securities to,inter alia,belfer,in which nfp stated that the dlg notes and secured real estate fund,either alone or in conjunction with the secured premium financing program,were securities.in march belfer allegedly produced a letter to nfp from an attorney stating that the notes were not securities but nfp found this letter inadequate and declined further involvement in dlg.later,in april,dlg informed the belfer and kroner defendants that it was being investigated for selling unregistered securities it had retained legal counsel who advised dlg to stop selling the notes because they were securities it would most likely be required to rescind the sale of its notes and that dlg would close down its investment notes program in order for dlg to prepare the necessary documents for the securities and exchange commission.
moss alleged that instead of discontinuing the investment scheme based on this information,kroner urged plamondon to sell with more urgency kroner contacted plamondon and told him that dlg was going to be closing down its dlg notes program for a number of months in order for dlg and its president to register the dlg notes,and encouraged plamondon to sell more dlg notes to his clients before the offering closed.kroner continued to process dlg investor applications from plamondon.
at the end of april,belfer and kroner received an email from another company reiterating the view that dlg notes were securities and warning them that selling those notes could constitute the illegal sale of an unregistered security.this message contained an attachment describing items of concern about dlg,its marketing materials,and inconsistencies that had been identified by the company securities counsel.by early may,moss alleged,the kroner defendants were aware of the following facts 
that the dlg reinsured notes were not fully insured and that only of an investor dlg investment was secured 
that there were issues with dlg financial records and reports,and that dlg claims of property ownership and value were not supported 
that dlg president background was an issue and 
that the dlg notes were securities and that they would need a securities license to participate in their sale.
on may,dlg president wrote an stating that no more dlg notes could be sold.moss alleged that this email was relayed to belfer.
on may,plamondon and moss met to discuss dlg.using the information and written materials he had obtained from the belfer and kroner defendants,plamondon told moss that dlg was a investment and that the investment notes offered by dlg were the best investment plamondon had the opportunity to sell in years.plamondon told moss that dlg president bought distressed properties from institutional owners,improved them,and then rented them,holding them in dlg portfolio.investor funds were used to acquire the properties and make loans.plamondon told moss that he could participate in an investment program that paid percent interest and was secured by dlg real estate portfolio worth in excess of billion.plamondon also told moss that the value of dlg real estate was far greater than its obligations to investors,and that because of the program conservative nature and the value of the properties,the notes were safe,zero risk,and secure.
moss alleged that the representations made by plamondon,based on information he received from the kroner defendants,were false and were material to his investment decisions.moss,an inexperienced investor whose inheritance was his retirement nest egg,relied on plamondon and the information he received from him regarding the proposed investment.moss had advised plamondon he would consider only investments that were secure,conservative,and posed minimal to no risk of loss to his monies.
in reliance on the representations about dlg and its investments,moss agreed to invest million with dlg for a term at a guaranteed annual rate of return of percent.plamondon filled out the dlg investor application with moss,as well as an authorization for the release of information that specified belfer,kroner,and cpg as authorized recipients of information about the dlg investment.moss questioned plamondon about the release,and plamondon told moss that regarding the dlg investments,he worked with belfer,kroner and cpg as a team.
plamondon collected the funds for the investment and the paperwork,and then transmitted them to the belfer and kroner defendants.moss alleged that the belfer and kroner defendants transmitted those items to dlg with a cover letter written by belfer on cpg letterhead.according to moss,the completed application identifies as receiving it.the sale of the dlg note to moss occurred on may.the defendants received approximately from the sale of the note to moss.
moss alleged that with respect to the solicitation,offer,sale and administration of moss dlg investment,the kroner defendants were acting as dual agents of dlg and of moss.conduct subsequent to the sale evidenced that agency status,according to moss on account statements pertaining to moss investment,dlg listed belfer as the agent.when dlg president disclosed to investors in december that he was a convicted felon who had previously filed for personal bankruptcy and who had been charged with mail fraud,kroner wrote to moss as a cpg client concerning the investment.kroner also telephonically reassured moss of the safety of the investment and claimed that he kroner would be the last person to take his money out of dlg as he would make sure that all of his clients got their money out of dlg first.
moss asked repeatedly for his money to be returned,but dlg never returned or refunded any of moss investment.although the securities and exchange commission has sued dlg and others,resulting in the appointment of a receiver who has filed suits in an attempt to recover dlg assets,there have been no distributions by the receiver to dlg investors.
moss sued,inter alia,the belfer and kroner defendants.in his fourth amended complaint,moss causes of action against the kroner defendants included violations of corporations code sections and.
in his first cause of action,moss contended that the note he bought constituted a security under california law and that dlg violated section by selling him a security that was neither qualified nor exempt from qualification requirements under the corporations code.moss further alleged that the kroner defendants materially aided in the sale of the dlg note to him and shared in the intent to defraud him,and therefore under sections and were jointly and severally liable with dlg for the violation of section.moss alleged that although the kroner defendants had been advised that the notes were securities and were not qualified for sale,they proceeded nonetheless to sell the notes including the sale to moss,which resulted in a commission of approximately to the kroner defendants and others involved in the sale.
in moss second cause of action,he contended that the kroner defendants,among others,had sold a security to him by means of written and oral communications including an untrue statement of material fact or omitting a material fact necessary to make the statement not misleading.the kroner defendants were alleged to have materially aided in the sale of the dlg note to have received the dlg application and check for from plamondon,who had received them from moss and then,as sales persons for dlg and agent,to have forwarded the items to dlg.the kroner defendants were also alleged to have created,along with others,the marketing materials that were used to sell the security to moss.moss asserted that the kroner defendants materially aided in the sale of the dlg note to him and shared in the intent to defraud him,and therefore under sections and were jointly and severally liable with dlg for dlg violation of section.
the kroner defendants demurred,and the trial court sustained the demurrers without leave to amend.the trial court dismissed the action as to the kroner defendants,and moss appeals with respect to the first two causes of action only.
discussion 
standard of review 
we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.citation.we also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.citation.further,we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.citation.when a demurrer is sustained,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.citation.and when it is sustained without leave to amend,we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment if it can be,the trial court has abused its discretion and we reverse if not,there has been no abuse of discretion and we affirm.citations.the burden of proving such reasonable possibility is squarely on the plaintiff.citation.blank kirwan cal d.
ii.first cause of action 
the trial court sustained the demurrer to the first cause of action for violation of section because the corporations code refers to a control person and these defendants are not control persons nor are the y alleged to be such persons anywhere in the fourth amended complaint.section provides that it is unlawful to sell unregistered securities in an issuer transaction except under specific circumstances.section provides that any person who violates section shall be liable to any person acquiring from him the security sold in violation of such section,establishing civil liability for the actual seller of the illegally sold security.
the trial court erred in concluding that the first cause of action failed because the defendants were not alleged to be control persons,because california law provides for numerous other actors to be held secondarily liable for the illegal sale of a security in violation of section.section,on which moss relies,provides that every agent who materially aids in the act or transaction constituting the violation is jointly and severally liable with the actual seller.an agent is defined by statute as any individual,other than a or a partner of a licensed,who represents a or who for compensation represents an issuer in effecting or attempting to effect purchases or sales of securities in this state,subd.a.with his allegations about the working relationship between the kroner defendants,cpg,and dlg by which the kroner defendants promoted,marketed,and participated in the sales of dlg investment products for a commission from dlg,moss adequately alleged in the fourth amended complaint that the kroner defendants promoted and represented dlg in effecting or attempting to effect sales of securities in california,and that they materially aided in the transaction that violated section.accordingly,moss stated a viable claim for a violation of section by means of section and the first demurrer to the first cause of action should not have been sustained 
section also furnishes a basis for liability here independent of whether the kroner defendants may be labeled agents within the meaning of section.section provides that any person who materially assists in a violation of section with the intent to deceive or defraud is jointly and severally liable with any other person who is liable for an illegal sale of unregistered securities under section.intent to defraud is defined as the intent to induce reliance on a knowing misrepresentation or omission.apollo capital fund roth capital partners th,apollo.therefore,to the extent that the fourth amended complaint alleges that the kroner defendants materially assisted dlg in selling unregistered securities and that they possessed the intent to defraud or deceive,the complaint properly alleges a claim for liability under section.here,moss allegations add up to a claim that perhaps as early as and certainly by april of,the kroner defendants were aware that investments in dlg were illegal securities and,as of april,they knew that the notes program was likely subject to an immediate shut down.based on this information,kroner contacted plamondon and urged him to sell as many of these unregistered securities as possible before sales were discontinued due to noncompliance with registration requirements.as of the time of moss investment,he has alleged,the kroner defendants knew not only that they were unregistered securities but also that the investment was not a proposition with a guaranteed return that the dlg reinsured notes were not fully insured and that only percent of an investor dlg investment was secured that there were issues with dlg financial records and reports,and that dlg claims of property ownership and value were not supported and that dlg president background was an issue but they continued to play their part in the sales transactions,including moss.these allegations are sufficient to state a claim that the kroner defendants materially assisted in the sale of unregistered securities in violation of section with the intent to deceive or defraud.
iii.second cause of action 
moss second cause of action,also for a securities violation,alleged a violation of section by means of sections and.section makes it illegal to offer or sell a security in this state or buy or offer to buy a security in this state by means of any written or oral communication which includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading.
section establishes civil liability for a violation of section any person who violates section shall be liable to the person who purchases a security from him or sells a security to him,who may sue either for rescission or for damages if the plaintiff or the defendant,as the case may be,no longer owns the security,unless the defendant proves that the plaintiff knew the facts concerning the untruth or omission or that the defendant exercised reasonable care and did not know or if he had exercised reasonable care would not have known of the untruth or omission.
in addition to the primary or direct civil liability established in section,the legislature has expressly extended liability for a violation of section to specified secondary actors by means of the same secondary liability statutes discussed above with reference to the first cause of action.sections and establish joint and several liability on the part of certain actors,including agents who materially aid in the transaction constituting the violation and persons who materially assist in the violation with the intent to deceive or defraud.apollo,supra,th at.the two statutes contain slightly different language describing that liability section makes its secondarily liable actors liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as the primary actor section simply makes them jointly and severally liable with the primary violator.
here,the trial court sustained the demurrer to the second cause of action,finding section inapplicable because it is clear from the fourth amended complaint and the previous pleadings that plaintiff bought his securities from dlg and not demurring defendants.we conclude that moss has sufficiently alleged a claim for violation of section by means of sections and.
privity for purposes of liability 
sec seaboard cir seaboard,on which the trial court relied to support its implicit conclusion that there can be no liability against anyone other than a direct seller for a violation of section,does not,upon a closer reading,so hold.the seaboard court observed that a corporation attorney could not be held liable for an illegal stock sale under sections and because he was not the direct seller of the stock.seaboard,at.the court of appeals did not,however,make any ruling purporting to bar joint and several liability under sections or whenever the defendant was not the direct seller of the security.to the contrary,the court of appeals noted the enacted section did in fact provide for liability for any person who materially assisted in a violation of section,but explained that section could not be applied because it was not yet in force at the time of the securities sale in question.seaboard,at,fn.the court of appeals did not mention section in seaboard.we suspect that this was because the appealing party was the attorney for a corporation and was not among the secondary actors,such as a control person,director,partner,or principal executive officer of a liable firm or corporation,an employee of a liable person,or a or agent,who could be held jointly and severally liable for a violation of section by means of section.
although seaboard has regularly been cited as the source of a rule that strict privity is required for any suit resting on an underlying violation of section,even if the liability is based on section or see,in re diasonics securities litigation,lubin sybedon,interpreting seaboard in this manner not only ignores its express recognition of section but also has the effect of reading sections and out of existence.numerous courts have recognized that strict privity is required only for claims of primary liability under section and,and not for secondary liability suits alleging joint and several liability for a violation of section by means of sections.see bains moores th,if control person liability were properly alleged under,plaintiffs needed to plead that they purchased securities from the company that was alleged to be liable under,not that they purchased them from the defendants alleged to be secondarily liable in re zzzz best securities litigation dist lexis,zzzz best strict privity not required with defendants where liability is alleged under alameda nuveen municipal high income opportunity fund dist lexis,strict privity not required for claims under openwave systems fuld dist,fn.strict privity not required where liability alleged under.as the court in zzzz best observed with respect to the control person liability provision of section,section does not in itself require privity.the need for privity stems from the liability derived from which the courts have uniformly interpreted to require privity.citation.however,this does not mean that the person alleged to be secondarily liable must be in privity with the plaintiffs.the person alleged to be controlled by the defendants must be alleged to be in privity with the plaintiffs.zzzz best,at see apollo,supra,th at of securities can not be held liable under section because he was not the direct seller,but may be secondarily liable under,bains moores,at.we agree with these courts that as long as primary liability is stated or established with the privity required by section and a violation of section,secondary liability may also exist under sections and for others who participated in the violation in the specific roles listed in those sections without any further need for privity between these secondarily liable actors and the plaintiff.accord,people ex rel.dufauchard th,declining to import the privity requirement for lawsuits alleging a violation of section through section to administrative proceedings under section alleging a violation of section.
privity for purposes of a remedy viterbi wasserman 
in a recent decision,viterbi wasserman th viterbi,the court of appeal for the fourth district concluded that secondary liability for defendants other than the seller of the security in a cause of action under section or depends on what remedy is available against the primary violator of the statute under section.if the available remedy is rescission,according to the viterbi court,then strict privity between the plaintiff and the secondarily liable defendants is necessary in order to maintain a claim.viterbi,at.we address the impact of viterbi here because it may fairly be inferred from the express allegations of the fourth amended complaint that moss still owns the security,and accordingly,if he were able to sue alleged primary violator dlg for a violation of section,his remedy against dlg under section would be rescission cobb,supra,th at.
in viterbi,supra,th at pages through,the purchaser of a security sold by alleged misrepresentation attempted to sue the advisor who encouraged and facilitated the sale but was not the actual seller of the security.the viterbi court observed that section provides that anyone who violates section by buying or selling securities by means of written or oral communications containing false statements or omissions of material fact shall be liable to the person who purchases a security from him,and that the wronged seller may sue either for rescission or for damages if the plaintiff or the defendant,as the case may be,no longer owns the security viterbi,at.section,therefore,limits a plaintiff remedy depending on whether or not he or she still owns the security in question if he or she retains it,then the remedy available is rescission if not,then damages
