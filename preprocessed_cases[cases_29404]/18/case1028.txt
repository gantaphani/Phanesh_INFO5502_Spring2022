we are called upon to interpret a corporation articles of organization to decide whether it has an obligation to redeem certain shares of its stock.
albert bolt owns shares of series a redeemable preferred stock series a stock issued by merrimack pharmaceuticals,merrimack,a biotechnology company organized under the laws of massachusetts.bolt now wants to redeem those shares.
the relevant redemption provision of merrimack restated articles of organization provides 
at any time from and after december,if the net worth of the corporation,determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and as shown on the balance sheet of the corporation as of the end of the fiscal quarter then most recently ended,equals or exceeds five million dollars,then upon the request of the holder of the series a preferred stock,the corporation shall redeem at the redemption price any and all shares of the series a preferred stock which such holder,by such request,offers to the corporation for redemption.
the following statement provides a snapshot of merrimack balance sheet as of december,
pricewaterhousecoopers llp audited merrimack financial statements,and opined that merrimack balance sheet referred to above presents fairly,in all material respects,the financial position of merrimack pharmaceuticals,at december,in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.
during,merrimack had issued shares of series b redeemable convertible preferred stock series b stock with a book value of.the series b stock is redeemable at the option of the holder upon a deemed liquidation,defined as a merger with another company,after which the merrimack stockholders would no longer hold a majority of the voting power,or the sale of merrimack business assets.the series b stock appears in the mezzanine of the balance sheet,between the liabilities section and the stockholders deficit equity section.see david herwitz matthew barrett,accounting for lawyers ed explaining that the section between liabilities and equity on the balance sheet is commonly referred to as the mezzanine.
on april,and again on march,bolt sent written requests to merrimack for the redemption of his shares of series a stock.in a letter dated june,merrimack rejected bolt demands for redemption.bolt filed suit in federal district court seeking a declaratory judgment that merrimack net worth exceeded million as of december.on for summary judgment,the district court granted summary judgment for bolt,concluding that merrimack net worth exceeded million as of that date.
merrimack timely appealed.
we are faced with the task of interpreting merrimack restated articles of organization to determine if it indeed has an obligation to redeem the series a stock held by bolt.the dispositive issue,of course,is whether merrimack net worth,determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap and as shown on the balance sheet,equaled or exceeded million as of december.the district court held that it did.we agree.
we must first determine the meaning of the term net worth,the threshold yardstick to determine whether merrimack has an obligation to redeem the series a stock as bolt requests.merrimack restated articles of organization fail to define that term.nor does gaap define that term.and no item on merrimack balance sheet is specifically labeled net worth.
merrimack is organized under massachusetts law,and therefore we apply that state body of law here.see order of united commercial travelers of am.wolfe.moreover,because articles of organization are contractual in nature,see willson laconia car,we look to massachusetts general contract principles.where the language of a contract is not ambiguous,we are instructed to give words their plain meaning,or their well established meaning.city of haverhill george brox,internal citations omitted see also erhard woolworth,freelander realty,restatement second of contracts.
the common and meaning of the term net worth is the difference between a corporation total assets and its total liabilities merrimack total assets and total liabilities,as shown on its december,balance sheet,equal and,respectively.accordingly,employing the meaning,merrimack net worth equals,well in excess of the million threshold set by the restated articles of organization.
merrimack suggests that net worth is sometimes referred to as stockholders equity this reference is often accurate because a balance sheet generally involves only three basic accounting,liabilities,and equity by definition equals the residual interest in the assets after subtracting liabilities yet,under this reasoning,merrimack net worth would still exceed million.
but merrimack goes further,arguing that the definition of net worth for purposes of its restated articles of organization equals only merrimack total stockholders deficit of,excluding merrimack total redeemable convertible preferred stock of merrimack contends that limiting the meaning of net worth to this amount is appropriate here because the restated articles of organization point to net worth as shown on the balance sheet and call for no further calculations.while this argument has surface appeal,we ultimately are unpersuaded.the restated articles of organization indeed point us to net worth as shown on the balance sheet.emphasis added.but there is no item so labeled on the balance sheet involved here.thus,such an interpretation of net worth is shown on the balance sheet only to the extent that we accept an additional premise necessary to connect it to the net worth reference in the restated articles of organization.either we accept merrimack premise that net worth is limited to total stockholders equity deficit on the balance sheet,or we accept bolt premise that net worth is commonly defined as the difference between total assets and liabilities.regrettably,the restated articles of organization provide no further guidance as to the proper definition of the term.given the common and meaning of the term net worth as the difference between total assets and total liabilities,we can not accept that the document reflects an intentionally narrower,more nuanced definition of that term that would equal only total stockholders equity deficit simply because it employed the phrase as shown on the balance sheet.we therefore decline to adopt merrimack definition here.
nevertheless,our analysis does not end with our construction of the term net worth.the restated articles of organization specify that the balance sheet relied upon must be determined in accordance with gaap if the balance sheet incorrectly reports total assets or total liabilities under gaap,our determination of net worth necessarily would be affected.
to determine whether the balance sheet is prepared in accordance with gaap,we do not take off our judicial black robes and reach for the accountant green eyeshade.rather,because generally accepted accounting principles are far from being a canonical set of rules that will ensure identical accounting treatment of identical transactions,and tolerate a range of reasonable treatments,we generally defer to the professional judgment of the accountant who audited or prepared the financial statements,unless a gaap authority demands a contrary accounting treatment.see thor power tool comm r,d see also united states basin power,cir en banc godchaux conveying techniques,cir.
merrimack argues on appeal that the series b stock,which is presented in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet,is akin to a liability under gaap authorities.of course,if the series b stock were considered a liability,merrimack net worth would not equal or exceed million.but merrimack balance sheet does not show the series b stock to be part of total liabilities.nor do we believe that gaap requires such accounting classification.
first,merrimack claims to find support in regulation of the sec,which requires certain stock to be presented on the balance sheet under the caption redeemable preferred stock and expressly prohibits including such stock under a general caption stockholders equity or combined in a total with preferred stocks,common stocks,or other stockholders equity.regulation.that regulation applies to any class of stock with the following characteristics 
it is redeemable at a fixed or determinable price on a fixed or determinable date or dates,whether by operation of a sinking fund or otherwise it is redeemable at the option of the holder or it has conditions for redemption which are not solely within the control of the issuer,such as stocks which must be redeemed out of future earnings.amounts attributable to preferred stock which is not redeemable or is redeemable solely at the option of the issuer shall be included under unless it meets one or more of the above criteria.
id.a emphasis added.
the parties do not dispute on appeal that merrimack series b stock falls within the scope of regulation and therefore is presented properly in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet.merrimack,however,places great weight on the fact that regulation requires such stock to be presented outside of stockholders equity,implicitly suggesting,merrimack urges,that it should be considered akin to a liability for purposes of determining net worth.
in our view,merrimack reads too much into regulation,which only requires that the series b stock be presented in a separate caption in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet,not that such stock be classified as part of total liabilities.indeed,in accounting series release,the sec expressly emphasized that these rules are intended to highlight the future cash obligations attached to redeemable preferred stock through appropriate balance sheet presentation and footnote disclosure.they do not attempt to deal with the conceptual question of whether such security is a liability.presentation in financial statements of redeemable preferred stock,accounting series release,transfer binder fed.sec.cch,at july,emphasis added.accordingly,we are not persuaded that regulation requires the series b stock to be classified as part of total liabilities on the balance sheet for purposes of calculating net worth.by reporting the series b stock in the mezzanine section,the balance sheet properly followed the presentation requirements set forth in regulation,which forms part of gaap.
second,both parties claim to draw support from accounting standards.see accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity,statement of fin.accounting standards fin.accounting standards bd hereinafter statement.we recognize,as does merrimack,that statement was not effective until after the balance sheet involved in this case was prepared.however,we believe that this statement offers helpful guidance that confirms our conclusion.statement requires that a mandatorily redeemable financial instrument,defined as a financial instrument that embodies an unconditional obligation requiring the issuer to redeem the instrument by transferring its assets at a specified or determinable date or dates or upon an event certain to occur,be reclassified as a liability.id,at emphasis added.even if statement applied in this case,the parties agree that it would not require the series b stock to be classified as a liability because redemption of that stock is conditional and expressly beyond the statement scope.see id.at.a redeemable preferred stock conditioned upon an event not certain to occur becomes mandatorily,therefore,becomes a that event occurs,the condition is resolved,or the event becomes certain to occur.id,at emphasis added.thus,while not applicable to the balance sheet at issue in this case,statement requirement that conditionally redeemable stock be classified as a liability upon the resolution of the conditional event suggests that under gaap such stock,like the series b stock here,should not be classified as a liability before that event.
finally,we have two additional gaap authorities to consider.merrimack points us to international accounting standards.see financial instruments disclosure and presentation,international accounting standards int l accounting standards bd.amended hereinafter international standard.that standard provides that conditionally redeemable preferred stock,like the series b stock in this case,should be classified as a liability while international standard is on point,we do not believe that it compels merrimack to restate the series b stock,which is presented in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet,as part of total liabilities.international accounting standards fall on the lowest rung of the gaap hierarchy in the united states.see supra.moreover,fasb,the organization charged with establishing gaap in the united states,has expressly declined to adopt international standard position with respect to classifying conditionally redeemable preferred stock as a liability 
the parties also direct us to fasb concept.but we do not believe the conceptual definitions found therein require a conclusion that the series b stock must be classified as part of total liabilities,contrary to the presentation on merrimack balance sheet.concept defines liabilities as probable future sacrifices of economic benefits arising from present obligations of a particular entity to transfer assets or provide services to other entities in the future as a result of past transactions or events,id,at,and equity as the residual interest in the assets of an entity that remains after deducting its liabilities,id,at.moreover,and more importantly,concept recognizes the conceptual difficulties with classifying certain hybrid securities like the series b stock at the nub of this case and instructs in such cases that the conceptual definitions are the starting point and provide a basis for assessing,for example,the extent to which a particular application meets the qualitative characteristic of representational faithfulness,which includes the notion of reporting economic substance rather than legal form.id,at emphasis added.
merrimack argues that the series b stock should not be considered equity pursuant to concept because that stock is not a residual interest.we appreciate,as do the parties,that the series b stock has a number of hybrid characteristics series b stockholders have a right to vote,together with the common stock as a single class,on all actions to be taken by the stockholders a right to elect one board member a dividend of four percent per annum of purchase price a liquidation preference before common stock,but after debts and liabilities and the series a stock preference a cash redemption right upon a deemed liquidation and at the election of the holder a right to convert such stock into common stock at any time according to a specified formula covenants and restrictions on certain actions by merrimack and a preemptive right.however,while recognizing that the series b stock does not fit neatly into either the definition of liabilities or equity under concept,we are unpersuaded that merrimack balance sheet,by not classifying that stock as part of total liabilities,is contrary to gaap.
in sum,finding no gaap authority that requires classifying merrimack series b stock as part of total liabilities,we defer to pricewaterhousecooper conclusion that merrimack balance sheet presents fairly,in all material respects,the financial position of merrimack pharmaceuticals,at december,in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.we therefore agree with the district court conclusion that merrimack balance sheet as of december,was determined according to gaap 
merrimack has an obligation to redeem bolt series a stock if its net worth equals or exceeds million.because we conclude that the term net worth for purposes of the restated articles of organization should be given its meaning as the difference between total assets and total liabilities,and because merrimack total assets and total liabilities equaled and,respectively,as shown on the december,balance sheet calculated in conformity with gaap,merrimack net worth exceeded million.accordingly,the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of bolt is
