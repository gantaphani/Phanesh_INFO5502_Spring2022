putative class representatives bryan harper and mark salzwedel appeal from the trial court order decertifying a limited class that had previously been recognized for their unfair competition claims under business and professions code sections and ucl claims challenging a form contract hour fitness,used to enroll new members.because the trial court decertification order is largely predicated on its erroneous legal assumptions concerning the scope of relief available in an individual action under sections and,we reverse.
factual and procedural background 
the dispute regarding membership renewal terms 
hour fitness operates workout and health club facilities throughout california.from until hour fitness offered memberships to use its facilities under a form contract that authorized a prepaid membership with a guaranteed renewal rate,the contract.harper and salzwedel became hour fitness members during this period and entered into prepaid,contracts.
the parties dispute the terms for the renewal period.harper and salzwedel contend the right to renew extended for three years,the same period as the term of their initial memberships hour fitness maintains the renewal clause provided for annual renewals only.upon expiration of their initial membership periods,hour fitness refused to allow harper and salzwedel to renew for a new term at the guaranteed rate,permitting renewals at the specified rate for an annual term only.
the class action complaint 
in february harper and salzwedel initiated this lawsuit and on june,filed a third amended putative class action complaint on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated,alleging hour fitness contracts and sales techniques were deceptive and falsely implied that members who prepaid their dues for the entire contract term were entitled to keep their dues at the same rate if they renewed their membership when the initial term expired.the complaint alleged causes of action for unfair competition and false advertising in violation of sections and,unfair or deceptive practices under the consumers legal remedies act,et,breach of contract and common law fraud and deceit.
in june harper and salzwedel filed a motion to certify two classes,one consisting of all persons in california who had entered into prepaid membership contracts with hour fitness,whether or not the individuals had renewed their memberships the second consisting of all persons in california who entered into any contract with hour fitness that contained several provisions harper and salzwedel contended were unconscionable.in their motion harper and salzwedel argued the contract provisions and associated representations presented identical violations of law and established a common factual predicate for all class members.in response hour fitness asserted that issues relating to contract interpretation and the negotiation of particular contracts presented questions requiring individual examination of the contracts in conjunction with parol evidence bearing on the contract terms.
the original class certification order 
on march,the trial court granted limited class certification,allowing class treatment for harper and salzwedel ucl claims,but denying class certification as to their unconscionability claims with respect to the ucl claims class,moreover,the court restricted participation to t hose persons who,on or after february,in the state of california,entered into a prepaid membership contract on a form with fitness,with an initial period exceeding months,and who renewed by prepayment for additional period in the same program that is,the same kind,type and benefits,and who did not permanently move during the term of their initial contract.
in addition,the court limited the basis for the ucl claims to the face of the contract form only,without reference to any alleged oral representations by hour fitness personnel.the court explained,limiting the claims to this proposed class satisfies commonality of the issues of fact and law,and avoids individualized inquiry into either qualification for inclusion in the class or entitlement to damages.
with respect to whether a class action was superior to a private attorney general action,the court found the matter to be a close question.the court determined that,although the costs of class notice were significant,a restitutionary remedy in a private attorney general action would carry many of the same costs involved in identifying those to whom restitution should be made.ultimately,the court concluded,a class action may be slightly superior to a private attorney general action.
motions for modification of the class definition 
after the trial court certified the class in march,multiple attempts were made by harper and salzwedel and by hour fitness to modify the definition of the class.first,harper and salzwedel sought to redefine the class to include their civil code section deceptive practices claim.on april,the trial court denied harper and salzwedel motion,concluding they were seeking certification of an entirely different class.next,on june,after hour fitness moved to limit the class originally certified,the trial court redefined the class to exclude those members who had bonus time notations written on the face of their contracts.the court explained its concern about the words bonus,bonus time or similar handwritten comments on the form contracts,the central purpose of limiting the class to the face of the form was to satisfy the numerosity and typicality criteria,and given the integration clause to avoid reference to prior representations not set forth in the writing itself the presence of these handwritten terms means that not all the putative class members contracts have the same terms.plaintiffs appear to simply ignore whether these notations may have any meaning.fn.omitted.the court can not wear the same blinders.
following additional discovery,on april,harper and salzwedel filed another motion to modify the class definition,contending the evidence they had developed showed the presence of the bonus words on the face of the contract did not affect the class members renewal rights.the court denied harper and salzwedel motion,stating,s ince plaintiff has thus far furiously resisted any attempt to allow extrinsic evidence,the present motion represents a reversal of position which,if carried to its logical conclusion,would require redefinition of or perhaps decertification of the entire class.
ultimately,seven attempts to change the class definition were made,three by hour fitness and four by harper and salzwedel,none of which was successful.the final effort was a motion by harper and salzwedel,filed october,to expand the class to include individuals who had signed the form,the successor to the form contract that had been the focus of the litigation for the preceding four years.harper and salzwedel explained they had learned through further discovery,contrary to hour fitness representations that the renewal language at issue in the form had been removed from membership forms,the identical language in fact appeared in the form in response,the trial court issued an order to show cause why it should not decertify the class,instructing the parties to brief the following issues the requirement for class certification that common issues predominate the requirement that a class action be a superior method of adjudication and the requirement of typicality.
the class decertification order 
on january,following briefing and oral argument,the trial court decertified the class.as suggested by its order for further briefing,in vacating its prior order certifying a limited class for harper and salzwedel ucl claims,the court reexamined the advantages of a class action for the parties and the court and reconsidered whether it was superior to proceeding by way of an individual action on the ucl claims.the court also reevaluated the issues of commonality and typicality.in particular,responding to harper and salzwedel insistence that hour fitness computer records were inaccurate and misleading and that each form contract needed to be individually examined to determine whether it fell within the bonus time exclusion,the court concluded,i t is clear from plaintiffs arguments that all the presumed economies from treating the sections and claims as class is,from not having to deal with each putative class member contract to be swept away.
to the extent individualized review of each member class claim now seemed to be required,the court was not persuaded by harper and salzwedel contention that common questions predominated sufficiently for the continued use of a class action.more significantly,the court questioned the continued benefit or superiority of class treatment.emphasizing the lack of progress since the original class certification order,the court found the unceasing process of attempting to define and redefine the class demonstrated the ineffectiveness of the class action at this point we are less than two months from the running of the five years for bringing this action to trial under ccp.the court issued the certification order over months ago,but class notice still has not gone out.indeed,to hear plaintiffs,we are today farther from giving class notice than we were on march,the date of the original class certification order,because we still need to revisit the issue of class definition.as this chronology makes clear,the issues of class definition and identification of the members of the class have taken on a life independent of the merits of the litigation,and indeed have apparently become the driving force.
in short,the court concluded,c lass certification has ceased to be beneficial.rather,class certification and class notice have become an obstacle to the prompt,fair,and reasonably economical resolution of this matter.accordingly,the court decertified the ucl claims class.harper and salzwedel filed a timely notice of appeal from the order decertifying the class.see linder thrifty oil cal th,d,denial of certification motion to entire class is an appealable order daar yellow cab cal d,trial court order that determines the legal insufficiency of the complaint as a class suit is in legal effect a final judgment from which an appeal lies see also aguiar cintas.th,d aguiar.
discussion 
the standards for review of a class certification order 
class actions are statutorily authorized when the question is one of a common or general interest,of many persons,or when the parties are numerous,and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court code civ.the certification question is essentially a procedural one that does not ask whether an action is legally or factually meritorious.drug stores,superior court cal th,d,drug stores.as the focus in a certification dispute is on what type of or likely to arise in the action,rather than on the merits of the case citations,in determining whether there is substantial evidence to support a trial court certification order,the reviewing court consider s whether the theory of recovery advanced by the proponents of certification is,as an analytical matter,likely to prove amenable to class treatment.id.at,d.t his state has a public policy which encourages use of the class action device.id.at,d,see aguiar,supra,th at,d.
the party seeking certification has the burden to establish the existence of both an ascertainable class and a community of interest among class members.drug stores,supra,cal th at,d.the community of interest requirement embodies three factors predominant common questions of law or fact class representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class and class representatives who can adequately represent the class.accord,fireside bank superior court cal th,d.t his means each member must not be required to individually litigate numerous and substantial questions to determine his or her right to recover following the class judgment and the issues which may be jointly tried,when compared with those requiring separate adjudication,must be sufficiently numerous and substantial to make class action advantageous to the judicial process and to the litigants.lockheed martin superior court cal th,d.
a class action also must be the superior means of resolving the litigation,for both the parties and the court.citation.generally,a class suit is appropriate when numerous parties suffer injury of insufficient size to warrant individual action and when denial of class relief would result in unjust advantage to the wrongdoer.citations.citation.r elevant considerations include the probability that each class member will come forward ultimately to prove his or her separate claim to a portion of the total recovery and whether the class approach would actually serve to deter and redress the alleged wrongdoing.citation.b ecause group action also has the potential to create injustice,trial courts are required to carefully weigh respective benefits and burdens and to allow maintenance of the class action only where substantial benefits accrue both to litigants and the courts.citation.newell state farm ins.th,d accord,aguiar,supra,th at,d see weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group,benefits of class action evaluated by interest of each putative class member in controlling his or her case personally potential difficulties in managing a class action nature and extent of already pending litigation by individual class members involving the same controversy and desirability of consolidating all claims in a single action before one court.
the trial court is generally afforded great latitude in granting or denying class certification,and we normally review a ruling on certification for an abuse of discretion.drug stores,supra,cal th at,d.this deferential standard of review,however,is inapplicable if the trial court has evaluated class certification using improper criteria or an incorrect legal analysis a trial court ruling supported by substantial evidence generally will not be disturbed unless improper criteria were used citation or erroneous legal assumptions were made.linder thrifty oil,supra,cal th at,d,accord,gattuso shoppers,cal th,d,drug stores,at,d,see bartold glendale federal bank th,d.
the decertification order is based on erroneous legal assumptions concerning the scope of individual actions under sections and 
when it originally granted limited class certification in march for harper and salzwedel ucl claims,the trial court characterized as a close question whether a class action would be superior to a private attorney general action for a fair and efficient adjudication of the litigation.as discussed,almost four years later,following multiple attempts by harper and salzwedel and hour fitness to modify the definition of the class and by hour fitness to have it decertified,the trial court reconsidered its decision and concluded the balance had shifted class certification has ceased to be beneficial.rather,class certification and notice have become an obstacle to the prompt,fair and reasonably economical resolution of this matter.
a significant factor in the court january,order reassessing the superiority of a class action was its belief in a representative action the relief granted under sections and may extend beyond the named parties.in addition,the court asserted a class action is unnecessary to provide the collateral benefits of deterrence and judicial economy because,should plaintiffs prevail,the deterrence function would be equally well served by injunctive relief against a practice by defendant and a restitutionary remedy,both of which are available under sections and even without class certification.the court also noted the absence of class claims should not prevent either retention or continuation of representation by counsel because the section and claims both provide for recovery of attorneys fees.
each of these points,essential to the trial court conclusion a class action was not advantageous to the judicial process or to the litigants,is legally incorrect.proposition,which the voters approved at the november,general election,modified the ucl by imposing new standing requirements for parties seeking relief under section standing is limited to certain specified public officials and to any person who has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of unfair competition and requiring individuals,such as harper and salzwedel,pursuing representative actions to satisfy the class action requirements of code of civil procedure section,see californians for disability rights mervyn llc cal th,d.proposition made identical changes to the requirements for standing and representative actions under section,the false advertising law.see californians for disability rights,at,fn,d.as a result of these amendments,absent class certification,in particular,extend beyond the named parties.these significant statutory changes apply retroactively to this case,filed before passage of proposition,but still pending californians for disability rights,at,d,and fundamentally undermine the trial court superiority analysis.see fireside bank superior court,supra,cal th at,d,rejecting argument,after adoption of proposition amendments,that class action not superior to individual,representative suit based on procedures for representative actions under the ucl.
moreover,even before adoption of proposition,there was no statutory authorization for an award of attorney fees to counsel for a successful plaintiff asserting ucl claims under sections.communications,cellular telephone cal th,d.recovery of attorney fees in ucl actions is dependent on the existence of relief restitution or disgorgement and application of the equitable common fund or substantial benefit doctrines see generally serrano priest cal d,serrano unruh cal d,consumer cause,gooch natural food markets,th,d or,in exceptional cases in which the action has resulted in the enforcement of important rights affecting the public interest,the private attorney general doctrine codified in code of civil procedure section.see graham daimlerchrysler cal th,d,branick downey savings loan cal th,fn,d.with the affirmance of the decertification order,contrary to the trial court prediction,the prospects appear dim for continued representation of harper and salzwedel as they pursue only individual claims against hour fitness.see baxter salutary sportsclubs,th,d affirming trial court denial of attorney fees to successful plaintiff who obtained modest relief in ucl action to ensure health club membership contracts conform with statutory requirements.
the other factor central to the trial court analysis,the ongoing difficulty in properly identifying the members of the certified class from hour fitness records,may be considered as part of a properly conducted evaluation of the superiority of proceeding by class action.however,the need to individually examine each member contract to ultimately determine whether he or she qualifies for inclusion in the class does not,as suggested,demonstrate a lack of ascertainability or manageability or establish that common questions of fact or law do not predominate.see lee dynamex,th,d.
with respect to the difficulty in confirming the identity of all class members prior to a determination on the merits,division one of this court recently affirmed certification of a class consisting of fedex drivers over fedex objection the members of this class shifted in and out,sometimes on a basis.estrada fedex ground package system,th,d.the court explained,the class is ascertainable if it identifies a group of unnamed plaintiffs by describing a set of common characteristics sufficient to allow a member of that group to identify himself as having a right to recover based on the description.citation.if fedex claim is that every member of the class had to be identified from the outset,fedex is simply wrong.accord,lee dynamex,supra,th at,d see also drug stores,supra,cal th at,d,a class action is not inappropriate simply because each member of the class may at some point be required to make an individual showing as to his or her eligibility for recovery bufil dollar financial group,th,d class of employees ascertainable in spite of absence of specific rest period records speculation that goes to the merits of ultimate recovery is an inappropriate focus for the ascertainability inquiry bell farmers ins.exchange th,d fact that class may ultimately turn out to be overinclusive not determinative most class actions contemplate eventual individual proof of damages,including possibility some class members will have none.
as to the issue of community of interest or the predominance of common questions of fact,although a review of individual contracts with a concomitant analysis of handwritten emendations may be required to identify whether an individual hour fitness member qualifies as a member of the class,from the outset the trial court was insistent the class action would be limited to issues appearing on the face of the contract without reference to oral representations.for their part,although continuing to contend members whose contracts include bonus time notations should not be excluded from the class,harper and salzwedel have consistently argued the form membership contract is fully integrated and their and the class ucl claims should be determined from the language of the form contract itself,which in their view unambiguously grants members the right to renew for more than an additional month period at the specified membership rate.the parties various efforts to refine,expand or contract the class of which were rejected by the trial no way destroy the commonality that exists in the class as defined.
disposition 
the order decertifying the class is reversed,and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.harper and salzwedel are to recover their costs on appeal.
i respectfully dissent.
it is true the trial court,in concluding class treatment was no longer the superior method to the resolve the claims,made several observations about the availability of relief and remedies in representative actions that do not reflect the current state of the ucl in the post proposition world.i am not convinced,however,that the trial court comments concerning the ucl,warrant reversal of the decertification order in view of the arguments on appeal and history of this case.likewise,as i shall explain,i agree with the trial court view that after five years of class status discovery it no longer appears that the individual class members share a community of interests.accordingly,i would affirm the trial court decertification order.
superiority of class treatment 
the majority characterizes as a significant factor that fundamentally undermines the trial court superiority analysis in the decertification order the trial court belief that in a representative action the relief granted under ucl sections and may extend beyond the named parties and may include restitution and attorney fees.in my view,the majority characterizations of the trial court comments as significant or fundamental factors in the court conclusion are not borne out in the record.instead,as reflected at the osc hearing on the decertification order,the trial court chief concerns lay elsewhere,namely,that given the class plaintiff seemingly endless efforts to increase the size of the class,the class action proceeding was no longer superior because it was no longer efficient,manageable or expedient.
the motivation behind the court original class certification order was to provide the parties an avenue to reach the merits of the claims expeditiously.however,the record shows class certification had the opposite effect and failed to confer any substantial benefit to the court or to the parties themselves.this lack of effectiveness is reflected throughout the record as the trial court openly critiqued the delay in reaching the merits of the claims.during the august hearing on a production request,the court granted appellants motion for production to expedite the discovery process and reach the merits of the claim.the court reasoned,
what i am doing is observing that it has taken us a heck of a long time to get where we are,a,and,b,as i understand it,there is little prospect of an end in sight.there is no light at the end of the tunnel.emphasis added 
part of what prompted the court to certify the class in the first place in such a limited manner was the belief that superiority of the
