plaintiff benefits committee of corporation and plaintiffs george amoss,bruce cowgill,stephen segebarth,and dennis baker,in their capacities as members of the benefits committee of corporation collectively,the benefits committee,appeal the grant of summary judgment to defendant key trust company of ohio,the trustee,which serves as the trustee of the furon company employee stock ownership plan the furon esop.the district court found that repayment by the furon esop of a loan to corporation,the successor corporation to furon,would violate the trustee fiduciary duties under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,stat,as amended,et.we reverse and remand.
background 
facts and procedural posture 
the parties stipulated below to the basic facts underlying this case,which the district court adopted.
the benefits committee is the plan administrator,as defined by erisa,of the furon esop.furon was the original plan sponsor of the furon esop.as described below,acquired furon in late.both the benefits committee and the trustee are named fiduciaries of the furon esop.
furon established the furon esop on february.the furon esop was intended to qualify as a stock bonus plan under a of the internal revenue code of the code,as amended,and as an employee stock ownership plan as defined by e of the code.the furon esop was designed to invest primarily in shares of furon stock.furon established the furon esop to provide eligible employees with the opportunity to obtain a beneficial interest in the company through the allocation of furon stock to individual participant accounts.
furon and ameritrust company national association entered into the furon company employee stock ownership plan trust agreement the trust agreement on february.the trust agreement provides for the establishment of the furon company employee stock ownership plan trust the trust to hold the assets of the furon esop,with ameritrust as the trustee.the trustee is the successor to ameritrust.
the benefits committee claims that under the trust agreement it has full discretion to construe and interpret the terms of the furon esop.the trustee is the custodian of the furon esop assets and holds those assets under the trust agreement it is responsible for making payments and distributions as provided in the furon esop and the trust agreement at the direction of the benefits committee,to the extent permitted by law.
the trustee caused the trust to enter into a series of loan transactions with furon,whereby furon loaned money to the furon esop to finance the purchase of furon stock the exempt loans.the exempt loans were permitted by the terms of the furon esop.the exempt loans are subject to erisa and the code,which generally prohibit loans between employers and the employee benefit plans they sponsor.however,the exempt loans were structured to fall within the exemption set forth in erisa,b,and the code.the exempt loans were made between october,and august,in the aggregate principal amount of.
the exempt loans were designed so that the trust,acting through the trustee,borrowed money from furon.the trustee then used the proceeds from the exempt loans to purchase furon stock,which was placed in a suspense subfund the subfund rather than allocated to the account of any individual furon esop participant.no security was pledged,rendering the exempt loans unsecured.
furon made contributions to the furon esop that the trustee used to make principal and interest payments to furon on the exempt loans.as the exempt loans were repaid,a portion of the furon stock in the subfund was released based upon a formula set forth in of the furon esop.as the furon stock was released,it was allocated to the individual accounts of the furon esop participants pursuant to and of the furon esop.thus,when the furon esop was first established,individual participant accounts were empty because all of the furon stock held by the trust was in the subfund.over time,as earned,the furon stock was transferred from the subfund and allocated to individual participant accounts.
on october,approximately of furon stock was acquired by fcy acquisition corporation fcy in a cash tender offer.fcy is a wholly owned subsidiary of.the acquisition included the purchase for cash of all the furon stock held by the furon esop,including the unallocated stock held in the subfund,at a price of per share.the purchase price represented a premium of over the market value of furon stock,which was valued at as of september.the cash proceeds from the sale of the furon stock in the subfund were approximately.as of october,the day before the acquisition,the furon esop included participants.
on november,the remaining outstanding shares of furon stock were acquired indirectly by through a merger of fcy with furon.as of that date,the subfund was composed solely of cash proceeds from the sale of the furon stock.on november,the principal amount of the exempt loans was.
on december,performance plastics,a wholly owned subsidiary of,was merged with the acquired furon.the new entity changed its name to performance plastics corporation plastics.thus,the current sponsor of the furon esop and the company referred to in the furon esop is plastics.
on march,the board of directors of plastics amended and terminated the furon esop,effective march.on march,the benefits committee notified the trustee by letter of the furon esop amendment and termination.
on may,requested a determination from the internal revenue service irs that termination of the furon esop and repayment of the exempt loans would not violate the code.on september,the irs issued a favorable determination that the amendment and termination of the furon esop did not adversely affect the esop status.
the benefits committee instructed the trustee to use the cash proceeds from the sale of the furon stock in the subfund to pay the balance of the exempt loans now payable to plastics.the trustee refused.nevertheless,on march,at the benefits committee direction,the trustee allocated the assets in the subfund,less the amount owing on the exempt loans,to individual participant accounts.in early june,furon esop participants were notified of the amount of their individual account balances and informed of the various distribution options available to them.later that month,the trustee began processing requests from furon esop participants for distribution.
neither nor plastics has made any contributions to the furon esop since furon was acquired by.likewise,the trustee has made no payments on the exempt loans since that time.thus,the amount in controversy is,the principal amount owing on the exempt loans as of november,and remaining money in the subfund.
the benefits committee filed suit in.the complaint set forth two causes of action.count one alleged that the trustee failure to repay the exempt loans with the cash proceeds from the sale of the furon stock in the subfund constituted a breach of the terms of the furon esop.count two alleged that the trustee failure to repay the exempt loans with the proceeds from the sale of the furon stock constituted a breach of its fiduciary duty.
with its answer,the trustee filed counterclaims against the benefits committee seeking a declaratory judgment that the trustee is precluded by erisa from using the proceeds from the sale of the furon stock in the subfund to repay the exempt loans the trust agreement requires the trustee to allocate the subfund to the participants in the furon esop in proportion to their current account balances and the benefits committee instructions to use the subfund to repay the exempt loans constitutes a breach of its fiduciary duties.
the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court granted the motion of the trustee and denied the motion of the benefits committee,holding that if the trustee were to repay the exempt loans with the assets currently held in the subfund,it would violate its fiduciary duties to the furon esop participants under erisa.the benefits committee appealed.the department of labor dol has intervened in this appeal as an amicus curiae in support of the trustee position.
ii.relevant documents 
trust agreement 
the benefits committee cites to g of the trust agreement,which states,
i f at the date of termination of the plan,the trustee remains indebted under any company stock loan,the trustee may pay accrued interest and principal and prepay the remaining principal balance of the company stock loan with shares of such plan held in the suspense subfund or with the proceeds of a sale or other disposition of such shares.if any assets remain in the suspense subfund after all company stock loans have been fully discharged,such assets will be allocated to the accounts of participants.
emphasis added.the language of this section is admittedly permissive rather than mandatory.
section d of the trust agreement sets forth the allowed methods of recourse in the event of of the exempt loans,quoting the limits on recourse in e 
under the terms of the company stock loan or other documents executed by the trustee in connection therewith,the lender shall not have recourse against the assets of the trust fund except that a company stock loan may permit recourse with respect to the collateral pledged as security for the company stock loan,contributions other than contributions of shares that are made to meet the trustee obligations under the company stock loan,and earnings attributable to such collateral and the investment of such contributions.
because no collateral was created,there will be no further contributions,and the trust contains no earnings,plastics has no recourse under d of the trust agreement in the event of by the trust.
section of the trust agreement states that the furon esop and the trust agreement shall be deemed to be and construed as a single document.
loan agreements 
the trustee relies on of the loan agreement with the company,which states,furon shall contribute to the trustee amounts sufficient to enable the trustee to timely pay the principal and any interest due and payable under section of this loan agreement.in addition,of the loan agreement sets forth the parties remedies in case of default 
a in the event of a default by the trustee the full amount of the outstanding principal balance,accrued and unpaid interest if any,and other sums then owing by the trustee under the note shall become immediately due and payable,without presentment,demand,protest or notice of any kind,provided,however,that furon shall have no recourse against the assets of the trust other than i any cash contributions made by furon under section and not previously paid to furon as loan payments,ii any shares that have not been released from the suspense account and iii the assets which may have resulted from the investment of the contributions referred to in i.a breach of the representations and warranties under section above and the failure to make any scheduled payment of principal of or interest on the notes other than solely as a result of furon failure to make required contributions shall constitute a default by the trustee hereunder 
b if furon shall fail to make contributions as required under section of this loan agreement,the trustee obligation to pay principal and interest due and payable under section of this loan agreement shall be suspended until such contribution is made,and such contributions shall be first applied to any past due interest and principal.
the parties agree that the trust failure to repay the exempt loans does not constitute a default under the terms of the loan agreements because its failure to repay is the result of the termination of the esop and end of further contributions thereunder.accordingly,the trust obligation under the loan agreements to make payments on the exempt loans has been suspended.it is also undisputed that the company can not make further contributions to the furon esop pursuant to the restrictions of the furon esop and the code.
furon esop 
section of the furon esop states,
in no event shall any part of the funds of the plan be used for,or diverted to,any purpose other than for the exclusive benefit of participants and their beneficiaries under the plan except as permitted under c or other applicable law.upon the transfer by a participating company of any money to the trustee,all interest of the participating company therein shall cease and terminate.
further,it is conceded that the company did not retain a security interest in the assets held in the subfund as collateral for the exempt loans.
the benefits committee points to of the furon esop,which states,
upon or after termination of the plan,the board of directors may terminate the trust.upon termination of the plan,whether or not the trust is then terminated,the trustee may pay in a single lump sum to each participant the full amount accredited to his individual account.upon the termination of the plan,the unallocated company stock in the suspense subfund attributable to an exempt loan from the company to the trust,and any unallocated proceeds attributable to the sale or other disposition of such company stock,which proceeds are held in the suspense subfund,shall,to the extent the fair market value of such unallocated company stock and the amount of such unallocated proceeds does not exceed the unpaid amount of any outstanding exempt loan from the company to the trust and to the extent permitted by the code and regulations,be returned to the company in full satisfaction of such exempt loan.to the extent such unallocated company stock and unallocated proceeds can not be returned to the company,or the fair market value of such unallocated company stock and proceeds exceed the company stock and proceeds returned to the company in satisfaction of an outstanding exempt loan,it shall be allocated to the accounts of participants upon termination of the plan in proportion to their account balances.without limiting the foregoing,any such distributions may be made in cash,company stock,other property,or any combination,as the committee in its sole discretion may direct.
this provision was amended on march,with the only significant changes being unallocated proceeds,as well as unallocated stock,are accounted for in the amended version and its provisions are triggered by termination of the trust or termination of the plan,regardless of whether the trust is terminated.

discussion 
erisa and esops 
erisa is a comprehensive statute designed to promote the interests of employees and their beneficiaries in employee benefit plans.shaw delta air lines,d.erisa regulates employee benefit plans,in part,by establishing strict standards of conduct,responsibilities and obligations for fiduciaries of the plans.b.an esop is one specific type of plan covered by the provisions of erisa.
an esop is a type of erisa plan that invests primarily in the stock of the employer creating the plan.roth lumber,cir see also d.an employer desiring to create an esop is required to execute a written document to define the terms of the plan and the rights of the beneficiaries under it.a.this plan must also name one or more fiduciaries who are to control and manage the operation and administration of the plan.id.a trust is established to hold the assets of the esop.a.
an esop assets are often derived from contributions from the employer to the plan in the form of the employer own stock or cash.an esop may also borrow money from a third party in order to invest in the employer stock.see b.if cash is contributed,the esop then purchases stock in the sponsoring company.this type of esop is called a leveraged esop and is the type of esop at issue in the present case.if a leveraged esop is created,the employer is obligated to make cash contributions to the esop,which in turn uses the cash to retire the loan debt.see donovan cunningham,cir.in the present case,after the esop borrowed money for the amount of the stock purchase,the stock was placed in a suspense subfund.as the esop makes loan payments using the cash contributions from the company,stock is released from the subfund and placed into the esop participants individual accounts.
ii.relevant statutes under erisa and the code 
section a of erisa provides the relevant fiduciary obligations under the statute,as follows 
a fiduciary shall discharge his duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries and 
a for the exclusive purpose of 
i providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries 
d in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan insofar as such documents and instruments are consistent with the provisions of this subchapter and subchapter iii of this chapter.
section of erisa discusses prohibited transactions 
a fiduciary with respect to a plan shall not cause the plan to engage in a transaction,if he knows or should know that such transaction constitutes a direct or indirect 
d transfer to,or use by or for the benefit of,a party in interest,of any assets of the plan 
erisa a d,a d.there is a parallel provision in the code.see c d.
section of erisa provides that the assets of a plan shall never inure to the benefit of any employer and shall be held for the exclusive purposes of providing benefits to participants in the plan and their beneficiaries erisa c,c.as quoted infra,of the furon esop includes this same language.
section of erisa provides a safe harbor exemption from the proscription of 
b enumeration of transactions exempted from section prohibitions 
the prohibitions provided in section of this title shall not apply to any of the following transactions 
a loan to an employee stock ownership plan as defined in section d of this title,if 
a such loan is primarily for the benefit of participants and beneficiaries of the plan,and 
b such loan is at an interest rate which is not in excess of a reasonable rate.
if the plan gives collateral to a party in interest for such loan,such collateral may consist only of qualifying employer securities as defined in section d of this title.
erisa b,b.as above with the list of prohibited transactions,there is a parallel exemption provision in the code.see d.
iii.dol opinion letters 
the dol has addressed the issue raised in this appeal in two opinion letters dated december,the letter and december,the letter.dol op,wl erisa,dol op.ltr,wl pension and welfare benefits ass.opinion letters need not be given deference under chevron,natural resources defense council,d.such letters may have persuasive value,however,if thoroughly considered and well reasoned.see,elwell.hosp.home care,d,stating that department of labor opinion was entitled to deference because it was a thorough,well reasoned and accurate interpretation of the relevant regulation kilgore outback steakhouse of florida,cir the opinion letters here fail to persuade us because they do not explain the statutory source for the limitation that they create.
both opinion letters deal with an issue concerning which funds can be used to repay the loans under the dol regulations.though also originally raised in this case,this issue was resolved by the district court in favor of the benefits committee and not challenged on appeal by the trustee or the dol.specifically,while e precludes recourse to other than the assets of the esop by persons entitled to repayment of a loan that is exempt under,it does not serve to limit the use of other assets by the fiduciary of an employee stock ownership plan to repay an exempt loan.wl,at,wl,at the department believes that the esop loan would not fail to be exempt solely because the appropriate plan fiduciary used assets of the esop other than those enumerated in section e to repay the loan.
after determining that use of subfund assets did not violate dol regulations interpreting erisa,the letter turned to the fiduciary question relevant to this appeal.the opinion letter quoted in full the relevant erisa provisions related to this question,including,and.then,the opinion letter proceeded with its analysis,which due to its brevity can be quoted in full here 
the appropriate plan fiduciary must consider the application of these provisions to the facts and circumstances of this case.in particular,the fiduciary must ascertain under the circumstances whether the lender has recourse to employer securities in the suspense account or proceeds received from the sale of such securities in the event of,whether the securities serve as collateral for the loan in the absence of such a determination,repayment by the plan of the balance remaining on the loan would appear to violate erisa sections c,a a,a b and a d because,assuming the loan complied with the terms of,the lender would have no right to employer securities held in the suspense account and the plan would have no legal obligation to repay the loan with the proceeds from the sale of the securities.
wl,at footnote omitted.the letter parroted this analysis 
as the department explained in advisory opinion december,the appropriate plan fiduciary must consider whether the lender has a security interest in the employer securities in the suspense account or the proceeds from the sale thereof in the event of default.in the absence of a determination by the plan fiduciary that the lender has an enforceable legal interest in the unallocated employer securities in the suspense account,repayment by the plan of the balance remaining on the loan through the sale or exchange of such securities would appear to violate erisa sections c,a a,a b and a d.the question of whether the lender has a security interest in the employer securities in the suspense account or the proceeds from the sale thereof is a question of state law interpretation.
iv.irs private letter rulings 
in two private letter rulings,the irs addressed the parallel code provision to erisa a d,regarding prohibited transactions,and the parallel exemption of that rule for qualifying esop loans in erisa b.see c d,d.in the ruling,irs priv.ltr.rul,wl,addressing an almost identical situation to this case,the irs concluded 
section b provides for repayment of an exempt loan in the event of default.however,the exemption provided by section d of the code,and described in the associated regulations will not fail to be met merely because a plan trustee sells employer securities and repays an exempt loan,not in default,if such transaction satisfies the primary benefit requirement based on all the surrounding facts and circumstances.
in the present case,no additional employer securities will be acquired subsequent to the tender offer because company n has no intention of continuing to maintain the esop.furthermore,a substantial premium was paid for the company m employer securities.after the loan is repaid,the balance remaining in the suspense account will be distributed to plan x participants and plan x will then be terminated.
accordingly,with respect to your requested ruling,we conclude,in the present case,that the proceeds from the sale,pursuant to the offer and merger,of the unallocated common stock in the plan x suspense account can be used to repay the outstanding principal balance on the loan without causing the loan to fail to meet the exemption provided by section d of the code.
wl no star paging provided.in an earlier analogous situation,the irs similarly held 
we hold that the prepayment by an esop of an exempt loan made to the esop is consistent with the above quoted language of section b of the regulations.this section of the regulations does not establish a per se prohibition against exempt loan prepayments by an esop.it requires that if an esop contemplates prepaying an exempt loan,the funds used to prepay the loan must be limited to the assets,qualifying employer securities acquired in the exempt loan transaction,whether or not those assets collateralized the exempt loan,plus income attributable to those assets,dividends,proceeds from a subsequent sale of the assets.in prepaying the loan,in other words,the esop may not use its other general assets.
irs priv.ltr.rul,wl,no star paging provided.both opinions,however,expressly indicated that the general fiduciary requirements under erisa and within the purview of the dol were not consi
