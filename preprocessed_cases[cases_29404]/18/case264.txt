this case raises the question of whether a shareholder proposal requiring a company to include certain candidates for the board of directors on the corporate ballot can be excluded from the corporate proxy materials on the basis that the proposal relates to an election under securities exchange act rule i,election exclusion or rule i.complicating this question is not only the ambiguity of rule i itself but also the fact that the securities exchange commission the sec or commission has ascribed two different interpretations to the rule language.the sec first interpretation was published in,the same year that it last revised the election exclusion.the division of corporation finance the division,the group within the sec that handles investor disclosure matters and issues letters continued to apply this interpretation consistently for fifteen years until,when it began applying a different interpretation,although at first in an ad hoc and inconsistent manner.the result of this gradual interpretive shift is the sec second interpretation,as set forth in its amicus brief to this court.we believe that an agency interpretation of an ambiguous regulation made at the time the regulation was implemented or revised should control unless that agency has offered sufficient reasons for its changed interpretation.accordingly,we hold that a shareholder proposal that seeks to amend the corporate bylaws to establish a procedure by which candidates may be included on the corporate ballot does not relate to an election within the meaning of the rule and therefore can not be excluded from corporate proxy materials under that regulation.
background 
the american federation of state,county municipal employees afscme is one of the country largest public service employee unions.through its pension plan,afscme holds shares of voting common stock of american international group aig or company,a corporation operating in the insurance and financial services sectors.on december,afscme submitted to aig for inclusion in the company proxy statement a shareholder proposal that,if adopted by a majority of aig shareholders at the company annual meeting would amend the aig bylaws to require the company,under certain circumstances,to publish the names of candidates for director positions together with any candidates nominated by aig board of directors proposal aig sought the input of the division regarding whether aig could exclude the proposal from its proxy statement under the election exclusion on the basis that it relates to an election.the division issued a letter in which it indicated that it would not recommend an enforcement action against aig should the company exclude the proposal from its proxy statement.american international group,sec letter,wl feb,aig letter.armed with the letter,aig then proceeded to exclude the proposal from the company proxy statement.in response,afscme brought suit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york stanton,seeking a court order compelling aig to include the proposal in its next proxy statement.the district court denied afscme motion for a preliminary injunction,concluding that afscme proposal on its face relates to an election.indeed,it relates to nothing else.am.fed of state,county mun.employees pension plan am.int l group,d.after this court denied afscme motion for expedited appeal,the parties stipulated that the district court opinion denying afscme motion for a preliminary injunction be deemed to contain the court complete findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to all claims asserted by plaintiff in this action and that it also be deemed a final judgment on the merits with respect to all claims asserted by plaintiff in this action.pursuant to this joint stipulation,the district court entered final judgment denying plaintiff claims for declaratory and injunctive relief and dismissing plaintiff complaint.
discussion 
rule i,also known as the town meeting rule,regulates what are referred to as shareholders proposals,that is,recommendation s or requirement s that the company its board of directors take some action,which the submitting shareholder s intend to present at a meeting of the company shareholders,a.if a shareholder seeking to submit a proposal meets certain eligibility and procedural requirements the corporation is required to include the proposal in its proxy statement and identify the proposal in its form of proxy,unless the corporation can prove to the sec that a given proposal may be excluded based on one of thirteen grounds enumerated in the regulations.id.i.one of these grounds,rule i,provides that a corporation may exclude a shareholder proposal i f the proposal relates to an election for membership on the company board of directors or analogous governing body.id.i.
we must determine whether,under rule i,a shareholder proposal relates to an election if it seeks to amend the corporate bylaws to establish a procedure by which certain shareholders are entitled to include in the corporate proxy materials their nominees for the board of directors proxy access bylaw proposal.in interpreting an administrative regulation,as in interpreting a statute,we must begin by examining the language of the provision at issue.resnik swartz,cir citing new york currency research cftc,cir.the relevant language here relates to an election is not particularly helpful.afscme reads the election exclusion as creating an obvious distinction between proposals addressing a particular seat in a particular election which afscme concedes are excludable and those,like afscme proposal,that simply set the background rules governing elections generally which afscme claims are not excludable.afscme distinction rests on rule i use of the article an,which afscme claims necessarily implies that the phrase relates to an election is intended to relate to proposals that address particular elections,instead of simply elections generally.it is at least plausible that the words an election were intended to narrow the scope of the election exclusion,confining its application to proposals relating to a particular election and not elections generally.it is,however,also plausible that the phrase was intended to create a comparatively broader exclusion,one covering a particular election or elections generally since any proposal that relates to elections in general will necessarily relate to an election in particular.the language of rule i provides no reason to adopt one interpretation over the other.
when the language of a regulation is ambiguous,we typically look for guidance in any interpretation made by the agency that promulgated the regulation in question.see auer robbins,d holding that an agency interpretation of its own regulation is entitled to deference provided that the regulation is ambiguous see also christensen harris county,d.we are aware of two statements published by the sec that offer informal interpretations of rule i.the first is a statement appearing in the amicus brief that the sec filed in this case at our request the second interpretation is contained in a statement the sec published in,the last time the sec revised the election exclusion.neither of these interpretations has the force of law.but,while agency interpretations that lack the force of law do not warrant deference when they interpret ambiguous statutes,they do normally warrant deference when they interpret ambiguous regulations.see christensen,at.citing auer,at.see also levy southbrook int l,cir explaining that courts will defer to an agency interpretation of its own regulation,presented in the agency amicus brief,unless the interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.
in its amicus brief,the sec interprets rule i as permitting the exclusion of shareholder proposals that would result in contested elections.the sec explains that f or purposes of rule,a proposal would result in a contested election if it is a means either to campaign for or against a director nominee or to require a company to include candidates in the company proxy materials.under this interpretation,a proxy access bylaw proposal like afscme would be excludable under rule i because it is a means to require aig to include candidates in the company proxy materials.however,that interpretation is plainly at odds with the interpretation the sec made in.
in that year,the sec amended rule i in an effort to clarify the purpose of the existing election exclusion.the sec explained that with respect to corporate elections,rule is not the proper means for conducting campaigns or effecting reforms in elections of that nature,corporate,political or other elections to office,since other proxy rules,including rule,are applicable thereto.proposed amendments to rule,exchange act release,proposed july,emphasis added statement.the district court opinion quoted the statement but omitted the italicized language and concluded that shareholder proposals were not intended to be used to accomplish any type of election reform.am.fed of state,county mun.employees pension plan,d at.clearly,however,that can not be what the statement means.indeed,when the sec finally adopted the revision of rule i four months after publication of the statement,it explained that it was rejecting a previous proposed rule which would have authorized the exclusion of proposals that relate to a corporate,political or other election to office in favor of the current version which authorizes the exclusion of proposals that simply relate to an election so as to avoid creating the erroneous belief that the commission intended to expand the scope of the existing exclusion to cover proposals dealing with matters previously held not excludable by the commission,such as cumulative voting rights,general qualifications for directors,and political contributions by the issuer.adoption of amendments relating to proposals by security holders,exchange act release,adoption.and yet,all three of these shareholder proposal voting rights,general qualifications for directors,and political comfortably within the category election reform.
in its amicus brief,the sec places a slightly different gloss on the statement than did the district court.the sec reads the statement as implying that the purpose of rule i is to authorize the exclusion of proposals that seek to effect,not election reform in general,but only certain types of election reform,namely those to which other proxy rules,including rule,are generally applicable.in,rule was essentially the equivalent of current rule,which requires certain disclosures where a solicitation is made for the purpose of opposing a solicitation by any other person with respect to the election or removal of directors.c.the sec reasons that,based on the statement,a proposal may be excluded pursuant to rule i if it would result in an immediate election contest,by making a director nomination for a particular meeting or would set up a process for shareholders to conduct an election contest in the future by requiring the company to include shareholder director nominees in the company proxy materials for subsequent meetings.
we agree with the sec that,based on the statement,shareholder proposals can be excluded under the election exclusion if they would result in an immediate election contest.we understand the phrase since other proxy rules,including rule,are applicable thereto in the statement to mean that under rule i,companies can exclude shareholder proposals dealing with those matters that,if addressed in a proxy alternative to a shareholder trigger rule,or the former rule.a proxy solicitation nominating a candidate for a specific election would be made for the purpose of opposing the company proxy solicitation and therefore would clearly trigger rule.accordingly,based on the statement,a shareholder proposal seeking to contest management nominees would be excludable under rule i.
by contrast,a proxy solicitation seeking to add a proxy access amendment to the corporate bylaws does not involve opposing solicitations dealing with the election or removal of directors,and therefore rule,or,equivalently,the former rule,would not apply to a proposal seeking to accomplish the same end.thus,we can not agree with the second half of the sec interpretation of the statement that a proposal may be excluded under rule i if it would simply establish a process for shareholders to wage a future election contest.
the statement clearly reflects the view that the election exclusion is limited to shareholder proposals used to oppose solicitations dealing with an identified board seat in an upcoming election and rejects the somewhat broader interpretation that the election exclusion applies to shareholder proposals that would institute procedures making such election contests more likely the sec suggested as much when,four months after its statement,it explained that the scope of the election exclusion does not cover shareholder proposals dealing with matters such as cumulative voting and general director requirements,both of which have the potential to increase the likelihood of election contests.see adoption.at.
that the statement adopted this narrower view of the election exclusion finds further support in the fact that it was also the view that the division adopted for roughly sixteen years following publication of the sec statement.see,union oil of,sec letter,wl,at,mobil,sec letter,wl,at,union oil of,sec letter,wl,at,unicare,sec letter,wl,at may,see also newbury,sec letter,wl,at.it was not until that the division first signaled a change of course by deeming excludable proposals that might result in contested elections,even if the proposal only purports to alter general procedures for nominating and electing directors.see,thermo electron,sec letter,wl,at,unocal,sec letter,wl,at,bank of boston,sec letter,wl,at,
because the interpretation of rule i that the sec advances in its amicus the election exclusion applies to proxy access bylaw with the statement,it does not merit the usual deference we would reserve for an agency interpretation of its own regulations.see thomas jefferson shalala,d quoting ins,d quoting watt alaska,d stating that an agency interpretation of a regulation that conflicts with a prior interpretation is entitled to considerably less deference than a consistently held agency view.the sec has not provided,nor to our knowledge has it or the division ever provided,reasons for its changed position regarding the excludability of proxy access bylaw proposals.although the sec has substantial discretion to adopt new interpretations of its own regulations in light of,for example,changes in the capital markets or even simply because of a shift in the commission regulatory approach,it nevertheless has a duty to explain its departure from prior norms.atchison,ry.wichita bd.of trade,d citing sec.of agric.united states.torrington employee ass nlrb,cir stating that an agency may alter its interpretation of a statute so long as the new rule is consistent with the statute,applies to all litigants,and is supported by a reasoned analysis.
in its amicus submission,the sec fails to so much as acknowledge a changed position,let alone offer a reasoned analysis of the change.the amicus brief is curiously silent on any division action prior to and characterizes the intermittent letters which continued to apply the position as mere mistake s.while we by no means wish to imply that the commission or the division can not correct analytical errors following a refinement of their thinking,we have a difficult time accepting the sec characterization of a policy that the division consistently applied for sixteen years as nothing more than a mistake.although we are willing to afford the commission considerable latitude in explaining departures from prior interpretations,its reasoned analysis must consist of something more than mea culpas.
accordingly,we deem it appropriate to defer to the statement,which represents the sec interpretation of the election exclusion the last time the rule was substantively revised.watt,at.deferring to an agency initial interpretation of a statutory provision where the interpretation was made contemporaneously with the provision original enactment and consequently rejecting the agency later conflicting interpretation we ther
