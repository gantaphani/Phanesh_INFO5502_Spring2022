plaintiff alliance payment systems,a california corporation aps,appeals from an order granting a new trial in its action against lisbeth walczer and reliable processing solutions rps walczer and rps are hereafter referred to collectively as defendants to collect amounts allegedly owed under a settlement agreement that divided a business.defendants have filed a protective from the judgment after a bifurcated trial.
in the first phase of the trial,a jury awarded aps damages under two provisions of the settlement agreement one prohibiting the parties from soliciting each other customers,and another requiring that the parties each forfeit to the other any revenue they received from the other customers,regardless of solicitation.in the second phase of the trial,the court found that the revenue forfeiture provision was unenforceable as an illegal restraint of trade,and the court subsequently ordered a new trial because the verdict may have erroneously awarded damages under that provision.
the principal issues presented are whether the settlement provisions are restraints of trade prohibited by business and professions code section,and,if so,whether they are excepted from the prohibition under business and professions code sections or we conclude that the provisions are restraints of trade,that the forfeiture of residuals for five years after dissolution,as discussed below,is illegal,but that the antisolicitation covenant is enforceable under section as a restraint imposed in connection with the dissolution of a partnership,or the disassociation of a partner.we agree with the trial court determinations,and affirm the new trial order.
factual and procedural background 
this lawsuit is part of the fallout from the breakup of the professional and personal relationship between lisbeth walczer and robert joyce,aps founder and sole shareholder.joyce and walczer are merchant service providers in the credit card industry.they solicit merchants to sign up with a third party processor of credit card payments,sell hardware and software to the merchants for credit card transactions,and service the merchants by helping them with supplies,equipment,and payments.service providers receive commissions known as residuals from the third party processor on credit card payments to their merchants.
joyce operated crown card services crown from to walczer worked for crown from to.thereafter,walczer worked at first data merchant services first data,and joyce started chestnut card services chestnut.walczer and joyce began living together in.in,joyce approached walczer about leaving first data at the time,chestnut was receiving residuals of per month through the third party processor american national bank anb.joyce proposed,in walczer words at trial,that we would join together and form a new company.we would take chestnut card services and rename it and form a joint venture or partnership,and we would work together.he would work on his side and i would start bringing in business from my side.
joyce and walczer signed the following agreement on may,
robert joyce bob and lisbeth walczer lis desire to enter into a business venture together.this document outlines their understanding,as evidenced by their signatures,of mutual objectives,responsibilities and compensation.

aps contracted with nova information systems,nova in june to process new accounts,and walczer brought in john gallups and charles malley in as sales representatives.malley,who had worked with walczer at first data,testified that when walczer called him about joining aps,she told him that she and joyce were partners in the business.joyce testified that he continued to service his anb accounts,and that the anb side of the business remained fairly stagnate from to,while the nova side grew thanks mainly to walczer efforts.
joyce acknowledged that,by october,walczer was bringing in residuals of more than per month,and had thereby satisfied the condition for obtaining percent ownership of aps under their may agreement.joyce told walczer that he considered her a percent owner,and he said at trial that,as far as he was concerned at that point,she could have taken whatever she wanted in compensation from the business.however,he did not give her any stock in aps because of tax considerations and concerns relating to his divorce proceeding.
at walczer request,joyce wrote and signed the following letter,dated october,
to whom it may concern 
i,robert joyce,being of reasonably sound mind,do hereby state the following information with regard to the proper distribution of the assets and liabilities of alliance payment systems,hereinafter referred to as aps,in the event of my death.
at the present time,i am listed as the only stockholder and corporate officer of aps.in june of,the name of chestnut card services was changed to alliance payment systems and a partnership between lisbeth walczer and me was created.in due course,this partnership will become officially sealed with the appropriate redistribution of stock,at which time lisbeth shall receive of the shares outstanding.this is my intention.
lisbeth presently performs her corporate functions with the title of vice president and as of october was added to the corporate checking account maintained with washington mutual bank.the purpose herein is to advise those who may be concerned about such matters that i hereby bequeath the portion of aps that i will retain once the transfer has been made official,to lisbeth,thereby giving her full and complete control and administration of the affairs of aps.
joyce and walczer relationship soured in,and they moved into separate residences.walczer said that,before they separated,he wrote her letters saying that he would rather be my lover than my business partner,but she had debated and decided that that was not a good way to go.walczer said that she proposed that we should separate the business at the end of,and joyce agreed.
walczer ran the business on her own in,using a bank account at morgan stanley in the name of aps sole proprietorship joyce authorized nova in january to deposit aps residual payments into that account,and thereafter received his residuals from walczer.walczer said that joyce offered to go to work for her in july as her office manager.walczer did not believe that joyce was qualified for the position,but suggested that he come into the office to see what was involved.he did so,was uncomfortable in the office,and the subject was dropped.
joyce and walczer failed to settle their business affairs in,and gave conflicting reasons for that failure.at the end of,joyce moved to reno and transferred all of the assets of aps to alliance payment systems,a nevada corporation.in january,joyce instructed nova to deposit aps residuals into his nevada bank account,rather than walczer morgan stanley account,to gain leverage against her in their dispute.
at the end of or beginning of,malley and gallups decided to keep their accounts with joyce,rather than walczer.walczer,who had been servicing those accounts,testified that malley sent out a letter on aps letterhead to the merchants telling them that their service was going to be switched to joyce number.joyce wrote walczer a letter on january,stating in part you will be paid in full for all of your own accounts in a timely manner and will continue to be paid as such so long as you agree not to attempt to move any accounts written by either john gallups or chuck malley,regardless of the reason.specific individual accounts of theirs may be negotiated should we ever reach a point whereby our dissolution is on course to be amicably resolved.
walczer filed a complaint against joyce on january,for breach of the may contract,which she called in her verified complaint a joint venture agreement for the conduct of the business of aps.the suit,which named aps as coplaintiff,alleged that walczer had performed all of the conditions required to obtain an equal interest in the business and aps,and sought injunctive and declaratory relief as well as damages.the cause of action for declaratory relief stated an actual controversy exists between walczer and joyce concerning their rights and duties with respect to the joint venture.walczer contends that she is an equal owner of the joint venture in the form of aps that the assets of the joint venture are in aps and the business conducted by aps,including all business previously conducted by joyce.joyce disputes walczer interest in the joint venture or aps,or in the business of aps,or the goodwill to the business,and contends that he has the sole and exclusive right of management including the right to direct contracting parties with aps,to make payments to him.
walczer sent joyce a letter dated april,requesting funds to reimburse her merchant servicing costs,and remarking,i never thought it would go this far or be this difficult to separate our business.joyce responded in a letter dated april,noting among other things that they had spent over one year discussing the termination of whatever it was we had together walczer then withdrew from aps washington mutual account,because,she said,she needed the money and wanted t o get joyce attention.joyce responded by threatening to have her criminally prosecuted.
after extensive,mediated negotiations,joyce and walczer overcame this impasse and along with aps entered into an agreement effective june,settling the lawsuit,which was described in the agreement as one in which walczer seeks an ownership interest in aps in the merchant accounts and other assets ostensibly held in the name of aps seeks to establish that a joint venture was created between her and joyce and a dissolution of the joint venture.the agreement divided aps accounts between those transferred to walczer,which included those procured by walczer,and those retained by aps,which included those procured by joyce,gallups,and malley.
the agreement contained the following key provisions central to this case hereafter sections d and e 
transition and future solicitation 
d no solicitation 
aps agrees that,for a period of five years after the date of this agreement,neither aps nor anyone acting for aps or joyce shall solicit or call upon any merchant whose account is one of the transferred accounts for the purpose of suggesting or causing the transfer of any transferred accounts away from walczer or any other business created by her,including reliable processing solutions.
walczer agrees that,for a period of five years after the date of this agreement,neither she nor anyone acting for her,nor any business with which she is affiliated,shall solicit or call upon any merchant whose account is one of the reserved accounts for the purpose of suggesting or causing the transfer of any of the reserved accounts away from aps.
e continuation of residuals from transferred and retained accounts 
this agreement is based in substantial part on the parties mutual assumption that the residual revenue from the merchant accounts will be divided between walczer and aps such that,in the near future,the residuals from the transferred accounts will be received by walczer,the residuals from the retained accounts will continue to be received by aps,and that neither party will obtain the benefit of any residuals which have been allocated to the other party,even where there has been full compliance with the provisions of sections a and d.accordingly,for a period of five years,in the event that an account residual payment which has been allocated to one party under this agreement is,for any reason whatsoever,hereafter received,directly or indirectly,by the other party,the latter shall be obligated to pay the entire amount of the residual from that account,the gross amount received for that account from nova or another processor back to the former party.the provisions of this subparagraph apply irrespective of any services rendered or expenses incurred relative to the account by the party receiving the residual from nova or other processor.
on september,joyce wrote walczer and accused her of breaching section d antisolicitation covenant.on october,walczer counsel wrote joyce counsel advising that walczer denied solicitation of any kind,and charging that section e was inserted into the agreement without her knowledge.joyce counsel replied that section e had been specifically negotiated between bob and li s.joyce admitted at trial that he had not spoken to walczer about section e.walczer said at trial that she would sign the agreement today were it not for section e.
aps complaint in this case,filed in november,asserted causes of action under the settlement agreement for promissory fraud,breach of contract,and interference with economic relations in the alternative,to the extent that the settlement agreement was invalidated,causes of action were pled for,and breach of fiduciary duty.defendants filed a against aps and joyce,seeking reformation of the settlement agreement to delete section e or a declaration that section e was unlawful and unenforceable,and damages under several theories including breach of contract.in june,aps moved for summary judgment or adjudication on the.in december,defendants moved for leave to file a first amended asserting causes of action for reformation based on mistake,and for breach of contract.in january,the court granted aps motion for summary adjudication of the reformation causes of action in the original,and denied the motion as to the cause of action for declaratory relief concerning the enforceability of section e.in february,the court denied the motion to amend the.
joyce conceded at trial that,when he entered into the settlement agreement,he thought it likely that a number of merchants would want to stay with walczer when they were told that she would no longer be servicing their accounts,and he admitted that he could not conceive of any of walczer merchants wanting to move to aps.the evidence at trial showed that approximately accounts classified as retained accounts under the settlement agreement,operating at or locations,left aps and signed up with rps,the corporation walczer formed in to carry on her business.
nearly all of the accounts that moved to rps were originally brought into aps by malley or gallups.malley testified that the six accounts he lost were high volume accounts among his top in profitability.gallups testified that he called a meeting with walczer when he discovered that some of his larger volume accounts were migrating to rps.gallups asked walczer why she was taking these accounts that she knows are mine and my family relies on that income,and she was just standoffish with regards to it.gallups said that one of his former merchants told him that he had asked walczer who would be servicing his account after she left aps,and she replied that she was not really sure.gallups said that he asked walczer why she did not tell the merchant that i going to be managing when you know i told you that i going to be taking over your role as service r,and she said,it not my job to sell you.
aps introduced documentation from eight merchants who moved their retained accounts to rps,consisting of a cover letter and a form to be executed by the merchant and nova.the cover letters,four of which were dated in may,three of which were dated in june,and one of which was missing,stated we are currently a merchant of nova information systems.due to the unacceptable level of service we now receive,we are requesting a change in service providers to reliable processing solutions.walczer admitted that she wrote the letters for these merchants and that the statement about unacceptable service was false.she said that she had serviced these merchants and they had no complaints,but nova requested the statement in the letter to facilitate the move to rps.seven of the eight forms were signed and dated on behalf of nova three in may,four in june.
walczer was asked,and,in fact,as early as may,you had gone to accounts to transfer those accounts had you not she answered,i did.we had no agreement at that time.walczer was asked,in june you were signing up customers that were supposed to be retained customers under the settlement agreement to move as well were you she answered,u ntil this document was signed,there was no firm list.the settlement agreement stated that it was executed by the parties effective as of june,but walczer testified that she did not sign it until july or.she was asked,and you knew when you signed the settlement agreement that these accounts in light of the signatures that you already retained were not going to stay with joyce she answered,correct.
walczer denied soliciting any of the accounts covered by the transfer documents she obtained before signing the settlement agreement in each case she simply told the merchant that she would no longer be servicing its account.she told people at montclair wines,one of gallup accounts and one of the accounts she signed up in may,that there was a tug of war going on over the account,but she testified that it had not yet been decided at that point whether gallup accounts would remain with joyce.david belrose,another of the merchants walczer signed up before executing the settlement agreement,testified that he initiated the transfer after walczer informed him that she would be leaving aps.it was stipulated that lee jester,another such merchant,would testify that he was not solicited by walczer,but refused to go with aps and insisted that walczer continue to service his account 
walczer said that,before the settlement agreement was signed,she communicated that there were retained merchants who intended to move to her company.joyce said that he was m ost definitely not apprised before executing the settlement agreement that walczer had already signed up retained accounts,and that he was relying on keeping those accounts.joyce said that he did not learn of the retained accounts walczer had lined up before signing the settlement agreement until he met with her in november,and she told him that she had been holding some applications as far back as may.he interpreted this statement to mean that she had solicited those accounts to move to her business,but he acknowledged that he did know whether she went to them or they came to her.
in her trial testimony,walczer conceded initiating a call to one of the retained merchants,best western.in her deposition testimony introduced at trial,she said that they called in for support or supplies,and i initiated a phone call to the owner stating,this is the situation,you going to have to make a decision whether to stay with aps.she said at her deposition that,other than best western,she notified all of the retained accounts that they were going to be having to referred them to our aps without exception.at her deposition she acknowledged telling a woman at dave ski shop,i suppose i could rewrite the account,but it is unclear from the transcript whether that statement was made before or after a transfer was requested.
walczer testified that she did not solicit any of the retained accounts after she signed the settlement agreement.she said that she delayed processing some of the transfers so that if they aps wanted to get the business back,they would have had an opportunity to get the business back.joyce said that aps made no attempt to recover any of the accounts that moved to rps because he did not think it would have been a good business decision to put merchants in the middle of his dispute with walczer.
an accountant testified for aps that aps suffered in damages under section e of the settlement agreement for lost profits on the moved accounts during the period specified in the agreement.in its verdict,the jury found that aps sustained losses of by virtue of defendants breach of the settlement agreement,but that aps failed to mitigate damages of,and thus awarded aps.
after the jury trial,defendants defense of illegality was tried to the court.in a may decision,the court determined that section e of the settlement agreement was an illegal restraint of trade under section but that section d was enforceable under section judgment was entered for aps for,plus costs and reasonable attorney fees to be determined 
defendants moved for a new trial,to vacate the may decision,or for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.the court granted the motion for new trial,denied the motion to vacate,and denied the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.the court ruefully ordered a new trial on the ground that it could not be determined from recourse to the pleadings,the trial evidence,the arguments of counsel to the jury,the jury instructions or the verdict form whether the jury found that defendants had violated section d,the enforceable provision,or section e,the unenforceable one.the court found it impossible to construe the verdict as based upon a paragraph d breach only even under aps view of the evidence,there is testimony of solicitation of but three of the transferred accounts.neither does there exist any indication in the special verdict form that the amount of damages awarded aps was derived solely from those three accounts.to interpret the verdict amount as based upon money derived from just those three accounts would mandate a finding by this court that the damage award is not supported by the evidence.the court found no legal authority for the proposition that evidence of solicitation of one account may support a finding that another and separate account was also solicited,and rejected defendants argument that judgment notwithstanding the verdict was warranted because there was no evidence that any solicitation occurred.
ii.discussion 
summary of issues 
the new trial order rests on four contested conclusions sections d and e are restraints of trade proscribed by section fn,ante section e is unenforceable under the business sale or partnership,fn,ante exceptions to the section prohibition section d is enforceable under the section partnership exception and there was evidence of some solicitation of the retained accounts on the part of walczer,but the evidence was insufficient to compel a finding that walczer had solicited all of the retained accounts that moved to rps.
application of section 
section prohibition of contracts in restraint of trade codifies california deeply rooted public policy favoring open competition.howard babcock cal th,d,hill medical wycoff th,d.noncompetition agreements are void under this statute unless they are specifically authorized by sections or bosley medical group abramson d,or they are necessary to protect trade secrets,or confidential or proprietary information thompson impaxx,th,d.
antisolicitation covenants such as section d,which prohibits the parties from soliciting each other merchants for five years,are routinely viewed as,and voided as,illegal restraints of trade under section,thompson impaxx,supra,th at,d kolani gluska th,d latona aetna healthcare d.
section e also falls squarely within the statutory prohibition.under e,a party forfeits whatever residuals it receives for five years for servicing the other merchants.provisions like this that impose a cost for competition,no less than those that prohibit competition outright,are considered restraints of trade,muggill reuben donnelley cal d,plaintiff forfeited pension by going to work for a competitor chamberlain augustine cal,employee who went to work for former employer competitor was required to pay employer gordon termite control terrones d.employee who solicited former employer clients was required to pay employer per solicited account see also howard babcock,supra,cal th at,d,noting that,in certain contexts,covenants not to compete typically do not actually prohibit competition,but rather place a price on competition.section e is an even greater restraint of trade than section d because it discouraged the parties from servicing the other merchants even if they did nothing to obtain those accounts,and thus affected the merchants ability to retain the service provider of their choice as well as the parties ability to compete.
these conclusions are straightforward,and aps arguments against them are unavailing.
aps submits that the settlement agreement promotes,rather than restrains,competition,because the overall intent behind,and a substantial component of,the settlement agreement was to facilitate walczer new business and arm her with the ability to compete with aps and others in the market.however,while it is true that the settlement agreement facilitated walczer business as to the accounts she received,the provisions at issue restricted her ability to compete as to the accounts aps retained.
aps argues that section e does not qualify as a restraint of trade because it does not prohibit competition,it merely restricts the manner in which competition is carried on.aps reasons the only restriction in paragraph e is that if an account assigned to one party is taken,that party must pay for the account.thus,paragraph e does not prohibit competition,but only delimits how it can be conducted.this argument is untenable under the authorities cited above establishing that restraints of trade include costs imposed on competition.muggill reuben donnelley,supra,cal d at,chamberlain augustine,supra,cal.at,gordon termite control terrones,supra,d at.
aps contends that section d and e are outside of section because they are restricted to a limited segment of the market.this argument rests on federal court opinions that have carved out a n arrow r estraint e xception to section that validates restraints of trade so long as they do not plac e a substantial segment of the market off limits.latona aetna healthcare,supra,d at.no reported california state court decision has endorsed this narrow restraint exception,and review has been granted in a case that has rejected it.edwards arthur andersen llp th,d,review granted.
we will assume for the sake of argument that the aps retained accounts do not represent a substantial segment of the merchant service provider market.however,we are not persuaded that the ninth circuit de minimis exception to section is consistent with the language or the purpose of the statute.the statute voids every contract restraining trade to th e extent of the restraint,leaving no room to deem restraints too minor to be unlawful.the statute was originally enacted to abrogate the common law rule allowing reasonable restraints of trade hill medical wycoff,supra,th at,d bosley medical group abramson,supra,d at,under which an agreement in partial restraint of trade,restricting it within certain reasonable limits or times,or confining it to particular persons,would,if founded upon a good and valuable consideration,be valid wright ryder cal,italics in original.the statute makes no exception in favor of contracts only in partial restraint of trade.chamberlain augustine,supra,cal.at.
california courts have consistently declared this provision an expression of public policy to ensure that every citizen shall retain the right to pursue any lawful employment and enterprise of their choice.metro traffic control,shadow traffic network th,d,italics added.in rejecting the narrow restraint exception,we follow in the footsteps of the california courts who have been clear in their expression that section represents a strong public policy of the state which should not be diluted by judicial fiat.scott snelling and snelling.
aps maintains that section e is outside section because it is explicitly directed at protecting aps valuable property rights purchased from walczer.however,the only valuable property rights that may justify restraints of trade involve trade secrets,or proprietary or confidential information,which are not claimed rule that distinguishes virtually all of the cases on which aps attempts to rely.see thompson impaxx,supra,th at,d distinguishing gordon landau cal d,fowler varian associates,d.john matull associates,cloutier d.loral moyes d.and gordon wasserman d,compare also king gerold d,upholding prohibition against use of proprietary design.
aps argues that section e should be excepted from section because of the mutuality of the provision,but whether a covenant not to compete is mutual has no bearing on its enforceability.see kelton stravinski th,d mutual covenant held to be unenforceable.
aps contends that section e should be excepted from section because it was part of a settlement agreement,but that fact is also irrelevant.when a contract creates an illegal restraint on trade,t here is nothing which the parties to the action could do which would in any way add to its validity.if the contracts upon which the judgment is based are to that extent void,they can not be ratified either by right,by conduct or by stipulated judgment.south bay radiology medical associates asher d.see also union collection buckman cal,court will not enforce illegal contract even if party against whom relief is sought expressly consents.
enforceability of section e 
section e is unenforceable under sections and because it operates as a restraint of trade even if aps ceases doing business as a merchant service provider.under section,sellers of a business or its goodwill may agree not to compete with the buyer provided,among other things,the buyer carries on a like business.likewise,under section,a partner may,upon dissolution of the partnership or upon his or her disassociation from the partnership,agree not to pursue a business similar to that of the partnership provided,among other things,that another partner or his or her successor in title carries on a like business.under section e,aps is entitled to any residuals defendants receive on the retained accounts for a period of five years whether or not aps continues to carry on a like business during that period.accordingly,a condition for enforceability of section e under sections and was not satisfied.
aps requests that a requirement be read into section e to preserve the benefit of the bargain it sought to obtain.courts have blue penciled noncompetition covenants with overbroad or omitted geographic and time restrictions to include reasonable limitations,but have otherwise declined to strike a new bargain for the parties.strategix,infocrossing west,th,d see also hill medical wycoff,supra,th at,d.we likewise decline to rewrite section e here 
enforceability of section d 
section d prohibits each of the parties from soliciting the other accounts for the purpose of suggesting or causing the transfer of the accounts away from the other party.an account could not be transferred away from a party unless that party was continuing to service the account.thus,section d,unlike section e,implicitly includes a requirement and satisfies that condition for enforceability under sections and.as we explain below,we agree with the trial court that the other section conditions for enforcement of section d were met,and thus need not decide whether section might also apply.joyce and walczer as partners agreed on dissolution not to carry on a similar business as to certain accounts within a known geographic area where as partners they had transacted business.
the new trial order rested on a factual finding based upon evidence at the trial that during the time joyce and walczer worked together they functioned as partners a partnership is defined by statute,as it was at common law,as an association of two or more persons to carry on as a business for profit,subd.a persson smart inventions,th,d.generally,a partnership connotes in partnership property,with a sharing in the profits and losses of a continuing business.chambers kay cal th,d,but see holmes lerner th,d an express agreement to divide profits is not an absolute prerequisite.i t is well settled that the existence of a partnership is a question of fact.persson smart inventions,supra,th at,d.the issue is ultimately one of the parties intent,as shown by their agreements,their conduct,and the surrounding circumstances.holmes lerner,supra,th at,d.the trial court finding that a partnership existed must be upheld if it is supported by substantial evidence.cochran board of supervisors d.
substantial evidence of a partnership between joyce and walczer was presented in this case.to begin with,the parties intent is ascertained primarily from the terms of their written agreement when one exists security pac.nat.bank matek d,and joyce and walczer may agreement expressly provided for the creation of a joint venture the equivalent of a partnership in this context.there are distinctions between a partnership and a joint venture see chambers kay,supra,cal th at,d,a joint venture is usually formed for a single business transaction or enterprise rickless temple d.a joint venture is generally more limited in both scope and duration than a partnership,and the name the parties give to their relationship is not necessarily controlling see greene brooks d.it is immaterial that the parties do not designate the relationship as a partnership,subd.a partnership may be formed whether or not the persons intend to form a partnership.but it is probative that the parties called their arrangement a joint venture because joint venturers,like partners,associate together as of a business enterprise rickless temple,supra,d at.and,f rom a legal standpoint,both relationships are virtually the same weiner fleischman cal d,see,mashon haddock d.rights and liabilities of joint venturers as between themselves are generally the same as those of partners.
the parties continued to refer to themselves as partners or joint venturers throughout their relationship.malley testified that walczer held herself out as a partner in aps when she approached him to join the business.in october,joyce wrote a letter at walczer request acknowledging that they had created a partnership.when walczer sued joyce in,she alleged that she and joyce had entered into a joint venture agreement for the conduct of the business of aps,and that the assets of the joint venture are in aps and the business conducted by aps.the settlement agreement described the suit as one in which walczer sought to establish that a joint venture was created between her and joyce and a dissolution of the joint venture at trial,walczer testified that she and joyce had originally agreed to form a joint venture or partnership.the trial court could credit how these intelligent and experienced business persons characterized their relationship.
the trial court could also reasonably find that the reality of the parties bargain matched their rhetoric.actions speak as loudly as words.the may agreement provided that a t such time as lis personally and the efforts of sales personnel hired by her and for which she is responsible,begin to contribute to corporate profits,her percentage of ownership shall increase accordingly.at the end of every quarter the residual revenue stream shall be reviewed and a percentage of ownership for lis will be determined by the percentage of revenue generated by her as a percentage of the total the agreement thus contemplated that walczer would be more than an employee she would become an owner to the extent of her contribution to the revenue of the business,and,eventually,a percent owner when her residual revenue reached the target amount.although she never received any shares in the corporation,she was treated as a at least by the time she met the revenue target in.joyce testified that,at that point,he considered her to be a percent owner who could have taken whatever she wanted out of the business.there was thus substantial evidence of the essential element of.
the evidence supplied substantial proof of joint management and control of the business,another feature of the partnership relation.estate of foreman d.a degree of participation by partners in management and control of the business is one of the primary elements of partnership greene brooks,supra,d at.same.the may agreement stated that joyce and walczer will consult each other on all business activities and no decisions shall be made without the approval of the other.again,this provision is indicative of something more than an relationship.the parties did not always confer and agree on business matters as their relationship deteriorated,but the evidence shows that they each exercised considerable control over the business at various times.at the outset,joyce controlled the bank account and paid walczer.later,walczer controlled the account and paid joyce.
the trial court could further find that the antisolicitation covenants were imposed upon dissolution of a partnership,or disassociation of a partner from the partnership,as required by section.defendants argue that the trial court ruling was based on the misconception that walczer and aps were partners italics added,but,as noted above,the new trial order referred to a partnership between walczer and joyce.as for that partnership,defendants assert without elaboration or citation to the record that walczer and joyce dissolved their partnership approximately months before the settlement agreement.italics in original.but while joyce and walczer had by the start of agreed to go their separate ways,they did not reach any agreement to dissolve their business or disassociate until their settlement in.during that interval,the parties communicated about a prospective dissolution and disassociation joyce january,letter referring to a point in the future whereby our dissolution is on course to be amicably resolved walczer april,letter lamenting that it had proven to be this difficult to separate our business and joyce april,letter noting that they had spent over one year discussing the termination of whatever it was we had together.plainly,the partnership had not been terminated and the parties had not separated their business when these letters were written.moreover,as recited in the settlement,the agreement among other things resolved a lawsui
