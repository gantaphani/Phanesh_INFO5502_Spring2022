this interlocutory appeal presents an issue of first impression in the circuit courts whether,and to what extent,the proportionate liability scheme of section d f of the securities exchange act of the act enacted as part of the private securities litigation reform act of the pslra,amends section a of the act,under which a person who controls a violator of the act is liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as that violator.
in,appellants,a group of investors in publicly traded securities,filed a securities class action against three groups of defendants vesta insurance group,vesta and certain of its officers and directors kpmg peat marwick,llp,vesta outside auditor and appellee,torchmark corporation,the former parent company of vesta.after completing discovery,obtaining class certification,and surviving various motions to dismiss by defendants,appellants reached court approved settlements with vesta and kpmg.torchmark,whose motion for summary judgment was denied by the district court,is the only remaining defendant in the action.
in,appellants filed a motion to strike two of torchmark affirmative defenses to the extent those defenses improperly sought to graft the pslra scheme of proportionate liability onto the joint and several liability existing between a controlling person and a controlled person under section a.in,the district court entered an order denying the motion to strike,concluding,as a matter of first impression,that the proportionate liability regime set out in section d f of the act trumps section a.in,the district court granted appellants motion to file an interlocutory appeal and certified the present issue as one involv ing a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion.b west.
under section d f,a controlling person is liable jointly and severally for the entirety of plaintiffs damages only if it commits a knowing violation of the act.section a exposes a controlling person who can not prove the affirmative defense provided in that section to derivative liability for the acts of its controlled person.for the reasons explained below,we do not interpret section d f as trumping a controlling person derivative liability under section a.recognizing that implicit repeals of statutory provisions are disfavored,we hold that section d f and section a should be read in harmony to preserve both the pslra proportionate liability scheme and a controlling person derivative liability under section a.
background 
a.the pslra and proportionate liability 
in,motivated in large part by a perceived need to deter strike suits by opportunistic private plaintiffs that filed securities fraud claims of dubious merit in order to exact large settlement recoveries,congress passed the pslra.novak kasaks,cir.the pslra was a reaction to the significant evidence of abuse in private securities lawsuits,including the routine filing of lawsuits against issuers of securities and others whenever there is a significant change in an issuer stock price,without regard to any underlying culpability of the issuer.conf,at,reprinted in.congress also hoped to put an end to the abuse of the discovery process to impose costs so burdensome that it is often economical for the victimized party to settle.id.
before the pslra,the general rule in most securities law actions was that defendants found to have violated the act were jointly and severally liable for all the plaintiff damages.see musick,peeler garrett,at.noting that violators share joint liability for that wrong under a remedial scheme established by the federal courts.thompson,at tbg,bendis,cir.in addition to strike suits,the legislative history of the pslra suggests congress was concerned about the many cases in which the application of traditional joint and several liability unfairly resulted in defendants having to pay for damages caused by other defendants.see,at,reprinted in,under current law,a single defendant who has been found to be liable may be forced to pay of the damages in the case,at,reprinted in,under joint and several liability,each defendant is liable for all of the damages awarded to the plaintiff.thus,a defendant found responsible for only of the harm could be required to pay of the damages.
to combat these perceived injustices,congress enacted section d f of the pslra,which replaced the existing joint and several liability regime with a proportionate liability scheme that restricts joint and several liability to persons who knowingly violate the act.section d f provides in relevant part 
f proportionate liability 
applicability 
nothing in this subsection shall be construed to create,affect,or in any manner modify,the standard of liability associated with any action arising under the securities laws.
liability for damages 
a joint and several liability 
any covered person against whom a final judgment is entered in a private action shall be liable for damages jointly and severally only if the trier of fact specifically determines that such covered person knowingly committed a violation of the securities laws.
b proportionate liability 
i in general 
except as provided in subparagraph a,a covered person against whom a final judgment is entered in a private action shall be liable solely for the portion of the judgment that corresponds to the percentage of responsibility of that covered person,as determined by the fact finder.
importantly,congress clarified that section d f affects only the allocation of damages between liable defendants and must not be construed to create,affect,or in any manner modify,the standard of liability associated with any action arising under the act.f.
under section d f proportionate liability scheme,there is a three step process to be followed by the fact finder determining a liable defendant share of responsibility under the act the first step is for the fact finder to determine whether the covered person or other persons claimed by any of the parties to have caused or contributed to the loss incurred by the plaintiff violated the securities laws second,the fact finder determines the percentage of responsibility of each person measured as a percentage of the total fault of all persons who caused or contributed to the loss incurred by the plaintiff.lastly,the fact finder determines whether such person knowingly committed a violation of the securities laws.
a person knowingly commits a violation of the securities laws and thus is responsible for damages jointly and severally if it makes an untrue statement of a material fact,with actual knowledge that the representation is false or omits to state a fact necessary in order to make the statement made not misleading,with actual knowledge that one of the material representations of the covered person is false or engages in conduct with actual knowledge of the facts and circumstances that make the conduct of that covered person a violation of the securities laws.west.
section a of the act and derivative liability 
the act imposes liability not only on the person who actually commits a securities law violation,but also on an entity or individual that controls the violator section a provides 
every person who,directly or indirectly,controls any person liable under any provision of this chapter or of any rule or regulation thereunder shall also be liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as such controlled person to any person to whom such controlled person is liable,unless the controlling person acted in good faith and did not directly or indirectly induce the act or acts constituting the violation or cause of action.
a emphasis added.
the text of section a unambiguously imposes derivative liability on persons that control primary violators of the act.under section a,a controlling person is liable to the plaintiff jointly and severally with and to the same extent as a controlled person for the controlled person acts,unless the controlling person can establish the affirmative defense of good faith and.
the legislative purpose in enacting a control person liability provision was to prevent people and entities from using straw parties,subsidiaries,or other agents acting on their behalf to accomplish ends that would be forbidden directly by the securities laws in congressional hearings preceding the passage of the act,congress referred to correcting the dangerous and unreliable system of depending upon dummy directors that lacked any accountability or responsibility the house of representatives report accompanying the act summarized section a and clarified that congress intended to achieve its purpose by making a person who controls a person subject to the act liable to the same extent as the person controlled unless the controlling person acted in good faith.
under traditional legal principles in effect prior to the act,nonfeasance was a basis for fraud liability only when the defendant owed a special duty to the plaintiff congress enacted section a because it understood that many control relationships are not within the special duty exceptions recognized at common law further,many controlling persons could have avoided traditional secondary liability under the common law to the extent such secondary liability relied on agency principles.
prior to section a,the conduct of a corporation agents in violation of the securities laws was not attributable to those who were part of the corporate hierarchy,such as shareholders,directors,and officers,because under the common law of agency the principal in the agency relationship was the corporation.congress intended section a to expand upon the common law of vicarious liability and crafted a statute that encompassed relationships broader than those associated with master and servant,or principal and agent.
pure vicarious liability,such as respondeat superior liability,attributes liability to one party based on the actions of the other party regardless of any allegation of culpability on the party held vicariously liable.section a is a derivative liability statute because it in effect requires,through the affirmative defense,a defendant to disprove certain wrongful conduct on its part.see musick,peeler garrett employers ins.of wausau,d of the act impose s derivative liability.specifically,a defendant must prove that it did not act in bad faith or with a recklessness that equates to inducing the acts constituting a securities law violation.see thompson,partridge,cir.notwithstanding section a liability involves culpable conduct both by the person who is derivatively liable and the person whose wrongful conduct was the direct cause of the securities law violation and injury to the plaintiff,a controlling person liability under section a is derived from the acts of its controlled person.
a plaintiff must show that the controlled person not the controlling person violated the federal securities laws.a plaintiff must also show that the controlling person exercised control over the controlled person congress recognized that it would be difficult,if not impossible,to enumerate or anticipate the many ways in which actual control may be exercised and expressly declined to define the term control,leaving courts free to decide issues of control status on a case by case basis the securities and exchange commission promulgated a more specific definition of control under the act,defining control as the possession,direct or indirect,of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person,whether through ownership of voting securities,by contract,or otherwise.west.circuit courts have recognized,however,that the control regulation,like the statute,does not attempt to formulate a precise definition of control applicable to all cases,but is intended only to provide some guidance,leaving a determination as to whether control exists dependent on the particular factual circumstances of each case.see,thompson,at sheinkopf stone,cir adams,cir sec first jersey,cir maher durango metals,cir 
the derivative nature of section a liability has caused courts to disagree over the extent and nature of the burden that the plaintiff must bear to prove section a liability in brown enstar group,cir,we held that a plaintiff alleging controlling person liability under section a must allege that the defendant had the power to control the general affairs of the primary violator,and the defendant had the power to control the specific corporate policy that resulted in the primary violation 
some of our sister circuits have required a plaintiff seeking to hold a controlling person liable under section a to prove that the controlling person was a culpable participant in the primary violation however,a careful review of the decisions applying the culpable participant standard reveals that courts stop short of requiring the controlling person to knowingly participate in or independently commit a violation of the act despite the varying standards,courts for good reason appear to be in agreement that a controlling person need not commit an intentional violation of the act to be liable under section a.as the former fifth circuit observed,w hat would be the purpose of the controlling person provision if intent were provision would hardly make anyone liable who would not be so otherwise.
even though section a should be construed liberally it is not applicable wherever the fact of control exists,as congress rejected an insurer liability for controlling persons by establishing a good faith defense not available under common law principles of agency courts have also interpreted the duty imposed on a defendant by section a differently in varying contexts in thompson,the former fifth circuit held that a controlling person attempting to invoke the affirmative defense has the burden of establishing that he did not act recklessly in inducing,either by his action or his inaction,the act or acts constituting the violation.thompson,at.accordingly,we interpret section a as requiring a controlling person to prove more than a lack of participation in the primary violation.a controlling person is derivatively liable under section a for the violations of its controlled person if the controlling person acted recklessly in failing to do what he could have done to prevent the violation.id.
from our prior cases it is clear that section a was founded and continues until today as a derivative liability statute,imputing liability to a controlling person based on its relationship to a primary violator and not based on any independent violation of the securities laws by the controlling person.we note that secondary actors may be held liable under the act by means other than section a.there is a consensus in the circuit courts that section a was intended to supplement,not to supplant the common law theory of respondeat superior as a basis for vicarious liability under the act and thus,section a does not constitute an exclusive substitute for the vicarious liability of secondary actors that might otherwise exist under common law agency principles.see,in re atlantic fin.management,cir,cert.denied,d commerford olson,cir marbury management,kohn,cir paul newton texas commerce bank,cir holloway howerdd,cir hollinger titan capital,cir kerbs fall river,cir but see rochez,at concluding that the principles of agency,respondeat superior,are inappropriate to impose secondary liability in a securities violation case however,because congress intended for persons presumptively beyond the reach of respondeat superior to be caught in the net of a,in re villa,cir,common law agency principles alone are insufficient to capture the full set of secondary actors that congress expressly intended to be liable under section a of the act.
discussion 
with this background in mind,we turn to the question asked of us by the district court whether,and to what extent,the proportionate liability provisions of section g of the securities act of,f,enacted as part of the private securities litigation reform act of,amended the joint and several liability provisions of section a,a.before we answer this question,however,we must first ask whether the proportionate liability provisions of section d f apply to section a claims against controlling persons at all.we find that they do.
the pslra provides that any covered person against whom a final judgment is entered in a private action shall be liable for damages jointly and severally only if the fact finder specifically determines that such covered person knowingly committed a violation of the securities laws.f a.if the fact finder does not specifically determine that the covered person knowingly committed a violation of the securities laws,then the covered person against whom a final judgment is entered in a private action shall be liable solely for the portion of the judgment that corresponds to the percentage of responsibility of that covered person.f b i.
by its plain language,then,the pslra applies solely to covered persons.if a party to a securities fraud action is not a covered person,then the proportionate liability provisions of the pslra do not apply.
the pslra defines the term covered person to mean a defendant in any private action arising under this chapter.f c i.t his chapter refers to chapter of title of the united states code,where the pslra is located.section a of the securities exchange act is also located in this chapter chapter of title of the united states code.put another way,section a arises under this chapter.
the proportionate liability provisions of section d f plainly mean that they apply to any covered just to some of them,and not just to any covered person except controlling persons,as appellants suggest.the supreme court has said,and so have we,that the term any in a statute has a broad,powerful,and expansive meaning it does not mean some or all but a few,but instead means all.when section d f refers to any covered person,it means exactly that and nothing less.
given that section d f states that it applies to any covered person,which plainly includes a controlling person covered under section a,we read section d f as applying to section a controlling person liability.we next address the question of whether the pslra amends the joint and several liability provisions of section a.it does not.
we know that section d f does not amend controlling person liability under section a because the pslra tell us so.the text under section d f applicability heading,provides that nothing in this subsection shall be construed to create,affect,or in any manner modify,the standard for liability associated with any action arising under the securities laws.f.in other words,nothing in the proportionate liability provisions of the pslra displaces in any way the standard of liability created by the securities exchange act,including section a controlling person liability.
as noted above,section a provides the standard for holding controlling persons substantively liable for the securities fraud that they do not themselves commit but instead is committed by those they control.section a states that controlling persons will be not just liable,but jointly and severally those circumstances unless they establish the affirmative defense of good faith and lack of inducement.the applicability provision in the pslra states that nothing in section d f modifies in any manner the standard for liability associated with any action arising under the securities laws.the plain meaning of that language of the pslra compels the conclusion that if controlling person liability existed before the pslra added section d f,it still exists afterwards.
if the clear and plain language were not enough,and it is the legislative history of the pslra leads to the same conclusion.the conference committee that produced the final version of the pslra explained in its report that t he fair share rule of proportionate liability does not create any new cause of action or expand,diminish,or otherwise affect the substantive standard for liability in any action under the act or the act t he standard of liability in any such action should be determined by the,unamended statutory provision that creates the cause of action,without regard to this provision,which applies solely to the allocation of damages.conf.rept,at,as reprinted in,emphasis added.
all of this means that the pslra,including the proportionate liability provisions,does not change the rules for determining who is liable for violating the securities laws.if a controlling person would have been substantively liable under section a before the pslra,it still will be afterwards.
section d f is not superfluous,however.it does have a role to play.as the conference committee report also explained,while the pslra did not modify in any manner the standard of liability under the securities laws,including section a,it did change the rules for allocating damages among the parties once liability has been established by the fact finder.before the pslra was enacted,if one of those parties was found liable as a controlling person of violating section a,it would have been responsible jointly and severally for the damages to the same extent as the primary violator.under the proportionate liability provisions of the pslra,if a party is found liable as a controlling person under section a,there is a new standard for allocating damages.what has changed is not the standard of liability that applies to controlling applicability provision states that has not been modified in any manner but their responsibility as liable persons for the damages.the proportionate liability provisions of section d f are applicable only after liability is determined,and liability is governed by the standard set out in section a.
under the new statutory regime,a controlling person is liable to the same extent as the controlled person,unless the controlling person affirmatively establishes that it acted in good faith and did not induce the violation by the controlled person.unless the controlling person carries the burden of establishing that affirmative defense,it is liable for violating the securities law,specifically section a.then,for the purpose of determining whether the controlling person is responsible for the entire amount of damages or only its proportionate share,we look to the proportionate liability provisions of the pslra,as we do for all covered persons.under these provisions joint and several liability for all the damages exists only if the fact finder specifically determines that the controlling person knowingly committed the violation.f a.where a controlling person fails to affirmatively establish good faith and lack of inducement under section a but the fact finder does not specifically find a knowing violation,there is liability for the violation but responsibility for the damages is only proportionate,not joint and several.f b i.
section a provides the standard of liability for controlling persons if they are liable under that standard,the proportionate liability sections of the pslra provide their responsibility for damages and the applicability section acts as a levy ensuring that each of the two provisions stays within its proper channel,preventing either one from washing out the other.the distinction between substantive liability and allocation of damages is reflected in the statutory language,which states that any covered person against whom a final judgment is entered in a private action shall be liable for damages jointly and severally only if f a emphasis added.that damages language is different from the liability language liable jointly and severally which is used in section a.
the legislative history also bears this out.the report of the primary committee that drafted the pslra indicates that this part of the act was intended to address the problem of damages being imposed jointly and severally on those who had not themselves done anything wrong.the committee heard from the president of the united shareholders association,who testified that in cases where there was no proof of actual fraud e liminating joint and several liability will significantly reduce the number of strike suits brought against defendants who have done nothing wrong but are seen as having deep pockets,at,as reprinted in,alteration and omission in original.based on testimony like that,and the need to eliminate unfairness and to reconcile the conflicting interests of investors in a manner designed to best protect the interests of al
