in this appeal,we consider whether the district court erred in dismissing a civil action brought against a foreign corporation on the ground that the plaintiff failed to satisfy its prima facie burden of showing that the defendant purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting business in the forum state.upon our review,we conclude that the plaintiff met its initial burden regarding that required element of personal jurisdiction,by submitting affidavits stating that the defendant contacted the plaintiff in the forum state,conducted repeated solicitations and meetings concerning the parties business relationship there,and engaged in numerous business transactions over a period.accordingly,we vacate the district court judgment and remand this action for the court to complete its jurisdictional analysis.
koro ar,koro is a leather company in argentina that purchases raw cow hides and tanning chemicals,and pays various argentine tanneries to produce finished leather products.between and,koro sold finished leather goods to universal leather,llc universal,a leather wholesaler located in north carolina.however,the parties relationship eventually deteriorated and,in september,universal filed a complaint against koro in north carolina state court,alleging breaches of contract based on late deliveries,nonpayment of certain shipping costs,impermissible price increases,and defective products.
after removing the civil action to federal district court,koro filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.in support of its motion,koro submitted a declaration from a company representative stating that universal purchased about million in leather goods from koro by executing various purchase orders over a period,but that those transactions were facilitated by another argentine corporation that primarily communicated and bargained with universal.in addition,the koro declarant stated that koro did not have any offices,property,or business operations in the united states,that koro had never solicited nor sent agents or employees to the united states,and that koro performed all its work in argentina and shipped all its goods argentina,requiring universal to accept delivery of the goods in argentina.
universal opposed koro motion to dismiss,and submitted two affidavits given by its assistant manager,kenneth kochekian.in those affidavits,kochekian made several statements that conflicted with the averments in the declaration filed by koro for example,kochekian stated that between and,universal bought more than million in leather goods from koro and that,during this time frame,universal dealt directly and exclusively with koro.kochekian also stated that two koro employees visited universal offices in north carolina in april to solicit purchases of koro goods.according to kochekian,one of those individuals visited universal offices on at least six occasions between and,engaging in continued solicitations and discussions of various aspects of the purchaser and seller relationship.kochekian averred that the same individual received weekly from universal employees,and that universal and koro maintained regular communications during the years that they did business.
in one affidavit,kochekian acknowledged that koro shipped its goods argentina.kochekian estimated that the various transactions between universal and koro resulted in over shipments of goods from argentina,at least of which were sent to north carolina and to other locations within the united states.
in july,a magistrate judge reviewed the pleadings and the parties affidavits and declarations,and recommended that the district court dismiss universal action for lack of personal jurisdiction.the magistrate judge concluded that,even viewing the m any disputed facts in the record in the light most favorable to universal,universal had failed to make a prima facie showing of sufficient minimum contacts with north carolina to establish personal jurisdiction.in support of this conclusion,the magistrate judge cited koro failure to enter into any contract with universal while koro employees visited north carolina koro performance of the parties contracts entirely within argentina and koro terms of shipment declining to assume responsibility for delivery of the goods outside argentina.
in rejecting universal arguments,the magistrate judge noted that the required minimum contacts were not established by the koro employees visit to north carolina in april or by koro direction of products into north carolina,and that the parties communications likewise were insufficient because alone do not constitute minimum contacts.the magistrate judge also stated several facts that he considered relevant to the analysis,including that koro did not have offices or property in north carolina and was not exposed to taxation there,that the parties did not engage in significant activities in north carolina,that none of the parties agreements set forth any provisions,and that the parties primarily chose to communicate by.
in september,the district court adopted the magistrate judge recommendation.the district court concluded that any visits and meetings between representatives of koro and universal in north carolina may support a finding of minimum contacts,but were not themselves automatically sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction.the court agreed with the magistrate judge that regardless of any meetings that may have occurred,the balance of the factors weighed against a finding of personal jurisdiction.accordingly,the district court dismissed universal action,and universal timely filed this appeal.
universal sole argument on appeal is that the district court erred in determining that it lacked personal jurisdiction over koro.we review de novo a court dismissal of an action for lack of personal jurisdiction,but we review for clear error the court underlying factual findings.consulting eng rs geometric,cir.
when a district court considers a question of personal jurisdiction based on the contents of a complaint and supporting affidavits,the plaintiff has the burden of making a prima facie showing in support of its assertion of jurisdiction.id.in considering whether the plaintiff has met this burden,the district court must construe all relevant pleading allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,assume credibility,and draw the most favorable inferences for the existence of jurisdiction.combs bakker,cir.
a federal district court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a foreign corporation only if such jurisdiction is authorized by the statute of the state in which the district court sits and application of the relevant statute is consistent with the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.esab,zurich ins.plc,cir.in the present case,universal contends,and koro does not dispute,that north carolina authorizes jurisdiction over foreign defendants in qualifying civil actions under d.
the north carolina supreme court has held that d permits the exercise of personal jurisdiction over a defendant to the outer limits allowable under federal due process see dillon numismatic funding,i t is apparent that the north carolina general assembly intended to make available to the north carolina courts the full jurisdictional powers permissible under federal due process.see also combs,at same.thus,because personal jurisdiction in the present case is asserted under d,our test merges into the single question whether universal has made a prima facie showing that koro had sufficient contacts with north carolina to satisfy constitutional due process.see haire,denis,see also tire eng g shandong linglong rubber,cir observing that our test collapses into a single inquiry when a state statute extends personal jurisdiction to the outer bounds of due process.accordingly,we turn to engage in this constitutional analysis.
under the fourteenth amendment due process clause,there are two paths permitting a court to assert personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant.the first path is specific jurisdiction,which may be established if the defendant qualifying contacts with the forum state also constitute the basis for t
