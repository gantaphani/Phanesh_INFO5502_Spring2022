the bay guardian and the san francisco weekly are competing alternative newspapers in the san francisco bay area.each paper relies on advertising revenue in large part to sustain the publication of the news weekly.san francisco weekly offered advertising to business entities at a rate lower than was provided by the bay guardian.consequently,the bay guardian sued san francisco weekly for unfair competition under california law.it was successful and won a jury verdict of approximately million.
this appeal has been taken by defendants new times media the new times,san francisco weekly the sf weekly,and east bay express the express,from a judgment that awarded plaintiff bay area guardian the guardian damages in an action for violations of business and professions code section based on sales of advertising at rates below cost for the purpose of harming a competitor defendants claim that the trial court erred by failing to admit defense evidence and properly instruct the jury on the essential element in a section action of proof of the defendant ability to recoup losses.defendants also argue that the court gave defective instructions on the intent or purpose to harm a competitor and the statutory presumption of improper purpose stated in section.they further assert that the evidence presented by plaintiff failed to adequately prove the element of damages caused by the sales,or that the new times and the express were agents of the sf weekly so as to incur liability to plaintiff pursuant to section.
we conclude that recoupment of losses by the defendant is not a requirement to prove a violation of section.therefore,the trial court did not err by failing to instruct the jury on recoupment of losses as an element of the action,by limiting the presentation of defense evidence on recoupment,or by denying defendants motions for judgment based on lack of evidence of recoupment.we also conclude that the court instructions on the purpose to harm a competitor and the statutory presumption of improper purpose were not erroneous.substantial evidence supports the finding of damages suffered by plaintiff,and the agency relationship between the sf weekly and the new times.the judgment against the express must be reversed for lack of evidence that it acted as an agent of the sf weekly to sell advertising at rates below cost in violation of section.otherwise,we affirm the judgment 
statement of facts 
the guardian was first published in october of in san francisco as an alternative newspaper of tabloid size,published weekly and distributed free of charge.the guardian targeted a young,educated,affluent audience,more focused on alternative views and life styles than daily newspapers such as the san francisco chronicle or san francisco examiner.without any revenue from circulation,the guardian relied almost exclusively on sale of advertising space in the paper to produce income.the guardian sold two forms of advertising classified advertising,which was primarily personal in nature and was placed in the back of the paper and display advertising,which was purchased by local retail businesses and sold modularly as a larger portion of a page of the newspaper.during the first six years of existence the guardian struggled,and was published only irregularly.by,however,the guardian became the dominant weekly newspaper in the san francisco bay area.between to,revenues grew from million to million,and then to over million by,of which million was attributable to display advertising.
over the years the guardian did not compete with the radio or even the daily newspapers,but rather with other papers which also had alternative editorial content.one of the guardian competitors was defendant sf weekly,which in principally focused on the music scene in san francisco,and had a target demographic of to years of age.
defendant the new times decided to acquire the sf weekly in to enter the vibrant san francisco journalism market.at the time the sf weekly was a marginally profitable newspaper of under pages per edition which had a circulation of about half that of the guardian.the objective of the acquisition of sf weekly was to increase circulation and improve content by bringing more journalism into the paper.thus,from to the journalism staff of the sf weekly was increased significantly,as was the editorial size of the paper,its circulation,number of advertisers,and total revenue.
the guardian adduced evidence at trial that soon after the acquisition the executive editor of the new times,mike lacey,disparaged the content of both the sf weekly and the guardian at a staff meeting,and announced that he wanted the sf weekly to be the only game in town.the guardian was considered the primary competitor of the sf weekly.lacey stressed that the new times had deep pockets,with the financial resources to compete very aggressively with the guardian and use guerilla tactics in rate battles.lacey also emphasized that he was interested in improving the editorial quality of the sf weekly.to increase circulation,additional salaried journalists were hired to bring higher quality long form journalism to the paper.the essence of lacey message was that he wanted to put the bay guardian out of business.
one of the new policies implemented at the sf weekly was to specifically target businesses which advertised in the guardian.the previous advertising policy of the sf weekly,like that of the guardian,was to set the advertising rate card based on the overhead costs of publishing the newspaper,plus a variable percentage,depending on the frequency of the customer advertising.rates were structured on a graduated frequency discount scale,with customers who advertised weeks throughout the year offered a lower rate than a one time customer.ads were sold according to the frequency earned.
following the acquisition of the sf weekly by the new times,sales representatives were authorized to directly contact advertisers in the guardian and offer to sell advertising at a lower frequency than was earned to transfer their business to the sf weekly.the sales representatives were made aware that advertising could be sold below cost if needed in order to make a sale,and the resources of the new times would cover the losses,even over a term of many years.for example,the sf weekly began to offer bay guardian advertisers the rate for times,even if the advertiser only agreed to run for one week.
furthermore the sf weekly identified key categories of advertising emphasis in the newspaper,such as restaurants,fitness clubs,health and beauty,music and film,and furniture.to increase volume in those categories,the strategy of sf weekly was to initially lower the introductory rate to advertisers to build up a certain amount of critical mass,then once volume was established slowly increase the rates over time of both the and new advertisers.
the guardian recognized that sf weekly had become a threatening competitor,along with internet publishing.both newspapers appealed to essentially the same demographic and attracted many of the same advertisers.competition between the two newspapers for advertisers was pretty intense.the fundamental objective of the guardian was essentially the same as the sf weekly to become dominant in the san francisco marketplace.
in march of,the new times acquired another alternative weekly newspaper,the express,which then had a circulation of about to.the express,which was based in oakland,offered advertising customers a slightly different geographical region of exposure than the guardian or the sf weekly,and in conjunction with the sf weekly provided a greater coverage area and circulation than the guardian alone.as with the sf weekly,the approach of the new times was to improve the editorial quality of the express and increase circulation.the express provided reduced rates to advertising customers,which it intended to slowly raise over time.despite its lower circulation the express charged higher advertising rates than the sf weekly,although lower rates than the guardian.once the express was acquired by the new times,to entice prospective advertisers away from the guardian the sf weekly also offered free advertisements in the express.the new times anticipated losses at the express while the paper was developed and expanded.
thereafter,through,the sf weekly and the express continued to offer advertising,particularly to advertisers in key categories,at rates at least percent below those charged by the guardian,below the rate card prices,and well below its own costs per inch of display advertising space.according to the calculations of plaintiff expert,the sf weekly average advertising space costs ranged from per inch in to per inch in,whereas the average sale price of advertising space varied from per inch in to per inch in.for the same time period,the guardian advertising costs per inch of paper ranged from nearly in,to in,and in its display revenue per inch was nearly in,in,and nearly in.
as a result of advertising offered by the sf weekly,the guardian consistently lost other advertising customers and revenue to the sf weekly after,even though the guardian had percent greater distribution in san therefore theoretically should have received a percent greater price for advertising.an examination of customer account ledgers for customers and over advertising transactions with the guardian and the two new times papers between and the first quarter of revealed that percent of the transactions of the sf weekly and express were sold below cost.for approximately percent of those transactions the guardian either lost customers to defendants papers or was compelled to discount advertising rates to remain competitive.
as an illustration,by offering reduced rates to advertisers the sf weekly managed to obtain the critical print advertising account of bill graham presents bgp,a major concert producer which historically advertised heavily in the guardian after the acquisition by the new times,bgp consolidated more of its advertising budget with the sf weekly,to percent,at favorable,rates,while at the same time reducing its overall print promotion in favor of radio and online advertising.then in,bgp entered into a sponsorship agreement to direct to the sf weekly a minimum annual display advertising purchase of or percent of its advertising budget in alternative newspaper publications in the bay area market,whichever was greater in exchange,the sf weekly paid an annual sponsorship fee to bgp for naming rights to the warfield theatre owned by bgp,and was given exclusive advertising rights associated with that venue.the advertising prices charged to bgp by the sf weekly under the sponsorship agreement were above previous rates,but still below cost.before the sponsorship agreement,bgp spent approximately per year in advertising with the guardian.as a result of the agreement between bgp and the sf weekly,the guardian subsequently received only a fraction of its previous advertising revenue from bgp,and lost hundreds of thousands of advertising dollars.
in,the guardian began a program to match the sf weekly lower advertising prices to some customers on a case by case basis by giving discounts,free ads and upsizes in the paper.the program lasted two or three years,but did not appreciably abate the guardian revenue losses.between and the guardian suffered a loss of display advertising revenue of about percent,and earned a total profit of million.
the guardian and the sf weekly also lost advertising revenue,particularly classified business,to internet providers such as craigslist,which attracted the youthful demographic targeted by both papers.the dot com bust in the san francisco bay area in further caused appreciable loss of display advertising revenues for both papers,as did the ensuing more general recession.the guardian increased advertising revenues between and,but suffered substantial loss of income between and 
despite increases in circulation and advertising revenue,between and the editorial expenses for the sf weekly and the express increased dramatically,and with the exception of and the papers lost money every year that the new times parent company was forced to cover.the new times sold the express in,due to lack of progress financially,for much less than the acquisition price six years earlier.
plaintiff offered expert opinion testimony from cpa clifford kupperberg,presenting an analysis of damages suffered by the guardian as a result of defendant advertising price structure.kupperberg suggested several models for calculation of plaintiff damages,which he characterized as the revenue or profits the guardian would have earned during the damage period established by the fiscal years through but for defendants advertising.kupperberg acknowledged that a damage analysis of something that did happen can never be perfect,but through his methodology of examining comparable situations he attempted to discern the most reasonable measure of damages.
in one model kupperberg assumed that between and the guardian would have continued to charge the same rate for advertising is,per it had for the five years to before the pricing damage event.the total amount of damages according to this model,without any increase in advertising volume,was.
a different comparable model approach took into account an increase in the guardian display revenue achievement in the damages period at a rate or percentage equivalent to the two other most comparable bay area weekly newspapers the bay weeklies those being the palo alto weekly and the pacific alternative newspapers operated elsewhere by the new times the new times weeklies,that were not impacted by the sf weekly pricing structure.those projected profits were then compared to the actual expenditures,profits and losses of the guardian during the same damages period.as so calculated the total projected damages ranged from a low of million as measured by the bay weeklies to a high of million as measured by the new times weeklies.
kupperberg also calculated damages according to a minimum change model,based on a projection that the guardian would not have lost any net market share to the sf weekly during the damages period in the absence of pricing.assuming the guardian maintained its revenues for the damages period,the total calculated damages were between and million.kupperberg felt that the minimum change model did not give a complete picture of the loss because it was not adjusted for the higher prices the guardian could have charged for the lost sales without the unfair practices.
the calculation of damages under kupperberg models ranged from a low of to a high of kupperberg asserted that all of the models he mentioned,although imperfect,could be representative of what happened,but the most appropriate method of calculation depended on the jury view of the facts.he also testified that a calculation of damages based on an examination of individual transactions was both to the hundreds of thousands of transactions at inaccurate given the impossibility of knowing which transactions would have gone to the bay guardian absent the be pricing.
defendants countered with expert opinion testimony by accountant everett harry that kupperberg models were based on faulty assumptions as to potential earnings during the damages period,and failed to follow established accounting guidelines for certainty.harry formed the opinion that kupperberg models and ultimate analysis of damages were unreasonable,unsupported based upon speculation and completely exaggerated.the range of kupperberg damage estimates,asserted harry,is far too wide to pass a reasonableness test.harry testified that the evidence of damages presented by plaintiff failed to consider competition for advertising from the internet,direct mail advertising,other free newspapers such as the san francisco examiner,and entertainment inserts in the san francisco chronicle.he also considered the cost plus six percent revenue model used by kupperberg for calculating damages unreasonable,as based on an erroneous assumption of a price per page for display advertising that the guardian could not have continued to charge during the damages period.
defendants also presented expert opinion testimony to prove that the sf weekly was not seeking to harm the guardian as a competitor with its advertising pricing scheme.economics professor joseph kalt testified that pricing by the sf weekly for the purpose of injuring competition would not make sense from a business or economic point of view.kalt reasoned that the sf weekly possessed neither the market power to control the alternative newspaper market and drive out competition,nor the protection from competitors to ultimately raise prices and recover the losses,both of which are required to make pricing a rational,sensible act from a business perspective.kalt examined the economic data and market trends,including increased internet competition,and found that the sf weekly failed to increase its revenues from pricing or drive the guardian and other competition from the market.
in rebuttal,plaintiff presented evidence that corroborated the essential enduring profitability of weekly alternative newspapers in the bay area during the damages period,in the form of testimony from william johnson,who published the two bay palo alto weekly and the pacific as comparables in kupperberg model.many of the advertisers in the guardian and the sf weekly also advertise concurrently in these two bay weeklies.johnson testified that the damage analysis by kupperberg properly compared the guardian and the sf weekly with the bay weeklies he published in terms of content,circulation,marketing strategies and advertising revenues.he added that the new times weeklies,with the exception of geography,were also quite comparable to the guardian and the sf weekly.
johnson offered the opinion that the revenue and profit figures given by kupperberg were correct.according to johnson,the alternative weekly newspapers did not suffer from the business downturn during the damages period or the increase in internet advertising in the same way as did daily newspapers.he testified that the relocation of advertising revenues from the daily newspapers to the internet has not occurred to any appreciable degree with newspapers johnson observed no impact on any of his papers from internet advertising.both the palo alto weekly and the pacific sun,which were not affected by the sf weekly advertising,realized an average gradual increase in display advertising revenues and profits during the damages period johnson further testified that an offer by a competitor of advertising rates below the rate card has a very large impact on pricing and advertising revenue.
at the conclusion of trial,the jury found that defendants sold advertising space at a price below cost for the purpose of harming plaintiff as a competitor in violation of section.a verdict was rendered in favor of plaintiff and against each of the defendants in the total amount of is,in actual damages suffered by plaintiff,partially trebled,plus prejudgment interest.this appeal followed.
discussion 
i.the element of recoupment of losses.
defendants argue that a series of errors were committed by the trial court,due to the court failure to recognize that a defendant ability to recoup losses following pricing is an essential element of proof of a violation of section.referring to parallel federal and state predatory pricing laws,defendants maintain that an objectively reasonable probability of recouping losses through later monopoly pricing must be established by the plaintiff in a section action.the trial court denied defendants motion for summary judgment,partially excluded proffered defense evidence on recoupment,denied motions for directed verdict,refused to give a recoupment instruction proposed by the defense,gave the plaintiff instruction that no proof the defendant would have had a reasonable expectation of recouping its losses by eliminating the plaintiff as a competitor was necessary and finally denied a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,all predicated upon a faulty determination that california law does not require proof of recoupment ability.defendants claim that in its rulings the court failed to assess whether recoupment ability existed and compounded that error by instructing that the jury was not required to find that defendants conduct was economically rational or that defendants would likely be able to recoup losses from sales.they also point out that without any proof of recoupment ability presented by plaintiff,we must reverse and direct judgment for defendants.
the issue of recoupment ability as an element of an action for pricing under the unfair practices act et the upa has not yet been resolved,and requires that we undertake an interpretation of section.in interpreting this statute,our goal is to determine the intent of the legislature and thereby effectuate the purpose of the law.citation.to do so,we apply certain fundamental rules of statutory interpretation.our first step in determining the legislature intent is to scrutinize the actual words of the statute,giving them a plain and commonsense meaning.citations.citations.colgan leatherman tool group,th,d.we reject an interpretation that would render particular terms mere surplusage,and instead seek to give significance to every word.city of san jose superior court cal th,d.when the language of a statute is clear,we need go no further.however,when the language is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation,we look to a variety of extrinsic aids,including the ostensible objects to be achieved,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,contemporaneous administrative construction,and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.nolan city of anaheim cal th,d.
we commence our examination of section by observing the obvious the language of the statute does not expressly mention recoupment in any way.section provides it is unlawful for any person engaged in business within this state to sell any article or product at less than the cost thereof to such vendor,or to give away any article or product,for the purpose of injuring competitors or destroying competition.under section,proof of one or more acts of selling or giving away any article or product below cost or at discriminatory prices,together with proof of the injurious effect of such acts,is presumptive evidence of the purpose or intent to injure competitors or destroy competition.recoupment is nowhere referred to in the governing statutes.
established law has also not specified that ability to recoup losses is an element of the statutory prohibition.to prove a violation of section,the cases have declared that a plaintiff must allege and prove two elements sales undertaken for the purpose of injuring competitors or destroying competition,that has resulted in a competitive injury.communications,los angeles cellular telephone,supra,cal th,d,fisherman wharf bay cruise superior court th,d turnbull turnbull ara transportation,d.
thus,as defendants recognize,recoupment as an element of the statutory cause of action must be added to section by necessary implication from its purpose.we do not lightly imply terms or requirements that have not been expressly included in a statute.people gardeley cal th,d,alpha mechanical,heating air conditioning,travelers casualty surety of america th,d.a n intention to legislate by implication is not to be presumed.citation.citizens for better streets board of supervisors th,d.the courts are not authorized to insert provisions or rewrite a statute to conform to an assumed intention which does not appear from its language.stop youth addiction,lucky stores,cal th,d,lewco iron metals,superior court th,d.
defendants argument for an implied recoupment provision rests on federal laws,particularly the act,and section of the sherman act,along with predatory pricing laws enacted by other states.we have no dispute with the first part of defendants premise that in predatory pricing actions pursued under federal law and some states,two prerequisites to recovery must be proved by the plaintiff first,a rival low prices are below an appropriate measure of its rival costs and second,the defendant had a reasonable prospect or dangerous probability of recouping its investment in prices.brooke group brown williamson tobacco,d.vollrath sammi cir.the united states supreme court has declared for the investment to be rational,the predator must have a reasonable expectation of recovering,in the form of later monopoly profits,more than the losses suffered.citation.recoupment is the ultimate object of an unlawful predatory pricing scheme it is the means by which a predator profits from predation.without it,predatory pricing produces lower aggregate prices in the market,and consumer welfare is enhanced.although unsuccessful predatory pricing may encourage some inefficient substitution toward the product being sold at less than its cost,unsuccessful predation is in general a boon to consumers.for recoupment to occur,pricing must be capable,as a threshold matter,of producing the intended effects on the firm rivals,whether driving them from the market,or causing them to raise their prices to supracompetitive levels within a disciplined oligopoly.brooke group,supra,at.
where we find fault with defendants argument is in the assertion that section is entirely analogous to the federal and predatory pricing laws,and must therefore be interpreted correspondingly.section recites distinctive language,and has dissimilar elements and a different focus than defendants proffered statutory counterparts.the predatory pricing statutes referred to by defendants may all prohibit discriminatory or pricing,but the federal and predatory pricing laws,unlike section,do not include an intent requirement.poultry farms,rose acre farms,cir.the federal law instead looks to the ultimate monopolistic impact and threatened harm produced by the pricing is,the probability of recoupment through future supracompetitive pricing upon elimination of competitors see brooke group brown williamson tobacco,supra,d cargill,monfort of colorado,d.matsushita industrial zenith radio d.poultry farms,supra,at indiana grocery,super valu stores,cir.even if business competitors engage in predatory pricing with the utmost malice directed at each other,the federal law is unconcerned unless predatory losses may be recouped and competition is thereby impaired.as the supreme court has observed concerning the federal law on predatory pricing,absent some assurance that the monopoly will materialize,and that it can be sustained for a significant period of time,t he predator must make a substantial investment with no assurance that it will pay off.citation.for this reason,there is a consensus among commentators that predatory pricing schemes are rarely tried,and even more rarely successful.matsushita,supra,at.
in section,in contrast,the very gravamen of the offense is the purpose underlying the anticompetitive act,rather than the actual or threatened harm to competition.the intent or purpose of the sale is at the heart of the statute,and distinguishes the violation from a pricing strategy undertaken for legitimate,nonpredatory business reasons.food and bureau of california united states cir.section does not make all sales below average total cost illegal per se.instead,such sales must have been made for the purpose of injuring competitors or destroying competition.citations.william inglis,itt continental baking cir,see also food bureau,supra,at.the intent requirement imposed by section is an especially stringent one.section uses the word purpose,not intent,not knowledge.communications,los angeles cellular telephone,supra,cal th,d.therefore,the california supreme court has concluded that to violate section,a company must act with the purpose,the desire,of injuring competitors or destroying competition.id.at,d,see also chicago title ins.great western financial cal d,fisherman wharf bay cruise superior court,supra,th,d.
further,section does not require an anticompetitive impact.a n injurious effect is not an essential element of the violation.the violation is complete when sales below cost are made with the requisite intent and not within any of the exceptions.people pay less drug store cal d.the language of sections and make it sufficiently clear that the legislature deemed that injury to a competitor or destruction of competition was an injurious effect,and therefore within the ban of the act and that it was not necessary to await success in the monopolistic effort before the measures provided to safeguard the public interest and welfare could be invoked.pay less drug,supra,at.while evidence of an injury due to a pricing scheme may establish the rebuttable statutory inference of unlawful purpose,the plaintiff may also prove purpose independently without any injurious effect.
even the objectives of the laws,though certainly similar,are not identical.the sherman act and act a seek to prevent anticompetitive acts that impair competition or harm competitors,whereas the upa reflects a broader l egislative concern not only with the maintenance of competition,but with the maintenance of fair and honest competition.citations.abc internat.traders,matsushita electric cal th,d.we disagree with defendants characterization of the upa as legislation that was merely intended to protect the public,not individual competitors.the upa has been described by our high court as a legislative attempt to regulate business as a whole by prohibiting practices which the legislature has determined constitute unfair trade practices.wholesale dealers national.cal d,see also max factor kunsman cal d,dis.opn.of shenk,upa appears to be a painstaking endeavor by the legislature to combat the abuses which the business interests have deemed unfair practices in the competitive field.id.at.the history of the amalgamation of statutes that comprise the upa teaches that a primary concern in the enactment of the upa was the protection of smaller,independent retailers,especially grocers,against unfair competitive practices of the large chain stores.as a contemporary commentator explained,the prohibitions added in on secret rebates and unearned discounts now section and sales now section are designed to protect the retailer whose more powerful neighbor is attempting to drive him out of business.citations.abc,supra,at see also fisherman wharf bay cruise superior court,supra,th,d.the defendant ability to recoup losses is unnecessary to the dual objectives of preventing unfair trade practices and protecting comparatively smaller enterprises from predatory pricing schemes of larger competitors.
thus,california and federal cases have recognized that the upa in many respects does not mirror federal predatory pricing law.william inglis,itt continental baking,supra,pac ord,fisherman wharf bay cruise superior court,supra,th,d.defendant reliance on federal law fails to acknowledge the significant differences between the language of the sherman act,the federal antitrust statute prohibiting predatory pricing,and its state counterpart,section of the upa.fisherman wharf bay cruise,supra,at,d.it has been observed that t he upa,in contrast to the federal antitrust statutes,is precisely drawn to eliminate defined commercial practices such as predatory pricing.therefore,changing judicial perspectives on antitrust enforcement have far less influence on the development of california predatory pricing law than on the development of the federal counterparts.mccall,private enforcement of predatory price laws under the california unlawful practices act and the federal antitrust acts pacific,id.at,d.
additional features of the statutory construct of the upa further persuade us that implication of recoupment ability as a requirement in section is neither necessary nor intended.within other unfair trade provisions of the upa that prohibit loss leaders,and secret discriminatory rebates or allowances,the legislature has seen fit in the language of the statutes to refer to potential injury to a competitor or the competitive structure,while statutes that prohibit locality price discrimination,like section,are directed at the intent of the violation the legislature has thus evinced the ability in the upa to target either the purpose or ultimate effect of the violation,and clearly intended the former in the language of section.we also point out that exceptions or defenses to the scope of the prohibition against sales,such as sales to meet competition,sales of damaged goods,or sales to close out stock,have been conspicuously delineated by the legislature in section inability to recoup predatory losses is not among them.
finally,we are not convinced by defendants argument that the severe consequences of violation of section may include fines,treble damages,and even potential criminal the statute draconian without an implied recoupment requirement.the rigorous task imposed upon the plaintiff in a section action to prove that the sales were done for the purpose of injuring competitors or destroying competition makes proof of a statutory violation formidable enough to justify the associated penalties.fisherman wharf bay cruise superior court,supra,th,d.
in light of the distinctions we discern,some glaring,some subtle,between section and the federal or other state predatory pricing laws and particularly in light of the conspicuous focus of section upon the mental state of defendants purpose rather than ultimate impact of pricing,we decline to imply a recoupment element in the statute where none has been expressed.we therefore conclude that the trial court,in its rulings on motions,the presentation of evidence,and instructions,did not err by refusing to recognize defendants recoupment claim 
ii.the instructions on purpose to harm a competitor.
we turn to defendants challenge to the instructions and accompanying verdict form on the purpose requirement of section.defendants claim the instructions and verdict form erroneously permitted the jury to base liability on an intent to harm a single competitor,rather than the upa term competitors.italics added.two instructions are at issue.in the first,the court explained the statutory presumption by stating that if the jury found any sales injured the bay guardian as a competitor,it is presumed that defendants purpose was to injure competitors and destroy competition.in the second,the court advised the jury that a defendant does not act with the required purpose under the statute merely because it had knowledge of probable substantial harm to a competitor or that customers would be diverted from a competitor.italics added.the verdict form asked the jury to determine if defendants purpose was to injure a competitor or destroy competition.defendants maintain that the effect of the instructions and verdict form was to direct the jury to impose liability merely by finding defendants made sales with a subjective intent to harm the guardian alone,in contradistinction to the statutory language which prohibits pricing for the purpose of injuring competitors or destroying competition.italics added.defendants position is that the jury should have evaluated whether defendants purpose was to inflict injury.
defendants proposed interpretation of section is at odds with both common sense and the objectives of the statute.defendants would have us interpret the law to prohibit pricing only if multiple competitors are the target of an unlawful marketing scheme.as we have observed,the declared purposes of the upa are to safeguard the public against the creation or perpetuation of monopolies and to foster and encourage competition,by prohibiting unfair,dishonest,deceptive,destructive,fraudulent and discriminatory practices by which fair and honest competition is destroyed or prevented.abc internat.traders,matsushita electric,supra,cal th,d.the legislature has also specifically directed that the upa provisions shall be liberally construed that its beneficial purposes may be subserved.ibid see also national broadcasting.thus,section,like the remainder of the upa,seeks to maintain fair and honest competition to protect smaller,independent retailers from the predatory practices of larger,more controlling competitors.abc,supra,at.the prohibitions against sales are designed to protect a competitor whose more powerful neighbor is attempting to drive him out of business.citations.fisherman wharf bay cruise superior court,supra,th,d,italics added,quoting from abc internat.traders,matsushita electric,supra,at.i njury to a competitor or destruction of competition is considered an injurious effect,and therefore within the ban of the upa.people pay less drug store,supra,cal d,italics added.in short,section is designed to reach a clash between competitors,not just an effect on competition.
a literal reading of section to require at least one economic actor in the field in addition to the defendant,so as to injure multiple competitors,would deprive the statute of much of its utility in at least two practical situations.if a given plaintiff and defendant are the only providers of an article or product,any competition between them would be beyond the reach of section because neither is injuring competitors.indeed,competition was the legal focus of the section claim in fisherman wharf bay cruise,supra.the plaintiff was the red white fleet,and defendant was blue gold fleet.moreover,defendants suggested interpretation of the law would immunize a business which serially engages in pricing to eliminate competitors one at a time,thereby permitting the very unlawful practices the statute seeks to proscribe.we are guided by maxims of statutory interpretation which direct us to avoid such illogical and meaningless consequences.people navarro cal th,d.if possible,the words should be interpreted to make them workable and reasonable citations,practical citations,in accord with common sense and justice,and to avoid an absurd result citations.citation.citation.cummings stanley th,d.giving the statute an interpretation that reaches only plural rather than singular competitors also conflicts with the more general directive of the business and professions code that words used in the singular or plural refer to both.see also people manfredi th,d cheek superior court th,d san gabriel valley water hartford accident indemnity th,d.we find that section applies to acts of pricing committed for the purpose of injuring either a single or multiple competitors or destroying competition.therefore,the reference to a single competitor in the instructions and verdict form was not incorrect in the present case,particularly inasmuch as only a single competitor was the focus of the predatory pricing scheme.
iii.the instructions on the statutory presumption.
we move to defendants contention that the instructions on the statutory presumption of improper purpose were defective.the court instructed the jury on the essential element of purpose by stating it is only when a defendant sells advertising below cost and does so with the purpose,that is,desire of injuring competitors or destroying competition,that such conduct is unlawful under california law.the court also advised the jury that,purpose may be inferred from circumstantial evidence of a party conduct or course of dealing,and may be proved the same way as any other fact may be proved either by direct or circumstantial evidence or by both direct and circumstantial evidence.in addition,pursuant to section the court gave the following instruction on the presumption of unlawful purpose if you find that any defendant sold advertising space below cost,and any sales injured the bay guardian as a competitor,it is presumed that defendants purpose was to injure competitors and destroy competition.but this presumption may be overcome by other evidence.the court then proceeded to describe the nature of evidence that did not prove unlawful purpose.defendants complain that the presumption instruction was incorrect for two reasons and thus should not have been given first,once some rebuttal evidence was adduced that defendants did not act with an anticompetitive purpose,the presumption was rendered inoperative and the instruction became irrelevant and second,the instruction improperly shifted plaintiff burden to prove purpose to defendants to disprove it.
in considering a claim of instructional error we must first ascertain what the relevant law provides,and then determine what meaning the instruction given conveys.people andrade th,d.a court is required to instruct on the law applicable to the case,but no particular form is required the instructions must be complete and a correct statement of the law.citat
