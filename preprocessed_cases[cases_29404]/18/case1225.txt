discussion 
ninestar argues that the international trade commission incorrectly found infringement by the ninestar products,that the authority exercised by the commission to exclude these products and to enforce its orders is in violation of the constitutional principles of separation of powers,and that the proceedings violated ninestar constitutional rights to notice,clarity,and a jury trial.

violation of the commission orders 
at the enforcement hearing,executives of the ninestar united states subsidiaries testified,upon subpoena,that they continued to import and sell the ink cartridges produced by ninestar china,with knowledge that the cartridges had been held by the commission to infringe united states patents and were subject to the commission exclusion and cease and desist orders.the ninestar executives acknowledged,and the evidence showed,imports and sales after issuance of the commission orders.the evidence also showed manipulation of transaction dates,and misdescriptions of the cartridges as compatible or remanufactured the ninestar executives acknowledged that they filed false affidavits of compliance during the period after issuance of the cease and desist orders.the alj,on an extensive evidentiary record,found that ninestar had deliberately and in bad faith violated the exclusion and cease and desist orders.the commission adopted the alj findings and conclusions,describing the violations of the commission orders as egregious.final det.
on this appeal ninestar does not deny its actions and its knowledge that it was not in compliance with the commission orders,but argues that it was justified in noncompliance because the law applied by the commission is wrong.ninestar states that the correct law is that the manufacture and sale of a product in any country extinguishes all patent rights,regardless of the physical location where the sales occur.ninestar br.ninestar states that national patent rights are exhausted by the manufacture and sale in a foreign country of a product covered by a national patent,and thus the importation of that product can not violate the national patent.thus ninestar states that the sale in a foreign country of a product manufactured in the foreign country extinguishes any right to enforce a united states patent against that product if it is imported into the united states.ninestar argues that since the law on which the commission relied is incorrect,no penalty should be imposed for ninestar violation of orders based on law that ninestar,in good faith,believed was incorrect.ninestar br.
ninestar focuses on the ruling in jazz photo int l trade comm n,where this court held that united states patents are not exhausted as to products that are manufactured and sold in a foreign country,and that importation of such products may violate united states patents.as stated in jazz photo,united states patent rights are not exhausted by products of foreign provenance.to invoke the protection of the first sale doctrine,the authorized first sale must have occurred under the united states patent.at.ninestar states that this case and the precedent on which it relied were incorrectly decided,and were overruled by the supreme court in quanta computer,lg.however,neither the facts nor the law in quanta computer concerned the issue of importation into the united states of a product not made or sold under a united states patent.in fujifilm benun,the court remarked that quanta computer,lg electronics,inc.did not eliminate the first sale rule territoriality requirement.the patents,products,and methods in quanta computer all concerned products manufactured and first sold in the united states,and the court held that method patents as well as product patents are subject to exhaustion upon sale of product or components in the united states.ninestar does not dispute epson statement that the vast majority of ninestar remanufactured epson cartridges were of asian or european origin,although ninestar does argue that it was epson burden to establish the provenance of each cartridge imported by ninestar.ninestar also states that was never an issue in the case.ninestar br.
the evidence,including testimony of ninestar executives as well as ninestar actions in attempted avoidance,showed that ninestar understood the law and the commission orders.indeed,in its prehearing statement ninestar stated admittedly,a patent attorney would and should know that refurbishing and reselling of spent cartridges,which were not first sold in the united states,would be patent infringement.statement at.ninestar did not dispute that the ink cartridges that it imported and the inventory that it sold after issuance of the commission orders are the same technological products as the cartridges whose importation and sale were found to be infringing and were prohibited by the commission.
the commission ruling that its orders were violated with knowledge and in bad faith is supported by substantial evidence and is in accordance with law,and is affirmed.
the statutory penalty 
the tariff act sets a civil penalty for violation of an order of the commission,as follows 
f any person who violates an order issued by the commission shall forfeit and pay to the united states a civil penalty for each day on which an importation of articles,or their sale,occurs in violation of the order of not more than the greater of or twice the domestic value of the articles entered or sold on such day in violation of the order 
ninestar argues that there should be no penalty in view of ninestar good faith belief that the commission orders were based on incorrect law,and also that the commission proceedings violate the constitution in several respects.the commission penalty ruling is reviewed on the standard of abuse of discretion,to determine if the decision is clearly unreasonable,arbitrary,or fanciful is based on an erroneous conclusion of law rests on clearly erroneous fact findings or follows from a record that contains no evidence on which the body could rationally base its decision.genentech,at.
factors considered 
in considering the penalty for violation of the commission orders,the alj and the full commission applied the factors summarized in san huan materials high tech,international trade commission,the good or bad faith of the respondent any injury due to the infringement the respondent ability to pay the assessed penalty the extent to which the respondent benefitted from its violations the need to vindicate the authority of the commission and the public interest.final det.
in determining whether there was good or bad faith,the commission applied the criteria in certain erasable programmable read only memories eproms,inv.ta,itc lexis,at,and certain agricultural tractors under power take off horsepower,inv.ta,itc lexis,at.the alj pointed to ninestar false compliance statements,under oath,that they believe that substantially all of such cartridges were of origin and therefore not covered products.eid.this belief was contravened by the testimony at the hearing,where ninestar vice president william dai testified 
sir,when you signed this compliance statement,you did not believe that substantially all of the remanufactured cartridges which ninestar had imported or sold in the united states after the date of the cease and desist order were of origin and,therefore,not covered products,is that true 
no,what i said just now was i did know or i do know.
do know what 
i mean,i did know where the empties used for producing the remans came from,that i did know.
the commission found that ninestar continued the importation and sales of the infringing ink cartridges with knowledge that the products were the subject of exclusion and cease and desist orders,that ninestar deliberately evaded the commission orders,and that t he record is replete with evidence of bad faith.final det.
the alj based the sanction assessment on ninestar united states subsidiaries electronic records between october,four days after issuance of the cease and desist orders and may.these records showed that the infringing products were imported on fifteen days and sold on days.the alj did not count records from other sources,such as customers,that showed additional sales not in the subsidiaries electronic records.the alj found that the importation and sales were made in deliberate and knowing violation of the commission orders,and levied the maximum statutory penalty of per day.eid.
the full commission,while remarking on the egregious bad faith of the violations,reduced the penalty to per day,stating that the reduced amount was commensurate with the sales violations and the lost sales of epson,and the bond that should have been posted during the presidential review period.final det.the commission stated that t he combined penalty of should be sufficient to deter future violations by the ninestar respondents and others considering violating the commission orders.id.the commission observed that ninestar has the ability to pay substantial penalties and that ninestar did not introduce accounting records or demonstrate any reason why the maximum penalties should not be imposed.final det.
the commission points to ninestar knowledge of its violation and the fraudulent actions taken to evade compliance.the commission referred to the harm to domestic industry due to the magnitude of the infringing operations.the commission found the amount of the penalty to be comparable to the lost sales to the patentee,found to exceed nine million dollars.final det.the commission points out that the statutory penalty is designed to serve as a deterrent,because t he public interest is not served if intellectual property rights are not respected,and the imposition of a penalty that is substantial enough to deter future violations is in the public interest.final det.if the only consequence of ignoring the commission orders were payment of a modest fee if caught,the statutory purpose of deterring unfair trade practices would fail,for the commission has no other remedy.
the commission penalty was within the commission authority,and in accordance with the legislative purpose.abuse of discretion has not been shown in the imposition of a penalty and its amount.
joint and several liability 
the commission ordered that a ll three of the ninestar respondents,ninestar technology,ninestar technology company,town sky,shall have joint and several liability for the payment of the total amount of these civil penalties.certain ink cartridges and components thereof,inv.ta,usitc pub,comm order.the commission adopted the alj determination that the text of the limited exclusion order,which identifies both subsidiaries ninestar and town sky,and any of its principals,stockholders,officers,directors,employees,agents,licensees,distributors,controlled whether by stock or ownership and business entities,successors,and assigns makes ninestar china,the subsidiaries principal and sole owner,liable for violating the cease and desist orders,whether directly,through its own actions,or through its control over the violations of the two subsidiaries,under basic agency principles,eid.final det.
ninestar argues that the penalty can not be levied against ninestar china,but only against the united states subsidiaries.ninestar states that it is elementary and well established law that a parent is not liable for the actions of its subsidiary,even if there are overlapping directors or officers.ninestar br.citing united states bestfoods,for the rule that a parent corporation and its subsidiaries are separate legal entities and that the parent is not liable for acts or obligations of the subsidiary.ninestar argues that the commission did not prove that ninestar china controlled the activities of its united states subsidiaries and that the burden of proof was with the commission.ninestar points to the testimony of its executives that the united states subsidiaries operated independently of the parent in china.ninestar states that the commission does not have jurisdiction over ninestar china and that the united states subsidiaries do not have the resources to pay the penalty.
the commission found that ninestar china monitored and controlled the actions of its united states subsidiaries,that regular reports were made of sales,
