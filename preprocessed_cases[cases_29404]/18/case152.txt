this case involves claims of race and national origin discrimination arising from the termination of an individual employment with the new subsidiary of a japanese corporation.the district court dismissed the actions against the corporate parent and subsidiary for failure to state a claim.we conclude that,under the standards articulated in cook arrowsmith shelburne,cir,the plaintiff,todd brown,sufficiently alleged that the corporate parent was part of a single integrated enterprise with its american subsidiary to be properly named as a in a discriminatory discharge suit under title vii and the new york state human rights law.we also conclude that brown plausibly alleged a claim of race or national origin discrimination against both the corporate parent and the subsidiary.on these counts,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this decision.
we agree with the district court,however,that brown claim for breach of contract does not survive defendants motions to dismiss because he failed to allege that either defendant maintained a written policy of terminating employees only for cause.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court dismissing brown contract claim.
background 
we recite the facts as alleged in brown complaint and amended complaint,noting any relevant differences we accept these facts as true for purposes of reviewing the district court grant of defendants motions to dismiss.see gatt commc ns,pmc assocs,cir.
brown who is white and of united states national origin is a former employee of daikin america,daikin america,a delaware corporation that is headquartered in rockland county,new york,and engaged in the manufacture and sale of chemical products.daikin america is a subsidiary of daikin industries dil,a japanese corporation based in osaka,japan brown worked in daikin america new business development group the group from approximately until,when he was discharged as part of a reduction in force.during his time at daikin america,brown performance reviews were consistently positive.brown is fluent in japanese and familiar with japanese business culture.before beginning work at daikin america,he worked for a japanese company for six years,during which he spent two years living and working in japan.
in february,when brown employment with daikin america ended,the group consisted of six employees,three of whom were white americans,and three of whom were japanese citizens of japanese national origin.each of the japanese employees in the group previously worked for dil in japan,but was assigned to daikin america to act as daikin america employee while in the united states.complaint compl.such rotational assignments lasted a period of years as a result of the workforce reduction,the employment of brown and one other white american in the group was terminated.the remaining white american employee was transferred out of the group,leaving three japanese citizens employed in the group during the same reduction effort,daikin america also terminated employees in three other business groups.in total,seven american employees six of whom were white and one of whom was black lost their jobs in the workforce reduction,but no japanese employees were terminated.
brown alleges that,for discriminatory reasons,daikin america did not consider terminating any of the japanese rotational employees or any employees of japanese national origin who had been hired directly by daikin america brown further alleges that dil and daikin america maintained a policy of terminating employees only for cause,and that he accepted and remained at his job at daikin america in part because of this policy.
after exhausting his administrative remedies with the equal employment opportunity commission,brown filed a complaint against dil and daikin america in june.in it,brown contended that dil and daikin america violated title vii of the civil rights act of title vii,et,and the new york state human rights law nyshrl,exec.law,et,by discriminating against him on the basis of his race or national origin.in particular,he alleged that defendants terminated his employment without considering similar action against japanese employees.he also alleged,in a separate count,that defendants violated an implied term of his employment contract that he would be terminated only for cause.
daikin america filed an answer to brown complaint and dil moved to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court granted dil motion to dismiss,reasoning that dil was not part of a single integrated enterprise with daikin america for purposes of determining what entity or entities were brown employer under title vii and the nyshrl.the district court ruled further that brown did not plausibly allege that dil had any input into the decision to terminate his employment.brown daikin,civ.cs,wl,at.the court observed that even if dil had some control over the decision to terminate,the complaint allegations supported only the mere possibility of misconduct by dil,rather than stating a plausible claim of discrimination the preferential treatment of japanese employees was just as likely to have been based on their rotational status as their national origin.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.finally,the district court dismissed brown breach of contract claim because the complaint did not allege that dil had violated a written policy limiting its right to discharge its employees.id.
with the district court leave,brown filed an amended complaint naming daikin america as the sole defendant.the amended complaint remained in all but one material respect the same as the original complaint its factual narrative omitted any reference to the rotational status of the japanese employees.
daikin america moved to dismiss the amended complaint,and the district court granted the motion in a bench opinion issued on june.disapproving as manipulative brown omission from the amended complaint of his earlier allegations about the employee rotational program,the district court chose to include those allegations in its analysis of the amended complaint for purposes of deciding the motion to dismiss.in light of these allegations,the district court ruled that brown had not plausibly alleged that his discharge occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination.the court explained that brown was not similarly situated to the japanese employees assigned to work at daikin america because,unlike those colleagues,he was not a rotational employee.because brown had failed to allege that he was treated differently than japanese employees who were similarly situated,he had failed to state claims cognizable under title vii and the nyshrl.the district court dismissed brown breach of contract claim against daikin america for the same reasons that it gave in support of its earlier dismissal of the parallel claim against dil.

discussion 
we review de novo the grant of a motion to dismiss pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.patane clark,cir.a complaint must be dismissed if it does not plead enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.bell atl.twombly,d.a claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.ashcroft iqbal,d.threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action,supported by mere conclusory statements,do not suffice,and we are not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation,twombly,at internal quotation marks omitted.
title vii and nyshrl claims 
title vii makes it unlawful for an employer to discharge any individual,or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual race or national origin.a.the nyshrl mirrors these federal obligations 
brown claims against dil turn at the threshold,however,on whether dil may be held liable as an employer under the relevant provisions of title vii and the nyshrl.accordingly,we turn first to this question,which we answer in the affirmative.we then address whether,in the complaint and amended complaint considered together,brown has stated a plausible claim of discrimination against dil and daikin america.
dil liability as brown employer 
t he existence of an relationship is a primary element of a title vii claim.see gulino state educ.dep t,cir see also b defining an employer as a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has fifteen or more employees,as well as any agent of such a person.an relationship is also required to sustain analogous claims under the nyshrl.see eisenberg advance relocation storage,cir.although brown acknowledges that daikin america not dil is his direct employer,he contends that dil also should be considered his employer for purposes of title vii and nyshrl liability because dil and daikin america constitute a single integrated enterprise.appellant br.at.we agree.
to prevail in an employment action against a defendant who is not the plaintiff direct employer,the plaintiff must establish that the defendant is part of an integrated enterprise with the employer,thus making one liable for the illegal acts of the other.parker columbia pictures,cir.in essence,a court must consider whether an employee,formally employed by one entity,has been assigned to work in circumstances that justify the conclusion that the employee is at the same time constructively employed by another entity.arculeo on site sales,cir.whether two related entities are sufficiently integrated to be treated as a single employer is generally a question of fact not suitable to resolution on a motion to dismiss.see,knowlton teltrust phones,cir salemi boccador,civ.gel,wl,at.
in cook arrowsmith shelburne,cir,we adopted a test to determine when,for title vii purposes,a parent company such as dil may be considered the employer of its subsidiary employees.id.at.under this test,a parent and subsidiary can not be found to represent a single,integrated enterprise in the absence of evidence of interrelation of operations,centralized control of labor relations,common management,and common ownership or financial control.id.at quoting garcia elf atochem,cir.although no one factor is determinative control of labor relations is the central concern.murray miner,cir citations omitted.
here,the district court ruled that brown sufficiently alleged that dil and daikin america maintained interrelated operations and were under common ownership the court nonetheless held that brown failed adequately to allege that the two entities constituted a single integrated enterprise because he did not plausibly allege centralized control of labor relations and common management.accepting brown allegations as true,we conclude that the district court erred in this respect.
to satisfy the test,a plaintiff need not allege that the parent exercises total control or ultimate authority over hiring decisions,so long as he alleges that there is an amount of participation by the parent that is sufficient and necessary to the total employment process.cook,at internal quotation marks omitted.in determining whether a plaintiff adequately alleges centralized control over labor relations the most important prong in the test the central question is w hat entity made the final decisions regarding employment matters related to the person claiming discrimination id.at citations omitted.for example,in cook our court found that a parent corporation had the requisite degree of control over labor relations to be held liable along with its subsidiary as the plaintiff employer where a the parent processed applications for employment for the subsidiary and approved personnel status reports b the subsidiary cleared all major employment decisions with the parent and c the plaintiff was hired and fired by employees of the parent.id.at.
similarly,in parker columbia pictures industries,cir sotomayor,we found a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether two entities constituted an integrated enterprise sufficient to hold both liable as the plaintiff employer under the nyshrl and the americans with disabilities act,et.there,the plaintiff filed disability discrimination claims against his former employer,sony pictures entertainment,spe a subsidiary of the parent corporation and spe sibling company,columbia pictures industries,cpi,which was also a subsidiary of the parent.to support his claim that the two siblings comprised an integrated enterprise,the plaintiff produced numerous documents,including disability forms and payroll authorizations,listing cpi as his employer.id.at.although the record contained evidence reflecting that the siblings maintained separate human resources departments,the plaintiff also produced pay stubs that showed his earnings as being paid on behalf of columbia pictures industries through spe corporate services,id.internal quotation marks omitted.citing cook,we held that,under the circumstances,a reasonable jury could conclude that cpi exercised sufficient control over the terms and conditions of plaintiff employment to qualify as his employer for purposes of a discrimination claim.id.
here,brown alleged that dil closely directed the operations of its wholly owned subsidiary,daikin america and that dil approval was required as to all significant actions by daikin america.compl.brown charged that dil immuniz ed japanese rotational employees from discharge by directing daikin america to discharge only employees who were not japanese,id,and by prohibiting daikin america from reassigning or discharging japanese rotational employees,id.taken together,these allegations sufficiently suggest that dil exercised centralized control over daikin america decisions about which employees to terminate in the course of the workforce reduction,and that dil,by protecting japanese employees from discharge,effectively ensured that employees of other races or national origins,like brown,would be terminated.
we recognize that brown does not plead facts suggesting that dil had significant responsibility for other aspects of daikin america labor relations.cook,at.for instance,brown does not allege that dil participated in the decision to hire him or expressly directed daikin to end his employment.nor,for that matter,does he allege common management.nonetheless,at this early stage in the litigation,the control that brown alleged dil to have exercised over daikin america employment actions lying at the core of brown charges of discrimination is adequate to sustain the action against dil.
because brown has pleaded facts that,if true,demonstrate that daikin america and dil conducted interrelated operations,had common ownership,and were subject to centralized control of labor relations,we conclude that he has plausibly alleged that dil and daikin america both were his employer for purposes of his title vii and nyshrl claims.
plausible claim of race or national origin discrimination 
we next address defendants contention that brown has failed to state a claim of race or national origin discrimination.it has been suggested that whether a title vii plaintiff must plead a prima facie case under the framework set forth in mcdonnell douglas green,d,to survive a motion to dismiss,or whether the plaintiff must simply allege facts sufficient to raise a right to relief above the speculative level,is not an entirely settled question in our circuit we are skeptical of these suggestions because the supreme court held in swierkiewicz sorema,d,that a that a plaintiff need not plead facts establishing a prima facie case under mcdonnell douglas to survive a motion to dismiss,id.at,and went out of its way in twombly to reaffirm that holding,d.nevertheless,we need not undertake to resolve the question here because brown discrimination claim is sufficient under either standard it is facially plausible,gives defendants fair notice of the basis for his claim,and alleges facts sufficient to establish a prima facie case under mcdonnell douglas.
