the problem that was presented by the facts of buss martin was that,upon the dissolution of a corporation,there may well be a difference,as there was in buss and as there is in the case at bar,between common and preferred shares and that this difference should be accounted for when it comes to determine standing to sue for dissolution.it has been observed that buss was simply another illustration of the predilection of the prior law law prior to to determine voting and other substantive rights of shareholders by counting pieces of paper regardless of what they represented.marsh et,cal.corporation law ed.
