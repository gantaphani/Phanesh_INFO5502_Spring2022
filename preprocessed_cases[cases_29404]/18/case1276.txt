discussion 
section provides,in pertinent part,that u pon motion,a court may award attorneys fees to a successful party in any action which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest if a significant benefit has been conferred on the general public section is one of many statutory exceptions that authorize a trial court to deviate from the generally applicable american rule that each party bears its own costs and attorney fees.essex ins.five star dye house,cal th,d.in,the united states supreme court clarified the limits of federal judicial discretion to alter the american rule in alyeska pipeline wilderness society,d,holding that it was the province of the legislative branch to craft exceptions to the american rule,and courts were not free to shift such costs on an ad hoc basis absent express legislative authorization.id.at.though this court and the california legislature are certainly not bound by federal authority,the legislature enactment of section authorizing an award of attorneys fees to a prevailing party in a private attorney general action resulting in substantial public benefit,added by stats,ch,appeared to be in significant measure an explicit reaction to the united states supreme court alyeska decision.woodland hills residents,city council cal d,woodland hills.
plaintiffs contend that section authorizes an award of both attorney fees and expert witness fees.as in any case involving statutory interpretation,our fundamental task is to determine the legislature intent so as to effectuate the law purpose.people murphy cal th,d.people cole cal th,d.statutory interpretation begins with an analysis of the statutory language.beal bank,ssb arter hadden,llp cal th,d.if the statute text evinces an unmistakable plain meaning,we need go no further.id.at,d.if the statute language is ambiguous,we examine additional sources of information to determine the legislature intent in drafting the statute.people cole,supra,cal th at,d.here,neither the language nor the legislative history of section demonstrates that the statute permits an award of expert witness fees.
the plain language of section authorizes an award of attorneys fees to a prevailing party.the statute is silent with respect to expert witness fees.the legislature omission of expert witness fees from the statutory language is notable in light of the numerous statutes that expressly include language regarding expert witness fees the plain language of section does not indicate an intent to authorize an award of expert witness fees.indeed,expert witness fees are not typically considered a subset of attorney fees rather,attorney fees and expert witness fees are viewed as distinct and independent subsets of the costs of litigation.see,subds.a,b.
we reached a similar conclusion in davis,holding that a statute expressly authorizing an award of attorney fees to a prevailing party did not also authorize an award of expert witness fees.davis,supra,cal th at,d.in davis,we considered whether government code section,former subdivision b,authorized an award of expert fees under a statutory provision providing that a prevailing party was entitled to receive reasonable attorney fees and costs.davis,supra,cal th at,d,former subd.b,as amended by stats,ch.
in davis,we explained that the costs of a civil action consist of the expenses of litigation,usually excluding attorney fees.under the common law rule,parties to litigation must bear their own costs.the right to recover any of such costs is determined entirely by statute.davis,supra,cal th at,d.as we described in davis,section is such a statute,describing the manner in which costs may be awarded to a prevailing party.id.at,d.section describes three types of costs subdivision a describes items allowable as costs to a prevailing party under section subdivision b describes items not allowable as costs,except when expressly authorized by law and subdivision c describes items that may be allowed or denied in the court discretion if not enumerated in subdivisions a and b.pursuant to subdivision a,attorney fees are allowable as costs if authorized by contract,statute,or law,subd.a a c.pursuant to subdivision b,fees of expert witnesses not ordered by the court see,subd.a are not allowable as costs unless expressly authorized by law,subd.b.
in davis,following our examination of section,subdivision b and decisional authority prior to the passage of that statute,we concluded that the fees of experts not ordered by the court were not an item of allowable costs because such fees were not expressly authorized by law.davis,supra,cal th at,d.we noted that,pursuant to section,if an award of expert witness fees is not expressly authorized,the trial court discretion is limited to determining whether any allowable costs were reasonably necessary and reasonable in amount citation,and to awarding or denying additional items of costs that are not mentioned as either allowable or nonallowable in section.davis,supra,cal th at,d.because the legislature had not elected to expressly authorize an award of expert witness fees in addition to attorney fees and costs under government code section,former subdivision b,we held that the statute did not authorize an award of expert witness fees.davis,supra,cal th at,d.
the reasoning in davis applies here.section provides that a prevailing party may be awarded attorney fees,as did government code section,former subdivision b.section,subdivision b provides that,unless expressly authorized by law,the fees of experts not appointed by the court are not allowable as costs.as was the case in davis with respect to government code section,former subdivision b,nothing in the plain language of section suggests that the legislature intended to authorize an award of expert witness fees in addition to attorney fees.davis,supra,cal th at,d.indeed,the legislature has amply demonstrated its ability to expressly authorize an award of expert witness fees when it so desires.see fn,ante.we therefore conclude here,as we did in davis with respect to government code section,former subdivision b,that section does not permit an award of expert witness fees to a prevailing party.
plaintiffs argue that this case is distinguishable from davis because there existed decisional authority prior to the enactment of section raza unida volpe la raza unida that expressly authorized an award of expert witness fees under a private attorney general theory.in davis,we noted that the decisional authority we discussed in interpreting government code section,former subdivision b,which predated the enactment of section,did not permit an award of expert witness fees.davis,supra,cal th at,d.as we noted in davis,section was intended to restate existing law and codify case law,clarifying and collecting in one location which costs are and which costs are not allowable.assem.jud,reading analysis of bill reg.sess.davis,supra,cal th at,d,see id.at,d.we stated that nonallowable items of costs included the fees of experts not ordered by the court.id.at,d.plaintiffs here claim that because la raza unida predated the enactment of section and constituted existing law at the time section was enacted,section requirement that an award of expert witness fees be expressly authorized is satisfied.
plaintiffs argument ignores the questionable precedential authority of la raza unida at the time section was enacted.in alyeska,the supreme court rejected the holding of la raza unida,calling into doubt the continued viability of the decision.west virginia.hospitals,casey,d casey,legislatively reversed by the civil rights act of as recognized by stender lucky stores.although we have observed that the legislature had in mind authority when it responded to alyeska by enacting section see woodland hills,supra,cal d at,we can not infer similar legislative intent with respect to section.because la raza unida was not reliable authority when section was enacted,plaintiffs contention that the award of expert witness fees was expressly authorized by la raza unida is incorrect.plaintiffs cite no authority other than the la raza unida line of cases to support the contention that an award of expert witness fees under section is expressly authorized as required by section.accordingly,there appears to be no reason to interpret section,subdivision b as meaning anything other than what is stated by its plain language f ees of experts not ordered by the court are not allowable as costs,except when expressly authorized by law.
in davis,we expressly did not reach the question of whether section permitted an award of expert witness fees,as the court of appeal had held in beasley wells fargo bank d,d beasley.davis,supra,cal th at,fn,d.in light of the rationale in davis and the plain language of section,we now conclude that beasley was improperly decided.
in beasley,the court concluded that b ecause our legislature relied heavily on the federal decisions in enacting section,we must assume the legislature intended to adopt the federal practice of awarding expert witness fees beasley,supra,d at,d,italics added.while it is indisputably correct that the legislature considered federal decisions in crafting section see woodland hills,supra,cal d,the beasley court erred in assuming that the legislature intended to adopt the federal practice of awarding expert witness fees beasley,supra,d at,d.rather than interpret a statutory provision based upon an assumption about the legislature intent,courts must analyze a statute plain language,and may look to the legislative history underlying a statute enactment only if the plain language is ambiguous.see people cole,supra,cal th at,d.indeed,beasley was criticized by the court of appeal below and in benson kwikset corporation th,d,for making an assumption regarding the legislative intent underlying section without relying on the plain language of the statute or its legislative history.benson,supra,th at,d.
in reaching its erroneous conclusion regarding the legislative intent underlying section the legislature intended to resurrect the authority permitting an award of expert witness fees to a prevailing party in a private attorney general relied on our decision in woodland hills.beasley,supra,d at,d.in woodland hills,we considered whether section applied to cases pending prior to the passage of the statute.woodland hills,supra,cal d at.we concluded that section should be applied retroactively,reversed the trial court judgment denying attorney fees,and remanded the matter to the trial court for further consideration in light of section.woodland hills,supra,cal d at.in woodland hills,we discussed only whether attorney fees could be awarded to prevailing parties bringing private attorney general actions expert witness fees were not discussed.we noted that i t is clear from both the statutory framework and language that in drafting section the legislature relied heavily on the federal private attorney general authorities indeed,we do not doubt that in significant measure the legislation was an explicit reaction to the united states supreme court alyeska decision.the statute reflected a legislative declaration that,in california,courts do enjoy the in numerous federal award attorney fees on a private attorney general theory.because in framing the provisions of section,the legislature drew heavily upon the federal decisions,we believe that such no longer viable in the federal often be helpful and reliable guides in interpreting the various provisions of the california statutes.id.at,italics added.our language was significant.we did not state that federal decisions were dispositive interpretations of section.we stated only that such cases will often be helpful and reliable guides woodland hills,supra,cal d at.
we can not conclude,as the beasley court did,that section was intended to revive federal decisional authority permitting an award of expert witness fees.as discussed below,the legislature certainly intended that attorney fees could be awarded to a prevailing party on a private attorney general theory however,section legislative history does not support the conclusion that expert fees may similarly be awarded.
in,the same year that the court of appeal decided beasley,the united states supreme court examined an analogous issue in casey.casey,supra,at.in casey,the supreme court held that expert witness fees could not be awarded to a prevailing party under united states code former section federal statute similar to section the statute then authorized only an award of attorney fees.casey,supra,at,citing as enacted by stat.the casey court explained that numerous federal statutes authorized the award of both attorney fees and expert witness fees,and to hold that expert witness fees could be awarded under a statute providing only for attorney fees would render statutes providing for both an inexplicable exercise in redundancy.casey,supra,at.because united states code former section was both broader and narrower than the regime,it had not been intended to return the federal courts precisely to the former law,and thus there was no reason to depart from the normal import of the statute text.beasley,supra,d at,d,quoting casey,supra,at.
declining to adopt the casey court analysis,beasley held that section was an explicit reaction to alyeska and therefore authorized the award of expert witness fees.beasley,supra,d at,d.the high court interpretation of a federal statute does not,of course,inform our interpretation of the legislature intent in enacting section.nonetheless,the beasley court would have been well served by adopting the casey court analysis regarding a statute nearly identical to section,instead of improperly assuming that section was intended to restore the federal author
