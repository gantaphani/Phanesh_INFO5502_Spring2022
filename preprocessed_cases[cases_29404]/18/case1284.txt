like many large companies,plaintiff general motors corporation has an active treasury department.its treasury department supplements the company other activities by investing the company idle cash in marketable securities.these investments present special analytical problems under the uniform division of income for tax purposes act uditpa which california has adopted,et and which it uses to determine what portion of a multistate company corporate income it may tax.a key part of the uditpa,the sales factor,helps allocate a company income to various states in accordance with the amount of gross receipts the company generates in each state.in turn,this raises the question what proceeds qualify as gross receipts.
unlike microsoft corporation,whose treasury department activities we addressed in the companion case microsoft corporation franchise tax bd,cal th,d,wl microsoft corporation,general motors corporation treasury department preferred not simply to hold its investments until maturity during the tax years in question.rather,it generated the bulk of its proceeds through repurchase agreements,commonly referred to as repos.see generally bewley franchise tax bd.cal th,d.in this case,we must decide how repos should be treated under the uditpa in particular,what portion of the proceeds from a repo should be treated as gross receipts for purposes of allocating a company income among the various states the consequences of the answer are significant here,for example,the answer may effect a nearly twofold change in the amount of state income tax due.we conclude a repo is analogous to a secured loan for uditpa purposes and thus only the interest received should be treated as gross receipts.
this case also poses a second question.like the federal government and many states,california subsidizes new research through a partial tax credit for increases in research spending.when research is performed by one member of a corporate family,does the credit go only to that member or may it be spread among the other members of the corporate family here,under the terms of the governing statutes,we conclude only the taxpaying corporation that performed the research is entitled to the credit.
the uditpa 
we explained the relevant principles of the uditpa in detail in microsoft corporation,supra,cal th at pages,d at pages,at pages,and summarize them only briefly here.the uditpa is designed to determine what portion of a business income is properly attributable to its activities in a given state and thus what portion of that income the state may tax.under the uditpa,a unitary business income is divided into business and nonbusiness income,each subject to different attribution rules,subds.a,d.here,we are concerned only with business income.business income is allocated to each state according to a formula that considers the amount of property,payroll,and sales a company has in each state.as in microsoft corporation,only the sales factor is at issue.that factor measures the portion of income attributable to a given state by dividing gross receipts by all worldwide gross receipts,subd.e.the size of this fraction can vary greatly depending on what qualifies as gross receipts.therein lies the heart of the dispute here.
factual and procedural background 
general motors corporation and certain affiliated corporations collectively,general motors engage in a unitary business that operates partially within california.general motors is engaged principally in manufacturing motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts.
general motors maintains a treasury department in new york.the treasury department manages general motors excess cash from its motor vehicle sales.the investment activities of the treasury department often produce a significant portion of general motors net income.during the tax years at issue,general motors net corporate income totaled approximately billion,of which the treasury department generated over million.
during the years at issue,the treasury department used its excess cash to invest in various marketable securities.these included united states treasury bonds,notes,and bills,and bank certificates of deposit,generally on a very basis income from these investments derived from direct sales,redemptions,and repos.direct sales of securities,sales before maturity other than pursuant to a repurchase agreement,accounted for percent of treasury department proceeds.redemptions,redemptions on maturity of the security,accounted for percent of proceeds.the bulk of treasury department proceeds,percent,derived from repos.
defendant franchise tax board the board audited general motors income tax returns.in its initial california tax returns,general motors treated the majority of the treasury department income as nonbusiness income,not subject to taxation in california.on audit,the board treated all of general motors treasury income as business income subject to california apportionment and taxation.in calculating income to be apportioned to california,the board included as gross receipts only general motors net proceeds from the treasury department securities transactions.general motors argued that the gross proceeds from these transactions,totaling almost trillion over the period,were all gross receipts.the board inclusion of only net proceeds resulted in almost twice as much income being apportioned to california for through general motors paid all taxes involved,filed claims for refund,and filed protests as the result of certain adjustments made during and after the audit.the board denied relief.
after exhausting its administrative remedies,general motors filed a refund complaint for in the superior court.as relevant here,general motors raised two issues.first,it challenged the board exclusion of the treasury department gross proceeds from the sales factor the gross receipts issue.second,it claimed that a million research credit earned for research expenses incurred in the tax year see should be applied to the tax liabilities of all corporations in its unitary business group that had california tax liability the research credit issue.the board allowed only delco,the member of the general motors unitary business group that originally incurred qualifying expenses,to use the credit.because the credit exceeded delco tax liability,the board allowed delco a credit of approximately million for and required that the remaining credit be rolled over to future years.
the trial court denied general motors motion for summary adjudication on both the gross receipts issue and the research credit issue,and granted the board for summary adjudication on the research credit issue.thereafter,the parties agreed a trial would be unnecessary and entered a series of stipulations resolving disputed issues.as relevant here,they agreed that approximately million of treasury department income would be treated as apportionable business income,and gross proceeds from direct sales would be treated as gross receipts.based on its rulings on the motions for summary adjudication and on the parties stipulation to judgment,the trial court entered a judgment finding that general motors had overpaid its california franchise taxes and awarding general motors a refund of approximately million.
the court of appeal affirmed.it ruled that redemptions and repos were in essence secured loans and that only the net proceeds from these transactions were includible in general motors sales factor.it further held that only delco,and not any other member of the unitary reporting group,was entitled to use the research tax credit.we granted review.
discussion 
gross receipts redemptions 
here,as in the companion case microsoft corporation,supra,cal th,d,general motors held some marketable securities until maturity.in microsoft corporation,we held the entire redemption price of a marketable security is includible as gross receipts in the sales factor.that conclusion applies equally to the marketable securities held to maturity by general motors.thus,we conclude the court of appeal erred to the extent it excluded the full price of these securities from general motors gross receipts.
the nature of a repo 
repurchase agreements,commonly known as repos,sound esoteric and can be quite complicated.they are,however,in essence nothing more than financing arrangements by which one party provides funds to another for a short period of time.there are two parties to a repurchase agreement one has money to lend,the other needs cash and has securities.the repurchase agreement itself consists of two transactions that are agreed to simultaneously,but are performed at different times the agrees to transfer securities to the in exchange for cash and the agrees to repurchase the securities from the at the original price plus interest on a specified future date or upon demand.bewley franchise tax,supra,cal th at,d.
the who transfers the securities and agrees to buy them back is said to be engaged in a repo the who provides the cash and agrees to sell the securities back is said to be engaged in a reverse repo.resolution trust aetna casualty sur.cir,in re bevill,bresler schulman asset management,but see,subd.i a,c reversing terms.it appears general motors principally engaged in reverse repos,but the distinction between the two transactions is unimportant in this case thus,we will occasionally refer to both repos and reverse repos generically as repos.
repos serve at least four critical functions.first,the federal reserve uses repos to make adjustments in the money supply and carry out the government monetary policy.to restrict the money supply,it enters repos,selling securities and withdrawing cash from the economy conversely,to expand the money supply,it enters reverse repos,buying securities and injecting cash into the economy.note,lifting the cloud of uncertainty over the repo market characterization of repos as separate purchases and sales of securities vand.
second,repos are used by securities dealers to finance their underwriting of new government debt issues.a liquid,repo market allows dealers to sell current securities holdings for cash as part of the front end of a repo and use the cash to acquire new government securities,thereby reducing the federal government financing costs.bevill,bresler schulman asset management spencer sav.loan cir,granite partners,bear stearns d,granite partners.
third,repos contribute to the domestic housing market.securities guaranteed by government agencies such as the federal national mortgage association fannie mae and federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac become more attractive to investors when they can be repackaged and resold in an active repo market.these agencies can thus raise funds more cheaply,which in turn means residential home buyers can obtain lower rate mortgages.granite partners,supra,d at in re bevill,bresler schulman asset management,supra,at.
fourth,repos are a valuable investment tool for the public,institutional investors,large corporations,and state and local governments.because repos can be structured with a maturity date tailored to the needs of the individual investor,they provide a high degree of liquidity and flexibility.securities exchange com.miller.this liquidity and flexibility,combined with high yields,makes them an attractive financial management tool for entities such as general motors here with large amounts of idle cash seeking secure investments.see granite partners,supra,d at,securities exchange com.miller,at comment,the need for a uniform classification of repurchase agreements reconciling investor protection with economic reality am.
characterizing repos as sales or secured loans 
as in microsoft corporation,supra,cal th,d,the issue here is what portion of the money received by the taxpayer in the course of its securities transactions qualifies as gross receipts.also as in microsoft corporation,we begin by considering how the plain language of the uditpa applies to these transactions.
the plain language offers little immediate assistance.the statute does not define gross receipts.see.while the term gross receipts generally refers to the whole amount received,without deduction microsoft corporation,supra,cal th at fn,d at fn,at fn,how this concept should apply to a transaction like a repo is not readily apparent.
agency interpretation similarly does not decide the question.general motors relies on two agency decisions,appeals of pacific telephone telegraph may,transfer binder rptr.cch paragraph,page,and appeal of merrill,lynch,pierce,fenner smith,june,transfer binder rptr.cch paragraph,page,as supporting its position.however,these decisions offer no insight here in neither case was the tax treatment of repos at issue.
the regulations interpreting the uditpa are likewise unhelpful concerning the proper treatment of repos.general motors cites out of context to one regulation that defines the term loan to exclude repos see,tit,subd.b,but this citation is unavailing for two reasons.first,the definition expressly applies only within the regulation,subd.b,and the regulation is a special one governing application of the uditpa to banks and financial institutions it has no application to general motors.second,the regulation goes on to address the treatment of repos under the gross receipts factor and provides that only the interest net gain from repo sales is to be the treatment the board advocates,and contrary to general motors position,subd.c a.
finding no dispositive answer in either the plain language of the statute or agency interpretations of that language,we turn to a closer examination of the economic reality of repo transactions.see frank lyon united states,d in deciding transaction tax treatment,court should look to transaction economic reality microsoft corporation,supra,cal th at,d at,at examining economic reality of redemptions to decide their tax treatment under the uditpa bewley franchise tax,supra,cal th at,d,examining economic reality of repos to decide their treatment under federal tax law.
we begin with two baseline observations.first,as both parties agree,in a sale of marketable securities the entire sale price constitutes gross receipts,just as it would for the sale of any other commodity.second,under the ordinary meaning of gross receipts,the repayment of a loan is never considered a receipt.marshall commissioner cir,see also c iii gross receipts exclude repayment of the principal amount of a loan,b ii d same,f iv a same.thus,in a secured loan transaction,where a loans money to b and b provides a a marketable security as collateral to secure the loan,the loan principal b repays a is not a gross receipt only the loan interest constitutes such.
given these baselines,the board analogizes a repo to a secured loan or,alternatively,to the simple repeated deposit and withdrawal of cash from a bank account.the court of appeal did likewise.to support its analogy,the board points to prior decisions of the united states supreme court and this court that expressly characterized a repo as a secured loan.
in nebraska department of revenue loewenstein,d,the united states supreme court followed frank lyon united states,supra,d,and looked to the economic reality of a repo in deciding how it should be treated under federal tax law,concluding that in economic reality,the repo receive interest on cash they have lent to the.loewenstein,at.loewenstein thus concluded that in a repo,the income from the transaction was interest from a private commercial loan and was not subject to the tax shield applicable to income received from the government pursuant to the purchase of government securities.id.at.see.the supreme court dismissed as irrelevant the taxpayer argument that repos were viewed as sales and repurchases of government securities for purposes of securities,bankruptcy,and banking law.loewenstein,at.
several months later,in bewley franchise tax,supra,cal th,d,we reached the same conclusion when addressing the identical tax question.like the united states supreme court,we considered the essential economic reality of the repos at issue.we concluded that they established a relationship,that the securities involved served as the functional equivalent of collateral,and thus that the income from the repos was essentially interest from private commercial loans.id.at,d.thus,in that tax context,we characterized repos as secured loans.
in contrast,general motors characterizes its repo transactions as sales in a repo,like any other sale of a commodity,title passes,and thus,general motors argues,its sale of a security in the course of a repo is no different than its sale of an automobile or its sale of any other security.to support this characterization,general motors points to numerous decisions that have indeed characterized a repo as a purchase and sale of a security 
in truth,neither side proffered analogies are precisely accurate,and neither side cases are precisely on point.a repo is a true hybrid it blends characteristics of both a sale of securities and a secured loan.in re bevill,bresler schulman asset management,supra,at keycorp tracy ohio.in some circumstances,it is properly characterized as a secured loan in other circumstances,it is properly characterized as a purchase and sale of a security.which characterization fits depends heavily on context those features of a repo salient in its characterization for bankruptcy purposes,or securities law purposes,or ucc purposes,or even federal tax purposes,are not necessarily the features that will be most salient in characterizing it under the uditpa.see in re county of orange,supra,d at different statutes have distinct purposes which warrant corresponding levels of examination.different levels of examination result in different conclusions about the correct legal characterization of repos.thus,we can not rely on superficial analogies,nor on the united states supreme court or our own prior decisions that have characterized a repo for other purposes,to decide on which side of the line a repo falls for purposes of section,subdivision e.nor can we simply accept the repo parties formal characterizations.though general motors master repurchase agreement provides t he parties intend that all transactions hereunder be sales and purchases and not loans,for tax purposes the economic reality of a transaction,not the form the parties employ,is dispositive.frank lyon united states,supra,at.thus,granite partners,supra,d at pages,relied on by general motors,which found this expression of intent dispositive for ucc purposes,is not instructive.
to identify the portion of a repo that constitutes gross receipts,we consider how and why a sale or redemption of a security,on the one hand,and a secured loan,on the other,are treated differently for gross receipts purposes.gross receipts are t he total amount of money or other consideration received by a business taxpayer for goods sold or services performed in a year,before deductions.black law dict.ed,citing see microsoft corporation,supra,cal th at,fn,d at,at.in both the sale and redemption of a security,the entire amount is received for the relinquishment of a commodity.in contrast,in a secured loan,some of the amount is received for a service,the use of money interest,while the remainder is simply a return of the money used principal.the return of principal does not fit within the definition of gross receipts.
to better understand this basic distinction and how it applies even in the case of debt instruments like bonds and treasury bills,consider the case of a security a treasury bill,say bought on the market from a securities dealer,then redeemed with the issuer,the united states government.the price the receives on redemption,is dependent on the value of the commodity it holds and independent of the price it paid to the broker.the taxpayer is not being repaid for money it lent it had,in fact,paid nothing and lent nothing to the united states government.the entire amount received is properly treated as gross receipts.
there are in fact four scenarios for acquisition and disposition of this hypothetical treasury bill purchase from a third with the issuer purchase from the with the issuer purchase from the to a third party and purchase from a third to a third party.the dispositions in the first two scenarios are labeled redemptions and in the last two are labeled sales,but in each case the two halves of the transaction are independent,which illustrates a fundamental point in the dispositional half of the transaction,the transaction we are analyzing for tax purposes,money is received for surrendering title to a marketable security and not for a service,the use of,because the amount received is dependent on the value of the security and independent of the amount one originally provided the.
in contrast,with a secured loan the opposite is true.the amount received is dependent on the amount originally paid loaned and is independent of the particular value of the securities held as collateral,whose value may rise or fall during the term of the loan without affecting the amount received.neither general motors nor the board contends here that the return of money loaned is money received in payment for goods or services and is includible in gross receipts.
viewed this way,it becomes apparent that,for gross receipts purposes,a repo has the characteristics of a loan,not the sale of a commodity.in a repo,the amount paid depends not on the value of the surrendered security,but on the amount of money the repo buyer paid the repo seller in the front end of the transaction.this can be seen from two key features of a standard repo transaction,each of which is present in general motors repos first,under a provision generally referred to in the securities trade as a provision if the value of the securities drops,the buyer may require the seller to provide additional securities to ensure the value of the securities held exceeds percent of the repurchase price.conversely,if the value of the securities rises,the seller may require the buyer to return securities sufficient to maintain the value of the amount held at no more than percent.thus,as with a secured loan,market fluctuations in value create a right to increase or reduce the amount of securities collateral held the buyer is protected from fluctuations in the value of the securities it has acquired.see in re county of orange,supra,d at.second,the repurchase price is set exclusively by reference to the purchase price and is independent of any increase or decrease in value the sold securities may undergo instead,the repurchase price is the purchase price increased by an annual percentage rate,adjusted for the number of days between sale and repurchase.thus,the repurchase price is dependent on the money initially paid and independent of the value of the securities surrendered.consequently,the repurchase price is payment for the interim use of the repo buyer money,not payment for the securities the repo buyer is returning.this means,in a repo,the seller is buying cash,receiving a loan,while in a sale or redemption,the is paying for a commodity.thus,a repo is properly characterized as a secured loan for gross receipts purposes.
to summarize for tax purposes,we care why money is being received.if it is received in exchange for a commodity,we treat the full price as gross receipts.if it is received in exchange for the use of money,only the interest,not the principal,is a gross receipt.in a securities sale or redemption,the price paid the seller is a function of the securities held and is independent of the initial cost.in a secured loan,the price paid is tied to the initial cost the amount loaned and is independent of fluctuations in the value of the securities held.in a repo,the price paid is also tied to the initial cost and is independent of fluctuations in the type or value of the securities held.thus,a repo has the characteristics of a loan,and only the interest received is a gross receipt for purposes of the uditpa.
the only case to consider the question,heinz revenue division,reached the same result.there,as here,the court rejected the parties characterizations of their transactions as purchases and sales and emphasized it must consider the real nature of the transactions without regard to the terms applied to them by the parties.id.at.the taxpayer was engaged in reverse repos it purchased securities from various financial institutions with its excess cash and resold them the next day,although t he securities,themselves
