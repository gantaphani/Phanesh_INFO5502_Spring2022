in rebney wells fargo bank d,an appeal from a judgment entered on a class action settlement,justice benson,then a member of this court,began his opinion this way according to the parties,the appeals are about either collusion or fantasy.appellants contend the class action settlements were the product of a collusive sellout between class counsel and the banks.respondents claim the appeals are attributable to appellants fantasy vision of wondrously large money judgments.id.at.that wry description might easily fit these appeals as well.
several objectors to a class action settlement agreement reached between the plaintiff class representatives and the corporate defendant,and approved by the alameda county superior court following several evidentiary hearings,appeal from the ensuing judgment,contending in substance that the settlement agreement was the product of collusion among succeeding class counsel,the class representatives,and defendant the southland corporation and its counsel was not fair,adequate,and reasonable and was grossly undervalued.the objectors also contend that the national class was improperly certified,and that the attorneys fees awarded objectors counsel by the trial court were inadequate.objectors also present a miscellany of satellite claims going to the validity of the settlement agreement and the judgment on it.current class counsel and defendant southland have filed briefs defending the settlement as a reasonable outcome to prolonged and heatedly contested litigation,one in which the trial court had before it a sufficient evidentiary basis to support its finding that the settlement was fair,adequate,and reasonable,that the plaintiff class was properly certified as a national class,and that the million in fees awarded objectors counsel were not unreasonable.we affirm.
background 
southland is the national franchiser of the stores the plaintiff national class is composed of all present and former franchisees since.the litigation began in,when plaintiffs,represented by california attorney david franklin and others the franklin group filed a complaint in the alameda county superior court.in brief,the named plaintiffs alleged southland had breached its franchise agreements with them by failing to share ratably in certain returns,discounts and allowances rdas over a period of several years.in effect,plaintiffs rda claims presented questions of the interpretation of a provision of the franchise agreement.the complaint relied on the following provision of the standard franchise agreement between southland and its franchisees retailer discounts and allowances including promotional and display allowances paid to and allocated or reasonably traceable to purchases shall be credited to cost of goods sold,except that shall retain reimbursements for its expenditures pursuant to vendors advertising or other similar programs where is partially or wholly reimbursed or where costs are shared for advertising expenditure programs.plaintiffs theory of recovery was that,by failing to credit ratably individual franchise accounts with the rdas,southland had breached this provision of the franchise agreement.
the rda categories contested by plaintiffs numbered four advertising allowances paid to southland by store advertisers allowances paid southland by its wholesalers for purchases equipment rdas paid to the company by vendors for equipment furnished to retail outlets and the mclane transition allowance,named after the mclane corporation,a company that had purchased distribution centers from southland corporation and which plaintiffs alleged had paid southland a premium that should have been shared with franchisees as an rda.throughout the litigation,southland contended that under the text of the franchise agreement provision,it was not required to share with its franchisees any of the four categories of rdas at issue,for a variety of reasons.
for plaintiffs,moreover,the california lawsuit was made problematical by parallel litigation filed in in the district court of dallas county,texas,judicial district,under the caption valente southland corporation,valente.the valente suit,also brought by franchisees against southland,was filed some three years after the california suit was commenced,and sought comparable relief,including class action certification.because the bulk of the contested rdas had been received in the late,the valente plaintiffs faced a statute of limitations defense interposed by southland,which had already been the subject of a favorable ruling by the texas state court.and because some of the total number of franchisees nationally were putative members of the valente plaintiff class,a ruling by the texas court upholding southland limitations defense would have been a death knell for recoveries by a majority of the national plaintiff class.
that is,had southland prevailed on its limitations defense in the texas litigation,a majority of the franchisees would have recovered little or nothing,even if their view of the merits of the rda claims proved correct in all respects.the texas court had upheld southland limitations defense but granted the valente plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint in an attempt to circumvent the time bar.an amended complaint,together with southland limitations opposition to it,was pending in the texas trial court at the time the settlement agreement was approved in the california litigation.
settlement of the california suit came after more than four and a half years of litigation,including voluminous discovery.the settlement proposal itself was preceded by three months of negotiations between the parties and their counsel in the summer and fall of a compromise proposed settlement was reached in negotiations between company officials and representatives of the class that august,counsel for both sides having been excluded from the talks.after being vetted by attorneys for both sides and following additional negotiations with counsel present,the proposed agreement was presented to the trial court for its tentative approval.there followed a prolonged review by the trial court of the fairness,adequacy,and reasonableness of the proposed settlement at lengthy fairness hearings.first,the trial court held three daylong evidentiary hearings on october and november and,to consider the objectors claims that the settlement was the product of collusion between class counsel and defendants.at the conclusion of those hearings,the trial judge made oral findings from the bench and later filed a memorandum order and opinion finding no factual basis for the claims of collusion alleged by former class counsel.
apace of these developments,other events led to a rupture of the solidarity among class counsel.after former counsel to the texas valente plaintiffs joined forces with two california attorneys representing members of the california class action,the franklin group moved the trial court to discharge both the class representatives and associate texas class counsel,alleging conflicts of interest and.the franklin group later filed suit against the class representatives their former clients and their texas class counsel colleagues,whom we will refer to as the culp group,after marc culp,one of its members.the class representatives rejoined by discharging the franklin group and retaining the texas lawyers as succeeding class counsel to represent them in this litigation.these counsel,in turn,asked the trial court to grant them an injunction against litigation the franklin group had instituted in the san diego county superior court,seeking a judgment increasing the attorneys fees awarded them out of the proceeds of the class action settlement.the franklin group also led the fight to overturn the proposed settlement of class claims with southland,arguing that it was not the product of an arm length deal but the fruit of collusion among southland,the class representatives,and the texas lawyers who had succeeded them as class counsel.
the collusion hearings were followed by extensive briefing and evidentiary submissions on the merits of the proposed settlement agreement.additional hearings were held by the trial court on december,and.at the conclusion of these hearings,the trial court entered a tentative ruling finding the proposed settlement fair,adequate,and reasonable,and the objectors objections to it groundless.the trial court also certified a national class of current and former franchisees,entered an order tentatively approving the settlement,and directed that notice of settlement be mailed to all members of the class.a form of class notice was mailed in january,to current franchisees and former franchisees,giving them days in which to opt out of the class,file objections to the settlement or,by doing nothing,assent.
according to evidence in the record,the proposed settlement was widely discussed within the national franchise community.in a court declaration,eugene villagrana,one of the original class representatives,recounted a meeting of the national coalition of organization formed to promote its members interests nationally and of which he was a universal city,california,in february of.members of the coalition board heard arguments favoring and opposing the settlement presented by southland and objectors.the meeting closed with a to endorsement of the proposed agreement,one member abstaining.
out of a class totaling some franchisees,elected to opt out of the settlement objections were filed by a total of franchisees,of whom were represented by members of the franklin group.on april,the trial court resumed hearings,this time to consider final approval of the tentative settlement agreement.objectors,represented by the franklin group,appeared and renewed the objections made at the previous fairness hearings.the court again concluded the allegations of the objectors were without merit and entered a final order of approval accompanied by findings of fact and conclusions of law.these appeals followed 
by the terms of the settlement agreement,southland agreed to pay to the class of franchisees the sum of million,including a fund of million allocated as fees to former and current class counsel.seven million dollars of the settlement monies would be paid to former franchisees in the form of cash the remaining million would be used to benefit current franchisees through modifications to the standard franchise agreement,the installation and maintenance of a computerized billing system known as retail information system ris in franchise stores,and related benefits.
discussiona.preliminary observations.
before taking up the question of the fairness of the settlement agreement and the circumstances under which it was negotiated and approved by the trial court,we observe that the record before us on this appeal,summarized above,comprises some volumes,running to more than pages of briefing,rulings,discovery,and hearings transcripts.we summarize as well a kind of jurisprudence of class action settlements,relying on a brace of california and federal circuit case law defining the standard under which an appellate court reviews such matters.
standard of review of the fairness hearing.
discussing the criteria under which class action settlements are reviewed on appeal,the court in dunk ford motor th,d dunk,wrote o ur task is limited to a review of the trial court approval for a clear abuse of discretion.citation.we will not substitute our notions of fairness for those of the trial court and the parties to the agreement.citations.so long as the record is adequate to reach an intelligent and objective opinion of the probabilities of success should the claim be litigated and form an educated estimate of the complexity,expense and likely duration of such litigation,and all other factors relevant to a full and fair assessment of the wisdom of the proposed compromise,it is sufficient.citations.of course,such an assessment is nearly assured when all discovery has been completed and the case is ready for trial.citations.id.at,d.
due regard,the dunk court continued,should be given to what is otherwise a private consensual agreement between the parties.the inquiry must be limited to the extent necessary to reach a reasoned judgment that the agreement is not the product of fraud or overreaching by,or collusion between,the negotiating parties,and that the settlement,taken as a whole,is fair,reasonable and adequate to all concerned.citation.ultimately,the trial court determination is nothing more than an amalgam of delicate balancing,gross approximations and rough justice.citation.dunk,supra,th at,d.
a ninth circuit panel has used even stronger language.our task on appeal is a very limited one,it wrote.the initial decision to approve or reject a settlement proposal is committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge.citation.we are not permitted to substitute our notions of fairness for those of the district judge and the parties to the agreement.class plaintiffs city of seattle cir.neither the trial court nor this court is to reach any ultimate conclusions on the contested issues of fact and law which underlie the merits of the dispute,for it is the very uncertainty of outcome in litigation and avoidance of wasteful and expensive litigation that induce consensual settlements.officers for justice civil service com n,cir.in other words,the settlement or fairness hearing is not to be turned into a trial or rehearsal for trial on the merits.ibid.
great weight is accorded the trial judge views.the trial judge is exposed to the litigants,and their strategies,positions and proofs.he is aware of the expense and possible legal bars to success.simply stated,he is on the firing line and can evaluate the action accordingly.city of detroit grinnell corporation,cir,quoting ace heating plumbing,crane company cir.to merit reversal,both an abuse of discretion by the trial court must be clear and the demonstration of it on appeal strong.dunk,supra,th at,d officers for justice,supra,at strong showing of clear abuse of discretion linney cellular alaska partnership cir,we will reverse the district court decisions certifying a class only upon a showing that the trial court abused its discretion.
criteria for determining fairness.
the trial court possesses a broad discretion to determine the fairness of the settlement,a discretion exercised through the application of a handful of identified criteria.both the federal circuit courts and our court of appeal have adopted a mix of relevant considerations,including the strength of plaintiffs case,the risk,expense,complexity and likely duration of further litigation,the risk of maintaining class action status through trial,the amount offered in settlement,the extent of discovery completed and the stage of the proceedings,the experience and views of counsel,and the reaction of the class members to the proposed settlement.dunk,supra,th at,d.the list of factors is not exhaustive and should be tailored to each case.id.at,d.according to the dunk court,a presumption of fairness exists where the settlement is reached through arm length bargaining investigation and discovery are sufficient to allow counsel and the court to act intelligently counsel is experienced in similar litigation and the percentage of objectors is small.id.at,d see also newberg conte,newberg on class actions.ed.
finally,i t can not be overemphasized that neither the trial court in approving the settlement nor this court in reviewing that approval have the right or the duty to reach any ultimate conclusions on the issues of fact and law which underlie the merits of the dispute.it is well settled that in the judicial consideration of proposed settlements,the trial judge does not try out or attempt to decide the merits of the controversy,citation and the appellate court need not and should not reach any dispositive conclusions on the admittedly unsettled legal issue.city of detroit grinnell corporation,supra,at.
b.the merits of objectors appeals.
claim of evidentiary inadequacy of the trial court conclusion that the settlement was fair,adequate and reasonable.
starting from the proposition that the trial court was under a fiduciary duty running to the absent class members to ensure the settlement was fair,adequate and reasonable,objectors assert that in making that determination,the trial court was required to consider the value to the class of the alternative of litigating the case through trial to judgment.instead of undertaking that calculation,objectors insist the trial court delegated the determination of fairness,adequacy,and reasonableness to the settlement proponents and their counsel.it thus failed to independently evaluate the best possible recovery plaintiffs might have achieved without the proposed settlement,leaving this important function in the hands of the settlement proponents and their lawyers,groups already committed to the settlement and thus irretrievably biased.
objectors assert that,given the limitations of the california discovery,the absence of any significant discovery in the parallel texas valente case,and gaps in the rda financial data provided by southland,the trial court lacked any ability to assess the plaintiff class maximum potential recovery,had the decision been made to litigate the case rather than settle it.the only evidence offered at the fairness hearings,according to objectors,was the declaration of paul hanson,a southland,culp legal opinions based on reading pages of depositions,and a stale document summary prepared by franklin office,and allusions to undocumented representations made to culp by southland employees during settlement negotiations.but the hanson declaration,objectors contend,was prepared for purposes of defending southland position in this very litigation and was,moreover,incomplete and inaccurate on its face.at the least,they assert,it is fair to assume hanson revenue estimates were on the conservative side.moreover,hanson reviewed only cash receipts records and some documents relating to equipment.missing from his analysis was any reference to discounts or other rdas earned by southland.and while there was some evidence that southland took discounts without sharing them with the franchisees,the trial court had no hard which to estimate the total sum of these unshared discounts.thus,objectors conclude,a document prepared for purposes of litigation ultimately became the foundation for the settlement agreement.
in addition,hanson excluded all individual cash receipts of or less.using his numbers alone,objectors argue,there is evidence of million in rda credits that should have been included but were not.indeed,according to objectors,the trial court could not even determine whether the current franchisees were receiving a net positive settlement or giving up more than they were receiving.the same holds for the recoveries by current franchisees versus former franchisees.objectors contend,in short,that the proponents of the settlement failed to carry their burden of proving the settlement was fair,adequate,and reasonable.
finally,objectors argue that the settlement proponents had limited familiarity with the discovery that had been taken.culp reviewed aged summaries of discovery documents and admitted he had not reviewed any discovery for several months prior to the settlement negotiations.he failed to recognize any documents with which he was confronted on at the fairness hearings.and,if anything,the class representatives were even more in the dark than class counsel,owing to a protective order barring their access to the discovery results.the trial court acknowledged franklin was the most knowledgeable of the class attorneys,but placed no weight on the fact that he had been excluded from the settlement negotiations.these facts,objectors assert,place squarely in question the reliability of the information on which the settlement negotiations and agreement were based.they suggest,moreover,the existence of collusion among succeeding class counsel and southland and its attorneys in removing the franklin group as class counsel.
in rebuttal,the proponents of the settlement agreement direct our attention to the overarching standard under which class action settlements are reviewed on appeal.that standard is whether,in concluding the settlement agreement was fair,adequate and reasonable to absent class members,the trial court abused its discretion.applying to this record the seven factors identified by the court of appeal in dunk,supra,th at,d,there is no question,proponents tell us,that the trial court decision to approve the settlement was both proper and adequately supported by the evidence before it.the franchisee class,according to their analysis,had pleaded two claims with potential equipment and the wholesale purchases rdas.by class counsels estimate,if successful,these claims totaled less than million in damages.a third claim,for an estimated southland distribution center sdc rda less than a chance of success,according to class counsels analysis.and the fourth and final rda claim for a share of advertising rdas worth an estimated almost no chance of succeeding in counsels estimation,a conclusion founded on the view that most advertising during the relevant period qualified as cooperative,shared between the advertiser and southland and thus exempt under the franchise rda provision.more importantly,recoveries on the equipment claim might be lost altogether if southland limitations defense in the texas litigation proved successful.in addition,trial of the california case was imminent,would probably have lasted for months,and class counsel were not prepared to prove any of the rda claims except the first equipment and the purchase commitments.
according to proponents,three sources of evidence supported the settlement agreement extensive written evaluations of the case by the culp group as class counsel,and testimony from paul hanson,from culp,and from eugene villagrana,a franchisee and member of the national coalition.and notwithstanding objectors,the trial judge took the view that culp was in a better position to evaluate the settlement terms than franklin because he was the only lawyer on plaintiffs side of the case to pull together the separate work of six different attorneys in the california litigation.culp confidential analysis to the class representatives of april,filed with the trial court by franklin,was a candid assessment of the case and its prospects.
even objectors counsel agrees that substantial discovery occurred in the california case.the trial court likewise observed that franklin and his associates,as litigation counsel in the california lawsuit engaged in vigorous,aggressive and exhaustive discovery against southland.the company produced over a million pages of documents for inspection and responded to hundreds of interrogatories plaintiffs counsel deposed numerous southland employees.moreover,in the course of the settlement negotiations,southland produced additional rda financial data for the years to.these data were compiled by hanson,the southland auditor,who swore to their accuracy and who was by franklin at the preliminary approval hearing.
proponents argue,moreover,that it does not matter that little or no discovery had been conducted in the texas case since the same rdas at issue in the california litigation were also central to the texas lawsuit.the relevant invoices were received in southland dallas headquarters,not in the field.the rda financial data that southland disclosed in the california litigation were,according to counsel,aggregate nationwide data,which by definition related to the entire country,not just to california.excerpts from the deposition testimony of a southland auditor appear to confirm this.the invoices related not only to the california franchisees but to southland national rda practices.proponents conclude that the extensive discovery taken in the california case to identify the types of rdas that were and were not credited to the franchisees was equally applicable to valente,and was more than sufficient to analyze the strength of the nationwide claim.
by stipulation of the parties,the discovery depositions taken in the california litigation would be admissible in the texas litigation.but the compelling response to objectors claim that no discovery had been taken in texas,proponents argue,is that texas counsel could not deliver what objectors counsel wanted without risking losing the limitations defense since southland would not open up discovery without a ruling on the limitations issue.thus,the only way to improve the texas discovery was to roll the dice on the limitations defense.that,apparently,is what objectors counsel wanted to do.succeeding class counsel,however,considered the gamble not in the best interests of the class.given this record,we can not say they were wrong or,more accurately,that the trial court abused its considerable discretion in so concluding.in any event,that no class action can be settled until the last particle of discovery has been completed and analyzed is not the law.i n the context of class action settlements,formal discovery is not a necessary ticket to the bargaining table where the parties had sufficient information to make an informed decision about settlement citation.n otwithstanding the status of discovery,plaintiffs negotiators had access to a plethora of information regarding the facts of their case.linney,supra,at see also in re corrugated container antitrust litigation cir,italics omitted it is true that very little formal discovery was conducted and that there is no voluminous record in the case.however,the lack of such does not compel the conclusion that insufficient discovery was conducted plummer chemical bank cir,we do not mean to suggest that extensive discovery is a prerequisite to approval or that obstructionist tactics by a minority of objecting class members should be permitted to turn a settlement hearing into a full blown trial on the merits.
in any event,the merits of the underlying class claims are not a basis for upsetting the settlement of a class action the operative word is settlement.see,officers for justice,supra,at city of detroit grinnell corporation,supra,at the fact that a proposed settlement may only amount to a fraction of the potential recovery does not,in and of itself,mean that the proposed settlement is grossly inadequate and should be disapproved.linney,supra,at this court has aptly held that it is the very uncertainty of outcome in litigation and avoidance of wasteful and expensive litigation that induce consensual settlements.the proposed settlement is not to be judged against a hypothetical or speculative measure of what might have been achieved by the negotiators,italics omitted.all of the class claims were vigorously contested by southland.at the same time,southland understandably wanted to put an end to divisive litigation by settling the lawsuit.given these circumstances,class counsel recommended the litigation be settled for million.the members of the national coalition association accepted that proposal by a vote of to,with one member abstaining.percent of the members of the franchisee class voted to accept it.as a fiduciary of the absent class members,the trial court duty was to have before it sufficient information to determine if the settlement was fair,adequate,and reasonable.dunk,supra,th at,d.
we turn,then,to a consideration of the record in light of the factors identified by the court in dunk,supra,th at page,d,tailored to the circumstances of this particular case before doing so,however,we note that a voluntary conciliation and settlement are the preferred means of dispute resolution.this is especially true in complex class action litigation officers for justice,supra,at and that,according to the dunk court,a presumption of fairness exists where the settlement is reached through arm length bargaining investigation and discovery are sufficient to allow counsel and the court to act intelligently counsel is experienced in similar litigation and the percentage of objectors is small.dunk,supra,th at,d.
strength of plaintiffs case.
culp presented his assessment of the merits of plaintiffs case in testimony at the approval hearings.counsel thought two of the four rda claims had a good chance at prevailing if the case went to equipment claim and the mclane transition allowance claim.these claims culp estimated had a value of between million and million respectively.but he thought the plaintiff class would lose the sdc rda claim for the reasons given above,as well as the advertising allowance claim,because the bulk of these were cooperative in nature and thus exempt from sharing under the terms of the rda franchise provision.culp also acknowledged the role played by the significant limitations issue pending in the texas court and that failure there would wipe out a majority of the claims of the class members.moreover,because of an apparent breach of the privilege,the trial court had before it a copy of culp confidential memorandum to the class representatives,authored well before the settlement negotiations had begun,detailing a candid assessment of the merits of the case.and that document was not only not an appraisal,but its conclusions dovetailed with those of the trial judge,who remarked,i have looked at these contract provisions and i have serious reservations about whether there have been breaches sufficient even to bring these damages issues into account with the singular exception of the equipment allowances.
b.the risk,expense,complexity,and duration of further litigation and the risk of maintaining class action status through trial.
proponents suggest that trial of the rda claim might well require an examination of every invoice that southland vendors had provided it for over a decade in order to ascertain the magnitude of the claims at issue.whether that is true or not,it seems clear enough that trial of the case would have required the preparation and testimony of opposing financial and accounting experts,as well as their depositions and the not insubstantial associated litigation costs.trial itself would have been lengthy and complex.and,as detailed elsewhere in this opinion,the risks of maintaining class action status and pursuing judgment through trial would have been large.
c.the amount offered in settlement.
proponents point out that,given the problems with proof,the uncertain fate of the limitations issue in the texas lawsuit,and an interest on the part of both sides in ending divisive litigation that threatened to harm ongoing business relationships,a settlement fund of million was not unattractive.the litigation interfered with attempts to cooperate in a successful business,especially after recent business reversals suffered by southland and its franchisees.
stage at which settlement is reached.
as noted,settlement came only after some four and a half years of litigation,including voluminous discovery and many motions filed and argued by both sides.the trial court was afforded the opportunity both to review many of the materials produced by discovery and to observe at close hand the ability of counsel for all of the parties.see dunk,supra,th at,d.
e.the experience and views of counsel.
the resumes of class counsel are a matter of record and disclose that all were experienced litigators,including several with prior class action litigation experience.and,as noted,class counsel recommended settlement on the negotiated terms.
f.the reaction of the class members to the proposed settlement.
according to the record,the response of the absent class members to the proposed settlement with southland was overwhelmingly positive.a mere of the national class members elected to opt out and most of them had particularized reasons for doing so that were unrelated to the rda claims.a total of nine of whom were clients of the franklin to the settlement.as the trial court observed,the magnitude of the favorable response was particularly impressive in this case,coming from a class composed of not unsophisticated business owners and operators.finally,the national coalition of franchisees voted to in favor of the settlement,an indictor we find particularly telling.
in light of this evaluation,we can not say the trial court abused its discretion in concluding the settlement was fair,adequate,and reasonable.indeed,we think the four factors identified by the court in length bargaining adequate investigation and discovery experienced counsel and a small percentage of to a presumption the settlement was fair,a presumption objectors have failed to overcome.see dunk,supra,th at,d.
the due diligence controversy.
in tentatively approving the settlement agreement,objectors tell us,the trial court relied heavily on representations by class counsel that a postsettlement due diligence audit of rda financial data produced by southland would take place,observing that t hese verification provisions furnish additional insurance that the settlement will be based on adequate information about the potential magnitude of the claims in this case.the class notice contained similar assurances,advising absent class members that if the accountant finds significant errors in the allowance data the class representatives have the option of terminating the settlement.the promised audit thus became,objectors argue,the pillar supporting the trial court determination that the settlement was fair,adequate,and reasonable.in the event,however,objectors argue the due diligence audit metamorphosed into an unsworn farrago of hearsay statements by class counsel in a letter to the class representatives relaying what the accountants allegedly told him they had found.no signature of any accountant or auditor was ever presented to the court no testimony regarding a real audit was ever taken.the trial court had no opportunity to examine anyone as to findings made or the procedures followed by the accountants.the vaunted audit,objectors assert,failed even to qualify as a compilation of documents,the lowest level of accounting work product.the trial court was noticeably uncomfortable at the final approval hearing,objectors assert,and in the end announced it would not consider the culp summary of the accountants findings.however,the court then referred to that document several times during the remainder of the hearing.
according to objectors,these circumstances placed the trial court in a situation if it considered the culp due diligence letter,that letter failed to provide the promised analysis of financial data if it did not consider the letter,the trial court was left without any basis for filling the informational gaps it had acknowledged existed at the preliminary approval stage.the trial court was left with no real choice,objectors conclude it was presented with what looks like a fait accompli.quoting in re general motors.truck fuel tank products liability litigation cir,truck litigation.
the proponents response to this line of argument is to remind us that no good deed goes unpunished.while the franklin group discovery efforts may have been ineffective,they did not undermine class counsels ability to evaluate the settlement value of the case.according to proponents,the franklin group had done little to confirm the accuracy of southland figures regarding the magnitude of the rdas in controversy.the only information counsel had obtained was southland interrogatory answers to the effect that its figures were substantially accurate.succeeding class counsel,however,did not believe it was prudent to accept these figures without some degree of independent checking.accordingly,as part of the settlement negotiations,the parties agreed that following preliminary approval of the settlement by the trial court,class counsel would select accountants to test the validity of southland rda data by sampling the underlying records,interviewing southland accounting personnel,and taking related due diligence measures southland would pay to defray the cost of the review work and the settlement would be voidable at plaintiffs option if significant as understating aggregate dollar amounts by percent or found.as adopted by the negotiators and accepted by southland and the class representatives,the due diligence provision took the following form 
southland represents that to the best of its knowledge as of the date of execution of this agreement,the information set forth in exhibit and the schedules thereto,as explained and qualified therein,is correct.class counsel will be given an opportunity to review and verify the allowance data and to otherwise complete such due diligence as they deem appropriate.to facilitate the review and verification,southland will make its internal accounting personnel reasonably available to class counsel and to class counsel independent accountant.southland will pay for the expense of class counsel independent accountant in an amount not to exceed note later raised to if class counsel review and verification of the allowance data indicates that the aggregate dollar amount of the allowances,set forth in exhibit and the schedules thereto have been understated by percent or more,then the class representatives may,at their option,terminate this settlement agreement within days of the alameda count superior court order tentatively approving this settlement 
pointing to the text of this provision,proponents say the verification procedure was never intended to be an audit or to result in a formal report.instead,the process was meant to give the class representatives and their attorneys additional assurance that the rda financial data provided by southland were accurate.an actual audit of the rda data would have required review of hundreds of millions of dollars in rdas that southland had processed over the preceding years,and would have been and costly.instead,according to class counsel,independent accountants were hired to review southland work and determine if there was any reasonable basis to believe there were substantial errors in the information provided.according to culp letter to the class representatives,lodged with the trial court,the accountants found no reason to believe southland figures were misstated.we think the text of the due diligence provision of the settlement agreement,quoted above,bears out this view of the role of the sampling by the accountants.and while the counsels report on the results of the sample might have been handled more deftly,no audit was required as a condition of court approval.the due diligence process that was employed by class counsel went beyond any legal requirement for a valid settlement.
claims of collusive settlement.
according to objectors,this case is replete with circumstantial evidence of an unholy alliance,evidenced by a ignoring of hard questions and of cooperation with and blind reliance upon southland,between the proposed class representatives,texas counsel,some of the california counsel and defendant southland and its attorneys.relying on truck litigation,supra.at,objectors insist the result of that alliance was to exclude the most knowledgeable attorney for the plaintiff class,franklin,from the settlement negotiations to exclude any putative class representatives who even questioned the settlement and to move the proposed settlement through the process with a momentum and inevitability that made the absent class members accept it as a fait accompli.moreover,in what objectors term was a direct violation of the views of the third and ninth federal circuits,the settlement agreement was negotiated in tandem with the proposed award of attorneys fees to class counsel.the third circuit,objectors argue,has virtually prohibited the conjunctive negotiation of attorney fees with the terms of class action settlement agreements.see truck litigation,supra,at.in this case,however,the terms of the proposed settlement and class counsels fees were negotiated in a package deal,circumstantial evidence,objectors argue,of a collusive settlement made to the disadvantage of excluded class counsel and the absent class members.
we explore the claim that the simultaneous negotiation of settlement terms and class counsels fees is a per se violation at greater length below.see post.but as for the claim that momentum for settlement pushed aside substantive concerns over its fairness,serious settlement discussions often induce a kind of momentum.and the momentum and fait accompli language objectors invoke is just made by courts in true class actions,making them not pertinent here.see mars steel corporation continental illinois national bank and trust company,mars steel where notice of the class action is sent simultaneously with the notice of the settlement itself,the class members are presented with what looks like a fait accompli truck litigation,supra,at the mere presentation of the settlement notice with the class notice may pressure even skeptical class members to accept the settlement out of the belief that,unless they are willing to litigate their claims individually they really have no choice.as we explain later in this opinion,this is not a genuine class action for the obvious reason that it had been heatedly litigated for over four years before settlement discussions ensued.
linked to the claim that counsel sold out the class for a mess of pottage is the related claim that james alberts,a member of the original group of who brought the california suit,had been saddled with a judgment for in costs taxed against the class representatives when summary judgment was granted against defendants on plaintiffs failed antitrust causes of action.on that ground alone,objectors argue,alberts was in a position to collude with southland by promoting an inadequate settlement in exchange for a forgiveness of the costs bill.it is true that the trial court expressed some unhappiness with alberts,but what provoked its ire was alberts failure to disclose the potential conflict when the class was certified the preceding november.
moreover,alberts was one of three class representatives.the trial court held a evidentiary hearing to assess these claims on november and.it heard from eight witnesses,including principals at the august settlement negotiations with southland.so far as we are able to glean from the record,southland offered alberts nothing there was no agreement to settle his suit filed by franklin the only time the topic came up,alberts was told the cost bill issue could not be coupled with the settlement discussions and would have to wait.at the conclusion of the november hearings,the trial court entered a finding that the charges of fraud,collusion or other wrongdoing by class representatives are entirely groundless and unfounded there is no evidence that any of them did anything unethical or improper or contrary to the interests of the class.
as for alberts being the chief instigator of the settlement,the two other class representatives participated in the august negotiations as well they conferred with class counsel during the talks and counsel continued to negotiate the terms with southland lawyers over several additional months.even if alberts were pursuing a personal supposition lacking support in the remaining class representatives appear to have been fully capable of protecting the interests of the class members.
the trial court explored the franklin group claim of a collusive settlement at three evidentiary october and again on november and,in the end pronounced them groundless.the latter two collusion hearings included the testimony of several witnesses who had participated in the settlement negotiations.six witnesses testified at the december fairness hearings.counsel for the objectors submitted over pages of argument and supporting materials to the trial court.the trial court considered these objections again at the daylong final hearing of april.and preceding that,counsel for objectors had filed with the court more than pages of materials in opposition to the settlement agreement and fee requests.we can not,in the face of such a record,say the trial judge abused his discretion in finding the claims of a collusive settlement to be without substance.
next,objectors assert the settlement agreement establishment of an allowance review committee arc,made up of seven franchisees to monitor southland rda processing for a period of six years,is nothing more than a thinly disguised form of to the class representatives for delivering an undervalued settlement to southland.it was alberts,objectors say,who was instrumental in negotiating the arc provision,which sets aside a budget of for six years and provides each committee member with a year in compensation.asserting that the average annual compensation for a franchisee is,objectors assail the arc as a form of additional compensation to the class representatives,a means of obtaining disproportionate economic benefits for themselves,not shared with the remainder of the class.
the arc provision of the settlement agreement,however,did not identify anyone as a committee member the class representatives were to select five of the seven members and southland the remaining two.and rather than a perquisite,the annual compensation paid the arc members is in exchange for work performed by them in monitoring southland rda accounting.we agree with the proponents that the arc provision of the settlement imposes substantial responsibilities on its members and that the annual compensation is not unreasonable.
claim class counsel had substantial conflicts of interest and could not adequately represent the class.
under this heading,objectors assert the culp firm originally was retained by the texas franchisees in to pursue the valente litigation.by late,objectors tell us,the firm was pursuing settlement discussions without the knowledge of their clients,and before either class certification or the selection of class counsel had occurred.eight of the ten class representatives in the texas litigation asked the culp group to cease negotiations with southland until some discovery had been conducted.the upshot of this request,objectors say,was the culp group withdrawal from representing the unhappy clients,and its representation of the remaining two class representatives,on whose behalf it continued to negotiate a settlement of the texas litigation with southland.as eventually negotiated with southland,the california settlement gave the culp group million in attorneys fees and placed limits on the fee recovery of the franklin group,which had done all the work.it is reasonable to infer,objectors infer,that a collusive occurred in which the class and former counsel took less and the settlement attorneys took more of the pie.
according to objectors,the third circuit has flatly prohibited simultaneous negotiation of attorneys fees and settlement terms.that is no longer,however,an accurate statement.while the third circuit formerly barred simultaneous negotiation of class settlement terms and counsel fees,in its truck litigation opinion,the court acknowledged that the supreme court opinion in evans jeff,d overruled the third circuit strict rule prohibiting simultaneous negotiations of counsel fees and settlement terms.truck litigation,supra,at see evans jeff,supra,at.if attorneys fee waivers can not be negotiated,the settlement package must either contain an attorneys fee component of potentially large and typically uncertain magnitude,or else the parties must agree to have the fee fixed by the court.even for the third circuit,the timing of class counsels attorneys fee negotiations is now merely one factor in evaluating the settlement adequacy.see truck litigation,supra,at we see no reason why jeff or its underlying policy of avoiding rules that impede settlement preclude us from considering the timing of fee negotiations as a factor in our review of the adequacy of the class representation.here,of course,there is no contention that the total fee award is excessive in point of fact,the franklin group takes the opposite position,arguing that more in the way of attorneys fees should have been granted them.
objectors related claim that the culp group had a conflict because they withdrew as class counsel in the texas litigation also falls short.counsels withdrawal was approved by the trial judge in the valente case and the remaining class representatives were successively represented by members of the franklin group.moreover,conflict and division between class counsel and class representatives are sufficiently common in class action litigation to have made the appellate reports counsels duty runs to the class as a whole and the governing rule is,in the event of conflicts,withdrawal is the appropriate course for counsel to take.see,kincade general tire rubber cir,because the client in a class action consists of numerous unnamed class members as well as the class representatives,and because t he class itself often speaks in several voices,it may be impossible for the class attorney to do more than act in what he believes to be the best interests of the class as a whole maywalt parker parsley petroleum cir,inherent in any class action is the potential for conflicting interests among the class representatives,class counsel,and absent class members in re agent orange product liability litigation cir,a motion to disqualify an attorney who has represented the entire class and who has thereafter been retained by a fraction of the class to represent its interests in opposition to a proposed settlement can not be automatically granted.rather,there must be a balancing of the interests of the various groups of class members and of the interest of the public.in light of this repeated judicial recognition,we can not say the culp group acted improperly in withdrawing as counsel for the valente plaintiffs who opposed the settlement and in pursuing it on behalf of some of the class representatives.
finally,objectors claim franklin was excluded from the settlement negotiations with southland officials.the record,however,fails to bear out this contention.franklin was asked to allow the class representatives to meet with southland executives in august of,and he agreed.he advised his clients by telephone during the course of those meetings.and franklin and a colleague participated in several subsequent negotiations with southland executives.we find no merit in this claim.
claim trial court failed to independently determine whether the proposed national settlement class met certification standards.
objectors complain that the trial court conducted no hearings and observed none of the required formalities under rule a in certifying a national class of plaintiff eleven franchisees.see truck litigation,supra,at the procedural formalities of certification are important even if the case appears to be headed for settlement rather than litigation.they argue that a fairness determination alone is no surrogate for rule findings,and that even after being reminded of the need to do so at the final settlement proceedings,the trial court conducted no hearings on anything except allegations of fraud,collusion,and the fairness of the proposed settlement.no evidence was presented.and no evidence,objectors charge,supports the trial court finding that a national settlement class was appropriate for certification.a review of the five days of fairness hearings demonstrates the complete absence of any evidence on the issue of national class certification.the trial court failed entirely to require a showing of adequate representation by either counsel or the proposed class representatives of the national class.we are urged to hold that this absence is fatal to the proposed settlement.
in rebuttal,proponents assert it would have made little sense to southland to have settled the class litigation in california only,leaving the pending texas proceedings to continue to trial.the company had no interest in settling one case while the other continued,because piecemeal settlement would not have eliminated litigation costs or ended the threat of divisiveness between southland and its franchisees.indeed,southland was concerned that such a path would have increased tensions among the class of california retail operators and those in other states.the question thus became,according to the settlement proponents,whether the california court was the proper forum for a global settlement of the franchise issues.and indeed,it appears that former class counsel,franklin,at one time thought it was.the california case had been filed three years earlier than the valente litigation in texas.and the trial court had held an hearing in june of,on the motion of counsel to certify the suit as a class action,and found,among other matters,that the rda claims were suitable for class treatment.
a comparison of the complaints filed in both cases confirms that the claims pleaded by the valente plaintiffs were not materially different from the california rda claims.moreover,the breakaway texas plaintiffs had sought national excluding california class certification in the texas litigation.the trial court findings from the june certification hearing appear equally applicable to the valente litigation.additional plaintiffs were added to the group of class representatives in the california suit in the june hearing.last,the trial court also assessed the qualifications of class counsel in its order of may.notably,unlike the typical class action in which a finding of representational adequacy is made early in the proceedings,the finding here came only after the trial judge had had the opportunity to observe class counsel,both in action and in regarding the adequacy of their representation.
writing of the class action,a prominent federal appellate jurist has said where notice of the class action is sent simultaneously with notice of the settlement itself,the class members are presented with what looks like a fait accompli.mars steel,supra,at.yet,although criticized,every court that has addressed the question has declined to hold that the procedure is a per se violation of rule of the federal rules and therefore requires that the settlement automatically be disapproved.id.at.however,the federal circuits,following the united states supreme court ruling in amchem,supra,d,have made it clear that certifications in such class actions must have given undiluted,even heightened,attention to class certification requirements in a settlement context in the interest of blocking unwarranted or overbroad class definitions.hanlon chrysler cir,quoting amchem,supra,at.
the hanlon court elaborated on the amchem requirement of heightened attention to certifications in the settlement context and the reasons behind it.the amchem court also noted the problem of counsel not prepared to try a case,it wrote,such counsel is,almost by definition,inadequate because an inability or unwillingness to try a case means the class loses all of the benefits of adversarial litigation the trial court must be skeptical of some settlement agreements put before them because they are presented with a bargain proffered for approval without benefit of an adversarial investigation.hanlon,supra,at,quoting amchem,supra,at.
we think this case falls between two stools.it does not qualify as a true class action,for the obvious reason that it was extensively litigated for several years preceding national certification.moreover,in december of,the trial court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law approving a conditional settlement class.among those findings and conclusions was a determination that a settlement of the class claims was appropriate because the principal claims were common to members of the national class.the trial court also made findings which can be read as satisfying the other criteria of rule a numerosity,typicality,and adequacy of representation.to the extent objectors contend these findings were insufficient,the short answer was given by the dunk court no findings were required dunk,supra,th at,d.but we also think that if there was error,it was harmless under the circumstances disclosed by this record.the rule certification criteria had been extensively briefed by the parties prior to the daylong hearing on june,the trial court entered a class certification order on july.it is clear from the record that these same criteria were applicable to the national class.moreover,the case had been vigorously litigated for over four years,removing any concerns that class counsel negotiated a settlement without the benefit of adversarial investigation.under these circumstances,we conclude no reversible error was committed.
claims of discrimination within the class.
objectors next assert the settlement improperly discriminates in favor of current franchisees at the expense of former franchisees.they point out that current franchisees receive million in future benefits,while former operators must settle for million in cash.there is,however,no legal requirement that all members of the class must participate equally in any settlement.while intraclass disparities may be a signal of unfairness,the
