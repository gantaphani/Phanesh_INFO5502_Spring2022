the defendants,david wittig and douglas lake,came to kansas from wall street investment banks to run the state largest public utility,now known as westar energy.the government convinced the jury in this case that the two men had conducted a scheme to milk the company for all they could through a pattern of fraud and deceit.but the prosecution hung by a thin legal thread.despite the scope of the alleged fraudulent scheme,all the counts of the indictment depended on proving the efforts of the defendants to conceal from the united states securities and exchange commission sec their personal use of corporate aircraft.the attempt to prove concealment was flawed,however,because the government produced no evidence that the defendants failed to comply with sec regulations governing the reporting of such personal use and the jury was never instructed regarding the sec reporting requirements.as a result,we must set aside the convictions on every count,most of which can not be retried.
the indictment charged counts of wire fraud,counts of money laundering,counts of circumvention of internal financial controls,and count of conspiracy to engage in these substantive offenses.a fortieth count sought forfeiture of the fruits of the alleged offenses.the offense of wire fraud requires a scheme to defraud and the use of an interstate wire communication to further the scheme.each count alleged the wire transmission to the sec of a different required report.transmission of a required report can serve as the predicate for a offense only if the report is itself false or fraudulent.the government alleged that the reports were deceptive because they failed to disclose the great value to the defendants about million each of their personal use of corporate aircraft.but sec regulations require reporting only the additional cost to the corporation incurred as a result of the corporate officer personal travel,and then only if the total additional cost exceeds a certain threshold per year for the officer.the government offered no evidence that the additional cost to westar of either defendant personal travel ever exceeded this threshold indeed,it offered no evidence of the additional cost to westar for any of the personal trips.therefore,the jury could not possibly determine that the reports,which disclosed no personal travel by the defendants,were false.consequently,we must reverse the convictions because of insufficient evidence.further prosecution of these charges is barred by the double jeopardy clause.
as the government properly conceded at oral argument,if the charges fall,then so must the convictions.the charges alleged that the defendants had used the fruits of their scheme to acquire various assets.if there was no wire fraud,there was no money laundering.these charges,too,can not be retried.
as for the circumvention charges,they were based on the failure of the defendants to disclose their personal travel on corporate aircraft in various internal forms used to prepare reports for the sec.the core issue with respect to these failures to disclose is the defendants intent.they argued at trial that other westar officers almost always failed to report such travel and that one could infer that they thought such disclosure was unnecessary.to counter this inference,the government offered evidence of the great value to the defendants of this travel again,about million each,making it unlikely that they would think it inconsequential.the defendants sought from the district court an instruction to the jury explaining that the proper consideration was not the value of the travel to the defendants but the much lower additional cost of the travel to westar.the court refused to give the instruction.because this instruction could easily have influenced the jury in deciding whether the defendants failure to disclose was with the requisite intent,we must also reverse the circumvention convictions,although without prejudice to a retrial.
finally,given the dependence of the conspiracy charges on the evidence and instructions regarding the substantive charges,we must also reverse the conspiracy convictions and remand for retrial.the forfeitures likewise can not stand.in light of our reversal of all the convictions on the above grounds,we need not address a number of other issues raised by the defendants regarding the conduct of the trial and their sentences.
background 
we summarize the evidence at trial in the light most favorable to the jury verdict.see united states espinoza,cir.in john hayes,the chief executive officer ceo of westar then known as western resources,recruited wittig a new york investment banker who had performed services for westar to join westar as executive vice president of corporate strategy to develop and implement a diversification plan for the utility.wittig original compensation included a salary of,a relocation benefit,stock,various short and incentives,and other benefits.by early hayes had left westar,the board of directors had appointed wittig as president,ceo,and chairman of the board,and lake,also a new york investment banker,had joined westar as executive vice president and chief strategic officer.
the diversification strategy initiated in involved the acquisition of various unregulated businesses.in westar attempted to acquire adt,a national security company.although the acquisition ultimately failed,westar made approximately million purchasing and then selling adt stock.in westar acquired a company,protection one,and bought stock in guardian international,a business.westar stock price increased dramatically and between and its assets grew from billion to billion although its debt increased from billion to billion.
as wittig replaced hayes at the helm,however,the tide began to turn.in early accounting irregularities and an sec investigation caused protection one share price to plummet.westar share price also fell sharply,from a high of almost in to about by the end of.
westar hired two investment banks to help restore shareholder value.they recommended that the regulated utility business be split from westar unregulated businesses and merge with another utility the transaction.westar board approved the proposal in,the unregulated businesses were split from the utility to create westar industries,and the search for a merger partner began.but the kansas corporation commission kcc in rejected the plan,scuttling a proposed merger.it also ordered westar to cut rates by million when westar had been seeking a million rate increase.westar stock hit a low of near per share in late,about the time of the departures of wittig and lake.
although at trial the defendants portrayed the diversification efforts as attempts to uplift and then save westar,the government presented a far different view.it contended that the efforts were the central feature of a scheme by the defendants to loot westar.the most ambitious prospect of the scheme was to collect huge sums to million for wittig and to million for lake from provisions of their employment contracts that would be triggered by completion of the transaction.
a second component of the alleged scheme was profiting by wittig million and lake million from complex transactions in guardian shares that caused a million loss to westar.also parts of the alleged scheme were acceleration of a million signing bonus to wittig that was to have been paid over a period beginning in improper payment of relocation expenses improper loans from westar acquisition of a contract for wittig at a far greater cost to westar than the bonus it was ostensibly to replace and personal use of westar aircraft.to accomplish this looting,the defendants misled the board of directors and connived to remove two board members who asked challenging questions the two resigned voluntarily.
the defendants personal use of westar aircraft was of central importance to the prosecution case.wittig,lake,and their families apparently flew on the aircraft on numerous personal trips.the flight logs,however,always listed the purpose of the trip as business.to identify personal trips,the government had an accountant,john meara,review the logs and select those trips on which only a defendant family members and employees were passengers,the flight took place over a weekend or holiday or the defendant calendar noted a vacation,and there was no business entry on the defendant calendar within hours of arrival.personal use of the aircraft violated a westar ethics policy that forbade personal use of corporate property in the absence of a policy allowing such use,although the defendants apparently were not alone in this violation.evidence indicated that a number of other westar executives including westar general counsel and directors flew family members on corporate aircraft between and.
federal law required westar to submit annually to the sec a annual report,see and a proxy statement,see id.the presents information about the company finances,business activities,and management.see form available at last visited.the presents,among other things,information about the compensation for the ceo and the next four most highly compensated officers of the company.see id.item requiring information set forth in id.a persons for whom disclosure is required.westar electronically submitted these reports to the sec they are available to the public.see a iii.to assist him in preparing these annual filings,westar general counsel distributed to its directors and officers annual director and officer d o questionnaires that requested the recipients to disclose all compensation they had received that year,including any personal benefits.each questionnaire provided a nonexhaustive list of examples of possible personal benefits,including home repairs and improvements,personal travel expenses,and personal use of westar property,such as cars,planes,apartments,or vacation homes.
wittig and lake both failed to list their personal use of corporate aircraft as compensation on the d o questionnaires.in this failure they had company.between and,out of all the directors and officers to whom a d o questionnaire was distributed,only westar general counsel john rosenberg in and westar director edwards in disclosed personal use of corporate aircraft.among those who failed to disclose personal use were westar general counsel rick terrill and his assistant,and later successor,larry irick.westar did not disclose any personal use of corporate aircraft in its sec filings,even for rosenberg and edwards.
a central issue at trial was whether wittig and lake acted with wrongful intent in failing to report on the d o questionnaires their personal use of company planes.highly pertinent to the assessment of that intent is whether the personal use had to be reported to the sec.the defendants asserted that sec regulations governing the and forms required disclosure of personal airplane use only if the aggregate incremental cost exceeded a certain lesser of and of annual salary plus that their use did not meet this threshold.the government argued that all compensation had to be disclosed,cash and noncash,regardless of the amount.but the government made no effort to inform the jury of what was specifically required by sec regulations,contending that the regulations were irrelevant.rather,it focused on the extremely high value of the personal trips.accountant meara testified to the charter value of the trips,informing the jury of the cost per hour of renting on the open market a similar plane for the trips.in calculating the charter value of the trips,he included the cost of dead head flights in which an empty plane returned to its base after delivering passengers or flew from its base to pick up passengers.he computed a total charter value for the period to of approximately million each for wittig and lake.
to support its contention that wittig failure to report his personal travel was a willful violation of the law,the government offered evidence of two occasions on which he had directed nondisclosure.first,in westar chief financial officer cfo had discussed with wittig the tax consequences of the personal airplane use and how the company should account for it.he informed wittig that the corporation tax department recommended that westar begin imputing airplane use to the employees,so that the travel would be deductible to the corporation but taxable income to employees.wittig decided that westar would not change its policy.
second,in,when the kcc was scrutinizing westar plan,arthur andersen llp,westar outside accounting firm,suggested to westar internal auditor,jeanette tryon,that she conduct an audit of corporate airplane logs.she met with wittig to inform him of the audit and determine the location of the flight logs.wittig told her that she was not to do the audit because the kcc would likely want the results.she informed arthur anderson of the refusal,but it did not pursue the matter with her during her remaining brief time with the company.a day or two after her conversation with wittig,the cfo offered tryon an attractive but voluntary severance package although she had been told just a few weeks earlier that the company wanted her to stay despite layoffs in her department.she accepted the package and left soon thereafter.
wittig and lake were indicted in december in the united states district court for the district of kansas.in the superseding indictment seven counts charged both men with wire fraud.see.each count alleged the scheme to loot westar the counts differed only in that each alleged a different wire transmission four annual reports one for each year from through and three proxy statements one for each year from through.seventeen counts charged the defendants with having engaged in monetary transactions in criminally derived property.see id.seven of these counts were based on transactions of wittig at capital city,increases in his line of credit and subsequent draws on that line of credit secured by property obtained through the wire fraud.the other counts alleged sales of westar stock obtained through the wire fraud.fourteen counts charged the defendants with having circumvented internal financial controls.see b.thirteen of these alleged that the defendants had circumvented internal controls by failing to report personal use of corporate aircraft on different annual d o questionnaires for westar,westar industries a subsidiary of westar,and protection one.wittig did not fill out anything in the d o reports for the three corporations.the remaining circumvention count alleged that wittig had circumvented internal controls by prohibiting westar internal auditor from performing an audit of corporate aircraft use.the conspiracy count charged the defendants with having conspired to commit wire fraud,money laundering,and circumvention.finally,the fortieth count of the indictment sought forfeiture of everything each had acquired as a result of the conspiracy,scheme,and money laundering.see a c and c.
the defendants first trial ended in a mistrial on december,because the jury failed to agree on a verdict.see united states wittig,d.they were retried six months later.see id.at the close of the government evidence,wittig and lake moved under.a for a judgment of acquittal.the district court reserved its ruling and the jury found wittig guilty on all counts and lake guilty on.the jury decided that many,but not all,of the assets listed in the forfeiture count should be forfeited.after the verdict wittig and lake renewed their motions for acquittal and alternatively sought a new trial.the district court denied both motions.
the district court sentenced wittig to years imprisonment,fined him million,and ordered him to pay restitution of almost million.it sentenced lake to years imprisonment,fined him million,and ordered him to pay restitution of about million.
ii.discussion 
wire fraud 
the statute,states 
whoever,having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud,or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises,transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of wire,radio,or television communication in interstate or foreign commerce,any writings,signs,signals,pictures,or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice,shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than years,or both.
emphasis added.the statute tracks language of the statute,id,substituting the italicized language above for the language italicized below in the statute,which states in pertinent part 
whoever,having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud,or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice or attempting to do so,places in any post office or authorized depository for mail matter,any matter or thing whatever to be sent or delivered by the postal service shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than years,or both 
emphasis added.interpretations of are authoritative in interpreting parallel language in.see pasquantino united states,d.
the elements of the offense of wire fraud in this case are a scheme to defraud,an interstate wire communication,and a purpose to use the wire communication to execute the scheme.see united states janusz,cir.the third element is the central dispute on this appeal.in other words,were the wire communications transmitted for the purpose of executing the scheme.
the wire communications that allegedly violated were seven filings of reports with the sec annual reports for to and annual proxy statements for to.the defendants contend that the third element was not established at trial because these reports were required by law and the government failed to prove that they contained anything false.we agree.
corporations are required by law to file both the report,see a form shall be used for annual reports required by or d and the schedule,see information specified in schedule must be provided to persons whose proxies are solicited see also a issuers wishing to solicit proxies must follow rules prescribed by sec.as we shall explain,the government failed to show that there was anything false or fraudulent about any of the reports upon which the seven counts rested.as far as the trial evidence showed,even in the absence of a fraudulent scheme the seven reports would have been filed and the contents would have been the same.in this circumstance,one can not say that the wire transmissions were for the purpose of executing the scheme.the reports were filed because they had to be,not because of any unlawful scheme.of course,a filing required by law could be used to further a scheme if it was itself false or fraudulent but the government did not show that there was anything misleading in the reports.consequently,we can not see how their filing advanced the alleged fraudulent scheme or how one could say that the defendants purpose in filing them was to advance the scheme.
this is an easier case than parr united states,d,in which the supreme court found no violation of the statute.the scheme in that case was the misappropriation of funds for the personal benefit of the defendants.the mailings,including letters,tax statements,checks and receipts,were all legally compelled mailings related to the assessment and collection of taxes by the school district.id.at.the taxes collected,of course,were the source of the funds that were then misappropriated.there could be no doubt that the collection of tax money was necessary to accomplish the defendants scheme after all,if no taxes were collected,there would be no money to misappropriate.nevertheless,in setting aside the convictions the court wrote 
w e think it can not be said that mailings made or caused to be made under the imperative command of duty imposed by state law are criminal under the federal mail fraud statute,even though some of those who are so required to do the mailing for the district plan to steal,when or after received,some indefinite part of its moneys.
nor,in the light of the facts in this record,can it be said that the mailings constituted false pretenses and misrepresentations to obtain money.
id.at.as summarized in schmuck united states,d 
parr held that in the absence of any evidence that the tax levy was increased as part of the fraud,the mailing element of the offense could not be supplied by mailings made or caused to be made under the imperative command of duty imposed by state law,at.t he mailings of the tax documents in parr were the direct product of the school district state constitutional duty to levy taxes and would have been made regardless of the defendants fraudulent scheme 
most other circuits to address the issue have interpreted parr to hold that mailings of documents which are required by law to be mailed,and which are not themselves false and fraudulent,can not be regarded as mailed for the purpose of executing a fraudulent scheme.united states curry,cir see united states cross,cir united states gray,cir,rev on other grounds sub nom.mcnally united states,d united states boyd,cir alternative holding.a divided panel of the seventh circuit did not read parr so broadly,see united states green,cir,but we think that the dissent in that case had the better of the argument.not only did the green majority opinion adopt an unconvincingly crabbed interpretation of parr,but it failed to explain how a nonmisleading mailing compelled by law can be for the purpose of furthering a fraudulent scheme.as the dissent pointed out,so far as appears,the defendant mailed the notices that were the predicate for the charges only because it was his official duty if he had mailed the letters he would have been fired.id.at.in any event,even under green,the government must prove that mailings were important to the successful execution of the fraud,id.at,and there was,as we shall see,no such proof in this case.
we now explain why the seven filed reports were not false or fraudulent,at least as far as the trial evidence shows.we note that the district court incorrectly instructed the jury that the truth of the reports was irrelevant,see.vol.iii at instruction but we are not reversing the convictions because of a faulty instruction.we are reversing because of a lack of sufficient evidence even if the jury had been correctly instructed,it could not properly have found that the reports were false or fraudulent.
whether the reports were false depends on what is required to be reported.an sec regulation mandates that companies follow form when filing the annual reports required by of the securities exchange act of.see.a second regulation requires companies wishing to solicit proxies to provide the solicited persons with a publicly filed statement containing the information specified in schedule.see id.for both form and schedule,information regarding executive compensation must be furnished in accordance with regulation,item,id.see sec form,item,available at last visited,item.
because of the central importance of the disclosure requirements to our analysis,we discuss at length item of regulation.item a states that the item 
requires clear,concise and understandable disclosure of all plan and compensation awarded to,earned by,or paid to the covered executive officers and directors by any person for all services rendered in all capacities to the registrant and its subsidiaries,unless otherwise specified in this item.
id.a.disclosure is made in a summary compensation table which contains columns in which to report the various components of compensation.columns a and b provide the name and position of the officer and the fiscal year reported on.see id.b i,ii.annual compensation is reported in columns c,d,and e according to the following directions in item 
the table shall include 
iii annual compensation columns c,d,and e,including 
a the dollar value of base salary cash and earned by the named executive officer during the fiscal year covered column c 
b the dollar value of bonus cash and earned by the named executive officer during the fiscal year covered column d and 
c the dollar value of other annual compensation not properly categorized as salary or bonus,as follows column e 
perquisites and other personal benefits,securities or property,unless the aggregate amount of such compensation is less than the lesser of either or of the total of annual salary and bonus reported for the named executive officer in columns c and d 
or preferential earnings on restricted stock,options,sars stock appreciation rights or deferred compensation paid during the fiscal year or payable during that period but deferred at the election of the named executive officer 
earnings on incentive plan compensation paid during the fiscal year or payable during that period but deferred at the election of the named executive officer 
amounts reimbursed during the fiscal year for the payment of taxes and 
the dollar value of the difference between the price paid by a named executive officer for any security of the registrant or its subsidiaries purchased from the registrant or its subsidiaries through deferral of salary or bonus,or otherwise,and the fair market value of such security at the date of purchase,unless that discount is available generally,either to all security holders or to all salaried employees of the registrant.
id.b.in addition to annual compensation,the table must disclose in columns f,g,and h any compensation,such as awards of restricted stock and payouts under a incentive plan,see id.b iv,and in column i all other compensation,such as payments,annual contributions to defined contribution plans,and insurance premiums paid by the company,see id.b v.
the government sole challenge to the reports of defendants compensation is that the reports failed to disclose the defendants personal use of corporate aircraft.but the government did not show at trial that disclosure was required.use of corporate aircraft is a perquisite governed by regulation item b iii c.see john white,div.of,sec.exch.comm n,remarks before the practising law institute executive compensation program principles matter,in practising law institute corporate law and practice course handbook series,pli order at,also available at http www.sec.gov news speech spch jww.htm last visited,director white remarks david yermack,flights of fancy,sternbusiness,available at winter last visited,yermack,flights of fancy see also,proposed regulation perquisites include personal travel using vehicles owned or leased by the company.disclosure of perquisites is required only if their aggregate value for the year exceeds a threshold equal to the lesser of and of the executive annual salary and bonuses.see b iii c.for most years at issue,was the threshold for each defendant because their salaries plus bonuses exceeded in those years,although wittig threshold was apparently in,and lake was apparently in and in.there was no evidence that the value of personal travel ever exceeded the reporting threshold.the government has not pointed to any perquisite other than personal travel as contributing toward the reporting threshold.
to be sure,the government contended that the value of personal flights far exceeded a year for each defendant.it computed the value of a flight by determining what a charter flight for the same trip would cost including the costs of chartering a plane to fly from the corporate plane base to the departure point for the trip and from the trip destination point back to the base.this is not an unreasonable method of measuring the value of the trips to wittig and lake.but it is not the method required by the sec.regulation states perquisites and other personal benefits shall be valued on the basis of the aggregate incremental cost to the registrant and its subsidiaries.id,instructions to item b iii c.the natural interpretation of this language is that the value of a trip is to be computed solely on the basis of the actual additional cost incurred by the corporation in providing the transportation.thus,for example,if the corporate airplane is flying to new york on business and a member of the wittig family goes along for pleasure,the value is only the extra cost of adding a passenger.the extra cost may be as little as the cost of additional fuel to fly with the weight of one more passenger plus luggage.even when the trip is solely for pleasure,the cost to the corporation may be modest.if the pilot is on a salary and is not working overtime,the extra cost might be limited to fuel and maintenance.although no regulation explains how to determine aggregate incremental cost,the interpretation above is the interpretation adopted by every treatment of the subject we have found,including a statement by an sec official.see james cooling joanne barbera,personal use of the company aircraft irs faa sec,cooling herbers,at available at.coolinglaw.com arts.htm last visited,director white remarks at richard handley stewart lapayowker,compliance feature corporate aircraft four common compliance issues,acca docket,at.suffice it to say that the government did not introduce or even offer any evidence concerning the cost to westar of the alleged personal trips benefitting the defendants.
the government suggests that even if the reports to the sec were not false because they contained all required information,they were fraudulent.it contends that the reports were misleading because,regardless of sec requirements,investors and the public would have expected disclosures of personal travel in those reports.it asserts westar had a practice of disclosing all compensation both cash and of the top six executives of the company,including defendants.westar practice was to include amounts of less than.aplee.br.at footnotes omitted.to support this assertion,the government at trial pointed to westar disclosure of various items of compensation on the summary compensation table in its proxy statement for.the table disclosed dividend equivalents of less than paid on behalf of wittig under the company defined contribution plan premiums of paid for term life insurance paid to wittig under the company relocation plan a payment of to wittig in lieu of a increase and payments of to various individuals.
the government argument is essentially that because the company voluntarily disclosed so many other items of compensation,the report lulled people into believing that it would also have reported personal use of corporate aircraft if there had been any.but this argument has merit only if the items pointed to on the statement were not required to be reported.the defendants responded,through testimony of rick terrill,former westar general counsel,that many items must be disclosed regardless of amount.the government failed to show that any reported item was not required to be disclosed.and it appears that an effort to do so would have been vain.regulation requires a company to report,regardless of amount,all payments of preferential dividend equivalents,see b iii c instruction all payments under a plan hence the reporting of the payments,see id.b v d and all payments for term life insurance hence the reporting of the premiums,see id.b v e.it must also disclose all plan and compensation,id.a.regulation defines plan to include 
a ny plan,contract,authorization or arrangement,whether or not set forth in any formal documents,pursuant to which the following may be received cash,stock,restricted stock or restricted stock units,phantom stock,stock options,sars,stock options in tandem with sars,warrants,convertible securities,performance units and performance shares,and similar instruments.a plan may be applicable to one person.registrants may omit information regarding group life,health,hospitalization,medical reimbursement or relocation plans that do not discriminate in scope,terms,or operation,in favor of executive officers or directors of the registrant and that are available generally to all salaried employees.
id.a ii emphasis added.the relocation plan discriminated in favor of executives,so the payment to wittig had to be disclosed.and the payments in lieu of a salary increase and the car allowance were both contractual payments of cash and therefore had to be disclosed.the government can not contend that westar reported compensation beyond what was required by law without establishing what the law required.
in short,the government failed to present evidence from which the jury could infer beyond a reasonable doubt that any of the reports wired to the sec was false,fraudulent,or even misleading.under parr,d,as we understand it,the charges were not proved.and even if we were to adopt a view of parr,we fail to see how one could infer from the evidence at trial that a purpose of submitting the reports was in any fashion to further the alleged fraudulent scheme.the reports which,for all we can tell,were correct were filed because they had to be.
because there was insufficient evidence to sustain the charges,we must reverse the convictions.under the double jeopardy clause,the government is not entitled to another chance to prove its case,so we do not remand for a new trial on these charges.see burks united states,d anderson mullin,cir.
money laundering 
the statute,forbids a person from knowingly engag ing or attempt ing to engage in a monetary transaction in criminally derived property of a value greater than and is derived from specified unlawful activity.id.a.the government must prove five elements that the defendant engaged or attempted to engage,in a monetary transaction,in criminally derived property,knowing that the property is derived from unlawful activity,and the property is,in fact,derived from specified unlawful activity.united states dazey,cir.criminally derived property is any property constituting,or derived from,proceeds obtained from a criminal offense.f.specified unlawful activity is any of a number of offenses listed in c,see id.f it includes wire fraud,see id.c a,b.
the indictment in this case stated that the specified unlawful activity was wire fraud.accordingly,the laundering counts required proof of wire fraud.but,as we explained in the preceding section,wire fraud was not proved.the government conceded at oral argument that reversal of the counts would require reversal of the convictions.we reverse those convictions.as was true of the charges,these charges can not be retried.
circumvention of internal controls 
we also must set aside the circumvention convictions,although the government is not foreclosed from retrying them.in pertinent part the circumvention statute,b,states no person shall knowingly circumvent or knowingly fail to implement a system of internal accounting controls or knowingly falsify any book,record,or account described in paragraph.paragraph states 
every issuer which has a class of securities registered pursuant to section of this title and every issuer which is required to file reports pursuant to section d of this title shall 
a make and keep books,records,and accounts,which,in reasonable detail,accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the issuer 
b devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that 
i transactions are executed in accordance with management general or specific authorization 
ii transactions are recorded as necessary i to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles or any other criteria applicable to such statements,and ii to maintain accountability for assets 
iii access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management general or specific authorization and 
iv the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences 
all but one of the circumvention counts charged the defendants with circumvention by failing to report personal use of corporate aircraft on annual d o questionnaires for westar,westar industries,and protection one a firm acquired by westar.there is no question that wittig and lake failed to report such personal use on the questionnaires.the issue for trial was whether their failure was with the requisite intent.
lake testified that he did not record personal use of company planes on the d o forms because i did think my personal use was material t he vast majority of my flights involved me traveling all over the place on business.and flights that i thought were purely personal were a small fraction of that.vol.xxxix at.wittig did not testify.in support of their position that their failure to disclose was neither knowing nor willful,they presented evidence that on only two occasions between and did any officer or director report personal travel on a d o form,and,in particular,the corporation general counsel neither reported his own personal flights nor took action when others failed to report.the essence of the government contrary argument was that the value of the personal flights was so great that their disclosure was obviously material,the defendants wished to conceal their personal flights from shareholders and the public,and any ignorance of disclosure requirements was an intentional ignorance.the government obtained from the court an instruction informing the jury that knowledge can be inferred if the defendant deliberately blinded himself to the existence of a fact.id.vol.iii at instruction.
to assess the defendants intent in not reporting this travel,the jury needed to know the purpose of the d o forms.the cover of each form was in the following format 
annual questionnaire 
corporation 
information furnished by each director,
nominee for director,and officer 
for use in year proxy statement 
and in various reports to the securities 
and exchange commission and state 
regulatory commissions 
id.vol.liv at,emphasis added.the parties did not address what,if any,information on these forms was required by state agencies so the only relevant purpose of the forms was to prepare sec filings.
as we previously discussed in setting aside the convictions,regulation required disclosure of an executive personal use of corporate aircraft only if the additional cost incurred by the corporation exceeded a threshold equal to the lesser of or of the executive salary plus bonuses during the year,and the government offered no substantial proof that this threshold was ever exceeded by either defendant.thus,there was no evidence that the defendants failure to disclose information in the d o forms ever caused a material omission in sec reports.to be sure,this fact is not dispositive of defendants intent.they may have thought that there was a risk that their travel would be publicly reported,and fear of such reporting may have caused them to refuse to report their personal travel on the d o forms.nevertheless,in assessing the state of mind of each defendant,the jury would likely be influenced by knowing that the omission on the d o forms apparently did not cause any errors in the reports to the sec.
the jury,however,was not fairly informed of what the sec required.the defendants had to rely on a witness,rick terrill,westar general counsel during the alleged conspiracy.he testified that the sec measured the value of personal aircraft use on an basis and that reporting was required only if the value exceeded.counsel for each defendant referred to this testimony in final argument.but terrill bona fides was easily challenged by the government the prosecutor in closing argument asserted that terrill had actively worked to prevent various disclosures,running interference for wittig.id.vol.xlviii at.
and the government,which had devoted substantial time in its case to establishing the charter value of the alleged personal flights,argued to the court and the jury that it was this charter value that mattered.for example,in closing argument the prosecutor added figures for lake admittedly personal flights and concluded,for a total of in chartered valued flights.material.id.vol.xlviii at.particularly ironic is the government obtaining from the district court an instruction that informed the jury that a defendant could be charged with knowledge of something that he deliberately blinded himself to.one purpose of the instruction was to allow the jury to find that the defendants knew what was required to be reported on their d o forms.yet,at least as far as the trial evidence showed,there was no necessity to report their travel on corporate aircraft because it would not need to be reported to the sec in any event.what the defendants allegedly blinded themselves to may well have been that there was no good reason to report their personal travel.
to respond to the government argument
