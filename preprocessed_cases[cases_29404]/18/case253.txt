section b of the securities exchange act of,b,imposes strict liability on insiders,such as directors and holders of more than of a company securities,who realize profits.the supreme court has construed b to reach directors by deputization,shareholders who exercise the power to appoint directors to the board of an issuer.see blau lehman,d.in,the securities exchange commission promulgated rule d which exempts from the coverage of section b transactions between an issuer and a director that are approved by the board of directors of the issuer or meet certain other conditions the sec has construed rule d to cover directors by deputization.this appeal considers whether that construction is permissible we conclude that it is.
background 
beginning in,perseus,perseus through various affiliates,invested in beacon power corporation beacon.by virtue of these investments,perseus appointed two directors to beacon board of directors who ostensibly represented the interests of perseus and its affiliates.in,two of those affiliates,perseus expansion,and perseus capital,acquired beacon warrants and shares directly from beacon.later in,perseus capital,distributed million beacon shares to its members including perseus investors group,and those members,in turn,sold the shares.andrew roth,a beacon shareholder,brought a derivative action against perseus,perseus,certain of its affiliated funds beacon,and others under section b to recover the profits the defendants made on the sale of the beacon shares.
the united states district court for the southern district of new york patterson,dismissed plaintiff claims.see roth ex rel.beacon power perseus,civ.rpp,wl,dist.lexis july.the district court held that defendants,as directors by deputization of beacon who also held more than of beacon securities,were not liable under section b by virtue of rule d.d roth,wl at,dist.lexis at.
the district court noted that it is the transaction originating with the issuer and the fiduciary duties placed on corporate directors that provide the necessary safeguards against abuse of insider information and t hat by deputization or also be ten percent holders of the issuer securities without diminish ing those duties.id.at,at.accordingly,it concluded that extending the rule exemption to cover directors who are ten percent holders would not hinder the policies underlying section b.id.at,at.finally,the district court upheld rule d as a valid exercise of the sec rulemaking authority on the ground that section b expressly confers on the sec the authority to enact rules or regulations exempting transactions from the reach of the statute as not comprehended within the purpose of the statute and the sec interpretations of rule are not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulations.id.at,at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.this appeal followed.we review the district court decision de novo.see prot.advocacy for persons with disabilities mental health addiction,cir questions of statutory interpretation and the appropriate level of deference to accord agency regulations are purely of law,subject to de novo review.internal citations and quotations omitted.
discussion 
section b provides that officers,directors,and holders of more than of the listed stock of any company are liable to the company for any profits realized from any purchase and sale or sale and purchase of such stock occurring within a period of six months kern county land occidental petroleum,d.rule d provides selective relief from section b otherwise blanket ban on profits by exempting transactions between the issuer and an officer or director so long as the transaction is approved by the board of directors of the issuer,or a committee of the board of directors that is composed solely of two or more directors.
roth complaint alleged that the defendants collectively held more than of beacon stock and constituted a group for purposes of section b since no one contests the fact that the defendants constitute a group,we will assume they are subject to section b unless exempted by rule d.roth contends that the rule does not apply because it does not cover directors by deputization or officers and directors who hold more than of an issuer securities.roth also claims that rule d is invalid because when the sec promulgated the rule it exceeded its statutory authority.
the supreme court adopted the deputization theory under section b in blau,d,indicating that an entity would count as a director under section b if it deputized a person on the board of directors to act on its behalf.see id.at.the sec has recognized that under the deputization theory a corporation,partnership,trust or other person can be deemed a director for purposes of section where it has expressly or impliedly deputized an individual to serve as its representative on a company board of directors.ownership reports and trading by officers,directors and principal stockholders,exchange act release,
in adopting the version of rule d the sec discussed its rationale,stating that 
where the issuer,rather than the trading markets,is on the other side of an officer or director transaction in the issuer equity securities,any profit obtained is not at the expense of uninformed shareholders and other market participants of the type contemplated by the statute.based on its experience with the section rules,the commission is persuaded that transactions between the issuer and its officers and directors that are pursuant to plans meeting the administrative requirements and nondiscrimination standards of the internal revenue code and the employee retirement income security act of erisa or that satisfy other objective conditions,are not vehicles for the speculative abuse that section b was designed to prevent.

the sec,in its amicus brief,argues that the rationale underlying its adoption of rule d applies to directors by deputization just as strongly as it does to directors.we agree because the sec rationale for rule d exemption primarily rests on the safety provided by the issuer knowledge of its own factor whose weight is unaffected by whether the person or entity on the other side of the transaction is a director by deputization rather than an officer or director consequently,because we identify no plain error or inconsistency in the sec challenged interpretation of its own rule,we reject roth argument that rule d does not apply to directors by deputization.see auer robbins,d chevron,natural res.def.council,d press quick reilly,cir.
section b liability extends to holders of more than of a company listed stock.rule d exempts certain transactions by officers and directors from section b liability.however,the rule does not expressly exempt entities whose liability under section b results from their ownership of more than of a company listed securities.consequently,the question presented to us is whether holders of more than of a company listed stock who are also directors including directors by deputization qualify for rule d exemption.
the answer to this question requires interpreting rule d.in so doing,we defer to the sec interpretation of the rule,including one articulated in its amicus brief,so long as the interpretation is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the law.see auer,at.agency interpretation of its own regulation controlling even if presented in amicus brief chevron,d press,at we are bound by the sec interpretations of its regulations in its amicus brief,unless they are plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation s internal quotation marks omitted.
in its amicus brief,the sec maintains that the rule d exemption is available to a director or director by deputization that also holds more than of the issuer publicly traded shares.in support of its position,the sec asserts that 
the commission reasoning as to why rule d should apply to ten percent holders who are also officers or directors is apparent from the adopting release as officers or directors,they are subject to the same fiduciary constraints placed on all officers and directors,
