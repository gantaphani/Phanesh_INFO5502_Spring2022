we must determine whether the appellants,three related corporate entities and six officers directors of these entities,are entitled to insurance coverage for an underlying litigation brought by the bankruptcy trustee of a former subsidiary of the corporate entities.the district court granted summary judgment to the insurance company based on findings that the trustee complaint alleged only willful acts and sought only restitutionary relief uninsurable under california law.we hold that genuine issues of material fact remain as to the resolution of these issues,and we remand to the district court for further factual development.
before may,hawaiian grocery stores,hgs was a subsidiary of appellant grocers specialty corporation,which was itself a subsidiary of appellant certified grocers of california,now known as appellant unified western grocers,unified acquired hgs on january,for about million and reportedly invested a total of million into the subsidiary from to.after hgs began to lose money in and,unified decided to sell hgs.in may,unified appointed six corporate officers of unified to act as officers directors of hgs the individual appellants.these officers directors approved a leveraged transaction on may,to sell all of the common shares of hgs from unified to an entity named rhl,for around million 
to fund this transaction,unified obtained a line of credit from congress financial corporation for million,which was secured by the assets of hgs.at the same time,the individual appellants,acting as the hgs board of directors,also authorized a secured promissory note for million from hgs to unified,which converted unified equity investment in hgs into a secured debt,and issued preferred stock of hgs to unified.the individual appellants,except for appellant daniel bane,then resigned their positions as officers and or directors of hgs on may,after the consummation of the sale of stock from unified to rhl.
hgs filed for bankruptcy on december,in the district of hawaii.mark yee yee or trustee was appointed trustee for the bankruptcy estate.yee then filed two actions in the district court yee unified western grocers,et,civil,the entity litigation,which involved only the corporate appellants and hgs accounting firm,kpmg,and yee unified western grocers,et,civil,the underlying litigation,which named the corporate appellants,individual appellants,and other law firms and individuals 
according to the third amended complaint tac or underlying complaint in the underlying litigation,which is the operative pleading for the summary judgment motions at issue,unified retained a control position in hgs,through its conspiratorial relationship with rhl,inc,and used this position to obtain not only the million for its stock,but large payments on its antecedent investment,that it would likely not have been repaid if the hgs had been liquidated or sold at a nominal price in.tac.the complaint alleges that unified continued to drain assets out of hgs while misleading creditors as to the of hgs and concealing damaging information.yee alleges that around million was transferred from hgs to unified between may and december.see entity,am.compl.
the individual appellants were insured by appellee twin city under a directors and officers liability policy d o policy issued to unified.the d o policy did not provide corporate entity coverage for these types of claims,but required twin city to reimburse unified for any losses for which unified had indemnified its insured directors and officers and for which the directors and officers became legally obligated to pay as a result of any covered claim made during the policy period.the underlying complaint alleged three claims against the insured individual appellants for which unified sought coverage under this policy breach of fiduciary duty count,aiding and abetting count,and civil conspiracy count 
on june,appellants filed a complaint for declaratory relief seeking a judgment that twin city was obligated to pay defense costs and reimburse appellants for losses resulting from the underlying complaint.for summary judgment for the first phase were filed on august,after a hearing on december,the district court issued an order on april,granting twin city motion for summary judgment and denying appellants motion for summary judgment.see unified grocers,twin city fire ins,d.the district court held that coverage was properly denied based on section of the california insurance code,which precludes indemnification or reimbursement for claims resulting from willful acts.id.at.the district court also held that a public policy exclusion under california law precluded indemnification because the claims only sought restitutionary relief or disgorgement of gains.see id.at.finally,the district court held that a contractual exclusion in the policy barred reimbursement for claims asserted against appellant bane because he was sued by a trustee of the outside entity where he was acting as an employee id.at.
in determining what state law to apply,a federal court applies the rules of the state in which it sits.kohlrautz oilmen participation,cir.hawaii,which is the location of the district court in this appeal,has moved away from the traditional and rigid rules in favor of the modern trend towards a more flexible approach looking to the state with the most significant relationship to the parties and subject matter.lewis lewis,haw,citing peters peters,haw.primary emphasis is placed on deciding which state would have the strongest interest in seeing its laws applied to the particular case.id.
the district court held that california had the most significant relationship to the parties and the subject matter.while the underlying litigation involved a hawaiian bankruptcy trustee and a hawaiian corporation,the appellants for this appeal are predominantly from california and appellee twin city is a large insurance company based in indiana.the subject matter of this action involves a insurance policy negotiated and formed in california.the district court did not err in holding that california has the strongest interest in seeing its laws applied to this case and that the parties were most closely connected with california.
the district court held that section of the california insurance code would preclude coverage for the claims asserted against the directors and officers in the underlying complaint.section states an insurer is not liable for a loss caused by the wilful act of the insured but he is not exonerated by the negligence of the insured,or of the insured agents or others.
the california supreme court has made clear section reflects a fundamental public policy of denying coverage for willful wrongs.penney cas.ins,cal d,citations omitted,cert.denied,d.it is an implied exclusionary clause which,by statute,must be read into all insurance policies.downey venture lmi ins,th,d.because section is considered under california to be an exclusionary clause,the insurer has the burden of proving that the requested claims are matters uninsurable under the law.raychem fed.ins.
section does not bar coverage for conduct which may be wrongful,but which is not intentional or willful from the standpoint of the insured.melugin zurich,th,d.preclusion under this statute requires more than negligence,recklessness or even the intentional doing of an act constituting ordinary negligence or the violation of a statute.downey,d at.the statutory exclusion is intended to preclude indemnification for conduct that is clearly wrongful and necessarily harmful.mez,pac.ins,th,d,footnote omitted.
although previous case law had required a specific intent to inflict harm,see clemmer hartford ins,cal d,the california supreme court held in that section can preclude indemnification without a showing by the insurer of its insured preconceived design to inflict harm when the insured seeks coverage for an intentional and wrongful act if the harm is inherent in the act itself.penney,at.a willful act has been further defined by california intermediate appellate courts as an act deliberately done for the express purpose of causing damage or intentionally performed with knowledge that damage is highly probable or substantially certain to result.shell oil winterthur swiss ins,th,d.therefore,section precludes indemnification for liability arising from deliberate conduct that the insured expected or intended to cause damage.id.at.
in determining whether an unproven claim is covered by an applicable insurance policy,we are reluctant to frame coverage based on isolated allegations in an underlying complaint.as we stated previously,the third party complainant,who may overstate the claims against the insured,should not be the arbiter of the policy coverage.gon first state ins,cir see also gray zurich ins,cal d,obviously,the complainant in the third party action drafts his complaint in the broadest terms he may very well stretch the action which lies in only nonintentional conduct to the dramatic complaint that alleges intentional misconduct.citation omitted the same underlying conduct that is eventually proven to be merely negligent may be asserted in the complaint as intentional and willful.even when faced with allegations that paint a broad picture of fraudulent schemes and conspiracies,the application of section,made on summary judgment without evidence of the insured actual conduct,should consider whether any asserted claim may allow for liability based on alleged conduct that has a lower degree of culpability.see,raychem.at because alleged violations of b and rule require only a showing of recklessness to fulfill the scienter requirement summary judgment for the insured is appropriate,unless the insurer can put forth facts which show that the acts of the officers and directors were willful.b e convalescent ctr.state comp.ins.fund,th,d,holding that the underlying wrongful termination claim was precluded by section because the claim created a potential for recovery only if there was proof of willful conduct.
it is clear that certain allegations in the underlying complaint describe willful conduct.twin city makes repeated reference to allegations in the underlying complaint concerning a scheme to withdraw the cash from hgs and give it to unified for essentially worthless stock.tac.yee alleges that the scheme by unified was intended to mislead others who would rely upon the credit worthiness of hgs and be left unpaid after rhl and unified drained the remaining assets out of the company for their own benefit.id.a claim for conspiracy asserted against the insured appellants alleges that the defendants entered into a continuing conspiracy aimed at obtaining money from hgs with the view that all or much of that money would be funneled to unified or certified.id.
although the conspiracy claim contains allegations of willful conduct,another claim asserted against the individual appellants does not necessarily require such a high degree of culpability.count of the underlying complaint asserts that the directors,officers,and other participants in the may transaction breached their fiduciary duties owed to hgs and its creditors.this claim alleges that the individual appellants had a conflict of interest from acting as officers directors of both unified and hgs at the same time during this transaction and that the transaction was against the best interest of hgs and its creditors.see id.yee alleges that the individual appellants knew or should have known,that taking these actions was improper and a breach of their respective duties as employees,officers,directors,fiduciaries.id.
although these allegations are similar to the conspiracy claims described above,the trustee did not hinge liability on a fraud or deceit on the corporation or its creditors,but on a conflict of interest by the individual appellants while they acted as officers directors of hgs.as alleged in the underlying complaint,a claim for breach of fiduciary duty could allow for liability if the appellants should have known that their actions were against the interests of hgs and its creditors,but did not take the necessary precautions to protect these interests.see lippi city bank,cir w here there is evidence that the parties knew or should have known that the transaction would deplete the assets of the company,the court will look beyond the leveraged formal structure in determining fraudulent transfer liability.see also william meade fletcher,fletcher cyclopedia of the law of private corporations if,for example,an officer neglects the substantial interests of his or her corporate principal by preferring another in a matter of importance,the officer may well offend his or her duty of loyalty though his or her heart is pure.as a fiduciary,the director duties to the corporation include undivided,unselfish and unqualified loyalty,unceasing effort never to profit personally at corporate expense,and unbending disavowal of any opportunity which would permit the director private interests to clash with those of his corporation.lussier,internal quotations and citation omitted.breach of this fiduciary duty,which may occur without any intent or expectation to cause harm,is not necessarily a willful act because it does not require a knowing,intentional and purposeful act that is clearly wrongful and necessarily harmful.see mez,d at footnote omitted.
twin city argues that any negligent or conduct that may allow for liability in the breach of fiduciary duty claim is inseparably intertwined with the willful conduct alleged as part of the appellants conspiracy.california case law does not allow the underlying complaint to expand the scope of coverage for the insured by including claims of negligence when the underlying factual allegations against the insureds are exclusively intentional or willful.see coit drapery cleaners,sequoia ins,th,d,rejecting any duty to defend or indemnify for noncriminal sexual harassment based on section,regardless of any potential negligence claim which could have been asserted on the underlying facts.the court in coit held we are required to interpret section so as to give effect and meaning to all its provisions just as we can not allow insurers to recharacterize negligent conduct as intentional,we can not allow the insured to recast intentional conduct as merely negligent.id.at.allegations of negligence do not give rise to an insurer duty to indemnify if the harm is alleged to result from negligent conduct which is so intertwined with intentional and willful wrongdoing as to be inseparable from the wrongdoing.marie star indem,th,d,internal citation,quotation and alteration omitted.
based on the current record,we conclude that the allegations of negligent conduct are not inseparably intertwined with the allegations of willful conduct.the damages alleged in the underlying complaint do not unavoidably originate from intentional and willful conduct by the insured.see uhrich state farm fire cas,th,d,the defamations shown by the evidence were embraced by lindseth campaign.uhrich can not manufacture coverage from conjecture about potential claims concerning unspecified,yet hypothetically different,defamations.citation omitted.also,the alleged conduct is not part and parcel with the willful conduct alleged as a scheme to defraud.see marie,d at.the insureds may be subject to liability solely for their negligence in holding conflicting positions and approving a transaction which allegedly caused the bankruptcy of hgs.
the presence of allegations in the underlying complaint that assert a broader scheme to defraud creditors does not automatically subsume all allegations of a negligent character into the sphere of willful conduct.it is commonplace under liberal pleading rules for complaints to assert alternative theories of liability.the underlying complaint did not simply recast claims involving willful conduct into smaller acts of negligence in order to allow for coverage.instead,it alleged a variety of claims against the insured appellants,some of which asserted negligence and others of which required willfulness.because the alleged breach of fiduciary duty in the complaint may be satisfied by proof of negligent conduct without any evidence of or logical correlation to a willful scheme to defraud,the district court erred in finding no genuine issue as to whether there was
