introduction 
parties jeffrey and david trahan and parties patrick and timothy trahan are the sole shareholders of trahan,a closely held corporation.appellants together own percent of the shares,as do respondents.appellants sought to dissolve the corporation and respondents thereafter exercised their statutory right under corporations code section to prevent dissolution by electing to purchase appellants shares at the statutorily mandated fair value.appellants appeal from a decree of the marin county superior court confirming the appraiser award and providing that trahan,will be dissolved unless the corporation respondents purchase appellants share in the corporation for a sum equal to or greater than that determined by the award of the appraiser,in this case negative.appellants argue that the superior court confirmation of the appraiser determination of the fair value of their trahan,shares was erroneous as a matter of law where the appraiser refused to include in her valuation of the corporation certain existing but uncompleted contracts,which according to the appraiser would bring the corporation estimated future gross profits of more than.
this appeal is from a special proceeding conducted pursuant to section and is expressly authorized by that statute,subd.c.we begin with the statute,which provides in pertinent part 
a i n any proceeding for voluntary dissolution initiated by the vote of shareholders representing only percent of the voting power,the corporation or,if it does not elect to purchase,the holders of percent or more of the voting power of the corporation the purchasing parties may avoid the dissolution of the corporation and the appointment of any receiver by purchasing for cash the shares owned by the shareholders so initiating the proceeding the moving parties at their fair value.the fair value shall be determined on the basis of the liquidation value as of the valuation date but taking into account the possibility,if any,of sale of the entire business as a going concern in a liquidation italics added.
b if the purchasing parties elect to purchase shares owned by the moving parties,and are unable to agree with the moving parties upon the fair value of such shares,and give bond with sufficient security to pay the estimated reasonable expenses including attorneys fees of the moving parties if such expenses are recoverable under subdivision c,the court upon application of the purchasing parties,either in the pending action or in a proceeding initiated by the purchasing parties in the case of a voluntary election to wind up and dissolve,shall stay the winding up and dissolution proceeding and shall proceed to ascertain and fix the fair value of the shares owned by the moving parties.
c the court shall appoint three disinterested appraisers to appraise the fair value of the shares owned by the moving parties,and shall make an order referring the matter to the appraisers so appointed for the purpose of ascertaining such value.the order shall prescribe the time and manner of producing evidence,if evidence is required.the award of the appraisers or of a majority of them,when confirmed by the court shall be final and conclusive upon all parties.the court shall enter a decree which shall provide in the alternative for winding up and dissolution of the corporation unless payment is made for the shares within the time specified by the decree.if the purchasing parties do not make payment for the shares within the time specified,judgment shall be entered against them and the surety or sureties on the bond for the amount of the expenses including attorneys fees of the moving parties.any shareholder aggrieved by the action of the court may appeal therefrom.
d if the purchasing parties desire to prevent the winding up and dissolution,they shall pay to the moving parties the value of their shares ascertained and decreed within the time specified pursuant to this section,or,in the case of an appeal,as fixed on appeal 
f for the purposes of this section,the valuation date shall be in the case of a proceeding for voluntary dissolution initiated by the vote of shareholders representing only percent of the voting power,the date upon which that proceeding was initiated.however,the court may,upon the hearing of a motion by any party,and for good cause shown,designate some other date as the valuation date.italics added.
facts and procedural background 
trahan,is engaged in the business of providing sheet metal and general contracting and maintenance services.
on may,appellants and moving parties executed an election to wind up and dissolve trahan.by written consent of shareholders holding shares representing of the voting power,as authorized by section,subdivision a.
as of that date,the corporation had a backlog of outstanding construction contracts.
in response to appellants election to dissolve the corporation,respondents exercised their statutory right to avoid dissolution by purchasing for cash the shares owned by appellants at their fair value.on june,after the parties had failed to agree upon the fair value of appellants shares,respondents petitioned the superior court to stay dissolution of the corporation and to fix the value of appellants shares as prescribed by section.on september,following a show cause hearing,the court issued its order staying the winding up and dissolution of the corporation and ordered the fair value,as of may,the valuation date,of the shares of the stock of the corporation owned by parties be determined as follows a the term fair value as provided in corporations code section,shall be determined on the basis of the liquidation value as of the valuation date but taking into account the possibility,if any,of sale of the entire business as a going concern in a liquidation.the court further ordered that the appraisal be made by a single appraiser,gallina.llp,certified public accountants,consistent with the parties agreement.the court also ordered the parties to provide the appraiser with,among other information,copies of all books and records of the corporation which reflect assets and liabilities of the corporation as of the valuation date,including but not limited to contracts standing in the name of the corporation and not paid in full as of the valuation date 
the appraiser,teresa,working for gallina.llp,filed her report on december.in summary fashion,the report stated the fair value of the corporation was determined on the basis of the liquidation value as of the valuation date,may,and that the appraiser has determined the fair value of the corporation,as of the valuation date,to have been.appellants shares correspondingly had a combined fair value of negative negative for jeffrey trahan ownership and negative for david trahan ownership.
shareholders thereafter submitted two cashier checks,one payable to appellant jeffrey trahan in the sum of and the other payable to appellant david trahan in the sum of,intending the checks to represent consideration for the transfer of percent of the voting shares in the corporation.
upon appellants refusal to transfer their shares,respondents sought an order to show cause re contempt,which the trial court denied,instead ordering respondents to file a motion to confirm the appraiser award.on february,respondents moved for an order confirming the appraiser award.appellants opposed confirmation,arguing the appraisal erroneously omit ted valuation of the corporation primary assets,the construction and maintenance contracts outstanding as of the valuation date.
on february,appellants submitted the declaration of appraiser,in which she stated in pertinent part the valuation of the shares filed with the court did not include the value of the construction contracts or the maintenance contracts of the corporation as of the valuation date,or the profits or losses to be derived therefrom as the court documents called for liquidation value.italics added.
on march,while the confirmation motion was pending,the court itself submitted interrogatories to the appraiser,seeking answers to two questions regarding the valuation of the corporation 
question in your opinion,what was the liquidation value,as of the may,valuation date,of the unperformed portion of trahan brothers,construction contracts,taking into account their terms and conditions,including their provisions for assignability or nonassignability and any other of their terms and conditions which you deem relevant 
question what are the estimated future not yet earned as of the valuation date may,determined as of the valuation date on construction contracts signed on or before the valuation date 
on april,the appraiser responded in a letter to the judge,stating that t he liquidation value as of the may,valuation date for the unperformed portion of trahan,construction contracts amounts to approximately,or the profit recognized to date.she stated that although the company had contract backlogs of approximately million with a total estimated gross profit of as of the valuation date,assignability or lack thereof is the key factor which drives the value down.the main reason for this devaluation is that the company would generally not have been able to sell these contracts as there is little or no market for partially completed contracts and on the public works and or bonded work,assignability is generally not allowed.please note that the anticipated gross profit upon completion of the public works or bonded projects would have amounted to approximately of the of total estimated gross profit.
in answer to the second question propounded by the court,the letter stated the estimated future profits not yet earned as of the valuation date on contracts in progress would have to be estimated at,based on the work in progress schedule provided by the parties as of may,however there are two important items one must consider the courts sic originally asked for and received the liquidation value as of may,which by its terms implies the contracts would not be completed and therefore the above estimate of would not come to fruition and if the contracts were performed through completion by the parties or someone else there would be incidental and overhead costs incurred which are not considered in the.one would be required to estimate the completion dates of the signed contracts as of may,as well as what the average monthly overhead costs in order to get the net profit which may positively or negatively affect the equity position of trahan,italics added.
on april,the court issued its decision confirming the award of the appraiser.according to the court the letter satisfied the court that the appraiser had taken into consideration the valuation of construction and maintenance contracts,finding their value to be zero for the reasons set forth in the letter.on may,the court filed its decree confirming the award of the appraiser,and ordering as provided in section,subdivision c,that the corporation be wound up and dissolved unless parties pay parties amounts equal to or greater than that determined by the award of the appraiser to be the value of appellants shares and ordering appellants upon such tender by respondents to immediately effect transfer of their shares in the corporation to respondents.this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
the issue on appeal is whether the court erred in confirming the award of the appraiser where the appraiser did not take into account the profits,if any,from contracts which had not been completed by the valuation date.
standard of review 
the trial court confirmation of the appraiser report is primarily a factual determination,which must be affirmed if supported by substantial evidence.mart severson th,d brown allied corrugated box d.see marsh,cal.law and prac.ed.supp.b.however,as we recognized in mart severson,supra,the superior court interpretation of the statutory standard set forth in section is subject to de novo review on appeal.citations.ibid.moreover,the substantial evidence rule is inapplicable if the record clearly establishes that improper inferences were drawn from the uncontroverted facts.brown allied corrugated box,supra.
appellants contend the decree must be reversed because the court confirmation of the appraiser determination of the fair value of their shares was erroneous as a matter of law.
clearing out the underbrush.
at the outset,we point out that appellants never requested that the trial court exercise its discretion to defer the valuation date to allow the backlog of construction and maintenance contracts to be completed.consequently,appellants can not and do not here contend the court abused its discretion in setting the valuation date at may,as provided by the statute.
nor did appellants argue in the court below that there was a possibility of sale of the entire business as a going concern in a liquidation.appellants do not contend on appeal that the appraiser erred in failing to value the corporation as a going concern in a liquidation.indeed,appellants specifically disavow any such claim on appeal.any error in this regard has been explicitly waived by appellants.
finally,appellants do not here challenge the appraiser conclusions as to the liquidation value of the corporation absent consideration of the outstanding contracts or as to the value of the contracts,should they be considered 
appellants contend the appraiser should have determined the fair value of appellants shares by calculating their investment value using the five methods set forth in internal revenue service,revenue ruling,wl,and propounded by ronald electronic packaging,d.ronald.ronald opined that the five valuation approaches in combination,will determine the value of a minority interest in a closely held corporation.id.at.but see marsh,cal.law,supra,c,criticizing ronald as confusing and condemning its use of the factors of ruling,normally used for federal estate tax purposes,to determine market value of the stock of a closely held corporation for purposes.appellants assert that utilization of the various methods set forth in the revenue ruling and ronald,supra,for determining the investment value of closely held shares includes evaluation of the earning capacity of the corporation and that p otential future income is a major factor in many valuations of stocks,d.such calculation would require evaluation of the outstanding contracts as part of the valuing of the potential future income of the corporation.
we reject this claim at the outset.the appraisers in ronald valued that closely held corporation as a going concern in liquidation.hence,the ronald court equation of fair value with investment value was premised upon the possibility of selling the entire business as a going concern in liquidation.ronald,supra,d at.that possibility was ruled out here.indeed,calculation of investment value is a pointless exercise where there is no possibility the enterprise could be sold as a going concern in liquidation.we therefore reject the claim that the appraiser failure to determine investment value of the stock by a combination of the five methods set forth in revenue ruling and ronald was erroneous as a matter of law and we need not address the merits of the critique of that case set forth in the marsh treatise.
appellants further argue the appraisal was flawed as a matter of law because the resulting valuation of their shares was considerably less than they would have received upon actual dissolution of the corporation.appellants urge that the dissolution process allows for winding up of the corporation,which would have included completion and performance of these outstanding contracts.
clearly dissolution includes the process of winding up and liquidation.neither a voluntary election to dissolve,nor court order for involuntary dissolution,automatically terminates the corporation existence or its business.rather,it remains in existence to liquidate and wind up really,wind down,to pay or make provision for payment of its debts to distribute its remaining assets to its shareholders and to file a certificate of dissolution with the secretary of state.friedman,cal.practice guide corporations the rutter group,friedman.section empowers the corporation directors or other persons appointed to wind up the corporation affairs to take all actions reasonably necessary for winding up its affairs,including,without limitation,specific powers to continue the conduct of the business insofar as necessary for the disposal or winding up thereof,subd.b and to carry out contracts,subd.c,italics added.see friedman,supra,marsh,supra.
respondents counter that liquidation is not necessarily the same as dissolution.although the winding up of a corporation may be part of the dissolution process,it is not a component of the calculation of fair value under section where the corporation is not valued as a going concern in liquidation.
section refers to liquidation value as of the valuation date.where there is no possible sale of the corporation as a going concern in liquidation,this language necessarily anticipates the piecemeal valuation of the corporation existing assets and liabilities as of the valuation date,without consideration of any period.this interpretation of the statute is consistent with case law,which describes liquidation through the sale of the entire business as a going concern in liquidation as the alternative to liquidation through a piecemeal sale of assets.
for example,in mart severson,supra,th,d,we held the lack of a agreement between shareholders did not support the refusal to value the corporation as a going concern.consequently,substantial evidence did not support the court finding the fair value on the valuation date was the corporation piecemeal liquidation value.in reaching that conclusion,we observed section establishes an objective process for valuing a corporation after dissolution proceedings have commenced.the fair value is the liquidation value.but the liquidation value can mean going concern value if the corporation could be sold as a going concern in liquidation.thus,the hypothetical question posed by section is whether the entire corporation could have been sold as a going concern in liquidation on the valuation date.id.at,d see also brown allied corrugated box,supra,d.liquidation through piecemeal sale of assets versus valuation of assets as a part of a going concern in liquidation ronald,supra,at.a liquidation does not necessarily contemplate piecemeal sale of assets where it may be possible to sell the entire business as a going concern brown allied corrugated box,supra,at.same friedman,supra,the possibility of selling the business as a going concern must be considered in determining its fair value.citations.if such a sale is unlikely,the various assets of the business have to be valued piecemeal for liquidation resulting in a distinctly lower value.citation.
we are unaware of any case in which liquidation value was found to mean something other than either valuation of the corporation as a going concern in liquidation or the piecemeal valuation of the company assets and liabilities as of the valuation date.respondents correctly characterize appellants challenge to the exclusion from the appraisal of future profits from the outstanding contracts as an attempt to single out one particular class of assets and treat them as if they,alone,constituted a going concern,without regard to their actual value on the valuation date and without regard to the liabilities associated with them or to the profitability of the business as a whole.
appellants contend that the failure to take into account the likelihood that the outstanding contracts would be completed in dissolution during a winding up period and the consequent failure to include the value of those contracts in the fair value determination undermines the main objective of the statute.that objective was described in brown allied corrugated box,supra,d.t he object of the appraisal proceedings below should essentially have been to award plaintiffs sellers what they would have received had their involuntary dissolution action been allowed to proceed to a successful conclusion.citation.id.at.
in brown allied corrugated box,supra,the court held,among other things,that under former sections and the predecessor statutes to,it was improper to discount the value of minority shares being purchased because of their lack of control.the court looked to the statutory scheme to determine whether minority shares should be discounted,finding the practice of devaluing minority shares in the area of taxation to have little validity in the context.id.at.according to the court,it is clear that upon distribution of the dissolution proceeds each of the shareholders would have been entitled to the exact same amount per share,with no consideration being given to whether the shares had been controlling or noncontrolling.under the valuation approach adopted by the majority commissioners and confirmed by the trial court,however,a controlling shareholder,especially an unscrupulous one,could avoid the proportionate distribution which would follow from an involuntary dissolution simply by invoking the provisions of former corporations code sections and.id.at,fns.omitted.thus,the very misconduct and unfairness which provoked the minority shareholders to seek involuntary dissolution could,in this manner,be used to further oppress them.this,the statutory scheme before us can not be read as condoning.rather,the statutes suggest that a minority shareholder who brings an action for the involuntary dissolution of a corporation should not,by virtue of the controlling invocation of the remedy,receive less than he would have received had the dissolution been allowed to proceed.the majority commissioners decision here to devalue plaintiffs shares for their lack of control was in direct conflict with this principle.id.at,fn.omitted,italics added.
other cases and commentators have reached similar conclusions as to the objectives of the provision of section and its predecessors.see,marsh,supra,c,the purchase procedure is an alternative to the liquidation requested by the minority,in which obviously all shareholders would participate pro rata in the proceeds of liquidation.ronald,supra,at.while moving parties should not be entitled to more than the liquidation value of the shares,what they would receive if their objective dissolution is obtained,neither should they receive a discounted share value because they do not hold a controlling interest.
the objective of section is to provide an alternative to dissolution through a by the holders of percent or more of the shares of the corporation.the objective of the statutory appraisal process is to find a fair value for the shares of the parties seeking dissolution and to award the percent shareholders seeking dissolution the liquidation value they would have received had their dissolution action been allowed to proceed to a successful conclusion.if the purchasing parties believe the price fixed by the court is too high,they can refuse to purchase the shares at that price and permit the winding up and dissolution of the corporation to proceed.their only liability would be to pay the expenses including attorney fees incurred by the moving parties in the appraisal process.see,subd.c friedman,supra.no comparable provision allows moving parties to refuse to accept a share price they believe to be too low.
we are thus confronted with a seeming contradiction between the objective of section and the language of the statute,which provides that the fair value shall be determined on the basis of the liquidation value as of the valuation date,subd.a,italics added.
we are not persuaded that the liquidation value can never take into account profits and losses associated with winding up the corporation.as we recently recognized,liquidation value encompasses not only the value which would be received from piecemeal sale of assets,b ut liquidation value can mean going concern value mart severson,supra,th,d.just as the term liquidation value is broad enough to include going concern value,the term is also broad enough to encompass the value realized during the winding up period,before liquidation or piecemeal sale of the assets where it is possible to estimate the profits losses ascribable to the winding up period of a dissolution and where the court sets a valuation date which encompasses such a winding up period.
this is consistent with the broad definition of t
