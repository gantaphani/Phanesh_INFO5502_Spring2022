appellants case management statement 
appellants filed a case management statement on may,advising the court and respondents that they expected to file,among other things,a petition to compel arbitration.
appellants petition to compel arbitration 
on june,appellants sought an extension from respondents of the time to answer respondents.an extension was apparently granted to july,at which time appellants filed their petition to compel arbitration as their first and only response to the.
in their petition,appellants asserted that all of the causes of action in respondents presented a controversy or claim subject to the arbitration provision in the operating agreement.in addition,appellants alleged,cortland bohacek and metis were bound by the arbitration provision as signatories to the operating agreement,puja bohacek could enforce the arbitration provision because she was alleged to have offered and sold membership interests pursuant to the operating agreement,and wellman and bennett could be compelled to arbitrate because they asserted claims as members of signatory metis.
respondents opposed the petition,filing a joint declaration by metis,wellman and bennett and a memorandum of points and authorities.respondents argued that the petition should be denied because the bohaceks waived their right to arbitrate code civ,subd.a,there were grounds for revocation of the operating agreement,and the parties to the arbitration agreement are also parties to a pending court action with a third party arising out of the same series of transactions and there is a possibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact code civ,subd.c 
trial court ruling 
by its tentative ruling of august,the trial court indicated its intention to deny the petition to compel arbitration.the tentative ruling advised in relevant part petitioners have engaged in litigation activity which would indicate a waiver of the right to compel arbitration.see,subd.a sobremonte superior court th,d.further,cross defendant karen polati is neither alleged to be a signatory to the operating agreement,nor has given assent to submitting the dispute to arbitration.accordingly,there is a possibility of conflicting rulings on common issues of law or fact,subd.c.
at the hearing on the petition,appellants counsel requested a statement of decision on the issues set forth in the tentative ruling.the court declined,reasoning that the proceeding was a law and motion matter.
after argument by appellants counsel and respondents counsel,the attorney for third party polati asserted that,if the claims against appellants were sent to arbitration,the possibility of inconsistent rulings would be eliminated if the litigation were stayed as to polati as well as the bohaceks.polati attorney also agreed with appellants counsel that the claims of cbt in the complaint were separate from those asserted in respondents and could proceed in court.
at the conclusion of the hearing,the trial court acknowledged the argument as to polati but stated that there are other parties as well,who i think present possibilities of conflicting rulings.the court then directed entry of the order in accord with the tentative ruling,modified to omit the reference to the claims against polati.
a written order filed august,denied the petition to compel arbitration because p etitioners have engaged in litigation activity which would indicate a waiver of the right to compel arbitration and t here is a possibility of conflicting rulings on common issues of law or fact.
this appeal followed 
ii.discussion 
as mentioned,appellants contend that the court erred in declining to issue a statement of decision,finding that their right to arbitrate had been waived,and denying their petition due to the possibility of inconsistent rulings.respondents debate these points and contend further that some of the claims in their are not arbitrable,wellman and bennett can not be compelled to arbitrate,and puja bohacek can not enforce the arbitration provision.
failure to issue statement of decision 
code of civil procedure section reads a statement of decision shall be made by the court,if requested pursuant to section,whenever an order or judgment,except a special order after final judgment,is made that is appealable under this title.noting that an order denying a petition to compel arbitration is an order appealable under this title see,subd.a,appellants argue that a statement of decision must be issued if requested pursuant to section under section,where the trial is concluded within one day,the request must be made before submission of the matter for decision and may be made orally on the record in the presence of the parties,specify ing those controverted issues as to which the party is requesting a statement of decision.because the hearing took less than a day,and counsel requested the statement of decision before submission of the matter,appellants urge that the court erred in refusing to issue a statement of decision.see whittington mckinney d.failure to issue statement of decision upon request under is reversible error shaw county of santa cruz th,d tentative decision or memorandum decision does not satisfy requirement of statement of decision.
we agree.section appears in article of chapter of title.title governs arbitration,and article of chapter specifically deals with petitions,including petitions to compel arbitration and petitions to confirm arbitration awards.see et because section mandates the issuance of a statement of decision in the part of the code of civil procedure that pertains to petitions to compel arbitration,and the denial of a petition to compel arbitration is an appealable order,the logical inference is that the legislature intended to require the trial court to issue a statement of decision,upon proper request under section,when denying a petition to compel arbitration.
it is true,as respondents point out and the trial court implied,that section has been interpreted to require statements of decision for trials,not motions.in re marriage of fong th,d references to trial in suggest that a statement of decision is required only in the event of a trial,as that term is commonly understood see lien lucky united properties investment,th,d general rule is that a statement of decision is not required for an order on a motion lien.indeed,section has been held inapplicable even where the motion involved an extensive evidentiary hearing people landlords professional services,d.preliminary injunction,or the order was appealable in re marriage of askmo th,d order to pay spousal support and attorney fees.
we are dealing here,however,with a petition to compel arbitration.such a petition is heard in the manner of a motion,with factual issues determined upon declarations or,if necessary,live testimony.rosenthal great western fin.securities cal th,d,rosenthal.but a petition to compel arbitration is in essence a suit in equity to compel specific performance of a contract.rosenthal,at,d.unlike most motions,it provides a final determination of certain factual issues such as whether the right to arbitrate was waived and results in an appealable order.moreover,in ruling on the petition when factual matters are in dispute,the court must weigh credibility and the strength of competing evidence.id.at,d.as such,a hearing on a petition to compel arbitration has attributes of a trial that suggest the need for a statement of decision to enable meaningful appellate review.see also lien,supra,th at,d noting an exception to the general rule that statements of decision are not required for motions,where the issues are of sufficient importance and appellate review can not be accomplished effectively without one.in addition,of all the cases cited by respondents that hold section inapplicable to motions,not one of them involved a petition to compel arbitration nor did they involve a specific statute such as section requiring that a statement of decision be issued whenever requested pursuant to section.
while section requires a statement of decision only upon the trial of a question of fact by the court and refers to the principal controverted issues at trial and any party appearing at the trial,construing section and the term trial to permit the issuance of a statement of decision only in the event of a traditional trial would render section meaningless.the hearing on a petition to compel arbitration is not a trial in the traditional sense nor is a traditional trial required for any of the appealable orders for which section requires a statement of decision.see.a strict construction of the term trial in section would thus always preclude the issuance of the statement of decision mandated by section.to harmonize section and section,we therefore must conclude that,at least where there is an adjudication of a question of fact by the court in deciding a petition to compel arbitration,a request for a statement of decision in the manner required by section obligates the court to issue one.see painters dist.council moen d.in the context of a petition to confirm an arbitration award,under the earlier language of requiring findings of fact and conclusions of law,must be read in light of,which requires findings only upon the trial of a question of fact,not where the issue is only one of law.
as applied here,there is no dispute that appellants complied with section by requesting a statement of decision pursuant to section,in the sense that the request was timely and in proper form.nor do respondents argue in their briefs that appellants counsel failed to sufficiently identify the controverted issues for the court.indeed,counsel reference to the court tentative ruling appears adequate under these circumstances,and any elaboration would have been futile given the court denial of the request on the general ground that it was a law and motion matter.with the requisites of section and met,the court was required to issue a statement of decision,specifying the factual and legal basis for its decision as to the principal controverted issues whether appellants waived their right to arbitrate and whether there was a possibility of conflicting rulings on a common question of law and fact,such that arbitration should be denied.
although the court refused to prepare a statement of decision,we must next consider whether the court written order might have nonetheless satisfied the requirements and purposes of a statement of decision.to comply with a request for a statement of decision,a court need only fairly disclose its determinations as to the ultimate facts and material issues in the case.central valley general hospital smith th,d.when this rule is applied,the term ultimate fact generally refers to a core fact,such as an essential element of a claim.citation.ultimate facts are distinguished from evidentiary facts and from legal conclusions.citations.ibid.
here,the court written order specified that litigation activity amounted to a waiver under section,subdivision a,and there was a possibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact for purposes of section,subdivision c.to deny arbitration due to waiver under section,subdivision a,however,there must be not only litigation activity,but also prejudice.agnes medical center pacificare of california cal th,d,agnes medical center.the court made no finding as to prejudice.to deny arbitration due to a possibility of conflicting rulings on common issues under section,subdivision c,there must be not only the possibility of conflicting rulings,but a determination that this possibility should lead to the denial of arbitration,rather than one of the other alternatives set forth in the statute.the court
