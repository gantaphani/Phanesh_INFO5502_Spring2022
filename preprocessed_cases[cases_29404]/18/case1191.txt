the main issue in this appeal is one of contract interpretation.we must decide whether a settlement agreement between kraft foods north america,kraft na and whetstone candy whetstone binds kraft na subsidiary,kraft foods uk,kraft uk.kraft uk was not a party to the agreement and the express terms of the agreement do not reflect an intention to bind kraft uk.we,therefore,uphold the express language that the parties agreed upon and conclude that the agreement does not bind kraft uk.we deny whetstone appeal and affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of kraft na on that and all other issues.
background 
whetstone,a florida corporation with its principal place of business in florida,manufactures,sells,and delivers confectionary products,including a chocolate orange.
defendant kraft na is a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in illinois kraft na manufactures,sells,and distributes food products,including confectionary products.kraft na wholly owns its subsidiary,kraft foods international,kraft international.kraft international,in turn,owns of kraft foods uk,kraft uk,originally also a defendant in this action.kraft uk is a business entity organized under the laws of the united kingdom and has its principal place of business there.kraft uk manufactures,sells,and distributes food products,including a product called terry chocolate orange.
this case involves the legal construction of a settlement agreement between kraft na and whetstone regarding the packaging of whetstone product.the events leading up to the current litigation began in.in june of that year,kraft na became aware that whetstone was preparing to market a product.kraft na asserted that whetstone packaging infringed upon kraft na trade dress rights in terry chocolate orange whetstone retained counsel who negotiated a settlement agreement with kraft na.in the settlement agreement,whetstone agreed to modify the packaging of its product in exchange,kraft na released whetstone from any claims it may have against whetstone regarding a possible trade dress violation 
subsequent to the signing of the settlement agreement in,whetstone attempted to market its product in the united kingdom through hall pride,hall pride,a distributor.upon learning of this plan,representatives from kraft uk threatened legal action against hall pride if hall pride did not cease marketing whetstone product in addition,whetstone alleges that,in the united states,kraft na representatives visited one of its customers,drugstores,and warned that they kraft na have a lawsuit against whetstone and that whetstone might not be around to deliver the product,however,apparently disregarded the warning and purchased whetstone product.
whetstone filed a complaint based on the above events.in count i,whetstone sought a declaratory judgment as to its rights under the settlement agreement and judgment for damages in its favor against kraft na and kraft uk.in count ii,whetstone alleged that kraft na and kraft uk knew about whetstone relationship with both hall pride and,and that representatives from the kraft corporations interfered with those business relationships by threatening unjustified legal action against hall pride and by telling that the product was not legitimate.whetstone sought damages for this alleged tortious interference.finally,in count iii,whetstone sought injunctive relief against kraft na and kraft uk to prohibit them from interfering with the sale and distribution of whetstone product.
after receiving the complaint,defendant kraft uk filed a motion to dismiss and,among other arguments,asserted that it was not subject to in personam jurisdiction in the district court.the district court granted kraft uk motion and dismissed it from this action for lack of personal jurisdiction.later in the proceedings,whetstone filed a motion for partial summary judgment with respect to count defendant kraft na,at the same time,sought the entry of summary judgment with respect to all counts.the district court concluded that there were no genuine issues of material fact and granted summary judgment in favor of kraft na on all issues.whetstone appeals

iii.does the settlement agreement bind kraft uk 
generally,a contract does not bind one who is not a party to the contract,or who has not in some manner agreed to accept its terms.consolidated resources healthcare fund i,fenelus,so d,hill southeast,pinellas county,so d.here,it is undisputed that only whetstone and kraft na signed the settlement agreement,but whetstone advances several arguments positing that kraft uk is bound by the settlement agreement.we consider these arguments in turn and reject each of them 
a.the plain language of the settlement agreement 
the whereas clause 
whetstone argues that the first whereas clause reference to kraft na subsidiaries operates to bind kraft uk to the settlement agreement.that clause states whereas,kraft or one of its subsidiaries have been involved in the production and marketing of a chocolate orange confectionery product which is sold in a particular container the kraft trade dress.emphasis added.whetstone argues that the purpose of the agreement was to redress the perceived invasion of rights possessed by kraft or one of its subsidiaries.they allege that the settlement agreement included the first whereas clause to make clear that kraft na entered into the agreement as the manufacturer of the product.thus,whetstone maintains that kraft na,as the parent corporation of kraft uk,entered into the agreement on behalf of itself as well as all of its subsidiaries who were manufacturing terry chocolate orange at the time it entered into the settlement agreement.although some scenarios would allow kraft na to bind its subsidiaries,including kraft uk such is not the case here.
first,the whereas clause is a true statement of the facts.kraft uk is a subsidiary of kraft na and does produce and market terry chocolate orange.consequently,the whereas clause accurately states kraft na production system,but does not suggest that kraft na entered into the settlement agreement as a manufacturer.rather,kraft na is an importer of terry chocolate orange and has a nonmanufacturing interest in protecting its own trade dress rights.see a moreover,whereas clauses are not binding when the contract is otherwise unambiguous.johnson johnson,so d.they are merely prefatory recitations of the facts that lead the parties to enter the agreement.id.
general principles of corporate law also dictate a conclusion that the whereas clause does not operate to bind kraft uk.corporations are separate legal entities and contracts made by a parent corporation do not bind a subsidiary merely because one corporation owns all of the stock of the other corporation.petersburg sheraton stuart,so d,see peacock general motors acceptance,so d.the agreement,according to its terms,was between kraft na and whetstone.absent facts that would allow us to disregard kraft uk status as a separate entity,kraft na,acting as an importer alone,has no ability to bind kraft uk,a separate entity,without kraft uk permission.see southeast capital inv.albemarle hotel,so d,citing dania palace,sykes,so d peacock,so d at discussing the circumstances under which the corporate form can be disregarded for torts committed by a related entity.
under,by or through kraft na 
whetstone also argues that the plain language of paragraph of the agreement,the waiver clause,binds kraft uk.that paragraph,in relevant part,states that all claims against whetstone dealing with the trade dress of its product are waived by kraft na and anyone claiming under,by or through it.whetstone alleges that kraft uk claim is under,by or through kraft na and kraft uk is therefore bound by the agreement.this argument has little merit for several reasons.
first,the settlement agreement explicitly uses the term subsidiary elsewhere in the agreement and,consequently,we should be reluctant to read this term into the waiver clause.using the words under,by or through would be a cryptic method to bind the subsidiaries of kraft na,especially when the parties referred to subsidiaries or affiliates in the reference in the first whereas clause to the fact that one of kraft na subsidiaries produces terry chocolate orange and the first portion of paragraph,which discharges the affiliates of whetstone from any infringement of the kraft na trade dress.the latter instance is particularly compelling because it appears in the same paragraph as the under,by or through it language that whetstone argues binds kraft uk.if the parties had intended to bind the affiliates or subsidiaries of kraft na,they would have included language similar to that used with respect to whetstone.
second,paragraph shows how the phrase under,by or through should be interpreted and lends further support to the conclusion that under,by or through does not include kraft uk.paragraph states that t he terms and provisions of this agreement shall inure to the benefit of and bind the successors and assigns and legal representatives of both kraft and whetstone.this paragraph identifies the entities,other than the parties,who are bound by the settlement agreement.as such,under,by or through operates as a release from claims made by the successors and assigns and legal representatives of kraft who would claim under,by or through kraft na.the question,therefore,becomes whether kraft uk is a successor,assign,or legal representative of kraft na.we hold that it is not.
a successor is one that follows,especially one who succeeds to a throne,title,or estate or is elected or appointed to an office,dignity,or other position vacated by another.webster third new int l dictionary accord black law dictionary ed.an assign,an assignee,is one appointed to act for another or one to whom a right or property is legally transferred.webster third new int l dictionary accord black law dictionary ed.thus,successors and assigns are those entities or individuals who have a claim under,by or through kraft na by virtue of some act or event,such as an appointment or merger.here,kraft uk is a subsidiary of kraft na and,as a subsidiary,it is merely related to kraft na through its corporate structure it does not succeed kraft na and it has not been appointed to act for kraft na.kraft uk,therefore,is not a successor or assign,and no credible argument can be made that it is kraft na legal representative.thus,any claims that kraft uk has against whetstone are not under,by or through kraft na 
whetstone arguments based on estoppel 
whetstone makes several arguments that kraft na and kraft uk are estopped from denying that kraft uk is bound by the settlement agreement.none of these arguments are compelling and we reject them.
estoppel by acceptance of the benefits of the contract 
whetstone argues that kraft uk accepted the benefits of the settlement agreement and is,therefore,bound by its terms.where a party accepts the benefits of a settlement agreement or a compromise of his case and knows,or in the exercise of due diligence should have known,the facts concerning that settlement,the party ratifies the settlement by accepting the benefits whether the settlement was in the first instance authorized by him,and he is thereafter estopped from attacking the settlement,sellan,d,holding that acceptance of a settlement check estops the party from challenging the settlement agreement even when the party did not sign the agreement.
is inapplicable to this case because kraft uk accepted nothing.kraft uk was not a party to the settlement agreement and kraft na entered into the agreement to enforce rights it independently held as an importer.
equitable estoppel 
whetstone further contends that kraft uk is equitably estopped from denying that it is bound by the settlement agreement.equitable estoppel consists of words or conduct which causes another person to believe a certain state of things exists,and to consequently change his or her position in an adverse way.southeast grove,mckiness,so d,see watson clinic,llp verzosa,so d,listing the elements of equitable estoppel 
as a matter of law,whetstone equitable estoppel argument fails because whetstone can not satisfy the first element.there is no evidence that either kraft na or kraft uk made any representation to whetstone that kraft uk would be bound by the agreement.equitable estoppel sometimes applies when there is,as here,merely silence or inaction,but the doctrine only applies in such circumstances when the other party is misled to his or her injury.southeast grove,so d at.here,however,there is no evidence that kraft na or kraft uk misled whetstone to whetstone injury consequently,equitable estoppel is inapplicable to this case.
whetstone arguments based on an agency relationship between kraft uk and kraft na 
whetstone also argues that because kraft na acted as the agent of kraft uk during the settlement negotiations,kraft uk is bound by the agreement.alternatively,whetstone contends that kraft na had apparent authority to bind kraft uk.we hold that kraft na was not the agent of kraft uk and that the doctrine of apparent authority is not applicable to this case.
actual authority 
whetstone actual authority argument fails because there was no agency relationship in this case for actual authority to exist such that the principal is bound,there must be an agency relationship,which requires the principal to acknowledge that the agent will act for it the agent to manifest an acceptance of the undertaking and control by the principal over the actions of the agent.meterlogic,copier solutions,d.
there is no agency relationship here because there was no acknowledgment by kraft na that it would act for kraft uk.whetstone provides no evidence that the kraft na negotiators were actually employees of kraft uk,nor does whetstone claim that kraft uk financed the business venture of kraft na,or offer any credible argument that kraft uk authorized kraft na to act on its behalf.see id.at evaluating these factors to determine whether there is acknowledgment.in addition,there is no question that the final element of an agency lacking here whetstone provides no evidence that kraft uk controlled kraft na during the settlement negotiations as such,we fail to find any evidence that there is an agency relationship between kraft na and kraft uk.
apparent authority 
there was no reasonable basis for whetstone to believe kraft na was the agent of kraft uk and,consequently,apparent authority is not present in this case.apparent authority exists when the principal creates the appearance of an agency relationship.ja dan.the appearance of an agency relationship can be created when the principal knowingly permits the agent to act as if the agent is authorized,or by silently acting in a manner which creates a reasonable appearance of an agent authority,but can not arise from the subjective understanding of the person dealing with the purported agent.id.
here,whetstone argues that kraft uk,by remaining silent and failing to object to the settlement agreement,acted in a manner that reasonably created the appearance of kraft na authority to act for kraft uk.because kraft uk had no input into the settlement agreement and because the agreement resolved only a dispute between kraft na and whetstone,there was no reason to expect kraft uk to object to the agreement.thus,it was merely the subjective understanding of whetstone that kraft na was the agent of kraft uk and,as stated above,such an understanding does not create apparent authority 
iv.whetstone tortious interference claims 
claims involving hall pride 
whetstone claims that kraft uk tortiously interfered with whetstone business relationship with hall pride,but asserts that kraft na is liable for this tortious interference because the kraft corporations hold themselves out to the pub
