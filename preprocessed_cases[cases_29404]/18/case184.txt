the securities and exchange commission sec filed this civil enforcement action against defendants nelson obus,peter black,and thomas bradley strickland alleging insider trading in violation of section b of the securities exchange act of,b,and rule,b.the sec alleges that strickland learned material information in the course of his employment and revealed it to black,his friend and a hedge fund employee,and that black in turn relayed the information to his boss,obus,who traded on the information.the district court for the southern district of new york george daniels,judge granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on both the classical and misappropriation theories of insider trading.we hold that the sec evidence created genuine issues of material fact as to each defendant liability under the misappropriation theory,and therefore that summary judgment for the defendants was erroneous.vacated and remanded.
background 
we recite only those facts pertinent to this appeal.as the party,the sec is entitled to have all factual inferences drawn in its favor.see eastman kodak image tech,d.the facts are undisputed unless noted otherwise.
a.the planned acquisition of sunsource and ge capital financing bid 
in may,strickland worked as an assistant vice president and underwriter at general electric capital corporation ge capital,a company that provides corporate financing.defendants statement of undisputed facts def.stmt,joint appendix ja.that spring,allied capital corporation allied had approached ge capital about financing allied planned acquisition of sunsource,sunsource,a publicly traded company that distributed industrial products.ja.strickland was assigned to perform due diligence on sunsource as part of the ge capital team working on the financing proposal.ja.his tasks included analyzing sunsource financial performance,but the parties dispute whether strickland was authorized to gather information about sunsource management.def.stmt.sec response to defendants joint statement of material facts pl.resp.
in the course of his work,strickland learned information about sunsource,including the basic fact that sunsource was about to be acquired by allied.strickland testified that he understood that allied acquisition of sunsource was confidential.ja.each page of the transaction deal book,which strickland received,was marked extremely confidential.ja.in addition,strickland had reviewed and annually signed ge capital employee code of conduct,which required employees to safeguard company property including confidential information about an upcoming deal.ja see ja.ge capital also maintained a list,containing the companies about which ge capital and its employees possessed material information,and which were therefore for securities trading.def.stmt.ja.sunsource and allied were not placed on the transaction restricted list until june,after strickland and the ge capital team had completed their due diligence work and submitted a financing proposal to allied.def.stmt.the parties dispute whether,under ge capital policies,sunsource should have appeared on the transaction restricted list at an earlier date,and whether it was among strickland responsibilities to add sunsource to the list.pl.resp.ja.
b.the alleged tip from strickland to black 
in the spring of,black,a friend of strickland from college,worked as an analyst at wynnefield capital,wynnefield,which managed a group of hedge funds.def.stmt,ja.in the course of his due diligence research,strickland learned from publicly available sources that wynnefield was a large holder of sunsource stock.ja.
on may,strickland and black had a conversation about sunsource.we note that strickland remembered the conversation taking place black recalled a telephone conversation.def.stmt.pl.resp.the sec and the defendants dispute what was said during this conversation.def.br.at.the defendants maintain that strickland asked black his opinion of sunsource management as part of strickland due diligence work.strickland testified that it was common to contact third parties while performing due diligence,and that his practice during such inquiries was to avoid revealing details by stating only that ge capital was potentially doing business with the relevant company.def.stmt,ja.the sec maintains that strickland revealed material information by telling black that allied was about to acquire sunsource.pl.resp.the sec relies on testimony that contacting large shareholders was not standard due diligence practice at ge capital and that strickland and black discussed sunsource after ge capital had completed its financing proposal.ja.the sec further argues that events following strickland and black may conversation,described below,raise a strong inference that strickland told black about the acquisition.
c.the alleged tip from black to obus 
obus was wynnefield principal and black boss.def.stmt.immediately after black conversation with strickland,black relayed the information he had learned to obus.ja.black maintains that strickland general questions about sunsource management led black to suspect based on sunsource prior public actions that sunsource was considering a transaction that would dilute existing shareholders.ja.black testified that he conveyed this suspicion to obus.ja.the sec contends that black told obus that sunsource was about to be acquired by allied.pl.resp.
obus call to andrien 
later that same day,obus called maurice andrien,sunsource ceo.def.stmt.ja.as a large sunsource shareholder,obus regularly spoke to andrien about the company.def.stmt.obus and andrien gave different accounts of this phone call.obus testified that the information from black led him to believe that sunsource was considering a transaction that would dilute the value of its public shares,and he called andrien to voice his concerns.ja.andrien testified that obus informed him that wynnefield had been tipped about sunsource imminent acquisition 
i t was a very funny conversation.and he obus said that he never had a conversation like this before,and did know whether he should be having it.
he said,i always knew you guys would sell sunsource technology services a subsidiary of sunsource if you could,but i never figured you sell the whole company.
and i said,nelson,that just not the kind of thing that i could ever discuss under any circumstances with you.whether we did,or we did,i just refuse to comment about that.
he said,well,a little birdie told me that you guys are planning to sell the company to a financial buyer.i said,a little birdie he said,a little birdie in connecticut.
i said,a little birdie in connecticut,and he said i might have even said,who would tell you something like that.and he said ge.
ja.the term financial buyer referred to a buyer planning to add sunsource to an investment portfolio,as opposed to a strategic buyer looking to acquire sunsource for its assets and business capabilities.ja.black overheard what obus said on the phone to andrien.consistent with obus testimony,black testified that obus said that a guy from a big conglomerate in fairfield might be working with sunsource and that obus hoped sunsource would not dilute shareholders.ja.
in any event,whether the obus call to andrien was as described by black and obus or as described by andrien,black was shocked to hear obus make the call,and tried to signal obus to stop talking.ja.after obus hung up,black said,what are you doing you realize,you know,my friend is going to be fired.ja.obus then became ashen and very upset because he realized it was a kind of call that could be traced back to strickland.ja.obus said if strickland were fired,obus would offer strickland a job at wynnefield or would help strickland find another job on wall street.ja.
weber call to andrien 
on the same day that obus spoke with andrien,andrien also took a call from alan weber,a business acquaintance of obus and another large investor in sunsource.ja.on the call,weber told andrien he hoped that sunsource would not be sold to a financial buyer the same term andrien recalled obus using in his phone call.ja ja.the two calls from weber and obus led andrien to be fairly certain that news of the planned acquisition had been leaked.ja.
f.the june,trade 
on june,two weeks after the conversation between strickland and black,a trader at cantor fitzgerald contacted wynnefield offering shares of sunsource at per share.ja.wynnefield counteroffered per share,and ultimately purchased at that price a total block of shares,about five percent of sunsource outstanding common stock.ja.obus testified that he was unaware of the pending acquisition when he made the trade and that his decision to buy had nothing to do with strickland conversation with black.ja.the june,purchase represented about the same number of shares as wynnefield had bought in october,the last time obus believed he had seen such a large block of shares available for purchase.ja.on june,wynnefield sold shares of sunsource.ja.
allied acquisition of sunsource 
on june,allied publicly announced that it was acquiring sunsource for per share in cash or stock.ja.sunsource stock closed that day at per share,an increase of or percent over the prior day closing price.ja.wynnefield june,purchase of sunsource stock nearly doubled in value from the purchase price to,producing a paper profit to wynnefield of over million.ja.on june and june,wynnefield purchased another shares of sunsource at prices over per share.ja.
obus call to russell 
in june or july,obus contacted andrien to ask when the merger with allied would close andrien referred obus to daniel russell,allied cfo.ja.obus and russell recollections of their phone call differ.obus testified that he called to express his preference to be paid in allied stock,rather than in cash,and to ask that allied extend the closing date of the merger to lower wynnefield tax liabilities.ja.russell testified that obus told him that obus was tipped off to the deal between allied and sunsource,and when russell asked what that meant,obus changed the subject.ja.
i.the sec subpoenas 
in july and august,the sec subpoenaed obus and black about the sunsource trades.ja.on august,strickland also received an sec subpoena and contacted black to arrange a meeting.ja.black told obus about strickland request to meet,realizing that strickland might want to discuss the subpoenas.ja.obus and black agreed that black should try to avoid discussing sunsource or the subpoenas and encourage strickland to be truthful.ja.
at their meeting,strickland told black that he had informed ge capital counsel that he did not recall any conversation about sunsource.ja.black reminded strickland that they had discussed sunsource in may,before the acquisition was announced.ja.when black told obus about the meeting,obus told black to tell strickland about obus conversation with andrien,and to encourage strickland to tell ge capital counsel about the may conversation between black and strickland.ja.
ge capital internal investigation 
after receiving the sec subpoena related to sunsource,ge capital conducted an internal investigation into strickland conduct.ja.the internal investigation did not go beyond interviewing strickland and other ge capital employees and thus did not include statements from andrien or russell.ja.the investigation concluded that while strickland had disclosed information outside of ge capital pertaining to sunsource,ja,he did not discuss the nature of the specific transaction being contemplated,ja.nevertheless,his conduct demonstrated a disregard of ge capital confidentiality restrictions.ja.following the investigation,strickland was denied a bonus and salary increase,but was not terminated.a letter of reprimand was placed in his file stating that he should have consulted a manager or counsel before discussing sunsource with a third party.ja.testifying later,a representative of ge capital said that the investigation concluded that strickland made a mistake but was trying to do some underwriting when he called black.ja.
ii.prior proceedings 
the sec filed a civil complaint against strickland,black and obus on april,that as later amended on june,alleged that the defendants were liable for insider trading in violation of section b and rule under both the classical and the misappropriation theories of insider trading.under the classical theory,the sec alleged that strickland,through his work for ge capital,became a temporary insider of sunsource and owed a duty to sunsource shareholders not to share material information about the company acquisition.under the misappropriation theory,the sec claimed that strickland had a duty to ge capital,his employer,to keep information about sunsource acquisition confidential,and that he breached that duty by tipping black.
the district court granted the defendants summary judgment motion on both theories,sec obus,civ gbd,wl,dist.lexis,but the sec appeals only with respect to the misappropriation theory.in the portion of its decision addressing that theory,the district court held that,even assuming strickland told black material information about the deal,the sec had failed to establish a genuine issue of fact as to whether strickland breached a fiduciary duty to his employer,ge capital.wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the district court based this finding on ge capital internal investigation,which concluded that strickland had not breached a duty to his employer,and on the fact that sunsource was not placed on ge capital transaction restricted list until after the sunsource acquisition was publicly announced.id.the district court further held that the sec failed to establish facts sufficient for a jury to find that strickland conduct was deceptive.wl,at,dist.lexis,at.because the district court found that strickland had not breached a duty,neither black nor obus could have inherited that duty,and thus they also could not be held liable under the misappropriation theory.finally,the district court held that the sec failed to present sufficient evidence that obus subjectively believed that the information he received was obtained in breach of a fiduciary duty.wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.huppe wpcs int l,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a a factual dispute is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.anderson liberty lobby,d.in reviewing a motion for summary judgment,t he evidence of the is to be believed,and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in its favor.id.at.
ii.legal background 
a.the misappropriation theory of insider trading 
insider trading unlawful trading in securities based on material information is well established as a violation of section b of the securities exchange act of and rule.see dirks sec,d chiarella united states,d sec texas gulf sulphur,cir en banc in re cady,roberts.under the classical theory of insider trading,a corporate insider is prohibited from trading shares of that corporation based on material information in violation of the duty of trust and confidence insiders owe to shareholders.chiarella,at.a second theory,grounded in misappropriation,targets persons who are not corporate insiders but to whom material information has been entrusted in confidence and who breach a fiduciary duty to the source of the information to gain personal profit in the securities market.united states,d united states chestman,cir en banc.such conduct violates section b because the misappropriator engages in deception as required for liability under that section and rule by pretending loyalty to the principal while secretly converting the principal information for personal gain,at internal quotation marks omitted.the requirement under section b that the deception be in connection with the purchase and sale of any security is met because the information is of a sort that can ordinarily be capitalize d upon to gain profits through the purchase or sale of securities.id.at united state falcone,cir.this appeal is concerned only with liability under the misappropriation theory.
one who has a fiduciary duty of trust and confidence to shareholders classical theory or to a source of confidential information misappropriation theory and is in receipt of material information has a duty to abstain from trading or to disclose the information publicly.the abstain or disclose rule was developed under the classical theory to prevent insiders from using their position of trust and confidence to gain a trading advantage over shareholders.see chiarella,at dirks,at.abstain or disclose has equal force in the misappropriation context,but the disclosure component operates somewhat differently.because the misappropriation theory is based on a fiduciary duty to the source of the information,only disclosure to the source prevents deception disclosure to other traders in the securities market can not cure the fiduciary breach of loyalty to his principal,at see moss morgan stanley,cir fiduciary duty of disclosure to employer does not imply duty to disclose to the public.under either theory,if disclosure is impracticable or prohibited by business considerations or by law,the duty is to abstain from trading.see united states teicher,cir.
tipping violations of insider trading laws 
the insider trading case law is not confined to insiders or misappropriators who trade for their own account.section b and rule also reach situations where the insider or misappropriator tips another who trades on the information.in dirks,d,the court addressed the liability of an analyst who received confidential information about possible fraud at an insurance company from one of the insurance company former officers.id.at.the analyst relayed the information to some of his clients,and some of them,in turn,sold their shares in the insurance company based on the analyst tip.id.the court held that a tipper like the analyst in dirks is liable if the tipper breached a fiduciary duty by tipping material information,had the requisite scienter to be discussed momentarily when he gave the tip,and personally benefited from the tip.id.at.personal benefit to the tipper is broadly defined it includes not only pecuniary gain,such as a cut of the take or a gratuity from the tippee,but also a reputational benefit or the benefit one would obtain from simply mak ing a gift of confidential information to a trading relative or friend.id.at.when an unlawful tip occurs,the tippee is also liable if he knows or should know that the information was received from one who breached a fiduciary duty such as an insider or a misappropriator and the tippee trades or tips for personal benefit with the requisite scienter.see id.at.the supreme court tipping liability doctrine was developed in a classical case,dirks,but the same analysis governs in a misappropriation case.see falcone,at.
liability for securities fraud requires proof of scienter,defined as a mental state embracing intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud.ernst ernst hochfelder,d.negligence is not a sufficiently culpable state of mind to support a section b civil violation.id.while the supreme court has yet to decide whether recklessness satisfies section b scienter requirement,see matrixx initiatives,siracusano,d,we have held that scienter may be established through a showing of reckless disregard for the truth,that is,conduct which is highly unreasonable and which represents an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care,sec mcnulty,cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted see sec,cir recognizing that eleven circuits hold that recklessness satisfies the scienter requirement of section b.we read the scienter requirement set forth in hochfelder and the recklessness variation in mcnulty to apply broadly to civil securities fraud liability,including insider trading under either the classical or misappropriation theory,and to liability.see,elkind liggett myers,cir.in every insider trading case,at the moment of tipping or trading,just as in securities fraud cases across the board,the unlawful actor must know or be reckless in not knowing that the conduct was deceptive.
with this background,we turn specifically to the scienter requirements for both tippers and tippees under the misappropriation theory.
tipper scienter 
to be held liable,a tipper must tip material information in breach of a fiduciary duty of confidentiality owed to shareholders classical theory or the source of the information misappropriation theory for personal benefit to the tipper.the requisite scienter corresponds to the first three of these elements.first,the tipper must tip deliberately or recklessly,not through negligence.second,the tipper must know that the information that is the subject of the tip is and is material for securities trading purposes,or act with reckless disregard of the nature of the information.third,the tipper must know or be reckless in not knowing that to disseminate the information would violate a fiduciary duty.while the tipper need not have specific knowledge of the legal nature of a breach of fiduciary duty,he must understand that tipping the information would be violating a confidence.
as the supreme court and commentators have recognized,the first and second aspects of scienter a deliberate tip with knowledge that the information is material and can often be deduced from the same facts that establish the tipper acted for personal benefit.see dirks,at holding that the inquiry into the tipper scienter requires courts to focus on objective criteria,whether the insider receives a direct or indirect personal benefit from the disclosure donald langevoort,insider trading regulation,enforcement,and prevention ed.the requirement that the tipper act with scienter is effectively subsumed in proof that the insider motive was personal benefit.the inference of scienter is strong because the tipper could not reasonably expect to benefit unless he deliberately tipped material information that the tippee could use to an advantage in trading.the third aspect of scienter,that the tipper acted with knowledge that he was violating a confidence,will often be established through circumstantial evidence.because the act of misappropriation itself is deceitful,at,evidence that the tipper knowingly misappropriated confidential information will support an inference that the misappropriator had a mental state embracing intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud,hochfelder,at.
because a defendant can not be held liable for negligently tipping information,see hochfelder,at,difficult questions may arise when a tip is not apparently deliberate or when the alleged tipper knowledge is uncertain.the line between unactionable negligence and actionable recklessness is not a bright one.but,we have held that a tipper can not avoid liability merely by demonstrating that he did not know to a certainty that the person to whom he gave the information would trade on it.one who deliberately tips information which he knows to be material and to an outsider who may reasonably be expected to use it to his advantage has the requisite scienter one who intentionally places such ammunition in the hands of individuals able to use it to their advantage on the market has the requisite state of mind elkind,at.moreover,conscious avoidance can be sufficient to establish tipper scienter.united states gansman,cir approving jury instructions that allowed the jury to consider whether the defendant tipper deliberately closed his eyes to what would otherwise have been obvious to him.by the same token,there is a valid defense to scienter if the tipper can show that he believed in good faith that the information disclosed to the tippee would not be used for trading purposes.see id.
assume two scenarios with similar facts.in the first,a commuter on a train calls an associate on his cellphone,and,speaking too loudly for the close quarters,discusses confidential information and is overheard by an eavesdropping passenger who then trades on the information.in the second,the commuter conversation is conducted knowingly within earshot of a passenger who is the commuter friend and whom he also knows to be a day trader,and the friend then trades on the information.in the first scenario,it is difficult to discern more than negligence and even more difficult to ascertain that the tipper could expect a personal benefit from the inadvertent disclosure.in the second,however,there would seem to be at least a factual question of whether the tipper knew his friend could make use of material information and was reckless in discussing it in front of him.similarly,there would be a question of whether the tipper benefited by making a gift of the information to his friend,or received no benefit because the information was revealed inadvertently through his poor cellphone manners.
tippee scienter 
like a tipper,a liable tippee must know that the tipped information is material and.and a tippee must have some level of knowledge that by trading on the information the tippee is a participant in the tipper breach of fiduciary duty.this last element of tippee scienter was addressed in dirks,which held that a tippee has a duty to abstain or disclose only when the insider has breached his fiduciary duty and the tippee knows or should know that there has been a breach.at emphasis added.in such a case,the tippee is said to inherit the tipper duty to abstain or disclose.the parties dispute whether the dirks rule is in conflict with hochfelder holding that negligence does not satisfy section b scienter requirement because the knows or should know rule,repeated in numerous second circuit cases sounds somewhat similar to a negligence standard.see restatement third of torts,cmt.g negligence requires foreseeability,which concerns what the actor should have known.we think the best way to reconcile dirks and hochfelder in a tipping situation is to recognize that the two cases were not discussing the same knowledge requirement when they announced apparently conflicting scienter standards.dirks knows or should know standard pertains to a tippee knowledge that the tipper breached a duty,either to his corporation shareholders under the classical theory or to his principal under the misappropriation theory,by relaying confidential information.this is a inquiry turning on the tippee own knowledge and sophistication,and on whether the tipper conduct raised red flags that confidential information was being transmitted improperly.hochfelder requirement of intentional or mcnulty requirement of reckless conduct pertains to the tippee eventual use of the tip through trading or further dissemination of the information.thus,tippee liability can be established if a tippee knew or had reason to know that confidential information was initially obtained and transmitted improperly and thus through deception,and if the tippee intentionally or recklessly traded while in knowing possession of that information.
tipping chains 
one last question presented by this case is how a chain of tippers affects liability.such chains of tipping are not uncommon,see,dirks,at falcone,at united states mcdermott,cir and follow the same basic analysis outlined above.a tipper will be liable if he tips material information,in breach of a fiduciary duty,to someone he knows will likely trade on the information,or disseminate the information further for the first tippee own benefit.the first tippee must both know or have reason to know that the information was obtained and transmitted through a breach,and intentionally or recklessly tip the information further for her own benefit.the final tippee must both know or have reason to know that the information was obtained through a breach,and trade while in knowing possession of the information.chain tippee liability may also result from conscious avoidance.see sec musella,finding scienter satisfied where the defendants,tippees at the end of a chain,did not ask about the source of information because they did not want to know.
to summarize our discussion of tipping liability,we hold that tipper liability requires that the tipper had a duty to keep material information confidential the tipper breached that duty by intentionally or recklessly relaying the information to a tippee who could use the information in connection with securities trading and the tipper received a personal benefit from the tip.tippee liability requires that the tipper breached a duty by tipping confidential information the tippee knew or had reason to know that the tippee improperly obtained the information,that the information was obtained through the tipper breach and the tippee,while in knowing possession of the material information,used the information by trading or by tipping for his own benefit.
iii.application 
applying these standards to the defendants in this case,we conclude that the sec presented sufficient evidence to create genuine issues of material fact as to strickland,black,and obus liability under the misappropriation theory.
strickland 
turning first to strickland,the sec presented sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment.first,it is undisputed that strickland,an employee of ge capital,owed ge capital a fiduciary duty.see,at holding that a company confidential information qualifies as property and undisclosed misappropriation of such information by an employee violate s a fiduciary duty restatement third of agency an agent has a duty not to use or communicate confidential information of the principal for the agent own purposes or those of a third party.moreover,the sec presented sufficient evidence that strickland knew he was under an obligation to keep information about the deal confidential,including strickland testimony that he knew it was confidential,the deal book that had every page marked extremely confidential,and strickland annual review of ge capital employee code of conduct,which contained provisions on confidentiality.while the defendants make much of sunsource absence from ge capital transaction restricted list until after the deal was publicly announced,this fact is not determinative to our analysis.moreover,there is a separate question of fact whether it was strickland himself who should have added sunsource to the list at an earlier date.thus there is sufficient evidence that strickland knew he owed ge capital a duty to keep information about the acquisition confidential and not to convert it for his own profit.
more hotly disputed is whether the sec presented sufficient evidence to allow a jury to conclude that strickland told black that sunsource was about to be acquired,whether the alleged tip actually occurred as is often the case,there is no direct evidence that strickland tipped black both maintained in depositions that strickland asked black general questions about sunsource management as part of his due diligence work,but revealed nothing about a sale to allied.however,we have never held that a tip needs to be established by direct evidence indeed,such a requirement would restrict successful tipping cases to those in which at least one party cooperated with the government,or where the government had a surreptitious recording.see mcdermott,at.in mcdermott,we found that the government had presented enough evidence to prove the content of a tip beyond a reasonable doubt based only on evidence that the tipper and tippee were having an affair and frequently spoke to each other on the phone the tippee greatly increased her trading activities after the affair began the tippee frequently traded in stocks about which the tipper had confidential information the timing of the phone calls and trades was consistent with tipping and the tippee trades were profitable.id.at see also warde,at pattern of phone calls and trades can support an inference of tipping.here,the sec presented the following evidence 
strickland and black,who were college friends,had a conversation about sunsource on may,three days after ge capital submitted its financing proposal to sunsource.strickland superiors stated that contacting shareholders was not part of due diligence,and strickland himself had never done so in the past.
black immediately told his superior,obus,about the conversation,and obus immediately called andrien to tell him,as andrien testified,that he had heard from a little birdie in connecticut that sunsource was planning to sell the company to a financial buyer.when andrien asked who the little birdie was,obus responded that it was ge.
