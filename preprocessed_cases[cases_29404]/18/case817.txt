this case involves two appeals arising from the dismissal of a putative consolidated class action against h r block,block,and individual defendants who are corporate officers or directors of block.first,horizon asset management horizon appeals the merits of the dismissal,arguing that the district court erred in concluding that horizon failed adequately to plead scienter under the heightened pleading requirements of the private securities litigation reform act of pslra.second,momentum partners and iron workers local pension fund iron workers appeal the district court appointment of horizon as the sole lead plaintiff to pursue all claims against the defendants.iron workers contends that the district court ruling prevented them from litigating the merits of their derivative claims against the individual defendants,because horizon refused to include the derivative claims in its consolidated complaint,and the district court subsequently dismissed the complaint and the entire case.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings.
block is a publicly traded corporation that provides a diverse range of tax,investment,mortgage,and business services and products.in june,block announced that it would restate its financial results filed with the securities and exchange commission sec for fiscal years and and the first three quarters of fiscal year.the restatement corrected,among other things,errors in the calculation of block corporate income tax.in february,block announced the need for a second restatement of its financial results for fiscal years and and the first two quarters of fiscal year,which pertained primarily to errors in determining block state effective income tax rate.also in early,the attorney general of california commenced an action against block,alleging that its refund anticipation loan program violated state and federal law,and the attorney general of new york filed suit asserting that block fraudulently marketed its express individual retirement account ira program.
as a result of these events,shareholders of block filed nine separate actions in state and federal court.the cases were consolidated in the district court,and the court appointed horizon the lead plaintiff.horizon filed a consolidated class action complaint bringing securities fraud claims under section b of the securities exchange act of and sec rule.see b.the complaint alleged that block and individual defendants,including mark ernst,block chairman,president,and chief executive officer,and william trubeck,block executive vice president and chief financial officer,made false and misleading statements to public investors regarding block financial condition.specifically,horizon alleged that block misled investors by failing to disclose the unlawful nature of its refund anticipation loan and express ira programs,which artificially inflated reported earnings failing to disclose its lack of safeguards and procedural controls to ensure accurate financial statements and misstating financial results due to errors in calculating its state effective income tax rate,which resulted in block filing restatements of its financial results.horizon also asserted an additional claim against the individual defendants,alleging liability of controlling persons under section a of the securities exchange act of.see b.
the district court granted block motion to dismiss the case.the court found that horizon failed to plead adequately that block had made any false statements,with the exception of the financial results that were based on the tax calculation errors.see in re h r block sec,d.the court concluded that block admitted the falsity of the financial results by restating them in a subsequent sec filing,id.at,but dismissed the claims because horizon failed to plead scienter adequately.id.at.because the claims were predicated on the underlying securities fraud violations,the court determined that those claims also failed.the court granted horizon leave to amend its complaint,but only with respect to the false statements of financial results.id.at.
horizon filed an amended consolidated class action complaint that removed its claims regarding the refund anticipation loan and express ira programs and added some additional detail to its other allegations.the district court again granted block motion to dismiss,concluding that horizon still failed to plead scienter adequately.see in re h r block sec,wl,at.horizon appeals the dismissal of the amended complaint.
to state a private securities fraud claim under section b of the securities exchange act of and sec rule,a plaintiff must allege a material misrepresentation or omission scienter,a wrongful state of mind a connection with the purchase or sale of a security reliance,often referred to in cases involving public securities markets cases as transaction causation economic loss and loss causation,a causal connection between the material misrepresentation and the loss.dura,broudo,d internal citations omitted emphases omitted see also in re int l.sec,cir.the district court dismissed horizon complaint for failing to plead adequately the element of scienter,and that is the only issue on appeal.we review the district court dismissal de novo.elam neidorff,cir.
the pslra imposes heightened pleading requirements on private securities actions to curb perceived abuses of such actions,including nuisance filings,targeting of defendants,vexatious discovery requests and manipulation by class action lawyers.tellabs,makor issues rights,d internal quotation omitted.as relevant to the pleading of scienter,the pslra instructs that the complaint shall,with respect to each act or omission alleged to violate this chapter,state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b.the required state of mind for private securities fraud actions is scienter,the defendant intention to deceive,manipulate,or defraud,or the defendant severe recklessness.in re ceridian.sec,cir quoting tellabs,at.
to determine whether the plaintiff has alleged facts that give rise to the requisite strong inference of scienter,we must weigh plausible nonculpable explanations for the defendant conduct against inferences favoring the plaintiff allegation of scienter.tellabs,at.although the inference of scienter need not be the most plausible of competing inferences,it must be more than merely reasonable or must be cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.id.at.internal quotation omitted see also ceridian,at.in conducting this comparison,we accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true,tellabs,at,and may take judicial notice of block public sec filings.see.state bd.of admin.green tree fin,cir united states eagleboy,cir 
while we assess horizon factual allegations holistically and collectively rather than in isolation,tellabs,at,horizon must nevertheless raise a strong inference of scienter for each defendant and with respect to each alleged misrepresentation.see phillips,cir citing b see also,at taking each defendant individually when analyzing the pleading of scienter kushner beverly,cir finding no strong inference of scienter when,inter alia,the complaint makes no particular assertion of which defendant was responsible for which statement or omission or how any defendant participated in the alleged scheme.thus,we must consider the allegations against each,trubeck,and.because horizon arguments against ernst and trubeck are substantially similar,however,we will discuss both individual defendants together before turning to block.
the only false statements that horizon alleges were made by ernst and trubeck are the financial results misstated in nine of block sec filings from march,to december.see h r block,d at.specifically,horizon cites false financial results that were later restated in block second restatement on march.although the exact dollar amounts varied,all nine filings included errors in the reporting of state income tax expense,deferred income tax assets,accrued income taxes,and other accounts in block statement of income and balance sheets that are calculated from these figures.as block explained in its second restatement of financial results,these misstatements were caused by errors in determining the company state effective income tax rate,including errors in identifying changes in state apportionment,expiring state net operating losses and related factors,for the fiscal years ended april,and,and the related fiscal quarters.
the nine sec filings that contained the false financial results restated in the second restatement can be grouped into three relevant time periods.the first period includes just one statement,and covers the time until the internal control failures in corporate tax were allegedly discovered by senior management in april.the second period lasts from when senior management allegedly became aware of internal control failures until block announced the need for the first restatement of financial results on june,and includes five statements.the final period runs from when block announced the first restatement until it announced the second restatement,and it includes the last three statements.
the first false statement was made on march.because trubeck did not begin his employment with block until october,horizon can not state a claim against him based on this first statement.there is also a time problem with respect to ernst.horizon alleges that ernst knew of accounting problems n o later than april,that is,no later than a month after the first false statement.
horizon does allege that tim mertz,block vice president for corporate tax,told a confidential witness in or that there were always problems with not reconciling tax accruals and tax liabilities on the state level.this was common knowledge in the accounting department.this allegation,however,tells us nothing about ernst state of mind because he was not a part of the accounting department.horizon contends,based on the statements of a confidential witness,that whatever knowledge mertz had about the company,he shared with ernst,but such a general,conclusory statement provides only weak support,if any,for an inference of ernst scienter.that mertz at times reported directly to ernst,also does not provide a basis to infer that ernst knew everything that mertz did.see kushner,at t he assertion that someone who may have been involved in the scheme reported to the defendant is not specific enough to support a strong inference that he knew of or participated in the fraudulent practice while it was occurring.
horizon further alleges that by the time of the first false statement,other problems were developing in the corporate tax department,including a decision by mertz to outsource corporate tax staffing in,mertz dismissals of three to four staff members,and the department failure to properly maintain and upgrade the tax accounting software.horizon fails to allege,however,that ernst even knew about these issues.the one alleged problem that we can readily infer ernst would have known about is block operation without a chief financial officer for eleven months,a period which included the date when this first false statement was made.but a vacancy in a corporate office does not suggest an intent to deceive or severe recklessness on the part of ernst.such a vacancy is equally consistent,if not more so,with the normal course of business operations,including the process of finding a replacement officer.therefore,considering all of the allegations regarding ernst state of mind when making the first false statement,we conclude that horizon has failed to raise a strong inference of scienter.
the second set of false statements were made after april,when,according to horizon,the internal controls in corporate tax were known to be ineffective by the company senior management,including defendants trubeck and ernst as well as the manager of corporate tax,timothy mertz.horizon based this assertion on a statement made by brad campbell,block assistant vice president for internal audit,alleging that the discovery of the control failures,specifically the tax accounting errors,occurred during the process of block efforts to comply with section of the act of.see.the complaint is unclear about whether horizon had direct knowledge of campbell statement or whether horizon is relying on the reporting of a confidential witness to whom campbell made the statement.in any event,the allegation does not significantly support horizon efforts to plead scienter.
the allegation is inaccurate in one important respect it contends that trubeck had knowledge of the accounting problems in april,six months before he began working for block.thus,the allegation does not support an inference of scienter with respect to trubeck,and the credibility of the statement is weakened with respect to its allegations against ernst.it also reveals another fault in the complaint horizon has not alleged how campbell discovered that ernst was aware of the control failures or how campbell would have a basis to know what ernst knew.see in re hutchinson.sec,cir discussing the need to plead the basis of a witness knowledge in order to have the witness allegations meet the standard of the pslra.moreover,even if we were to assume that the allegation were true and that ernst knew about the accounting problems,horizon does not allege that ernst knew that the financial results released in the five sec filings were false or that he intended to deceive the public.
according to horizon,the inference that ernst and trubeck made these five false,with respect to trubeck,at least the last three statements made while he was employed by further strengthened by the slow pace of the internal investigation once the accounting errors were discovered.we disagree.the facts pled in horizon complaint demonstrate that as soon as the accounting errors were discovered in april,mertz directed that an internal investigation begin,and that the issue was then researched intensively by two different employees.at some point prior to announcing its first restatement of financial results on june,block also consulted with its independent auditors to conclude that a restatement was necessary.this was a prudent course of action that weakens rather than strengthens an inference of scienter.see higginbotham baxter int l,cir taking the time necessary to get things right is both proper and lawful.managers can not tell lies but are entitled to investigate for a reasonable time,until they have a full story to reveal.
throughout the period that block investigated its internal control failures,and as soon as block senior management allegedly became aware of the problems,block repeatedly disclosed its corporate accounting control weaknesses.in its form filed on july,it stated 
w e identified a series of control weaknesses related to our corporate tax accounting function.these weaknesses relate specifically to the reconciliation and level of detailed support of both current and deferred income tax accounts.we also determined an acceleration of taxable income was warranted in one of our segments,however,there was no change to our total income tax provision.upon identification of these control weaknesses,immediate corrective action was undertaken.our efforts to strengthen financial and internal controls continue.we expect these efforts to be completed by the end of fiscal year.
block included similar disclosures in all of its sec filings until it filed its first restatement of financial results on july.these statements do not support an inference that ernst and trubeck intended to deceive the public or acted with severe recklessness.rather,they portray managers who disclosed known accounting problems and warned that work on their internal controls was continuing.therefore,considering all of horizon allegations relating to the second set of false statements,we conclude that horizon has failed to raise a strong inference that ernst or trubeck acted with scienter.
turning to the third and final set of false made after the need for the first restatement was announced on june,central argument is that ernst and trubeck acted with scienter in continuing to state false financial results when they knew that the first restatement did not correct all of the false financial results and that a second restatement would be necessary.horizon strongest allegation to support this argument is a statement by a confidential witness that he 
was directly informed by his manager brad campbell and also jeff brown,who worked in accounting,that senior management,including ernst and trubeck,knew and had spoken of the fact,as of september or october of,that a further restatement of the company financial statements with respect to the misstated tax accruals would be necessary,although they did not yet know the exact amount.
assuming that the confidential witness was told this information at the beginning of september,the allegation would be relevant to whether the last two false statements in this time period were made with scienter.the allegation is not strong and compelling,however,because it does not provide the sources basis of knowledge.see hutchinson,at cornelia crowell gst trust possis,cir.the allegation does not state whether campbell and brown spoke directly with ernst and trubeck or whether they merely conveyed hearsay information that was passed along by others.any inference of scienter is further weakened by the fact that,elsewhere in horizon complaint,this same confidential witness inaccurately alleged that trubeck had knowledge of accounting errors at a time when he was not even employed by block.
block continued disclosures of its control problems in all three of the filings that contained false financial results during this period also weaken the inference that ernst and trubeck acted with scienter.in block sec filing that included the first restatement of financial results on july,it explained that as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form,block disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.block then described the specific deficiencies discovered in its accounting for income tax and stated that the deficiencies resulted in errors in the company accounting for income taxes that were corrected prior to the issuance of the restated financial results.block continued,however,to explain that 
in the aggregate,these deficiencies represent a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting on the basis that there is a more than remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the company annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected by its internal control over financial reporting.because of this material weakness in internal control over financial reporting,management concluded that,as of april,the company internal control over financial reporting was not effective 
although block described the efforts it took to improve internal controls,and stated that it believes it has established appropriate controls and procedures and created the appropriate tax account analysis and support subsequent to april,it also disclosed that 
in addition to the above actions,management will conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the corporate tax function,including resource requirements,during the current fiscal year to identify and implement additional improvements to ensure compliance with the controls and procedures that have been put in place to remediate deficiencies previously identified.
similar disclosures discussing the ongoing review,the hiring of a firm to assist in the review,and additional improvements to controls were made in the subsequent two sec filings.horizon argues that certain statements,such as block statement that it corrected the errors caused by the deficiencies and its belief that it had established appropriate controls after april,suggest that ernst and trubeck deceptively made it appear that all of block accounting problems were corrected.but horizon takes those statements out of context.looking at block disclosures quoted above and in its other filings,it is apparent that block disclosed an ongoing process to remediate complex accounting problems.
horizon attempts to overcome this deficiency by pointing to statements of securities analysts who misinterpreted block disclosures.one analyst,for example,opined that this blemish has been rectified and that it will not be an issue for investors going forward.statements made by securities analysts,however,are insufficient to raise a strong inference of scienter where,as here,there are no allegations that the defendants adopted the statements,represented that they were true,used the analysts as conduits by providing them false information,or otherwise became entangled with the analysts.in re navarre.sec,cir quoting elkind liggett myers,cir see also raab physics,cir.we conclude,therefore,that these allegations with respect to the last three false statements do not raise a strong inference that ernst and trubeck made the statements with the requisite scienter.
horizon alleges that an inference that ernst and trubeck acted with scienter also arises from their signing of certifications.horizon argues that because ernst and trubeck signed certifications pursuant to sections and of the act of,verifying that block internal controls were sufficient when the tax accounting controls were,in fact,inadequate,there is a strong inference of scienter.this court rejected a comparable argument in ceridian,explaining that if an allegation that a mandatory certification was later proven to be inaccurate is sufficient to give rise to the requisite strong inference,scienter would be established in every case where there was an accounting error or auditing mistake by a publicly traded company,thereby eviscerating the pleading requirements for scienter set forth in the pslra.ceridian,at quoting cent.laborers pension fund integrated servs,cir.
horizon also alleges that an inference of scienter is strengthened by the fact that trubeck had motive to commit fraud because of his desire to receive almost in bonuses under block short term incentive program,which awarded bonuses based upon corporate performance.motive can be a relevant consideration,and personal financial gain may weigh heavily in favor of a scienter interference,tellabs,at,but merely pleading that a defendant compensation depends on corporate value or earnings does not,by itself,establish motive to fraudulently misrepresent corporate value or earnings.kushner,at quoting green tree,at.a complaint must show that the benefit to an individual defendant is unusual,for example,that the benefit is of an overwhelming magnitude and received under suspicious circumstances.in re cerner.sec,cir.we have held that bonuses as high as and paid to a corporate officer under a performance plan were not unusual.see kushner,at.thus,trubeck bonuses over two years totaling approximately,where there are no allegations of suspicious timing,are insufficient.see ceridian,at.
horizon makes a similar allegation that ernst and trubeck had motive to commit fraud because they wanted to ensure a subsidiary success in issuing million in promissory notes,and block profitability was important to that success.this assertion is also unavailing.the desire to make a company seem more profitable is a desire universally held among corporations and their executives,and thus insufficient to support an inference of scienter,even when tied to a debt offering.cerner,at internal quotation omitted.therefore,we find that horizon motive allegations do not support a strong inference of scienter.
finally,horizon contends that even if its complaint does not raise a strong inference of intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud,tellabs,at,it at least raises a strong inference that ernst and trubeck acted with severe recklessness.proof of severe recklessness may establish the requisite scienter.ceridian,at.to demonstrate severe recklessness,a plaintiff must allege highly unreasonable omissions or misrepresentations amounting to an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care,and that present a danger of misleading buyers or sellers which is either known to the defendant or is so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it.kushner,at.a plaintiff must allege more than incompetence or corporate mismanagement before a claim of negligence rises to t
