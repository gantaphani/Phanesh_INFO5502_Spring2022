the sec alleged that alan phan used stock registered only for employee compensation purposes to raise capital from the public for the publicly traded company he led in,thereby violating federal securities law.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the sec,holding that phan both engaged in an unregistered securities sale and committed securities fraud.in this appeal,phan contends that the admissible evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to him,supports his position rather than the sec.
we affirm the district court summary judgment rulings concerning the registration issue.whether or not the stock was initially issued to compensate bona fide consulting services,phan was involved in its subsequent resale to raise capital for the company and thereby violated the registration provision of federal securities law.we agree with phan,however,that the summary judgment record does not demonstrate that he made misstatements material as a matter of law.we therefore reverse the grant of summary judgment in favor of the sec with respect to the antifraud claims and vacate much of the relief the district court awarded against phan.
during the relevant time period,phan was chairman,ceo,and president of the hartcourt companies hartcourt,a publicly traded business development and investment holding company based in long beach,california.believing,as did many others during the heady bubble of the late,that fortunes could be made by investing in the technology sector,hartcourt decided to enter the chinese technology market.to this end,hartcourt entered into a pair of investment agreements with companies based in china and hong kong that obligated hartcourt to pay those companies several million dollars in cash during the later half of.as was true of many other companies venturing into the technology sector in the late,hartcourt ambition outstripped its financial resources,and the company found itself in the fall of having difficulty making the promised payments to its investment partners.
to help it find business opportunities in china,hartcourt sought the assistance of yongzhi yang,a math professor in alabama who worked as a consultant to american companies seeking to invest in chinese technology firms.according to yang,he and his wife,yan wu,ran the consulting business as a joint enterprise yang preferred to use only wu name on public documents to hide from his university the fact that he moonlighted.
hartcourt entered into a written fee and option agreement the fee agreement with wu on august.the fee agreement specified that wu will use her best efforts to search for,identify and make known to hartcourt,businesses and assets opportunities which qualify as potential acquisitions by hartcourt.the fee agreement explained that wu talents and services are of a special,unique,unusual and extraordinary character and are of particular and peculiar benefit and importance to hartcourt.
the fee agreement stated that hartcourt would provide wu with an option to purchase one million hartcourt shares at a price of per share,approximately hartcourt share price.the fee agreement represented that this payment was to satisfy wu time and expense incurred,up to and including the first acquisition by hartcourt of an opportunity introduced or arranged by wu,and that wu has not been engaged to perform,nor will she agree to perform any services in connection with capital raising transactions.the fee agreement specified that wu would serve as a consultant through december,but that either party could terminate her service on notice.the fee agreement contained no provision requiring wu to forfeit the option if the fee agreement was terminated early,although it did state that hartcourt shall only be liable for payment of fees earned by wu as a result of work prior to the effective date of the termination.
under the terms of a separate option agreement the option agreement,also signed on august,hartcourt granted wu an option to purchase one million shares to fulfill the promise made in the fee agreement.wu had until december,to exercise the option and was required to pay the per share at the time of exercise to receive the stock the prepayment requirement.in other words,wu immediately became the owner of the options,but would not receive the one million shares of hartcourt until she paid million.
both agreements were filed with the sec on september,as attachments to a form,which registered the issuance of those one million shares this form and its attachments were publicly available upon filing.the securities act of the act,requires publicly traded companies to register all new issuances of stock.a form provides a streamlined method of registering stock issued to compensate employees and consultants,as opposed to the more detailed and prolonged process required to register shares used to raise capital.registration of securities on form,release codified at b.by signing the registration,hartcourt explicitly agreed to amend the form during any period in which offers or sales are being made to reflect any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement which,individually or in the aggregate,represents a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement and to include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement.a.
right after it filed the form,hartcourt issued one million shares of common stock to wu.contrary to the option agreement,however,wu and yang paid nothing to hartcourt at that time.in a declaration submitted in the district court yang explained that he pressed for the elimination of the prepayment requirement because i wanted some guarantee that my wife and i would receive our option shares,since we did not have the money to pay the option price,and it made no sense for us to bring companies to hartcourt if there was no guarantee that we would receive the shares.
phan stated in his declaration that to satisfy yang request he orally modified the agreement on behalf of the company,by waiving the prepayment requirement and instead allowing wu to receive the shares in exchange for a promissory note to pay hartcourt million hartcourt did not note this modification in its form,so the supposedly superseded terms were the only publicly disclosed information about the arrangement between hartcourt and wu.
within months,wu resold most of the one million shares.the bulk of the shares were sold to rubin investment group rubin in a november,transaction involving shares and a november,transaction involving shares.the sales were at prices well below the per share that wu supposedly was obligated to repay hartcourt.phan stated in his declaration that he suggested yang contact rubin and that he directed hartcourt lawyer to draft a contract for one of these stock sales.phan also acknowledged that hartcourt demand in october that wu repay the million promissory note generated wu decision to sell the shares yang likewise stated in his declaration that he informed phan that wu would be forced to sell the shares if hartcourt demanded repayment of the loan,and phan insisted that if that was the only way we could pay hartcourt,then we should sell the shares and get hartcourt paid.
at phan direction,wu wired the approximately in proceeds of these two sales to hartcourt investment partners in china and hong kong,to pay hartcourt outstanding debts.on december,she also wired one of these partners more than,from money she received upon selling hartcourt shares.phan characterized these transactions as an arrangement to avoid delay by eliminat ing the middleman,because hartcourt would have immediately wired wu payments to its creditors.wu also transferred shares on november,directly to perfect data corporation,another creditor of hartcourt.
yang made a number of smaller purchases and sales of hartcourt stock during the fall of,primarily for his own benefit.during the same period,hartcourt promised yang that he would receive shares in exchange for helping hartcourt enter into a joint venture with chinese technology company innostar.the defendants explain that this promise caused hartcourt to forgive wu debt for the purchase price of of the original one million shares in lieu of issuing additional shares.
after conducting an investigation,the sec filed a civil complaint against phan,yang,and hartcourt,exercising its power to seek injunctions and fines against those who violate the act and the securities exchange act of the act.see.the sec alleged that the defendants violated section of the act,which forbids the unregistered sale of securities.the sec also alleged violations of the antifraud provisions of section a of the act,a,section b of the act,b,and rule,based on materially untrue statements made in hartcourt filing 
after both parties moved for summary judgment,the district court granted the sec motion and denied the defendants motion.the district court permanently enjoined the defendants from violating securities laws,fined the a fine against phan,a fine against yang,and a fine against hartcourt and yang to disgorge gains and,barred phan from serving as an officer or director of a publicly traded company.phan appealed the judgment yang and hartcourt did not.
we review de novo the district court decisions on the summary judgment motions.sec first pac.bancorp,cir.in our review,we must determine,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.johnson columbia props.anchorage,lp,cir.
it is unlawful to participate in an interstate or mail sale of unregistered securities.see act a,c,a,c see also berckeley inv.group,colkitt,cir in order to establish a section violation,plaintiff must point to evidence that no registration statement was in effect as to the securities defendant sold or offered to sell the securities and the sale or offer was made through interstate commerce.by its terms,section of the act creates liability for any securities sale for which a registration statement is not in effect it does not limit liability to initial distribution.a see also sec cavanagh,cir each sale of a security must either be made pursuant to a registration statement or fall under a registration exception.quoting eddy rogers,jason weeden,resales of securities under the securities act,allison ticor title ins,cir section applies to transactions each sale must be registered or exempt.shaw united states,cir noting that the registration requirement could apply to a company resale of a batch of shares initially distributed using a statutory exemption from registration louis loss et,securities regulation ed.on its face,is all embracing.section of the act,however,shields any transactions by any person other than an issuer,underwriter,or dealer,thus exempting from section ordinary resales of stock between independent parties.see also sec murphy,cir section was designed to exempt routine trading transactions with respect to securities already issued loss,supra,at explaining that exempts an unregistered resale of stock between friends from violating.
the district court held that phan violated section because a large portion of the stock was resold by wu to raise capital for hartcourt without filing an additional registration statement the registration dispute in this case thus centers on whether,at the time of wu resales of hartcourt stock,the september,registration statement was in effect as to the security.a 
sec regulations provide that an registration form can be used by a company only to issue stock as a means of compensating consultants for bona fide services not connected with raising capital.first,b a provides that an form may be used to register securities to be offered to its employees under any employee benefit plan.in turn,provides that consultants may participate in an employee benefit plan,but only if t hey provide bona fide services to the registrant and t he services are not in connection with the offer or sale of securities in a transaction,and do not directly or indirectly promote or maintain a market for the registrant securities.emphasis added.
the sec interprets these regulations flatly to prohibit the use of an form to register shares that are sold to the public to raise capital.as the sec published explanation of amendments to the regulations promulgated in specifies 
s ome issuers and promoters have misused form as a means to distribute securities to the public without the protections of registration under section of the securities act.for example,the issuer registers on form securities nominally offered and sold to employees or,more commonly,to consultants.these persons then resell the securities in the public markets,at the direction of the issuer or a promoter.in some cases,the consultants or employees perform limited or no additional services for the issuer.the consultants or employees then either remit to the issuer the proceeds from these resales,or apply those proceeds to pay expenses of the issuer that are not related to any service provided by the consultants or employees.
registration of the shares on form does not accomplish section registration of these public sales.the transaction that takes place a transaction with the public is a different transaction from the transaction registered on form a compensatory transaction with employees,including consultants.although the issuer purports to sell securities to employees,the securities instead are sold to the public.the employees act as conduits by selling the securities to the public and distributing the proceeds or their economic benefit to the issuer.this public sale of securities by the issuer has not been registered,although the securities act requires registration.the failure to register this sale of securities deprives public investors of the protections afforded by the securities act.
release.at emphasis added footnote omitted.
at the same time,the sec explained the circumstances in which it would view a transaction as seeking to raise capital from the public 
form is not available to register offers and sales of securities to consultants and advisors where 
by prearrangement or otherwise,the issuer or a promoter controls or directs the resale of the securities in the public market or 
the issuer or its affiliates directly or indirectly receive a percentage of the proceeds from such resales.
id.at footnote omitted.the sec has also explained that the controls or directs test is intended to focus on the issuer power to make a resale happen,or to make it happen at a particular time.id.at.and the directly or indirectly receive test will be satisfied where the issuer or its affiliates receive an economic benefit from the resale proceeds,such as when the proceeds are used to pay the issuer operating expenses or are paid to the issuer control persons.id.at.
we owe substantial deference to an agency published interpretation of its own regulations and will treat it as controlling if it is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.auer robbins,d internal quotation marks omitted see also epstein mca,cir applying such substantial deference to an interpretation published in a sec release,rev on other grounds sub.nom matsushita indus.epstein,d.such deference is particularly sensible here in light of the sec broad statutory authority to design the schema for registering securities.see.because the sec interpretation is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with regulations that already draw a distinction between bona fide consulting and services that aid a transaction,we hold that an form can not be used to register a securities transaction in which the issuer or promoter controls or directs a resale or directly or indirectly receives a percentage of the proceeds.
applying this holding,we conclude that wu resale of hartcourt publicly traded stock could not be covered by an registration.that resale had the effect of supplying the company with capital from the public at the company behest.
the summary judgment record,viewed in the light most favorable to phan,establishes both that wu transferred to hartcourt creditors the proceeds of the stock sales she made through rubin and her brokerage account to satisfy the company outstanding debts and that hartcourt was the impetus behind these resales.phan declaration states 
hartcourt made demand sic for payment from yang and yan wu in october.yang agreed to sell the hartcourt shares which he and his wife received from hartcourt.he asked me if i knew anyone who could sell shares in large lots,and i directed him to call rubin investments,whose business card was on my desk at the time and whom had recently made a presentation to hartcourt where they had described themselves as institutional investors which had an interest in investing in hartcourt.in an effort to assist yang and yan wu,i later asked my attorney to prepare a simple share purchase agreement which yan wu could use in selling the shares,since yang told me that he and his wife were unfamiliar with the process 
from the payments which hartcourt demanded that yang and yan wu make pursuant to their exercise of the option shares,i instructed yang to send those sums to third parties designated by hartcourt instead of sending the money directly to hartcourt.
likewise,a declaration submitted by yang stated 
i advised alan phan that wu and i did not have the money to pay off what was owed,and that the only way we could come up with a major portion of what was owed would be to sell the shares we received.phan insisted that if that was the only way we could pay hartcourt,then we should sell the shares and get hartcourt paid.
this undisputed evidence demonstrates that it was the company directives to wu that resulted in the sale of the stock and therefore in raising capital for the company.given these circumstances,the resale of wu stock could not validly be registered on form.issuer of publicly traded stock control led or direct ed yang resale of the securities in the public market through its demand for repayment of the loans,because the demand ma d e a resale happen.see release.at.further,hartcourt indirectly receive d a percentage of the proceeds from such resale when the proceeds of the resale were paid to its creditors.id.at.
phan asserts that the foregoing analysis is not here pertinent,as long as the defendants intended at an earlier hartcourt initially granted wu the one million provide compensation for bona fide consulting.but,as we have noted above,liability need not turn on whether hartcourt initial grant of the shares to wu was properly registered.even if the form was effective as of the date of the initial grant because hartcourt intended to compensate wu for bona fide consulting we must accept,construing the summary judgment record in the light most favorable to the registration ceased to be effective once hartcourt sought to use the shares for a purpose.see thomas lee hazen,treatise on the law of securities regulation e,at ed.unlike most other registered offerings,securities offered in a form registration may be subject to resale restrictions.
at the point at which a company seeks to redistribute into the public market the securities it issued to consultants,then,form is not available to register offers and sales of securities to consultants.release.at see also a a registration statement shall be deemed effective only as to the securities specified therein as proposed to be offered.emphasis added as the previous analysis demonstrates,the circumstances surrounding wu resale of the stock clearly fall within the sec criteria for a transaction.consequently,no registration statement was in effect as to wu stock at the time of resale,in violation of section.a see sec dci,d,a violation of the registration provisions exists where the issuing company raises capital via its employees sale of stock,regardless of the existence a sic preconceived plan regardless of intent,a public company and its officers violate the registration provisions by using employees as conduits for the sale of stock to the public because the true distribution of securities to the not registered.sky scientific,initial decision release,sec docket,wl,at,similar holding by an administrative law judge in a sec proceeding see also sec calvo,cir applying the principle that the act creates strict civil liability to a section claim.the assumed for purposes of summary judgment initial legitimacy of hartcourt registration form is thus irrelevant to phan liability under section,as wu ultimately resold her shares to raise capital for hartcourt at the company behest 
phan also argues,in a cursory fashion without citing any authority,that h e did not participate in any sale of shares nor did he benefit from any such sales.although we have recognize d that a defendant role in the transaction must be a significant one before section liability will attach,we have defined a significant role to include one who is both a necessary participant and substantial factor in the sales transaction.murphy,at,
applying this standard,phan role in assisting wu resale satisfied the sold or offered to sell element of section.as detailed in the defendants own declarations,quoted above,phan chose the date to call in wu million obligation to hartcourt,directed wu to sell the shares in order to repay her obligation,provided yang with a buyer,directed hartcourt lawyer to draft a stock sale contract,and instructed wu where to send the proceeds.phan therefore was both a necessary participant and a substantial factor in wu resale.see id.at see also geiger,at s omeone who played a role as crucial as the defendant finding the buyer,negotiating the terms,facilitating the escape liability under section by avoiding direct involvement in the final sales act.
in sum,the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the sec on the section cause of action 
the district court also granted summary judgment in favor of the sec on its claim that phan committed securities fraud through his involvement in filing hartcourt registration form.the fraud claim is certainly supported by some of the evidence,indeed much of it.but viewing all of the evidence in the light most favorable to phan,as we must on summary judgment,we conclude that there are disputes of material fact that preclude summary judgment.we therefore reverse the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the sec but affirm the denial of phan motion for summary judgment.

phan primarily challenges the district court holding that the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to him demonstrated the materiality of his misstatements the antifraud provisions materiality element is satisfied only if there is a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.basic levinson,d quoting tsc,northway,d internal quotation mark omitted applying test to claims under section b and rule see also sec rogers,cir applying a reasonable investor test to section,overruled on other grounds by pinter dahl,d.
determining materiality in securities fraud cases should ordinarily be left to the trier of fact.in re apple computer secs,cir.materiality typically can not be determined as a matter of summary judgment because it depends on determining a hypothetical investor reaction to the alleged misstatement.as the supreme court has explained 
the determination of materiality requires delicate assessments of the inferences a reasonable shareholder would draw from a given set of facts and the significance of those inferences to him,and these assessments are peculiarly ones for the trier of fact.only if the established omissions are so obviously important to an investor,that reasonable minds can not differ on the question of materiality is the ultimate issue of materiality appropriately resolved as a matter of law by summary judgment.
tsc,at.quoting johns hopkins hutton,cir footnote omitted see also charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure civil,at ed.e ven when there is no dispute as to the facts,it usually is for the jury to decide whether the conduct in question meets the standard.emphasis added,cited in tsc,at.thus,for example,the supreme court has refused to hold as a matter of law that a difference between payment in warrants worth each and warrants worth each would be material to an investor,holding instead that,even if the company statements could have misled investors to believe that the higher value was correct,the significance of the difference in value to an investor was a question of fact for the jury.id.at.
applying this strict standard and evaluating the securities fraud claim in light of the record viewed most favorably to phan,we can not find that the misstatements made in hartcourt registration form rise to the level of obviousness necessary to award summary judgment.
the sec argues that the many misrepresentations and omissions in the form as of the moment it was filed on september,made materiality so obvious so as to warrant summary judgment.the evidence in the record is in conflict,however,as to many important facts that could support this conclusion.for example whether wu had a bona fide obligation fully to repay hartcourt for the stock after the transaction was restructured whether hartcourt did initially intend the shares to compensate yang and wu for consulting work and whether hartcourt issued the shares to wu expecting that they would be resold to raise capital from the public to satisfy the company pressing debts.the registration would certainly have contained material misstatements if those disputed facts were resolved in the sec favor.obviously,an average hartcourt investor would want to know if the company was giving away a million shares of stock for free or needed to sell stock quickly in order to stave off a liquidity crisis.but we can not uphold summary judgment in favor of the sec on that basis,as the underlying facts have not been conclusively established.
the district court determined otherwise after it refused to credit critical statements in phan and yang declarations.those statements attested to a restructuring of the transaction that created a bona fide obligation for wu fully to repay hartcourt for the stock the district court viewed the declarations as uncorroborated and and as contradicted by earlier testimony in the record,and so disregarded the statements regarding restructuring.the district court characterizations of the statements can not justify disregarding them.
as we have previously noted,declarations oftentimes will be a nd properly so,because otherwise there would be no point in a party submitting them.united states shumway,cir.in most cases,consequently,t hat an affidavit is selfserving bears on its credibility,not on its cognizability for purposes of establishing a genuine issue of material fact.id.only in certain as when a declaration state s only conclusions,and not such facts as would be admissible in evidence,can a court disregard a selfserving declaration for purposes of summary judgment.id.quoting fed.civ.e.
villiarimo aloha island air,cir,relied upon by the district court as supporting the disregard of uncorroborated and declarations,involved just such a situation the declaration in question included facts beyond the declarant personal knowledge and provide d no indication how she knows these facts to be true.id.at.phan and yang declarations do not have a similar defect,as they involve the declarant own actions.the personal actions of phan and yang are central to wu obligation to repay hartcourt for the stock,especially as the record shows that wu was basically a figurehead rather than an independent actor.
moreover,it is unremarkable that the defendants could not otherwise corroborate their personal conversations.that is likely to be the case regarding most conversations between two people,and does not disqualify either participant from testifying about the,of course,to a credibility determination by the finder of fact.the district court was thus wrong to disregard the declarations as uncorroborated and.
nor was it proper to disregard phan and yang declarations based on our case law that treats declarations flatly contradict ed by the declarant prior testimony as sham s.kennedy allied mut.ins,cir.phan deposition testimony that he directed his staff to send wu a promissory note with a term does not flatly contradict the declaration assertion that hartcourt could demand repayment in october.the deposition provided only cursory testimony about the terms,and phan stated in his deposition that he was unsure whether such a promissory note was even actually sent.moreover,yang testimony during the sec investigative phan sa id do this deal,sell that many shares and whatever money you get send to hartcourt creditor is entirely consistent with the statements in yang later declaration that phan demanded repayment with the understanding that wu would have to sell the stock.
the upshot is that for present purposes,we must take the description of the option transaction contained in yang and phan declarations as true.in other words,we must accept that phan modified the option agreement at wu request to replace the prepayment requirement with a million loan obligation and that wu initially received the stock for compensatory purposes,and can not in evaluating the grant of summary judgment on the fraud issue rely on any misstatement concerning those representations.
at the same time,it is quite clear that,by the time the form was filed,yang and wu,by their own account,had arranged to obtain the shares without paying up front,yet the form stated otherwise.that means that in evaluating the sec summary judgment motion,we can rely on the one undisputed misstatement in the registration form the assertion that wu would be required to pay million in cash upon exercising her option to receive the one million hartcourt shares.
given that understanding of the underlying facts,we can not conclude on the present summary judgment record that,by failing to disclose the payment term change,the registration form contained a misstatement obviously important to an investor.see tsc,at.the sec,which both bears the burden of proof and is the party moving for summary judgment,submitted no evidence to the district court demonstrating the materiality of the misstatement about the payment terms in light of that vacuum,we can not conclude that an average investor would have viewed the difference between hartcourt potentially selling shares for a definite payment of million in cash rather than definitely selling the shares in exchange for a promissory note of million as pertinent in evaluating the company.we would have to engage in rank speculation to determine the inference that investors would have drawn from knowing that the transaction changed from a potential occurrence to a definite reality.but as the supreme court has observed,t he determination of materiality requires delicate assessments of the inferences a reasonable shareholder would draw from a given set of facts.id.
we do agree with the sec observation in its brief that a ny reasonable investor would consider it important that the company was giving away one million shares and getting nothing close to full payment for the shares,emphasis added see also murphy,at surely the materiality of information relating to financial condition is not subject to serious challenge.but we must accept for present purposes that hartcourt received a million promissory note in exchange for the shares.although financial logic dictates that a million promissory note is less valuable than million in cash,given the risks inherent in a loan and the time value of money,the record contains no evidence about the value of this million note at the time the transaction was restructured.therefore,we have no way to know if hartcourt decision to accept a loan as payment was the equivalent of agreeing to get nothing close to full payment for the shares,or represented only a minor decrease in payment that might well be an inconsequential change in the risk that investors already realized they faced by investing in the unproven company.accordingly,we can not say as a matter of law,unaided by any evidence in the record,that an investor would view the total mix of information about hartcourt as significantly altered by this misstatement,standing alone.see basic,at.united states bingham,cir per curiam reversing a criminal conviction for violating rule when the government expert testimony about materiality was far too abstract to satisfy the materiality requirement in a particular case,because m ateriality must be judged in the context of the total mix of information available to investors.
indeed,the case for materiality is,if anything,weaker here than it was in tsc indus.in tsc,the supreme court refused to hold as a matter of law that the difference in value of a payment in warrants worth and warrants worth was material.here,we do not even know the value of the promissory note.given that gap in the would turn on wu financial circumstances,her credit record,and the likely repayment schedule,among other can not gauge the extent of the misrepresentation and so can not determine whether the difference in value between the promissory note and million in cash was greater,absolutely or as a percentage of the represented value,than the difference in value in tsc,the significance of which was held to be a question for the trier of fact.
the sec,indeed,does not really argue that the materiality of the one misstatement about payment only misstatement supported by the record when construed in the light most favorable to by itself sufficiently obvious to warrant summary judgment.instead,the sec brief argues only that importance of the numerous misrepresentations and omissions is so obvious that reasonable minds could not differ,not that the single misstatement regarding the form of the transaction meets that standard.emphasis added.likewise,the single judicial opinion that the sec cites to support granting summary judgment on materiality,sec softpoint,aff,cir unpublished table decision,concerns no misstatement similar to the sole misstatement we may consider at this juncture.true,in that case,the defendant form registrations misrepresented the stock issued as a consultant fee,when,in actuality,proceeds from the shares were funnelled back to the company.id.at.but,as we have stressed,the record here,construed in the light most favorable to the defendants,demonstrates that the stock was initially issued to wu as a consultant fee.no case,including,supports the conclusion that a single misstatement on a somewhat peripheral aspect of a transaction is material 
in sum,whether phan made a material misstatement of fact in the original filing is a question for resolution at trial.although it may well be that,in fact,the transaction was a conduit from the outset and the contrary representations on the form were material misstatements,or that the admitted misstatements regarding the form of the original transaction was indeed material,neither matter can appropriately be decided on the present summary judgment record.
up to this point our analysis has assumed that we can consider all the evidence the district court used in ruling on the summary judgment motions.phan also appeals,however,the district court rejection of several evidentiary objections.
in asking us to reverse the district court evidentiary rulings phan faces a heavy burden.a district court refusal to exclude evidence in its consideration of summary judgment is reviewed for an abuse of discretion and warrants reversal only when the evidentiary ruling was manifestly erroneous and prejudicial.orr bank of,cir.phan falls far short of meeting such a burden.his arguments are meritless,and some border on frivolous.
phan broadest challenge concerns a declaration submitted by sec lawyer nicholas chung,which incorporated dozens of interview transcripts,depositions,and documentary exhibits.phan argues the declaration and its attachments must be excluded because chung neither had personal knowledge of the attachments creation nor served as a record custodian at the sec.excluding this declaration would leave no evidence in the record supporting the sec claims.
phan correctly notes that rule e of the federal rules of civil procedure requires that declarations used to support or oppose summary judgment motions shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence,and shall show affirmatively that the declarant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein.fed.civ.e.for summary judgment declarations,however,a proper foundation need not be established through personal knowledge but can rest on any manner permitted by federal rule of evidence b or.orr,at.with the exception of one transcript,discussed below,phan presents no argument on appeal that the documents attached to chung declaration failed to comply with rules and 
phan does argue that the sec failed to establish a sufficient foundation for the transcript of yang august interview,conducted as part of a sec investigation into a prior case.that transcript lacked a court reporter certification when originally submitted to the district court,but the sec later provided the certification by filing a declaration from the court reporter.the later declaration was adequate.see fed.civ.e the court may permit affidavits to be supplemented by further affidavits.
phan also objects to the admission of the transcript of yang interview because neither phan nor his lawyer was given an opportunity to attend it.accordingly,phan argues,the transcript use violated the requirement in the federal rules of civil procedure that depositions may be used only against any party who was present or represented at the taking of the deposition.fed.civ.a.an interview given under penalty of perjury may,however,be treated as a therefore may be considered in ruling on a summary judgment motion,fed.civ.e even though rule a prevents its use as a formal deposition.hoover switlik parachute,cir see also sec am.commodity,cir holding that transcripts from a sec investigation may be considered in ruling on summary judgment as the equivalent to a declaration.
fully accepting phan position that wu received one million shares of hartcourt in exchange for a million loan to compensate yang service as a consultant and resold most of those shares to repay the loan,phan is nonetheless liable under section for the unregistered resale of hartcourt stock.the district court therefore correctly granted summary judgment in favor of the sec on the section cause of action.but the fact that this transaction differed from the arrangement hartcourt detailed in registering those one million shares with the sec does not establish as a matter of it raises the distinct phan committed securities fraud by making a material misstatement.we therefore reverse the grant of summary judgment in favor of the sec on these claims but affirm the denial of phan motion for summary judgment.because the district court award of penalties and injunctive relief against phan was partly based on the determination that he violated the antifraud provisions,we also vacate that award except for the permanent injunction prohibiting phan from violating section.
