this appeal arises out of a dispute involving a tooling purchase agreement entered into by nimbus technologies,and sunndata products,certain purchase orders related to that agreement and the circumstances surrounding the dissolution of sunndata and organization of ez led llc and ez led.nimbus appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants aaron geer,david tarasevich,ez led llc,ray whelchel,and steven whelchel on nimbus claim for intentional interference with business relations.nimbus also appeals the district court holding that nimbus may not hold geer accountable for the judgment against sunndata by piercing the corporate veil.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants on both issues.
background 
nimbus is a north carolina corporation that manufactures specialized electronic equipment.sunndata,owned by ray whelchel,was an alabama corporation incorporated in january,that sought to establish itself in the diode led industry ez led,was an alabama corporation incorporated in june,and ez led llc was an alabama limited liability company organized in june.whelchel and tarasevich were the sole participants in ez led llc.tarasevich was also a business advisor to sunndata and geer.geer was a creditor of sunndata and ez led llc,lending sunndata approximately,and ez led llc over.
in and,sunndata was producing leds and attempting to gain a foothold in the led industry,although at that time it had limited sales and few assets.in,whelchel of sunndata met john weir,the owner of nimbus,which was in the business of outsourcing for specialized electronics manufacturing.whelchel and weir held discussions regarding the assembly of various colored led products that were already on the market,and nimbus began manufacturing those products for sunndata.
sunndata believed that the key to success in the led industry was to develop a true white led.in early,sunndata held discussions with the robert allen company rga regarding the development of a true white led.rga displayed sample white leds that appeared to be of high quality and were supposedly made from prototype tooling,but rga requested to develop the tooling fully.because sunndata did not have the necessary capital to fund rga development of the white led tooling,it approached nimbus about entering into an agreement to fund rga development of the white led tooling.
nimbus and sunndata subsequently entered into a tooling purchase agreement tpa,whereby nimbus agreed to pay rga the requested to develop the white led tooling,and sunndata agreed to reimburse nimbus the plus an additional.once developed,the tooling would be the property of nimbus until sunndata paid nimbus the.after sunndata paid nimbus,the tooling was to become the property of sunndata.
after the parties executed the tpa,nimbus paid rga,as contemplated in the agreement.rga obtained white leds that sunndata believed were of poor quality and did not conform to the samples rga had previously shown sunndata.rga did not develop any tooling for the manufacture of white leds,and subsequently filed bankruptcy without refunding nimbus any of the.because rga did not develop the tooling,sunndata did not pay nimbus the contemplated in the tpa.
without the tooling for the white led,sunndata was faced with insolvency.it had no significant revenue from sales,and was surviving on periodic infusions of cash from geer geer insisted that sunndata consult a business expert,and he recommended tarasevich due to his manufacturing experience.tarasevich conducted a due diligence inquiry into the led market and the operational status of sunndata.he concluded that whelchel should wind down sunndata due to potential liability related the sales of poor quality products,and because a new white led product would have to be developed using new tooling technology.thereafter,geer refused to lend further money to sunndata.
tarasevich recommended forming two new companies to produce and market the planned white led product.in june,whelchel and tarasevich formed ez led llc and ez led.ez led,was to manufacture a white led product,and ez led llc was to market the product.that month,pursuant to a written purchase agreement,sunndata sold its assets to ez led llc for approximately in cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities,for a total of.the assets included computer and office equipment,a car,all intellectual property of sunndata,and some inventory.tarasevich testified that he believed this was only an asset sale,and that ez led llc did not assume sunndata liabilities,though it did agree to assume certain debts,including money owed to geer and charlotte stanford,a sunndata investor.ez led llc and ez led,operated out of the same space as sunndata,and used the same telephone and fax numbers and email address,but had different management and ownership than sunndata.
geer loaned to ez led llc,and tarasevich acted as manager of the company.geer testified that though he believed his loan could later be converted into membership shares in the llc,such a conversion never took place.eventually,ez led llc and ez led,became insolvent,and geer foreclosed on certain assets owned by ez led llc by physically taking possession of them and removing them from ez led llc offices.
at the time ez led llc and ez led went out of business,nimbus still had invoices outstanding on products ordered by sunndata.nimbus brought suit in an attempt to recover the it believes it is owed under the tpa,as well as money due under the unpaid invoices.nimbus named sunndata,ray and steven whelchel,geer,tarasevich,ez led llc,and ez led,in a complaint seeking recover on a number of theories,including,inter alia,intentional interference with business relations and seeking to pierce the corporate veil to hold all defendants liable for sunndata debts.sunndata and ez led,failed to answer,and nimbus obtained a default judgment against them.
the remaining defendants filed motions for summary judgment,which were granted except to the extent any defendants continued to hold assets transferred from sunndata.the district court also denied ray whelchel motion for summary judgment as to nimbus attempt to pierce the corporate veil,but granted summary judgment in favor of the other defendants on that issue,holding that only persons with an ownership interest in sunndata could be held accountable for its obligations.nimbus appeals the district court holding that geer,as a creditor,may not be held liable under a theory of piercing the corporate veil,and also appeals the court grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants on nimbus claim for intentional interference with business relations.
