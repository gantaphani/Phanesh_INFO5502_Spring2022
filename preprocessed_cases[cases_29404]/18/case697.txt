kenneth nelson and richard curia dispute the terms of a stock purchase agreement the two entered into in and then modified several times over the next decade.in the agreement,nelson sold curia a small number of shares in two automobile dealerships the contract also gave curia a series of options to purchase all remaining shares pursuant to a defined valuation formula.a modification of the agreement contains language suggesting that the parties terminated curia options and specified instead that his right to purchase additional shares was left to future agreement of the parties.other language in this and subsequent modifications,however,also suggests that curia option to purchase additional shares in one of the dealerships may have survived the modification.the district court granted summary judgment in curia favor after concluding that the contract and its modifications,read together,unambiguously gave curia the option to purchase the remaining shares in one of the dealerships.
we reverse.the contract as modified is reasonably susceptible to both parties interpretation and is therefore ambiguous regarding the survival of the options.accordingly,extrinsic evidence is required to clarify what the parties meant,and summary judgment compelling the sale of shares was inappropriate.
background 
in kenneth nelson and richard curia entered into a stock purchase agreement providing that nelson would sell curia a minority block of shares in two automobile dealerships,ken nelson,known as auto plaza,and ken nelson nissan,known as auto mall.prior to the agreement,nelson owned all shares of outstanding capital stock in auto plaza and all shares in auto mall.paragraph of the agreement provided that curia was to pay nelson in exchange for shares of auto plaza and shares of auto mall.paragraph of the agreement,titled options to purchase additional shares,gave curia three options to purchase additional stock in the two corporations.the first option gave curia the right to purchase an additional shares of auto plaza and shares of auto mall for.the second allowed curia to purchase a stake in both corporations by acquiring shares of auto plaza and shares of auto mall.the final option gave curia the right to acquire all remaining shares in the two corporations provided he also offer ed to purchase the land and four buildings of auto plaza.rather than specify a price,paragraph of the agreement set forth a valuation formula for the latter two options.
some time passed before curia could complete the initial transaction,apparently because he encountered some difficulty borrowing the funds necessary to make the initial purchase and to exercise the first option.after some delay he secured a loan,and in he purchased the shares specified in the initial transaction and exercised the first of the options.by this time,however,the number of shares in the two corporations had plaza now had outstanding shares and auto mall now had.nelson transferred shares in auto plaza and shares in auto mall to curia.
in the parties decided to modify their original agreement.the reason for the modification is not entirely clear,although it appears to relate to the change in the number of shares in the corporations.the preamble to the modification offers some additional explanation.the recitals in the modification agreement state that nelson and curia had made a mutual mistake in determining the fair market value of the capital stock of auto plaza and auto mall and in evaluating the minority interest the parties had intended.accordingly,the parties stated their intention to modify the agreement to reflect the of the minority interest and to correct the mutual mistake of the parties.the recitals also lay out the revised price that should have applied in to achieve the intended minority interest.exhibit a to the modification shows that the parties calculated the intended price by applying a revised valuation formula and then discounting the share price by.
the modification also included the following language in paragraph,titled purchase of additional shares 
curia shall have the right to purchase additional shares of stock in said corporations upon those terms and conditions subsequently agreed upon by the parties hereto.the purchase price for said additional shares of stock shall be determined by adding to the total net worth of each corporation a figure representing the accumulated lifo last in first out reserve and dividing the total sum thereof by the number of shares of each corporation.
emphasis added.the parties dispute the effect of paragraph its first the options contained in the agreement.nelson believes the first sentence rendered the remaining options in the agreement inoperative.curia argues that whatever that sentence means precisely,the modification agreement read as a whole makes it clear that the parties intended to maintain his option to purchase all remaining shares.the second sentence of paragraph sets forth a valuation formula for any of the said additional shares.that formula differs from the one applicable to the options provided for in the agreement and matches the formula used in the modification to calculate the book value of shares in the two companies as of.curia maintains that the presence of this modified valuation formula means that his option to purchase all remaining shares survived the modification.
nelson and curia entered into two subsequent modification agreements,one in and one in.the district court held,and the parties now agree,that the involved a third party purchase of terminated any remaining right that curia might have possessed to purchase any additional shares in auto mall.the modification,entitled amendment to modification agreements,was the last of the parties modification agreements.one evident purpose for this final modification was to memorialize the parties intent with respect to share transfers in the event that either party died.according to this last modification,curia would immediately purchase from nelson shares of stock in auto plaza in the event that nelson died while the agreement and the modification were still in force.the parties also modified the valuation formula that would apply should the parties need to calculate t he purchase price of the shares of stock and the remaining shares of stock.this valuation formula differed from both the one stated in the modification and the one stated in the agreement.this modification further explained that in the event that curia died first,nelson would repurchase curia stock according to the new formula.finally,the modification stated that if nelson died first,curia agreed to provide compensation to nelson relatives and estate until such time as curia purchases all of the remaining shares of nelson stock.
in the parties began discussing curia buyout of nelson interest in the corporations.apparently these discussions stalled,and in march curia notified nelson that he was exercising the second option under the agreement to acquire the shares necessary to give him control over of the outstanding capital stock in the corporations.curia included in this letter his own calculation as to the number of shares he was purchasing.he also noted that he was exercising his option pursuant to section of the agreement for the consideration and upon the terms set forth in the spa and the modification.a day after sending this notice,curia sent another notice to nelson saying that he intended to exercise his option to purchase all remaining shares in auto plaza and auto mall.
nelson immediately contested curia right to purchase the shares,claiming that the options were no longer valid.in april nelson filed a declaratory judgment against curia seeking a ruling that curia did not have the right to exercise either option.this led to a countersuit by curia claiming nelson breached the parties agreement to sell him the shares pursuant to the options,as modified by the later agreements.the suits were consolidated,and in a series of orders,the district court granted curia motion for summary judgment to compel the sale of all remaining stock in auto plaza,holding that the agreement as modified in and unambiguousl
