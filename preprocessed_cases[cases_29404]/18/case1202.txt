background 
bae is a publicly owned corporation,incorporated in england and wales,that operates in the united states through its subsidiary bae systems.harper woods is a pension fund that owns approximately american depository receipts adr representing shares of bae.an adr represents ownership in a security issued by a foreign company in foreign markets.city of monroe employees ret.bridgestone,cir.
on september,harper woods filed a shareholder derivative suit on behalf of bae against bae board of directors,some of whom are also officers of the company,and former officers and directors bae defendants.harper woods named bae as a nominal defendant in the suit,as is typical with shareholder derivative suits.bae systems,the american subsidiary,was not named as a defendant.
harper woods alleged that the bae defendants engaged in intentional,reckless,negligent breaches of their fiduciary duties of care,control and candor,involving illegal,improper,ultra vires conduct,including causing bae to violate the laws of the united states and international business codes and conventions by making,or permitting to be made,improper illegal bribes,kickbacks and other payments.complaint,reprinted in joint appendix.according to harper woods,the bae defendants caused bae to engage in a pattern and practice of making illegal and improper payments to secure contracts and false and misleading statements to conceal and cover them up,in violation of and united kingdom law.id.specifically,harper woods alleged that the bae defendants undertook illegal and improper conduct in breach of their fiduciary duties to bae,including paying more than billion in bribes and kickbacks to prince bandar bin sultan of saudi arabia in order to obtain a large contract known as the contract from the saudi arabian ministry of defense.id.harper woods further alleged that the illegal or improper payments were secretly bargained for at the outset of the contract,and that bandar received most of this money in washington,via an account at riggs bank.id.harper woods sought damages including punitive damages,an accounting by defendants,and an order directing bae to undertake certain corporate governance reforms.id.at.
the bae defendants moved to dismiss on three grounds lack of standing,forum non conveniens,and lack of personal jurisdiction.they submitted with their motion to dismiss a declaration from martin moore qc,a barrister in private practice in london appointed queen counsel in.decl.of martin moore qc,reprinted in see also black law dictionary ed defining queen counsel as an elite,barrister or advocate.moore was asked to give his view as to the circumstances in which,as a matter of english law,a shareholder in an english incorporated company,such as bae plc,can bring proceedings derivatively on behalf of that company to remedy alleged harm caused to the company concerned.moore decl.bae also asked moore to consider from an english law standpoint whether the plaintiff allegations in this action are sufficient to establish its right to bring the claims asserted in the complaint derivatively on behalf of bae plc against the named defendants.id.
moore concluded that harper woods could not bring its derivative action against the bae defendants on behalf of bae.id.he stated that the conduct of the bae defendant directors came within the english rule of foss harbottle,which provides that the company is the proper plaintiff when a wrong is done to the company,whether by a director or by others.id.though the wrongs allegedly committed by the bae defendants constituted breaches of regulatory,civil,or criminal law,the rule of foss harbottle concerns itself with alleged wrongs done to the company.id.the essence of the alleged wrongs done to the company by the consisted of mismanagement and failure of oversight,according to moore.id,see also id.since the directors conduct could be ratified by a majority of shareholders,moore stated that the company was the proper plaintiff in an action against the directors unless one of the exceptions to the foss rule applied.id.moore then declared that none of the exceptions applied.see id.finally,moore described remedies for director misconduct,other than derivative suits.id.under english law,these remedies include statutory rights to demand a shareholder meeting,to submit resolutions at the meeting,and to remove directors by ordinary resolution to petition the high court in england for relief on the grounds that the company affairs have been or are conducted in a way that is unfairly prejudicial to shareholder interests and in some circumstances to bring a claim directly against the directors accused of misconduct.id.
opposing bae motion to dismiss,harper woods submitted a declaration from paul girolami qc,a barrister appointed queen counsel in and appointed in to sit as a deputy high court judge in the chancery division of the high court.decl.of paul girolami qc,reprinted in.girolami declared,i have been asked to give my views on,and in response to,the declaration of moore.like him i have made this declaration on the same basis as i would have done were this expert evidence given in english proceedings.id.additionally,girolami stated,it is not for me to express views on what the complaint should properly be understood as alleging,nor on whether moore understanding is correct.but it does seem to me possible that his characterisation of the complaint is too limited id.expressing his views on english company law,girolami agreed with moore that,as a general matter,a complaint for mismanagement and failure of supervision falls within the rule barring shareholder derivative suits he stated,however,that shareholders could bring a derivative suit for other breaches beyond failure of oversight if those breaches were incapable of ratification by a majority of shareholders.id.in particular,girolami asserted that,under english law,directors may commit breaches of duty,in addition to ultra vires acts,that are incapable of being ratified by shareholders.id.admitting that there is a dearth of decided english cases in support of the point,girolami explained that the leading treatises on english law state that illegal acts can not be ratified by shareholders.see id.
the bae defendants submitted a second declaration from martin moore with their reply to harper woods opposition to the motion to dismiss.in this declaration,moore convincingly showed that the authoritative statements of the rule in foss harbottle,both old and new,do not suggest that there is an exception to the rule where conduct is illegal.second decl.of martin moore qc,may,reprinted in see also id,citing and discussing significant english authorities indicating that general illegality does not constitute an exception to foss harbottle.
the district court conducted a hearing on the motion to dismiss on june.at the end of the hearing,the district court invited supplemental submissions on the question of whether it is possible under law to ratify an illegal act.tr.of hearing june,at,reprinted in.in response,the bae defendants filed a third declaration from martin moore stating that,under english law,an illegal act by a company director is ratifiable by shareholders.supplemental decl.of martin moore qc,june,reprinted in.harper woods filed a second declaration from paul girolami,reaching the opposite conclusion,declaring that shareholders can not ratify breaches of duty by directors that consist of applying the company money in making illegal or improper payments in violation of criminal law.second decl.of paul girolami qc july,reprinted in.
in its complaint,harper woods also named as defendants prince bandar bin sultan pnc financial services group,the legal successor to riggs bank following a merger and joseph,robert,and barbara allbritton,three former executives and controlling shareholders of riggs.pnc and the allbrittons pnc defendants jointly moved to dismiss the complaint,arguing that the bae defendants motion to dismiss should be granted based on lack of standing and therefore the aiding and abetting claims against the pnc defendants should be dismissed as well.pnc and the allbrittons joint motion to dismiss at,reprinted in memorandum of points and authorities in support of pnc and the allbrittons joint motion to dismiss at,reprinted in.pnc and the albrittons additionally moved to dismiss on two alternate grounds failure to state a claim for aiding and abetting and application of the in pari delicto defense to bar the claims against the pnc defendants.see pnc and the allbrittons joint motion to dismiss at.
the district court,applying english law,granted the motion to dismiss,holding that harper woods lacked standing to bring the shareholder derivative suit.harper woods,d at.the district court applied the common law rule of foss harbottle,which governed shareholder derivative suits until it was superseded by the companies act.see id.at.harper woods does not contest on appeal the district court finding that the act does not apply retroactively to its complaint.see id.at.
applying the rule of foss harbottle,the district court found that shareholders may not bring derivative actions under english law except in limited circumstances,none of which is applicable in this case.see harper woods,d at.the district court dismissed the claims against the pnc defendants on the basis that plaintiffs who lack standing to bring a derivative claim for breach of fiduciary duty can not pursue counts for aiding and abetting those breaches.id.citing mann gtcr golder rauner,d.the district court thus did not address the defendants motions to dismiss on grounds of forum non conveniens,lack of personal jurisdiction,failure to state a claim for aiding and abetting,and in pari delicto.
appellant filed a timely appeal with this court challenging the district court dismissal of its complaint.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
this court reviews choice of law issues de novo.williams first gov t mortgage investors.
as a general matter,it is well understood that the party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing its standing.steel citizens for a better env t,d.moreover,plaintiffs bear the burden of establishing standing to bring a derivative suit under english law,which applies to this case.see prudential assurance newman indus,ch,stating that plaintiff,before proceeding with a derivative suit,must establish a prima facie case that the action falls within the proper boundaries of the exception to the rule in foss harbottle see also tr.of oral argument at plaintiff counsel acknowledged,i think that i got the burden of indicating that we come within an exception to the rule of foss harbottle.
the district court determination of an issue of foreign law is treated as a ruling on a question of law and our review is therefore de novo.see also ry.labor executives ass ret.reviewing a motion to dismiss,this court accepts as true all of the factual allegations contained in the complaint and draws all inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.see ctr.for law educ.dep t of.though the court construes the complaint liberally in the plaintiff favor,it need not accept inferences unsupported by facts or legal conclusions cast in the form of factual allegations.see kowal mci commc ns.
b.the applicable law 
as the district court correctly determined,english law applies to this case.a federal court sitting in diversity applies the conflict of law rules of the forum in which it sits.see klaxon stentor.when a claim addresses matters of corporate governance or other internal affairs of a company,courts apply the law of the state of incorporation.see cowin bresler,see also labovitz.times.as the district court recognized,this internal affairs doctrine applies to corporations incorporated outside of the united states.see harper woods,d at citing cases.bae is incorporated in england and wales,so english law applies to this shareholder derivative suit.
in an attempt to avoid an application of english law,harper woods argues that the district court erred in failing to apply a public policy exception to the district of columbia internal affairs doctrine.see harper woods,at restatement second conflict of laws.however,this exception is normally applied only where the laws of the jurisdiction of incorporation are immoral or unjust,see,hausman buckley,cir in re bp,derivative,d,or another state has a more significant relationship to the parties and transaction or overriding interest in the issue to be decided.see restatement second conflict of laws in re bp,d at.the district court concluded that neither rationale applies here.see harper woods,d at.harper woods cites to nothing in local law that impugns this judgment,and we affirm it.
plaintiff standing 
harper woods contends that the district court erred in holding that it lacked standing under english law to pursue the shareholder derivative claim.harper woods advances two principal arguments first,it contends that the complaint does not fall within the rule of foss harbottle and is therefore not barred by the rule and,second,it asserts that even if the complaint is within the compass of foss,the suit still may proceed because the complaint is covered by one of three exceptions to the foss rule.we disagree on both counts.
we affirm the district court judgments that the complaint comes within the rule of foss harbottle and that none of the exceptions to the rule apply.we hold further that,even assuming harper woods complaint can be characterized as alleging that the directors committed illegal acts rather than mere breaches of fiduciary duty,it still falls within the rule of foss harbottle.harper woods has not shown that shareholders can not ratify illegal acts of directors that are not ultra vires,so the conduct at issue does not fall outside the scope of the rule.the district court did not reach this point because it characterized harper woods complaint as alleging failure of supervision and oversight,which both parties experts agreed could be ratified under english law.see harper woods,d at see also moore decl,girolami decl.
the rule of foss harbottle 
prior to the passage of the companies act,english law did not permit shareholder derivative suits except in the very limited circumstances outlined in foss harbottle.see hare.english courts describe the rule of foss harbottle as having five components.first,the foss rule provides that the proper plaintiff in an action regarding a wrong allegedly done to a company is prima facie the company itself.see prudential,ch.at edwards halliwell,all.second,no individual shareholder can maintain an action if the alleged wrong is capable of ratification by a simple majority of shareholders.prudential,ch.at edwards,all at.third,where the alleged wrong is ultra vires,the rule has no application because a majority of shareholders can not ratify the transaction the ultra vires exception.prudential,ch.at edwards,all at see also moore decl.fourth,where the wrongdoers themselves are in control of the company and the alleged action amounts to fraud,the rule is relaxed to allow the minority to sue the wrongdoer control or fraud on the minority exception.prudential,ch.at edwards,all at see also moore decl,girolami decl.fifth,the foss rule does not prevent a shareholder from suing if the alleged wrong could be validly sanctioned only by a special majority the super majority exception.prudential,ch.at edwards,all at see also moore decl,girolami decl.
as the district court recognized,a court applying the foss rule must first determine whether the alleged wrongdoing is capable of ratification by a simple majority of shareholders.harper woods,d at citing moore decl.the district court was correct to conclude that while full and frank disclosure of the matters to be ratified may be necessary for an actual shareholder ratification to be valid,such disclosure is irrelevant to the operative question under foss harbottle,whether conduct is in principle capable of ratification.see id.at citing moore second decl,see also edwards,all at explaining that where the alleged wrong is a transaction which might be made binding on the company by a simple majority of the members,no individual member of the company is allowed to maintain an action because no wrong has been done to the company if a majority approves the transaction and the company itself can bring suit if a majority of shareholders do not approve emphasis added.if the actions alleged in the complaint are capable of ratification,a shareholder may not pursue a derivative action on behalf of the corporation unless one of the exceptions to the rule of foss harbottle applies.harper woods,d at citing moore decl.
ratification of illegal acts 
the district court found that the essence of plaintiff complaint is f ailure of supervision and oversight.harper woods,d at.the district court explained that the wrongs allegedly done to the company that gave rise to the derivative suit were breaches of fiduciary duty,not breaches of regulatory,civil,or criminal law.id.at.the parties experts agree that breaches of fiduciary duty for mismanagement and failure of supervision are capable of ratification by shareholders.see moore decl,girolami decl.ratification would render the wrongful failure of supervision and longer a breach of duty to the company.harper woods,d at citing moore supp.decl.
harper woods seemingly disputes this characterization of its complaint,noting that the district court accepted moore narrow characterization of the complaint instead of accepting as true all material allegations and construing the complaint in the light most favorable to harper woods.see appellant br.at citing warth seldin,d.it is at best questionable whether the complaint alleges anything more than breaches of fiduciary duty.the complaint asserts,in conclusory terms,that the directors caused bae to engage in a pattern and practice of making illegal and improper payments and made false and misleading statements to conceal and cover up the payments.complaint,see also id,alleging that bae defendants undertook illegal and improper conduct including paying bribes or kickbacks to prince bandar id,same.these unsupported assertions are insufficient to charge the defendant directors with illegal acts.although we must construe the complaint liberally in harper woods favor,we need not accept legal conclusions cast in the form of factual allegations.see kowal,at.our skepticism regarding the frailties of the complaint was fueled during oral argument when counsel for harper woods acknowledged that the complaint focuses on a breach of fiduciary duty,a failure to supervise,and in all likelihood,a deliberate turning of a blind eye.tr.of oral argument at.
in the end analysis,however,harper woods arguments regarding the breadth of the complaint are much ado about nothing.even if harper woods complaint can be construed as an action against the directors for committing illegal acts,harper woods has not convincingly demonstrated that english law finds illegal acts incapable of ratification by shareholders.at oral argument,harper woods relied primarily on a irish case,cockburn newbridge sanitary steam laundry.although the cockburn case recognized that i llegality and ultra vires are not interchangeable terms,the court in fact conflated the two,noting that it is difficult,if not impossible,to conceive a case in which a company can do an illegal act and act within its powers.id.at.the court then discussed a case involving an ultra vires act unaffected by criminality,and concluded that the ultra vires argument is stronger when the whole matter is tainted with criminality.id.at.the court held that,because the agreement entered into by the in cockburn was likely to be illegal,i t would,accordingly,have been quite beyond the powers of the company to have entered into it.id.the cockburn decision is perplexing,to say the least,in part because it can be read as nothing more than an application of the ultra vires exception to the foss rule.in other words,whether or not illegal,the court found that the alleged wrongdoing in cockburn undoubtedly involved an ultra vires action.
in his second declaration,moore dismisses cockburn as an irish case that is not binding on the english courts.moore second decl.c.moore makes a more compelling argument,however,when he points out that the reasoning underlying the decision in cockburn is fundamentally incompatible with important and binding english authority,in particular rolled steel prods.holdings british steel,ch,and arab monetary fund hashim,lloyd.id.in rolled steel,the court stated that the phrase ultra vires in the context of company law should for the future be rigidly confined to describing acts which are beyond the corporate capacity of a company.rolled steel,ch.at slade.in other words,the court made it clear that a company has capacity to carry out a transaction which falls within its objects even though carried out by wrongful exercise of its powers.id.at.
the law commission consultation paper on shareholder remedies,cited by moore,confirms this conclusion,stating that where an act which a company commits is illegal it is not also ultra vires unless it is also beyond the capacity it is given by the companies acts.see moore second decl.c,see also the law commission,shareholder remedies a consultation paper the stationery office hereinafter law commission consultation paper.the law commission consultation paper continues,the description of the rule in foss v.harbottle previously described in the consultation paper applies to illegal acts which are ultra vires in this sense.where the company proposes to do some other illegal act,a member may bring proceedings to restrain the company from so acting,but it is doubtful whether he can bring proceedings to recover damages for any loss which the company may suffer as a result without showing a fraud on the minority.law commission consultation paper at.harper woods expert,girolami,cites this language to show that the point is not free from doubt and that the law commission report does not espouse moore apparently view that all illegal acts can be ratified by a simple majority.girolami second decl.but plaintiff has the burden of demonstrating standing to bring the derivative suit,see prudential,ch.at,and harper woods has not demonstrated that illegal acts can not be ratified.
harper woods also relies on treatises to support its claim that illegal acts can not be ratified.however,only two treatises cite english cases in support of the proposition that the foss rule does not apply if the alleged wrong is illegal or criminal.see girolami decl.c,f.only one of the cases kempton park racecourse,concerns a criminally illegal action of
