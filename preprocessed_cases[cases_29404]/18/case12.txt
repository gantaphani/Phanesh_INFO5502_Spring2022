respondent first derivative traders first derivative,representing a class of stockholders in petitioner janus capital group,jcg,filed this private action under securities and exchange commission sec rule,which forbids any person t o make any untrue statement of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.the complaint alleged,inter alia,that jcg and its wholly owned subsidiary,petitioner janus capital management llc jcm,made false statements in mutual fund prospectuses filed by janus investment fund for which jcm was the investment adviser and administrator and that those statements affected the price of jcg stock.although jcg created janus investment fund,it is a separate legal entity owned entirely by mutual fund investors.the district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim.the fourth circuit reversed,holding that first derivative had sufficiently alleged that jcg and jcm,by participating in the writing and dissemination of the prospectuses,made the misleading statements contained in the documents.before this court,first derivative continues to argue that jcm made the statements but seeks to hold jcg liable only as a control person of jcm under a.
held because the false statements included in the prospectuses were made by janus investment fund,not by jcm,jcm and jcg can not be held liable in a private action under rule.
a although neither rule nor the statute it interprets,b of the act,expressly creates a private right of action,such an action is implied under b.superintendent of ins.of bankers life casualty.that holding remains the law,stoneridge investment partners,llc,but,in analyzing the question at issue,the court is mindful that it must give narrow dimensions to a right congress did not authorize when it first enacted the statute and did not expand when it revisited it,at.
for rule purposes,the maker of a statement is the person or entity with ultimate authority over the statement,including its content and whether and how to communicate it.without control,a person or entity can merely suggest what to say,not make a statement in its own right.this rule follows from central bank of denver,first interstate bank of denver,which held that rule private right of action does not include suits against aiders and abettors who contribute substantial assistance to the making of a statement but do not actually make it.reading make more broadly,to include persons or entities lacking ultimate control over a statement,would substantially undermine central bank by rendering aiders and abettors almost nonexistent.the court interpretation is also suggested by stoneridge,at,and accords with the narrow scope that must be given the implied private right of action,at.
the court rejects the government contention that make should be defined as create,thereby allowing private plaintiffs to sue a person who provides the false or misleading information that another person puts into a statement.adopting that definition would be inconsistent with stoneridge,supra,at,which rejected a private rule suit against companies involved in deceptive transactions,even when information about those transactions was later incorporated into false public statements.first derivative notes the uniquely close relationship between a mutual fund and its investment adviser,but the corporate formalities were observed,and reapportionment of liability in light of this close relationship is properly the responsibility of congress,not the courts.furthermore,first derivative rule would read into rule a theory of liability similar to but broader than liability under a.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit 
justice thomas delivered the opinion of the court.
this case requires us to determine whether janus capital management llc jcm,a mutual fund investment adviser,can be held liable in a private action under securities and exchange commission sec rule for false statements included in its client mutual funds prospectuses.rule prohibits mak ing any untrue statement of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.cfr.we conclude that jcm can not be held liable because it did not make the statements in the prospectuses.
janus capital group,jcg,is a publicly traded company that created the janus family of mutual funds.these mutual funds are organized in a massachusetts business trust,the janus investment fund.janus investment fund retained jcg wholly owned subsidiary,jcm,to be its investment adviser and administrator.jcg and jcm are the petitioners here.
although jcg created janus investment fund,janus investment fund is a separate legal entity owned entirely by mutual fund investors.janus investment fund has no assets apart from those owned by the investors.jcm provides janus investment fund with investment advisory services,which include the management and administrative services necessary for the operation of janus fun d,app,but the two entities maintain legal independence.at all times relevant to this case,all of the officers of janus investment fund were also officers of jcm,but only one member of janus investment fund board of trustees was associated with jcm.this is more independence than is required by statute,up to percent of the board of a mutual fund may be composed of interested persons.see stat,as amended,a see also a ed.and supp.defining interested person 
as the securities laws require,janus investment fund issued prospectuses describing the investment strategy and operations of its mutual funds to investors.see a,b,b,a,a b.the prospectuses for several funds represented that the funds were not suitable for market timing and can be read to suggest that jcm would implement policies to curb the practice for example,the janus mercury fund prospectus dated february,stated that the fund was not intended for market timing or excessive trading and represented that it may reject any purchase request if it believes that any combination of trading activity is attributable to market timing or is otherwise excessive or potentially disruptive to the fund.app.although market timing is legal,it harms other investors in the mutual fund.
in september,the attorney general of the state of new york filed a complaint against jcg and jcm alleging that jcg entered into secret arrangements to permit market timing in several funds run by jcm.after the complaint allegations became public,investors withdrew significant amounts of money from the janus investment fund mutual funds because janus investment fund compensated jcm based on the total value of the funds and jcm management fees comprised a significant percentage of jcg income,janus investment fund loss of value affected jcg value as well.jcg stock price fell nearly percent,from on september to on september.
respondent first derivative traders first derivative represents a class of plaintiffs who owned jcg stock as of september.its complaint asserts claims against jcg and jcm for violations of rule and b of the securities exchange act of,stat,as amended,b.first derivative alleges that jcg and jcm caused mutual fund prospectuses to be issued for janus mutual funds and made them available to the investing public,which created the misleading impression that jcg and jcm would implement measures to curb market timing in the janus mutual funds.app.to pet.for cert.had the truth been known,janus mutual funds would have been less attractive to investors,and consequently,jcg would have realized lower revenues,so jcg stock would have traded at lower prices.at.
first derivative contends that jcg and jcm materially misled the investing public and that class members relied upon the integrity of the market price of jcg securities and market information relating to jcg and jcm.at.the complaint also alleges that jcg should be held liable for the acts of jcm as a controlling person under a supp.a of the act.
the district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim in re mutual funds inv.litigation,supp,d.the court of appeals for the fourth circuit reversed,holding that first derivative had sufficiently alleged that jcg and jcm,by participating in the writing and dissemination of the prospectuses,made the misleading statements contained in the documents.in re mutual funds inv.litigation,emphasis in original.with respect to the element of reliance,the court found that investors would infer that jcm played a role in preparing or approving the content of the janus fund prospectuses,at,but that investors would not infer the same about jcg,which could be liable only as a control person of jcm under a,at.
we granted certiorari to address whether jcm can be held liable in a private action under rule for false statements included in janus investment fund.under rule,it is unlawful for any person,directly or indirectly,t o make any untrue statement of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.cfr b to be liable,therefore,jcm must have made the material misstatements in the prospectuses.we hold that it did not 
the sec promulgated rule pursuant to authority granted under b of the securities exchange act of,b.although neither rule nor b expressly creates a private right of action,this court has held that a private right of action is implied under b.superintendent of ins.of bankers life casualty.that holding remains the law,stoneridge investment partners,llc,but c oncerns with the judicial creation of a private cause of action caution against its expansion,ibid.thus,in analyzing whether jcm made the statements for purposes of rule,we are mindful that we must give narrow dimensions to a right of action congress did not authorize when it first enacted the statute and did not expand when it revisited the law.at.
one makes a statement by stating it.when make is paired with a noun expressing the action of a verb,the resulting phrase is approximately equivalent in sense to that verb.oxford english dictionary def.hereinafter oed accord,webster new international dictionary def.ed.make followed by a noun with the indefinite article is often nearly equivalent to the verb intransitive corresponding to that noun for instance,to make a proclamation is the approximate equivalent of to proclaim,and to make a promise approximates to promise.see oed def.the phrase at issue in rule,t o make any statement,is thus the approximate equivalent of to state.
for purposes of rule,the maker of a statement is the person or entity with ultimate authority over the statement,including its content and whether and how to communicate it.without control,a person or entity can merely suggest what to say,not make a statement in its own right.one who prepares or publishes a statement on behalf of another is not its maker.and in the ordinary case,attribution within a statement or implicit from surrounding circumstances is strong evidence that a statement was made by and only by the party to whom it is attributed.this rule might best be exemplified by the relationship between a speechwriter and a speaker.even when a speechwriter drafts a speech,the content is entirely within the control of the person who delivers it.and it is the speaker who takes credit or blame for what is ultimately said.
this rule follows from central bank of denver,first interstate bank of denver,in which we held that rule private right of action does not include suits against aiders and abettors.see,at.such suits against entities that contribute substantial assistance to the making of a statement but do not actually make it may be brought by the sec,see e,but not by private parties.a broader reading of make,including persons or entities without ultimate control over the content of a statement,would substantially undermine central bank.if persons or entities without control over the content of a statement could be considered primary violators who made the statement,then aiders and abettors would be almost nonexistent 
this interpretation is further supported by our recent decision in stoneridge.there,investors sued entities who,acting both as customers and suppliers,agreed to arrangements that allowed the investors company to mislead its auditor and issue a misleading financial statement.at.we held that dismissal of the complaint was proper because the public could not have relied on the entities undisclosed deceptive acts,at.significantly,in reaching that conclusion we emphasized that nothing the defendants did made it necessary or inevitable for the company to record the transactions as it did.at this emphasis suggests the rule we adopt today that the maker of a statement is the entity with authority over the content of the statement and whether and how to communicate it.without such authority,it is not necessary or inevitable that any falsehood will be contained in the statement.
our holding also accords with the narrow scope that we must give the implied private right of action,at.although the existence of the private right is now settled,we will not expand liability beyond the person or entity that ultimately has authority over a false statement.
the government contends that make should be defined as create.brief for united states as amicus curiae citing webster new international dictionary ed.defining make as t o cause to exist,appear,or occur this definition,although perhaps appropriate when make is directed at an object unassociated with a verb,to make a chair fails to capture its meaning when directed at an object expressing the action of a verb.
adopting the government definition of make would also lead to results inconsistent with our precedent.the government definition would permit private plaintiffs to sue a person who provides the false or misleading information that another person then puts into the statement.brief for united states as amicus curiae but in stoneridge,we rejected a private rule suit against companies involved in deceptive transactions,even when information about those transactions was later incorporated into false public statements,at.we see no reason to treat participating in the drafting of a false statement differently from engaging in deceptive transactions,when each is merely an undisclosed act preceding the decision of an independent entity to make a public statement.
for its part,first derivative suggests that the and uniquely close relationship between a mutual fund and its investment adviser should inform our decision.brief for respondent.it suggests that an investment adviser should generally be understood to be the maker of statements by its client mutual fund,like a playwright whose lines are delivered by an actor.we decline this invitation to disregard the corporate form.although first derivative and its amici persuasively argue that investment advisers exercise significant influence over their client funds,see jones harris associates,slip,at,it is undisputed that the corporate formalities were observed here.jcm and janus investment fund remain legally separate entities,and janus investment fund board of trustees was more independent than the statute requires.any reapportionment of liability in the securities industry in light of the close relationship between investment advisers and mutual funds is properly the responsibility of congress and not the courts.moreover,just as with the government theory,first derivative rule would create the broad liability that we rejected in stoneridge.
congress also has established liability in a for e very person who,directly or indirectly,controls any person liable for violations of the securities laws.a.first derivative theory of liability based on a relationship of influence resembles the liability imposed by congress for control.to adopt first derivative theory would read into rule a theory of liability similar to but broader in application than,see post,at what congress has already created expressly elsewhere we decline to do so.
under this rule,jcm did not make any of the statements in the janus investment fund prospectuses janus investment fund did.only janus investment fund not jcm bears the statutory obligation to file the prospectuses with the b,b,a b see also cfr imposing requirements on investment companies the sec has recorded that janus investment fund filed the prospectuses.see jif standalone prospectuses,online at as visited june,and available in clerk of court case file recording the filer of the janus mercury fund prospectus as janus investment fund there is no allegation that jcm in fact filed the prospectuses and falsely attributed them to janus investment fund.nor did anything on the face of the prospectuses indicate that any statements therein came from jcm rather than janus investment fund a legally independent entity with its own board of trustees 
first derivative suggests that both jcm and janus investment fund might have made the misleading statements within the meaning of rule because jcm was significantly involved in preparing the prospectuses.but this assistance,subject to the ultimate control of janus investment fund,does not mean that jcm made any statements in the prospectuses.although jcm,like a speechwriter,may have assisted janus investment fund with crafting what janus investment fund said in the prospectuses,jcm itself did not make those statements for purposes of rule 
the statements in the janus investment fund prospectuses were made by janus investment fund,not by jcm.accordingly,first derivative has not stated a claim against jcm under rule.the judgment of the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit is reversed.
it is so ordered.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit 
justice breyer,with whom justice ginsburg,justice sotomayor,and justice kagan join,dissenting.
this case involves a private securities and exchange commission sec rule action brought by a group of investors against janus capital group,and janus capital management llc janus management,a firm that acted as an investment adviser to a family of mutual funds collectively,the janus fund or fund.the investors claim that janus management knowingly made materially false or misleading statements that appeared in prospectuses issued by the janus fund.they say that they relied upon those statements,and that they suffered resulting economic harm.
janus management and the janus fund are closely related.each of the fund officers is a janus management employee.janus management,acting through those employees and other of its employees,manages the purchase,sale,redemption,and distribution of the fund investments.janus management prepares,modifies,and implements the janus fund strategies.and janus management,acting through those employees,carries out the fund daily activities.
rule says in relevant part that it is unlawful for any person,directly or indirectly t o make any untrue statement of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.cfr b emphasis added.see also b b of the securities exchange act of.the specific legal question before us is whether janus management can be held responsible under the rule for having ma d e certain false statements about the janus fund activities.the statements in question appear in the janus fund prospectuses.
the court holds that only the janus fund,not janus management,could have ma d e those statements.the majority points out that the janus fund board of trustees has ultimate authority over the content of the statements in a fund prospectus.and in the majority view,only the person or entity with ultimate authority over the statement,including its content and whether and how to communicate it can make a statement within the terms of rule.ante,at.
in my view,however,the majority has incorrectly interpreted the rule word make.neither common english nor this court earlier cases limit the scope of that word to those with ultimate authority over a statement content.to the contrary,both language and case law indicate that,depending upon the circumstances,a management company,a board of trustees,individual company officers,or others,separately or together,might make statements contained in a firm prospectus even if a board of directors has ultimate responsibility.and the circumstances here are such that a court could find that janus management made the statements in question.
respondent complaint sets forth the basic elements of a typical rule fraud on the market claim.it alleges that janus management made statements that created the misleading impression that it would implement measures to curb a trading strategy called market timing.second amended complaint hereinafter complaint,app.to pet.for cert.the complaint adds that janus management knew that these market timing statements were false that the statements were material that the market,in pricing securities including related securities relied upon the statements that as a result,when the truth came out that janus management indeed permitted market timing in the janus fund,the price of relevant shares fell and the false statements thereby caused respondent significant economic losses.complaint,at.stoneridge investment partners,llc,the elements of a typical b private action 
the majority finds the complaint fatally flawed,however,because rule says that no person shall directly or indirectly make any untrue statement of a material fact,the statements at issue appeared in the janus fund prospectuses,and only the person or entity with ultimate authority over the statement,including its content and whether and how to communicate it can make a false statement.ante,at.
but where can the majority find legal support for the rule that it enunciates the english language does not impose upon the word make boundaries of the kind the majority finds determinative.every day,hosts of corporate officials make statements with content that more senior officials or the board of directors have ultimate authority to control.so do cabinet officials make statements about matters that the constitution places within the ultimate authority of the president.so do thousands,perhaps millions,of other employees make statements that,as to content,form,or timing,are subject to the control of another.
nothing in the english language prevents one from saying that several different individuals,separately or together,make a statement that each has a hand in producing.for example,as a matter of english,one can say that a national political party has made a statement even if the only written communication consists of uniform press releases issued in the name of local party branches one can say that one foreign nation has made a statement even when the officials of a different nation subject to its influence speak about the matter and one can say that the president has made a statement even if his press officer issues a communication,sometimes in the press officer own name.practical matters related to context,including control,participation,and relevant audience,help determine who makes a statement and to whom that statement may properly be attributed,see ante,at,at least as far as ordinary english is concerned.
neither can the majority find support in any relevant precedent.the majority says that its rule follows from central bank of denver,first interstate bank of denver,in which the court held that rule private right of action does not include suits against aiders and abettors.ante,at.but central bank concerns a different matter.and it no more requires the majority rule than free air travel for small children requires free air travel for adults.
central bank is a case about secondary liability,liability attaching,not to an individual making a false statement,but to an individual helping someone else do so.central bank involved a bond issuer accused of having made materially false statements,which overstated the values of property that backed the bonds.central bank also involved a defendant that was a bank,serving as indenture trustee,which was supposed to check the bond issuer valuations.the plaintiffs claimed that the bank delayed its valuation checks and thereby helped the issuer make its false statements credible.the question before the court concerned the bank liability a secondary liability for aiding and abetting the bond issuer,who on the theory set forth was primarily liable.
the court made this clear.the question presented was whether private civil liability under b extends to those who do not engage in the manipulative or deceptive practice,but who aid and abet the violation.at emphasis added.the court wrote that aiding and abetting liability reaches persons who do not engage in the proscribed activities at all,but who give a degree of aid to those who do.at emphasis added.the court described civil law aiding and abetting as know ing that the other conduct constitutes a breach of duty and giv ing substantial assistance or encouragement to the other.at quoting restatement second of torts b emphasis added.and it reviewed a court of appeals decision that had defined the elements of aiding and abetting as a primary violation of b recklessness by the aider and abettor as to the existence of the primary violation and substantial assistance given to the primary violator by the aider and abettor.at emphasis added.faced with this question,the court answered that b and rule do not provide for this kind of aiding and abetting liability in private suits.
by way of contrast,the present case is about primary liability about individuals who allegedly themselves make materially false statements,not about those who help others to do so.the question is whether janus management is primarily liable for violating the act,not whether it simply helped others violate the act.the central bank defendant concededly did not make the false statements in question others did,while here the defendants allegedly did make those statements.and a rule the majority rule absolving those who allegedly did make false statements does not follow from a rule central bank rule absolving those who concededly did not do so.
the majority adds that to interpret the word make as including those without ultimate control over the content of a statement would substantially undermine central bank holding.ante,at.would it the court in central bank specifically wrote that its holding did 
not mean that secondary actors in the securities markets are always free from liability under the securities acts.any person or entity,including a lawyer,accountant,or bank,who employs a manipulative device or makes a material misstatement or omission on which a purchaser or seller of securities relies may be liable as a primary violator under,assuming all of the requirements for primary liability under rule are met.at some emphasis added.
thus,as far as central bank is concerned,depending upon the circumstances,board members,senior firm officials,officials tasked to develop a marketing document,large investors,or others taken together or separately all might make materially false statements subjecting themselves to primary liability.the majority rule does not protect,it extends,central bank holding of into new territory that central bank explicitly placed outside that holding.and by ignoring the language in which central bank did so,the majority rule itself undermines central bank.where is the legal support for the majority draw ing a clean line,ante,at,that so seriously conflicts with central bank indeed,where is the legal support for the majority suggestion that plaintiffs must show some kind of attribution of a statement to a defendant,ante,at,if it means plaintiffs must show,not only that the defendant ma d e the statement,but something more 
the majority also refers to stoneridge,but that case offers it no help.in stoneridge,firms that supplied electronic equipment to a cable television company agreed with the cable television company to enter into a series of fraudulent sales and purchases,for example,a sale at an unusually high price,thereby providing funds which the suppliers would use to buy advertising from the cable television company.these arrangements enabled the cable television company to fool its accountants and ultimately the public into believing that it had more revenue for example,advertising revenue than it really had.as part of the agreement,the companies exchanged letters and backdated contracts to conceal the fraud.investors subsequently sued the cable television company,some of its officers,its auditors,and the equipment suppliers,as well,claiming that all of them had engaged in a scheme to defraud securities purchasers.in respect to most of the defendants,investors identified allegedly materially false statements contained in the cable television company financial statements or similar docu ments.but in respect to the equipment suppliers,claimed that the relevant deceptive conduct was in the letters,backdated contracts,and related oral conversations about the scheme.the investors argued that the equipment suppliers,by participating in the transactions,violated b and rule.stoneridge,at.
the court held that the equipment suppliers could not be found liable for securities fraud in a private suit under b.but in doing so,it did not deny that the equipment suppliers had made the false statements contained in the letters,contracts,and conversations.see,at.rather,the court said the issue in the case was whether any deceptive statement or act respondents made was not actionable because it did not have the requisite proximate relation to the investors harm.ibid.emphasis added.and it held that these deceptive statements or actions could not provide a basis for liability because the investors could not prove sufficient reliance upon the particular false statements that the equipment suppliers had made.
the court pointed out that the equipment suppliers had no duty to disclose and their deceptive acts were not communicated to the public.at.and the court went on to say that as a result,the investors can not show reliance upon any of the equipment suppliers actions,except in an indirect chain that we find too remote for liability.ibid.the court concluded,
the equipment suppliers deceptive acts,which were not disclosed to the investing public,are too remote to satisfy the requirement of reliance.it was the cable company,not the equipment suppliers,that misled its auditor and filed fraudulent financial statements nothing the equipment suppliers did made it necessary or inevitable for the cable company to record the transactions as it did.at.
insofar as the equipment suppliers conduct was at issue,the fraudulent arrangement took place in the marketplace for goods and services,not in the investment sphere.at.
it is difficult for me to see how stoneridge support s the majority rule.ante,at.no one in stoneridge disputed the making of the relevant statements,the fraudulent contracts and the like.and no one in stoneridge contended that the equipment suppliers were,in fact,the makers of the cable company misstatements.rather,stoneridge was concerned with whether the equipment suppliers separate statements were sufficiently disclosed in the securities marketplace so as to be the basis for investor reliance.they were not.but this is a different inquiry than whether statements acknowledged to have been disclosed in the securities marketplace and ripe for reliance can be said to have been ma d e by one or another actor.how then does stoneridge support the majority new rule 
the majority adds that its rule is necessary to avoid a theory of liability similar to but broader in application than a liability,for e very person who,directly or indirectly,controls any person liable for violations of the securities laws.ante,at quoting a supp.but that is not so.this court has explained that the possibility of an express remedy under the securities laws does not preclude a claim under b.herman maclean huddleston.
more importantly,a person who is liable under a controls another person who is liable for a securities violation.morrison national australia bank,slip,at,liability under a is obviously derivative of liability under some other
