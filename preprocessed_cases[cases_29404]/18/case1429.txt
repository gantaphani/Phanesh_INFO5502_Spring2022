factual and procedural background 
the accident and the lawsuit 
christopher caso,a professional stuntman,suffered severe head injuries while performing a stunt for a television show called,a program produced in by touchstone television productions touchstone.following the accident,the casos sued,yohnka and hall,as well as rpi,myi and npi.caso asserted claims for negligence anne marie caso alleged loss of consortium 
according to the allegations in the complaint,the stunt caso performed required him to fall through a scored drywall ceiling onto a collapsible gurney and crash pad.yohnka,who was scheduled to be the stunt coordinator for the stunt,advised caso and touchstone a few days in advance that,due to an unforeseen scheduling conflict,he would be unavailable the date the stunt was to be performed.pursuant to yohnka recommendation,yohnka was replaced by hall.on the day of the stunt,hall and refused caso request to drill a hole in the ceiling and failed to ensure the center of the crash pad was properly placed.the crash pads,which had been provided by yohnka,were also poorly maintained.because of yohnka,hall and failure to prepare properly for the stunt,the casos alleged,caso fell to the ground at an improper angle,missing part of the crash pad and slamming his head on the ground.
the summary judgment motions 
yohnka,and hall moved for summary judgment on the ground each of them was a special employee of touchstone at the time the accident occurred and was acting in the scope of that special employment.thus,under labor code section,subdivision a workers compensation remedies were the exclusive remedies available for a injury to caso caused by the negligence of a coemployee the corporations filed their own motion for summary judgment contending none of them was vicariously liable for its individual employee negligence because each had relinquished full control over its respective employee to touchstone.
the motions were consolidated.in support of the consolidated motions,yohnka and hall each testified the use of corporations was a common practice in the entertainment industry.when an individual is hired by a producer to work on a production,the individual informs the producer he or she has a corporation then,contracts are entered into in which the corporation agrees to furnish the services of its owner and sole employee to the producer the producer agrees to pay the corporation for the services and the agrees to the arrangement.the corporation itself does not participate in any way in the production after the agreement is signed except to receive payment for its services.
each of the individual defendants and his corporation signed a television player agreement with touchstone.those agreements stated the corporate defendant was its employee as outlined in the attached employment agreement,subject to the applicable collective bargaining terms the employment agreements signed by,yohnka and hall also incorporated an inducement page in which,yohnka and hall acknowledged an employment relationship exists between touchstone and me,touchstone being my special employer under the agreement.the employment agreements also provided in the event of any injury the parties rights would be governed by,and their remedies limited to,those specified in the workers compensation laws.touchstone contract with rpi and was even more specific.it provided would obey all rules and regulations from time to time promulgated by touchstone it being understood that director employment hereunder will be subject to the direction and control of touchstone,and it being understood further that nothing in this agreement will restrain or prevent touchstone from terminating director employment hereunder at any time because of director failure to render services in accordance with the provisions of this agreement.the agreement also stated services would be performed at such places as touchstone may from time to time designate,and touchstone retained the right to cut,edit,add to,subtract from,arrange,rearrange,adapt,change,colorize,vary,transform,alter,shorten and revise the program in any manner and by any method which touchstone may in its sole discretion determine.
testified he understood he was an employee of touchstone during the production of the episode he reported directly to paul marks and ken topolsky,touchstone producers,and understood touchstone had the ultimate authority over his direction.yohnka and hall similarly testified they believed they were employees of touchstone,based upon the terms in their employment agreements and the fact that their employment relationship was subject to the terms of the collective bargaining agreements between touchstone and the screen actors guild.both yohnka and hall explained all the work they did for the episode,including planning and choreographing caso stunt,was subject to the detailed supervision and control of marks and.
each defendant proffered evidence that the corporations played no part in the production of the episode other than to receive payments from touchstone.yohnka also testified it was customary for the stunt coordinator to obtain equipment needed to perform the stunt and then seek reimbursement from the studio.in this case,yohnka provided the crash pads used in the stunt with the intent to bill touchstone,but did not do so after the accident.
the casos filed an opposition to the consolidated motions,arguing triable issues of fact existed as to whether,yohnka and hall were special employees of touchstone and whether their corporations had relinquished all control over them for purposes of the production in which caso was injured.they cited evidence,yohnka and hall remained on the payroll of their respective corporations while working on the project,as well as evidence that,although touchstone had the right to terminate any of them for any reason,it was still required to pay them their service compensation under the employment agreement.in addition,the casos emphasized,yohnka and hall were highly skilled at their jobs and had a great deal of discretion in how to perform their services for touchstone.
the trial court granted the consolidated summary judgment motions,finding,yohnka and hall were special employees of touchstone and had been acting in the scope of that employment at the time the accident occurred.accordingly,the action against each of them by their coemployee was precluded by section.the court also concluded the corporations did not retain any control over their employees during the period and thus could not be held vicariously liable for the acts of their employees.because anne marie caso claim for loss of consortium was based on her husband injury for which workers compensation was the exclusive remedy,her claim failed as well.
contention 
the casos contend summary judgment was improperly granted because triable issues of material fact exist concerning whether,yohnka and hall were special employees of touchstone and whether their respective corporations had relinquished full control over their employees to touchstone.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review the trial court grant of summary judgment de novo and decide independently whether the parties have met their respective burdens and whether facts not subject to triable dispute warrant judgment for the moving party as a matter of law.intel hamidi cal th,d,guz bechtel national,cal th,d,code civ,subd.c.
the trial court did not err in concluding as a matter of law the casos claims were barred by workers compensation exclusivity 
section defines an employee as every person in the service of an employer under any appointment or contract of hire or apprenticeship,express or implied,oral or written,whether lawfully or unlawfully employed apart from certain exceptions not relevant to this case,the exclusive remedy for injury or death of an employee against any other employee of the employer acting within the scope of his or her employment is benefits under the workers compensation laws,subd.a.this statutory restriction does not affect the employee rights to tort damages from individuals or entities with whom the employee has no employment relationship.marsh tilley steel cal d,marsh.for purposes of this summary judgment motion only,caso does not dispute he was an employee of touchstone.however,he argues triable issues of material fact exist as to whether,yohnka and hall were special employees of touchstone.if they were independent contractors rather than special employees,he correctly observes,his claim is not barred by workers compensation exclusivity.see,borello sons,department of industrial relations cal d,borello workers compensation exclusivity does not apply to independent contractors.
a.the doctrine of special employment 
when an employer lends an employee to another employer and relinquishes to the borrowing employer some right of control over the employee activities,a special employment relationship arises between the borrowing employer and the employee.marsh,supra,cal d at.once a special employment is identified,two consequences ensue the special employer liability for workers compensation coverage to the employee,and the employer and its other employees immunity from a common law tort action,the latter consequence flowing from the exclusivity of the compensation remedy embodied in labor code section.santa cruz poultry,superior court d.see also kowalski shell oil cal d,kowalski.
in determining whether a special employment relationship exists,the primary consideration is whether the special employer has t he right to control and direct the activities of the alleged employee or the manner and method in which the work is performed,whether exercised or not kowalski,supra,cal d at,see borello,supra,cal d at.the decision turns on whether the borrowing employer control over the employee and the work he is performing extends beyond mere suggestion of details or cooperation whether the employee is performing the special employer work whether there was an agreement,understanding,or meeting of the minds between the original and special employer whether the employee acquiesced in the new work situation whether the original employer terminated its relationship with the employee whether the special employer furnished the tools and place for performance whether the new employment was over a considerable length of time whether the borrowing employer had the right to fire the employee and whether the borrowing employer had the obligation to pay the employee.riley southwest marine,d.circumstances tending to negate the existence of a special employment relationship include situations in which t he employee is not paid by and can not be discharged by the borrower,a skilled worker with substantial control over operational details,not engaged in the borrower usual business,employed for only a brief period of time,and using tools and equipment furnished by the lending employer.marsh,supra,cal d at.
although the terms of a contract may specify that a special employer retains the right to control the details of an individual work or purports to establish an employment relationship,the terminology used in an agreement is not conclusive even in the absence of fraud or mistake.kowalski,supra,cal d at.there still must be evidence to support the inference to be drawn from the contract terms.ibid.
whether a special employment relationship exists generally is a question of fact.kowalski,supra,cal d at,where evidence,though not in conflict,permits conflicting inferences,existence of special employment relationship is question of fact.if neither the facts nor inferences are in conflict,however,the question is one of law that may be decided on summary judgment.wedeck unocal th,d wedeck johnson productions,d.w here the facts of employment are not disputed,the existence of a covered relationship is a question of law.
b.the undisputed facts demonstrate,yohnka and hall were special employees of touchstone 
yohnka and hall satisfied their burden on summary judgment to demonstrate they were special employees of touchstone.not only did the employment agreements between touchstone and each of the individual defendants expressly identify,yohnka and hall as special employees,subject to both the benefits and limitations of the workers compensation laws,but also the evidence supported touchstone ultimate authority to control and direct each of the individual defendants activities on the set testified,consistent with the terms of his contract,that touchstone retained control over the entire production,including the ability to create,edit and even transform the production as it saw fit.reported to touchstone producers yohnka and hall reported to fallon.each of them was performing work that was the regular business of touchstone at a studio supplied by touchstone,and touchstone either supplied or had the ultimate authority to supply tools and instrumentalities used in connection with the production.although yohnka provided the crash pads,he acted as any other third party contracting with touchstone to supply instrumentalities needed for the production.
although,yohnka and hall received their paychecks from their respective corporations rather than from touchstone,the undisputed evidence established the relationships with their corporations were administrative only,existing solely for payment purposes.see wedeck,supra,th at,fn,d payment by the general employer is not particularly enlightening in determining whether a special employment relationship exists citation,particularly in the labor brokerage context where the general employer often handles administrative details,including payroll.moreover,although the length of their respective employments was relatively was employed for one month at a time yohnka and hall for just a few was also standard practice in the entertainment industry to employ the person solely for the length of time his or her services were needed for the specific production.
the casos do not meaningfully dispute any of the facts underlying the conclusion,yohnka and hall were special employees of touchstone.rather,they facts also support the conflicting inference touchstone did not have the right to direct,yohnka or hall performance of their jobs.they also insist the trial court erred in placing any reliance on the employment contracts with touchstone identifying,yohnka and hall as special employees.see borello,supra,cal d at,t he label placed by the parties on their relationship is not dispositive and subterfuges are not countenanced kowalski,supra,cal d at,contract is not conclusive evidence of the existence of the right to control.
the casos observe,yohnka and hall were engaged in highly skilled activities and were responsible for choreographing the stunt,raising the inference they,not touchstone,were in control of the details of the stunt.see kowalski,supra,cal d at,paramount consideration for special employment appears to be whether the alleged special employer exercises control over the details of an employee work.relying on von beltz stuntman,d.von beltz,a case they characterize as on all fours with the instant matter,they argue the record before this court reasonably supports the inference the individual defendants were independent contractors,thus precluding summary judgment.
in von beltz,supra,d,a stuntwoman was seriously injured when the stunt car in which she was riding collided with another car involved in a scene for the movie cannonball run.the stuntwoman von beltz sued the director needham and his corporation stuntman,for negligence.needham claimed he was employed by the same production company,cannonball productions,that employed von beltz and thus was a coemployee,limiting von beltz recovery to workers compensation benefits.stuntman,the company,asserted needham was not its agent,precluding its liability to von beltz on a respondeat superior theory.the evidence established,however,tha
