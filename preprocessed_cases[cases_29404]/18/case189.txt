section b of the securities exchange act of imposes strict liability on insiders whose purchases and sales of securities result in profits.see b.insiders include directors,officers,and beneficial owners of more than of a company registered securities namely,persons who exercise voting or investment control over,and hold a pecuniary interest in,more than of a company registered securities.see id.a and b a a id d a.
this appeal concerns whether a beneficial owner acquisition of securities directly from an issuer at the issuer request and with the board approval should be exempt from the definition of a purchase under section b,on the theory that such a transaction lacks the potential for speculative abuse that section b was designed to curb.see kern cnty.land occidental petroleum.we hold that such transactions are covered by section b.we further hold that the defendants appellants,who are limited partnerships,are beneficial owners for the purposes of section b liability,notwithstanding their delegation of voting and investment control over their securities portfolios to their general partners agents.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court 
background 
defendants appellants,special situations fund iii qp,qp and special situations private equity fund,pe together,the funds are delaware limited partnerships.the funds invest in publicly traded companies through pipe private investment in public equity transactions privately negotiated acquisitions of positions in publicly traded companies.at all relevant times,each fund owned over of the shares of nominal defendant wpcs international incorporated wpcs,a wireless infrastructure engineering and special communications systems company whose shares trade on the nasdaq.
the funds limited partnership agreements provide that the management,operation and control of the business of the fund shall be vested completely and exclusively in a general partner who shall have the right,power and authority,on behalf of the fund and in its name,to exercise all rights,powers and authority of a general partner under the laws of delaware.appendix at.the partnership agreements further empower each general partner to invest or reinvest the limited partnership assets,and to appoint agents to perform the general partner duties.pe general partner is a limited liability company of which austin marxe and david greenhouse are members.qp general partner is a limited partnership of which marxe and greenhouse are limited partners.through these arrangements,marxe and greenhouse hold the exclusive power to make all investment and voting decisions on behalf of the general partners and,in turn,on behalf of the funds.
beginning in december and continuing until the end of january,the funds sold wpcs shares in their portfolios on the open market at prices between and per share.these sales constituted the first leg of the trades for which the funds now face disgorgement liability under section b.
in march,wpcs announced that a change in applicable accounting rules required it to restate certain financial statements.wpcs share price fell precipitously on the announcement,compromising wpcs plans for a secondary public offering intended to raise capital for a critical strategic acquisition.at that point,wpcs approached marxe and greenhouse to gauge their interest in a pipe transaction.marxe and greenhouse had already closed one pipe transaction with wpcs in november for million.they responded favorably and,on april,the funds,together with other funds managed by marxe and greenhouse,bought additional shares directly from wpcs at per share a discount of approximately from the market price.wpcs board of directors approved the transaction.wpcs used the new capital to make the acquisition,and the company share price began to improve.
plaintiff appellee maureen huppe,a wpcs shareholder,subsequently filed this derivative action alleging that the funds,as ten percent holders,were liable to wpcs under section b for their short swing profits namely,the difference between the prices at which the funds sold wpcs shares from december to january,and the lower prices of the april purchases.matching these sales and purchases,huppe sought disgorgement of approximately.
at the close of discovery,both parties moved for summary judgment.the funds argued that,because they had delegated voting and investment power over their holdings of wpcs to marxe and greenhouse,only they and not the funds could be held liable as beneficial owners for purposes of section b.the funds further argued that,even if they were beneficial owners,the pipe transaction should be exempt from the definition of a purchase under section b.because the transaction was and approved by the board,they argued,it differed from the paradigmatic abusive sequence that section b was enacted to prevent.the united states district court for the southern district of new york swain,rejected both arguments,denying the funds motion and granting huppe motion.see huppe ex rel.wpcs int l special situations fund iii qp,d.after concluding that the funds relationship with marxe and greenhouse did not alter the funds insider status,the district court held that,because the funds april purchase was neither hostile nor involuntary,the potential for abuse that section b was designed to curb existed,and consequently the funds were liable for their profits.id.at.this appeal followed.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see miller wolpoff abramson,cir.
discussion 
the funds argue that the district court erred in its determinations that the pipe transaction was a purchase of wpcs shares and that the funds were beneficial owners under section b.section b provides that officers,directors,and principal shareholders of a company are liable for profits realized from the purchase and sale or sale and purchase of its shares within a period.b the section was designed to prevent these insiders from engaging in speculative transactions on the basis of information not available to others.see,at.the act defines purchases and sales broadly.see a the terms buy and purchase each include any contract to buy,purchase,or otherwise acquire.id.a the terms sale and sell each include any contract to sell or otherwise dispose of.as we have observed,it is quite apparent that section b may be applied not only to routine cash purchases and sales,but also to acquisitions and dispositions of equity securities in transactions such as conversions,options,stock warrants,and reclassifications.see blau lamb,cir.the funds acquisition of stock from wpcs in april clearly falls within the literal terms of section b.steel partners ii.bell,cir explaining that w here the transaction at issue does not plainly fall within the literal terms of the statute,t he judicial tendency,especially in this circuit,has been to interpret section b in ways that are most consistent with the legislative purpose second alteration in original quotation marks omitted.
nevertheless,the funds argue that we should exempt the april transaction from section b coverage because it was the product of direct negotiations between wpcs and the funds and approved by wpcs board of directors thus,they argue,even if one assumes the funds had access to inside information about wpcs,it was impossible for the funds to gain any speculative advantage from such information because wpcs and its board which approved the transaction had access to the same information.
section b has been described as a blunt instrument,magma power dow chem,cir,a flat rule taking the profits out of a class of transactions in which the possibility of abuse was believed to be intolerably great,reliance emerson.significantly,no showing of actual misuse of inside information or of unlawful intent is necessary to compel disgorgement.magma power,at.in limited circumstances,we scrutinize borderline or unorthodox transactions pragmatic ally to determine whether they serve as a vehicle for the evil which congress sought to prevent the realization of profits based upon access to inside information.kern,at see steel partners ii,at heublein,cinema,cir am.standard,crane,cir blau,at.however,t
