this case illustrates the problems the government encounters when it deviates from the procedural and substantive rules governing criminal forfeiture by obtaining the defendants promises to convey certain interests in property to the united states,in lieu of a forfeiture trial and sentence,and the defendants renege.
on december,a southern district of florida grand jury returned a count against fred de la mata,manuel calas,oscar castilla,enrique fernandez the defendants,real estate partners,and hialeah properties,the corporate defendants.the indictment charged the defendants with,among other crimes,racketeering,c,racketeering conspiracy,d,money laundering,and bank fraud.the corporate defendants,which were wholly owned by the defendants,were charged with racketeering and racketeering conspiracy 
the indictment also contained a forfeiture count in which the government sought forfeiture,under a and a of the defendants interests in various pieces of property securities,including the defendants interest in the shares of the corporate defendants real estate and bank accounts held in the names of companies not the corporate defendants that were wholly owned by the defendants the government also sought forfeiture of the corporate defendants interests in two bank accounts held in their names.immediately after the indictment was returned,the district court granted the government motion for a restraining order pursuant to d a enjoining the defendants and corporate defendants from using,transferring,alienating,or otherwise encumbering their interests in the property listed in the forfeiture count.
the case against both the defendants and corporate defendants,which were not represented by counsel,proceeded to trial on october.two and a half months later,on december,the jury found the defendants and corporate defendants guilty on nearly all counts of the indictment.united states de la mata,cir.
after receiving the jury verdicts,the court declared a recess until january,when the trial on the forfeiture count would begin.during the interim,the defendants and the government settled the forfeiture issues in exchange for the government release of the defendants interests in some of the property listed in the forfeiture count,the defendants agreed to the forfeiture of their interests in the remaining property,including their interests in the shares of the corporate defendants and the bank accounts held in the corporate defendants names.the corporate defendants and the government reached no agreement on forfeiture.
the government and the defendants informed the district court of the settlements they had reached on january,just before the forfeiture phrase of the trial was to begin,and asked the court to approve the agreements.they represented that the settlements were mutually beneficial to the defendants and the government.the settlements would benefit the defendants because the government would be acquiring less than what it sought in the forfeiture count they would benefit the government because a trial on the forfeiture count,which the prosecutor estimated could take over a year,would be avoided 
the district court approval of the settlements depended on whether the defendants had entered into them freely and voluntarily.the court therefore examined the defendants and their attorneys as it would in entertaining a plea of guilty under federal rule of criminal procedure.after hearing their responses,the court found that the defendants had voluntarily agreed to the terms of the settlements.on january,it entered an order approving the parties agreements 
under a and a,if a convicted defendant interest in property is to be forfeited to the government,the district court must provide for the forfeiture as part of the defendant sentence in this case,the court did not include the forfeiture it had approved on january,as part of its pronouncement of the defendants sentences,which the court imposed from the bench on april.the court memorialized the defendants sentences in judgments of conviction entered on april.these judgments also contained no mention of forfeiture.
the district court sentenced the corporate defendants on may,placing them on probation for three years.the judgments of conviction in their cases,which were entered the same day,contained no mention of forfeiture.
the defendants filed timely appeals of their convictions while their appeals were pending,the defendants separately moved the district court for a new trial on the ground that the judge who presided at their trial and sentencing should have recused.the defendants appeals were held in abeyance pending resolution of the motions.a district judge,sitting by designation granted the motions,and a panel of this court affirmed.united states cerceda,cir.on rehearing en banc,the defendants judgments of conviction and sentence were reinstated,united states cerceda,cir,and on january,the defendants appeals went forward.
the defendants convictions were affirmed,except for two bank fraud counts de la mata,at.the mandate issued on december,thus bringing the criminal cases against the defendants to an end 
while the defendants appeals were ongoing,the government,on may,published notice of the defendants purported forfeitures in the miami review.in june and july,ocean bank,republic national bank of miami,de la mata wife,lourdes de la mata,and the de la matas four children petitioned the district court pursuant to l and n to hold ancillary hearings to adjudicate the validity of their claims to the property interests the defendants had supposedly forfeited to the government under the district court order of january.these ancillary hearings were never held,however,because the government settled their claims.the last settlement,involving ocean bank claim,occurred on december.
to recapitulate,this was the status of the property interests the defendants had agreed to forfeit to the united states in january.their interests had not actually been forfeited to the united states by operation of law because the district court had not ordered their forfeiture as part of the defendants sentences in conformance with the requirements of a and a.and unless the defendants had voluntarily conveyed such interests to the united states,which they had not,they still retained title to the interests.this retention was subject,of course,to the terms of the agreements they had entered into with the government in january.
to ensure against the possibility that,notwithstanding those agreements,the defendants might seize the interests they had agreed to example,by withdrawing funds from the bank accounts held in the names of various companies which they government made sure that the restraining order the court entered following the return of the indictment remained in place.presumably,the restraining order could remain in force indefinitely,but that would not give the government what it needed to take title to some of the properties,such as securities,held in the defendants names,and bank accounts held in the names of companies which they owned.what the government needed to obtain title to the interests subject to the restraining order were amendments to the defendants sentences explicitly forfeiting such interests to the united states.the government attempted to fulfill that need on december.
on friday,december,the government filed,and served on the defendants by mail a motion for a final order of forfeiture.as the authority for its motion,the government cited and,subsections a of which require that the forfeiture of a defendant interest in property be made part of the defendant sentence,and asked the court to order forfeited to the united states of the interests listed in the january agreements the motion included the two bank accounts held in the corporate defendants names,although it did not cover the defendants interests in the corporate defendants stock.the district court granted the government motion the following tuesday,december,entering a final order of forfeiture that forfeited the interests precisely as the motion had requested.
on december,de la mata and his wife moved the district court to set aside the december order.they argued that they had an unspecified legal claim to two of the amounts of monies listed in the final order of forfeiture and had intended to oppose the government motion but had been denied an opportunity to be heard in violation of local rule c,which required the court to give them ten days to respond to the government motion before issuing a ruling their motion did not cite the rule of procedure under which they were proceeding 
the government responded to the de la matas motion on december.it characterized the motion as a motion for reconsideration timely filed pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure e and thereby represented to the district court that the proceeding before it constituted a civil case.the response labeled the motion groundless,as it failed to specify the legal basis for the de la matas claim to the property,and overbroad,as it sought to set aside the court entire order,but only referred to two of the property interests the order listed.
the district court summarily denied the de la matas motion for reconsideration on january.in doing so,the court apparently agreed with the government that the case was a civil matter,involving a claim by the government to enforce the settlement agreements the court had approved on january.de la mata,alone,filed a notice of appeal on january,challenging the district court orders of december and january 
on october,this court disposed of de la mata appeal in an unpublished decision.united states de la mata de la mata ii,at,wl cir.before turning to de la mata argument for reversal,the court questioned whether it had jurisdiction over the appeal and,if so,whether de la mata had standing to prosecute it.id.at.it answered the jurisdictional question in the affirmative by treating the controversy as a civil case id.in so doing,the court noted that the government,in responding to the de la matas december motion,had treated the case as a civil proceeding by considering de la mata motion as having been filed pursuant to rule e id.at.the court answered the standing question in the affirmative as well id.at.the court,additionally,recognized that the controversy at hand concerned the stipulation the government and de la mata had submitted to the district court prior to the commencement of forfeiture proceedings,which stated as to the items specified in the indictment,what de la mata would and would not forfeit to the government,id.at,and the government effort to enforce the stipulation despite the fact that the district court had not ordered forfeiture as part of de la mata sentence.id.at.
having determined that all parties were properly before it,the court therefore proceeded to the issue de la mata had raised whether the district court had abused its discretion by ruling on the government motion without affording him ten days to respond to the motion,as required by local rule c.id.at.the court readily concluded that an abuse had occurred and therefore vacated the district court final order of forfeiture and remanded the case for further proceedings.id.at.
on october,after the case had been remanded,de la mata filed a response to the government december,motion for a final order of forfeiture.citing our decisions in united states pease,cir,and united states gilbert,cir,he argued that because the district court had not ordered forfeiture as part of his sentences on their imposition on april,no forfeiture had occurred moreover,once he was sentenced and thereafter appealed his convictions,the court no longer had subject matter jurisdiction under to amend his sentences,as the government was requesting.a consequence of this lack of jurisdiction,he suggested,was that the court had no lawful basis for continuing to hold his interests under its restraining order he therefore sought as part of his response to the government december motion the return of his interests under the aegis of federal rule of criminal procedure g the other defendants filed similar responses,adopting de la mata arguments and asking for the return of their interests.the corporate defendants,who,having never been served with process,had not been parties to the proceedings up to this point,appeared with counsel and responded without opposition from the government to the government december motion.as part of their response,they asked for the return of their bank accounts,as designated in the government motion,pursuant to rule g.
the government filed a response in opposition to all of these responses on november,and,on december,the defendants and corporate defendants filed a joint reply.on september,the district court issued an order granting the government december,motion for a final order of forfeiture in its order,the court first addressed the question of which of the defendant parties were before the court.it held that since de la mata was the only defendant who had appealed from its december,order granting the government december motion,only de la mata would be heard.the remaining defendants,by not appealing that order,had waived their right to be heard in opposition to the government motion.having said this,the court rejected as meritless de la mata opposition to the government december motion.it made no mention of de la mata request for rule g relief,presumably because its decision to grant the government motion rendered such request moot.the defendants and corporate defendants now appeal the district court september,rulings.
the defendants and corporate defendants appellants unless otherwise indicated present the same arguments they made to the district court in opposing the government motion for a final order of forfeiture and requesting rule g relief.the government,in reply,concedes that forfeiture was never ordered as part of appellants sentences,but argues,nonetheless,that the district court ruling should be affirmed.the government first contends that only de la mata is properly before this court,on the ground that the remainder of the appellants waived their right to challenge the court september,final order of forfeiture because they had not joined de la mata in appealing the december,final order of forfeiture the government then argues that de la mata,or,should we disagree with its initial contention,all of the appellants,lacked standing to oppose the government december,motion for a final order of and that considerations of equity required that the district court deny the appellants rule g motion.
as a threshold matter,we must determine whether all appellants are properly before this court.on remand following our decision in de la mata ii,the district court limited the controversy to the dispute between the government and de la mata,since he was the only defendant to have appealed from the court december,final order of forfeiture.in doing so,the court apparently overlooked the scope of de la mata ii mandate.that mandate vacat ed the final order of forfeiture and remand ed the case for further proceedings.de la mata ii,at cir,thus,the only pleading pending on remand was the government december,motion,to which all of the appellants except the corporate defendants,who had yet to appear in the case could respond.see judgments where a judgment is vacated or set aside by a valid order or judgment,it is entirely destroyed and the rights of the parties are left as though no such judgment had ever been entered.consequently,and contrary to the government position,all of the appellants including the corporate defendants were properly before the district court and,now,are properly before us.we accordingly proceed to a disposition of these appeals,whether to disturb,in whole or in part,the district court final order of forfeiture.
we first consider appellants principal the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to grant the government december,motion for a final order of forfeiture.the argument assumes that in granting the motion,the court was amending appellants sentences,to include forfeiture,and therefore was exercising its jurisdiction under despite the absence of a pending criminal case.if the district court was purporting to,and did,amend the defendants sentences the law provided them with the means to challenge the court action they could appeal the court judgments under a they had ten days,until january,to do so absent the filing of a notice of appeal within that period,the district court judgments would become final 
de la mata did appeal,but his notice of appeal was not filed until january.the appeal was untimely if he was appealing a district court order amending his sentences,an amended judgment in a criminal case the appeal was timely,however,if de la mata was appealing the district court final disposition of a civil case.the latter step is what he was taking,in the view of de la mata ii court.the court exercised jurisdiction over the appeal as civil after observing that the case involved a stipulation providing for the disposal of the items listed in the indictment forfeiture count and the government attempt to have the stipulation enforced.de la mata ii,at cir.
in sum,appellants argument that the district court lacked subject matter the government motion for a final order of forfeiture sought relief in a criminal case via amended.what the district court had before it was a civil case,instituted by a motion that was the functional equivalent of a complaint in a civil case,a complaint seeking the specific enforcement of forfeiture agreements reached between the government and the a criminal not made part of the defendants sentences.the district court had subject matter jurisdiction to proceed under 
the defendants do not dispute that they entered into these agreements freely and voluntarily,as they represented to the court when it questioned them on january,nor have they argued that the law somehow precluded the government and a criminal defendant from providing for forfeiture by contract in advance of the trial on forfeiture in the absence of any argument from the defendants on this point,we see no error in the government reaching this,albeit somewhat unconventional,arrangement with the defendants.see united states bank of new york,cir noting that defendant had settled civil forfeiture suit by executing consent decree united states white,wl,at,holding that defendant lacked standing to enjoin government from seizing property he forfeited pursuant to a consent judgment,entered in lieu of normal criminal forfeiture proceedings united states howle,cir a plea agreement is,in essence,a contract between the government and a criminal defendant.absent a legal impediment to the settlement of forfeiture issues in the manner in which the settlements occurred in this case,we have no reason to vacate the district court final order of forfeiture.we therefore affirm the court final order of forfeiture as it applies to the defendants.
the corporate defendants were not parties to the agreements the government reached with the defendants on january,and the court approved three days later,on january.accordingly,the government december,motion,which sought,in essence,the specific enforcement of promises the defendants had made in those agreements did not,and could not,have involved the corporate defendants the corporate defendants,then,still have possession of their interests in the their bank accounts,subject,of course to the district court extant restraining order,and thus we do not affirm the final order of forfeiture to the extent that it provides for the transfer of the corporate defendants interests.
as noted above,the district court september,order,which reinstated the december,final order of forfeiture,did not mention appellants applications for the return of interests under rule g.our affirmance of the reinstated final order of forfeiture renders moot the applications of the defendants,but it does not render moot the rule g applications of the corporate defendants.rule g rulings are based on a balancing of the equities and are reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard.united states machado,cir.balancing the equities is a matter for the district court in the first instance.we therefore vacate the portion of the september order to the extent that it applies to the corporate defendants rule g applications and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings.
affirmed,in part vacated and remanded,in part.

the parties settled the forfeiture issues by entering into agreements,which they referred to as stipulations.de la mata and fernandez entered into separate agreements with the government calas and castilla reached a joint agreement with the government.
the prosecutor told the court that a conservative estimate of the total amount forfeited under the agreements was.without the agreements,the prosecutor stated,the total value of the forfeiture would approach approximately.
