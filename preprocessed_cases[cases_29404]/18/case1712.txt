in this appeal,we consider the propriety of the court of chancery decision to grant summary judgment in a derivative action subsequently pursued by a successor corporate entity against its former directors.the complaint,originally asserted as a stockholders derivative action,challenged the level of compensation that directors had been receiving as well as directors decision for the corporation to acquire a minority interest,and later,of a company owned by the corporation chairman.following for summary judgment,the court of chancery granted judgment to the directors on the excessive compensation claims and the duty of loyalty claims,but denied summary judgment as to two duty of care claims in which there were disputes of fact.because the corporation charter contains an exculpation provision,the plaintiff chose to forego prosecution of the duty of care claims in order to convert the court of chancery dismissal order into an appealable final judgment.
upon a full review of an enlarged record,we conclude that the unsettled nature of that record does not permit resolution through summary judgment.accordingly,we reverse the decision of the court of chancery granting summary judgment and remand this case for further proceedings to resolve factual differences apparent in the record.
telxon is a delaware corporation that develops and markets portable computers for retailers and wholesalers in various industries.between and the time period relevant to this action,the telxon board of directors consisted of raymond meyo,dan wipff,robert meyerson,raj reddy,norton rose and robert goodman.meyerson was also the ceo of telxon from to.during the late and early,meyerson continued to serve as the chairman of the board,and provided consulting services to telxon.the parties continue to dispute whether meyerson was an executive at this time,or served as a chairman.
in,meyo succeeded meyerson as ceo and continued as telxon ceo until he resigned in october.director wipff was telxon chief financial officer from december through january.beginning in october,wipff also served as its president and chief operating officer.director goodman was the senior partner of goodman weiss miller llp,a cleveland,ohio law firm that provided legal services to telxon and,in the past,had also provided services both to meyerson personally and to another company that meyerson owned.director reddy was the dean of the school of computer science at carnegie mellon university and a well recognized leader in the field of computer science.director rose was the president and of norton rose,a cleveland,ohio consulting firm.
telxon began experiencing operational problems in,and the board decided that meyerson should be engaged to assist meyo in managing the corporation.to that end,telxon entered into a consulting agreement with meyerson company,accipiter corporation accipiter.under the consulting agreement,accipiter through meyerson agreed to perform technical and marketing services necessary for the planning and development of new products.the agreement further provided that accipiter work product,created pursuant to the contract,would become the property of telxon,and accipiter could not render similar consulting services to any direct competitors of telxon in the ptc market.on march,telxon entered into a new consulting agreement with accipiter,under which accipiter agreed to provide management consulting,corporate and financial analysis,and marketing development services,as requested by telxon.specifically,accipiter would provide telxon with eight hour days per year of consulting services,the majority to be provided by meyerson.in return,accipiter would receive annually,plus for general administrative and overhead costs,plus reimbursement for its travel and other expenses.
in august of,meyerson began to explore the possibility of developing a product known as pen based computers pbcs.the parties continue to dispute whether meyerson offered this opportunity to the telxon board.the court of chancery determined that meyerson did offer pbc technology to the telxon board,and the board decided that telxon should not develop its own pbc product directly,because of the expense involved,but should allow meyerson to develop it while retaining a stake in meyerson work.at oral argument before this court,directors asserted that there are board minutes reflecting the consideration,and rejection,by the board of a proposal by meyerson for telxon to develop pbcs.because the record developed in the court of chancery did not include such minutes,and in view of telxon strenuous argument that the minutes reflect no such consideration by the board,directors were required to supplement the record on appeal to sustain their contentions.directors have been unable to produce any such documentation,but continue to allege that meyo considered and rejected the opportunity for telxon to develop pbcs.
despite the absence of supporting minutes,it is undisputed that in august or september of,meyerson who at that point was consulting for telxon chose to pursue development of pbc technology on his own and formed teletransaction for that purpose.at some point the timing of which is disputed,the telxon board decided that it should acquire some interest in teletransaction.the court of chancery found that,at a february,board meeting,the board approved a plan for telxon to invest in teletransaction in incremental steps.first,telxon would acquire a interest in teletransaction.second,upon the successful completion of a pbc prototype,telxon would acquire an additional interest for million,increasing its ownership interest to.third,after teletransaction had pbc products that were ready for sale,telxon would purchase an additional stock interest for million,bringing its total ownership interest in teletransaction to.although telxon agrees that the board did seek to acquire teletransaction,it disputes the reasoning and timing attributed to the board by the court of chancery.the parties agree,however,that meyerson abstained from any discussions of the teletransaction acquisition.
in march,telxon began its acquisition of teletransaction by purchasing of teletransaction stock for million,the bulk of which was distributed directly to meyerson and members of his family.again,it is unclear whether this transaction was part of a larger scheme to acquire teletransaction incrementally.six months later,however,on october,meyo suddenly resigned as ceo.the court of chancery found that the telxon board then concluded that the emergency caused by meyo resignation made it advisable for telxon to acquire of teletransaction,rather than in three stages,so that meyerson would agree to resume his post as ceo of telxon.accordingly,on october,the board authorized telxon to acquire an additional of teletransaction for million as a down payment and a part of the process of negotiation for the acquisition of all,or substantially all of the stock of teletransaction,and as part of the inducement to meyerson to accept the role as chief executive officer of telxon 
in november,during negotiations between meyerson and telxon over the terms of meyerson return to telxon,meyerson demanded an additional million above the initially agreed price for telxon purchase of of teletransaction.meyerson told the board that the additional million would compensate him for i his sale of the residual equity in teletransaction he had originally intended to retain,and ii his commitment to become ceo of telxon,rather than a consultant.after discussing meyerson proposal and receiving a fairness opinion from an independent financial advisor,unterberg harris,the board,without meyerson present,approved that proposal subject to certain conditions.the total consideration for the purchase of teletransaction,as consummated in,would be million.
this action followed soon thereafter.the complaint challenged the acquisition of teletransaction both at the point that the initial interest was acquired and when the purchase was consummated.telxon argues that since it already owned all rights to the pbc developed by meyerson under the consulting agreement,the decision to later purchase teletransaction
