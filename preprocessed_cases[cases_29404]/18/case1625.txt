background 
state farm mutual automobile insurance company insures more than million vehicles throughout all states and canada,including million in texas.incorporated in illinois under illinois law as a mutual insurance company,state farm has no.instead,it is owned by its policyholders,who elect its board of directors.under the company,the board is vested with authority to manage and control the company affairs.the authorize the board to issue refunds or dividends to policyholders upon such terms and conditions and in such amounts or percentages as the board,in its judgment,deems proper,just and equitable,subject to governing laws and regulations.under texas department of insurance regulations,state farm can not pay a dividend in texas without the department approval.see.admin.code.dep t of,dividends procedure.
state farm,like all insurance companies,maintains a surplus or policyholder protection fund representing the difference between its assets,including invested premiums,and its liabilities,including loss reserves.the fund is intended to assure that sufficient resources are available to cover policyholder claims in the event of catastrophic occurrences like earthquakes or hurricanes,or the sudden depletion of assets due to economic downturns.this fund provides the source of any dividends paid to policyholders.state farm does not factor the payment of dividends into the calculus when it sets rates.instead,dividends may be paid,the company may choose to lower its premium rates,when the company losses and its financial condition prove to be better than expected.when the board decides to declare a dividend,it allocates the payment among the various states policy holders based upon its loss experience in each particular state.so,for example,when state farm declared a dividend in,texas policyholders received percent of the total national dividend,though only percent of its insured vehicles are in texas.
every state farm policy provides 
the policyholder is a member of the company and shall participate,to the extent and upon the conditions fixed and determined by the board of directors in accordance with the provisions of law,in the distribution of dividends so fixed and determined.
in,state farm policyholders alicia lopez,adan munoz,juan llanes,diana moreno,and albert alaniz sued state farm and its directors asserting a right to refunds dividends under this provision plaintiffs third amended petition alleged that state farm balance sheet reflected a surplus as regards policyholders of,an increase of more than billion over the previous year.they further alleged that the board of directors had abused its discretion in failing to declare adequate dividends and that,given such a surplus,the company and its directors had breached a contractual obligation to pay sufficient dividends.in addition,plaintiffs asserted claims for fraud,malicious suppression of dividends,breach of fiduciary duty,and misrepresentation.they seek payment of a reasonable dividend,or a return or credit from the savings and gains of the corporation.
plaintiffs requested that the trial court certify a class under texas rule of civil procedure b a,b,and they initially sought to certify a nationwide class of all state farm policyholders from up until the time of trial,but at the certification hearing limited their request to a class of texas policyholders.the trial court granted plaintiffs certification motion.the order,in its entirety,provides 
plaintiff second amended motion for class certification came on for hearing on august.having considered the papers filed in support of,and in opposition to the second amended motion for class certification,the evidence presented,and the argument of counsel,the court finds that said motion is.
the court therefore orders as follows 
plaintiffs second amended motion for class certification is granted and 
the certified class is defined as all persons and entities who are or had been policyholders of vehicle casualty policies issued by state farm mutual automobile insurance company in the state of texas during the years,and and up to the time of trial.
state farm and director wendy gramm filed an interlocutory appeal of the certification order under section a of the texas civil practice and remedies code after briefs were filed in the court of appeals,we decided southwestern refining bernal,holding that it was improper for a trial court to certify a class without performing a rigorous analysis of prerequisites and without indicating how the claims will likely be tried.the court of appeals affirmed the certification order.at.on rehearing,the court of appeals held that state farm had waived any argument that bernal required a trial plan for certification.the court also held that bernal does not require a trial plan in every certification order,particularly here,when predominance and superiority are not challenged.id.we initially dismissed state farm petition for review for want of jurisdiction,but granted the petition on rehearing to reconsider our jurisdiction over this appeal 
ii.jurisdiction 
jurisdiction over interlocutory appeals is generally final in the courts of appeals.gov t code b jurisdiction in this court is proper,however,if the court of appeals holds differently from a prior decision of another court of appeals or of the supreme court.id.c,a.state farm contends that we have jurisdiction over this appeal because the court of appeals decision conflicts with our decision in bernal.
our conflicts jurisdiction arises when,applying the same standards,two decisions can not stand together that is,one decision would operate to overrule the other had it been issued by the same court compaq computer lapray.it is not necessary that one court expressly disavow the other court decision for conflicts jurisdiction to exist.henry schein,stromboe.instead,a conflict may arise when one court correctly state s the law but misapplie s it.see also snyder communications,magana.
the court of appeals determined that bernal does not require a trial plan in every class certification order.at.upon initial review,we dismissed state farm petition for review for want of jurisdiction,concluding that the court of appeals statement regarding a trial plan was mere dicta because the court had first determined that state farm waived the issue by not timely raising it.at.in its motion for rehearing,state farm claims we failed to apply the standard for distinguishing between alternative holdings and dicta that we applied in texas natural resource conservation commission white.on further consideration,we are persuaded that state farm is correct.
in tnrcc white,the respondent argued that the alleged conflicting case,schaefer city of san antonio,antonio,no writ,would not support conflicts jurisdiction because it rested upon alternative holdings,which rendered the conflicting portion merely dicta.at.we rejected this argument and held that the standard for conflicts jurisdiction was met 
the schaefer court made two holdings the city was not operating or using the water pump and the pump was not equipment.id.at.certainly,the court could have relied on either determination to reach its ultimate conclusion that sovereign immunity had not been waived.but it relied on both.
id.at.as in tnrcc white,the court of appeals here relied on both waiver w e hold that appellants have waived this issue and its conclusion that a trial plan was not necessary w e hold that a trial plan is not necessary in this case to affirm the trial co
