this case concerns the proper disposition in bankruptcy court of proceeds from the sale of property,the ownership of which was subject to dispute and in litigation in a pending adversary proceeding.while the debtor held legal title to the property,its partner claimed that the property was owned by the partnership and hence not the estate.the outcome of the ownership dispute,yet unresolved,would determine whether the indebtedness secured by liens on the property would be satisfied out of the proceeds from the sale or out of the debtor assets.
the bankruptcy appellate panel bap held that,since the sale had been consummated and was not subject to attack,the nonbankrupt partner was entitled to disgorgement of the sale proceeds sufficient to protect the partnership claimed ownership interest in the property and his potential interest in the partnership.we have jurisdiction pursuant to d.we affirm,but for reasons other than those of the bap.
factual and procedural background 
the debtor is rodeo canon development corporation rodeo,which holds record title to a commercial property at brighton way in beverly hills,california the property.in,it formed the brighton way partnership brighton with beverly rodeo development corporation,whose president is fred yassian together beverly.each partner held a interest.while rodeo held legal title to the property,beverly claimed that,because partnership funds were used to purchase it,the brighton partnership is the equitable owner of the property and beverly has a interest.adversary proceedings remain pending in the bankruptcy court to resolve this ownership dispute.
beginning in,members of the warnick family and a family trust together the warnicks extended a series of loans aggregating to rodeo the loans were secured by deeds of trust on the property.in july,the warnicks sought to foreclose their trust deeds,prompting rodeo bankruptcy filing.beverly and the chapter trustee disputed the validity of two of the trust deeds and a portion of a third.beverly contended that these obligations were incurred without the consent of the partnership and hence could not be enforced against the property.that issue also remains pending in the adversary proceeding.
in december,after conversion of the bankruptcy to chapter,the trustee moved pursuant to b and f for authorization to sell the property free and clear of liens,agreeing that the warnicks lien interests as well as beverly interest in the property would attach to the sale proceeds pending resolution of the disputes.beverly objected on the ground that the property was not property of the estate as required by b.
to settle the dispute over the enforceability of the trust deeds and clear the way for a sale,the trustee and the warnicks entered into a settlement agreement on january.under the agreement,the property would be sold for,the warnicks would accept in settlement of their secured claims and convert a portion of their secured claim to unsecured,and other creditors secured liens totaling would be paid the disbursements would leave the estate with in sale proceeds.following a hearing,the bankruptcy court approved the settlement agreement and entered its order for the sale free and clear of liens and claims.
beverly moved for reconsideration,representing that it did not object to the sale free and clear of liens and claims to the extent that it authorized payments of costs and liens not in dispute,so long as the payments would not implicitly resolve or render moot the litigation in which it claimed that the partnership owned the property and that the challenged liens could not be enforced against the property.it sought an order directing the trustee to withhold payments to the warnicks in excess of pending resolution of the adversary proceedings over ownership and the enforceability of the liens.the court denied the motion and the appeal to the bap followed.
the bap affirmed the order insofar as it approved the settlement.it reversed the sale order insofar as it provided for the disbursement of more than of the sale proceeds to the warnicks,holding that it was error to permit the trustee to sell free and clear of any other entity interest so long as such interest remained in dispute without prohibiting or conditioning such sale as is necessary to provide adequate protection of such interest.e.the warnicks argued that the settlement agreement provided adequate protection because as a partner beverly was,at most,entitled to half of the available for distribution to the partners after payment of other creditors secured liens,and the in net proceeds remaining in the estate would suffice to satisfy that entitlement.the bap disagreed,however,pointing out that because partnership property rights and interpartner adjustments remained unresolved,there was no guarantee that beverly interest would be only of the sale proceeds.the bankruptcy court had therefore erred in authorizing the trustee to distribute the entire amount of before the ownership issue had been resolved.the bap instructed the bankruptcy court to order the warnicks to disgorge disputed amount of sale the trustee pending conclusion of the adversary proceedings.

ii.beverly right to maintain claims on behalf of the partnership 
the warnicks contend that beverly and yassian are not entitled to maintain this action because they are not real parties in interest.the pivotal issue in the litigation is whether the property was property of the bankruptcy estate.the warnicks argue that because the dispute is over the partnership claim to ownership of the property,only the partnership is the proper party to assert it.
we do not need to resolve this issue because the warnicks,having failed to raise the real party in interest objection in the bankruptcy court,have waived it.federal rule of bankruptcy procedure incorporates federal rule of civil procedure a,which mandates that e very action shall be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest.we have held that an objection to a party on real party in interest grounds is waived if not raised in a timely manner.see united states ex rel.reed callahan,cir refusing to address a real party in interest defense raised for the first time on appeal.other circuits have taken the same position.see ensley cody,cir rule a objection waived when not raised until case reached court of appeals richardson edwards,objection waived when not raised until trial underway gogolin stelter karn auto,cir defense waived when made at the close of the plaintiff evidence hefley jones,cir defense waived when made sixteen days before trial chicago northwestern transp,cir defense waived when not raised during trial court proceedings.
the real party in interest objection is not founded on article iii standing principles,but is a prudential rule intended to ensure that the party bringing the action is the party entitled to make the claim.whelan abell,conceptually the problem of stockholders rights to bring an action alleging breach of a fiduciary duty owed to the corporation is not an article iii one.see also ensley,at holding that so long as the plaintiff satisfies constitutional standing requirements,the rule a limitation is prudential rather than constitutional.
rule a makes clear that the objection must be timely raised 
rule a provides that no action shall be dismissed on grounds until a reasonable time has been allowed after objection for ratification of commencement of the action by the real party in interest this implies that the defense may not be raised at any time,for the real party must have the opportunity to step into the unreal party shoes and should not be prejudiced by undue delay.
