this is an appeal from a bankruptcy court order which was certified to this court pursuant to d.appellant challenges the bankruptcy court holding that scotia pacific company llc scopac was not a single asset real estate sare debtor under of the bankruptcy code and was therefore not subject to expedited reorganization procedures set forth in d of the code.we affirm.
scopac is a limited liability company which was formed as a special purpose subsidiary of pacific lumber company palco.palco transferred to scopac approximately acres of timberlands in humboldt county in northern california as well as the contractual right to harvest timber on an additional acres owned by its affiliates.scopac business is to derive maximum revenue from the timber grown on these lands scopac timber while maintaining sustainable forests.scopac plans,manages,and implements timber harvesting plans relating to the scopac timber.it also conducts the sale of the standing timber and then and manages future timber stands.additionally,scopac attends to the varying harvesting requirements and environmental prescriptions of each of the nine watersheds on the scopac land however,palco harvests the timber from the timberland.
scopac currently has over sixty employees,the majority of whom are scientists employed within the forestry program.the bankruptcy court order contains detailed findings of fact regarding scopac operations and the activities of its employees.the following is a summary description of the specialized work done by the scopac employees.scopac performs timberlands analysis and inventory through its own employees and outside contractors.it also ensures compliance with various laws and rules including its habitat conservation plan,the california forest practice rules,and the clean water and acts.scopac also develops a timber harvesting plan,submits it for approval,and implements the plan.this includes road planning,design,and engineering.scopac also supervises harvesting by palco personnel to ensure compliance with the timber harvesting plan and applicable regulations.additionally,scopac prepares and submits permit applications including those regarding water quality,erosion control plan development and implementation,and a streambed alteration agreement.further,scopac is involved in individual programs in a variety of specialized fields such as watershed analysis and other scientific studies as well as litigation support.after harvesting by palco,scopac performs site preparation,replanting,vegetation management efforts,and streambed remediation.
scopac borrowed funds in the capital markets from investors in the amount of million to fund its business.the timber notes scopac executed are senior secured obligations of scopac and are secured by the land and the income generated through the harvesting and sale of timber.
scopac and several affiliated companies filed a chapter bankruptcy petition to avoid foreclosure proceedings by the indenture trustee of the timber notes.the ad hoc group of timber noteholders noteholders moved the bankruptcy court to expedite the bankruptcy proceedings pursuant to d of the bankruptcy code arguing that scopac is a sare debtor.the bankruptcy court denied the noteholders motion.
the bankruptcy court made extensive factual findings and concluded that scopac does not meet the definition of sare set forth in of the bankruptcy code.the court concluded that because scopac operates substantial business on the property,it is not a sare 
scopac is also engaged in a substantial business other than operating the real property.this court agrees with judge rhoades interpretation in in re club golf partners,of the definition according to an criterion that inquires into the nature of revenue generation on and by the property,that is,whether the revenue is the product of entrepreneurial,active labor and thus is not single asset real is simply and passively received as investment income by the debtor as the property thus is single asset real estate real property that,for the generation of revenues,requires the active,employment of workers and managers other than or additional to the principals of the debtor,and that would not generate substantial revenue without such labor and efforts,should not be regarded as single asset real estate.
in re scotia.quoting in re club golf partners,wl,at.thus,the bankruptcy court concluded scopac is clearly engaged in an active economic enterprise on its property.id.at 
the noteholders appealed the order to the district court and moved the bankruptcy court to certify the appeal to this court pursuant to d.the bankruptcy court initially denied certification of the appeal but three days later entered an order vacating the order denying certification and recommended that the district court certify the appeal.the district court then entered an order certifying the appeal to this court.in response to the district court certification order,we accepted this appeal.
two issues are presented in this appeal.first,whether this court should exercise appellate jurisdiction in this case notwithstanding the fact that the case was certified to this court by the district court while it was still technically pending before the bankruptcy court second,whether scopac is a sare.we consider these issues below.
this court applies the same standard in reviewing decisions of a bankruptcy court as does the district court.nesco acceptance jay in re jay,cir.a bankruptcy court findings of fact are reviewed for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.id.this court may affirm if there are any grounds in the record to support the judgment,even if those grounds were not relied upon by the courts below.bonneville power admin.mirant in re mirant,cir internal quotations omitted.
scopac argues first that this court should not entertain this appeal because the case was not certified to this court in accordance with the applicable rules.more particularly,scopac contends that because the appeal was pending in the bankruptcy court when the district court certified it,the wrong court certified it for appeal,and consequently we should not consider the appeal.
the certification of bankruptcy cases for appeal from the bankruptcy court to the court of appeals under is a new procedure added by the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act bapcpa in the procedure to be followed in such certification is supplied by interim federal rule of bankruptcy procedure f which has been adopted by the southern district of texas which provides that a bankruptcy court shall make the certification while the matter is pending in the bankruptcy court.fed.f interim it is uncontested that when the district court certified this case for appeal it had not yet been docketed in the district court and therefore was still pending in the bankruptcy court according to interim rule f.thus,it is clear that the proper court to certify the appeal from the bankruptcy court judgment was the bankruptcy court rather than the district court.
because the procedure for certification of judgments in bankruptcy cases is a rule and not governed by statute,certification by the district court in this case did not deprive this court of jurisdiction.see bowles russell,d.the supreme court in bowles,in considering the effect of a violation of procedural rules which were adopted by a court rather than by statute,stated on the other hand,we have treated the time limit for criminal cases differently,stating that it may be waived because t he procedural rules adopted by the court for the orderly transaction of its business are not jurisdictional and can be relaxed by the court in the exercise of its discretion id.at.see also kontrick ryan,d bankruptcy rules adopted by the court for the orderly transaction of its business are not jurisdictional.
scopac does not argue that the certification of this case by the district court rather than the bankruptcy court deprives us of jurisdiction,and we agree with noteholders that this procedural glitch does not deprive us of jurisdiction.the only question is whether we should consider the merits of this appeal despite the procedural mistake.
the record makes it clear in this case that both the bankruptcy court and the district court sought to certify the bankruptcy court judgment to this court for appeal.after the bankruptcy court judgment was appealed to the district court,the bankruptcy court recommended certification to the district court.the fact that the bankruptcy court and the district court overlooked the fact that the case was still technically pending in the bankruptcy court under interim bankruptcy rule f apparently prompted the district court to certify the judgment for appeal.under these circumstances,where both courts wish to certify the case to this court for appeal,this error is technical in nature,does not affect the substantial rights of the parties,and prompts us to exercise our discretion in favor of proceeding to the merits of this appeal.
turning to the merits,the noteholders argue that the bankruptcy court erred in concluding that scopac was not a sare.in determining whether scopac is a sare,we turn first to the statutory definition in of the bankruptcy code 
the term single asset real estate means real property constituting a single property or project,other than residential real property with fewer than residential units,which generates substantially all of the gross income of a debtor who is not a family farmer and on which no substantial business is being conducted by a debtor other than the business of operating the real property and activities incidental.
three requirements emerge from this definition which must all be met for a debtor to be considered a sare debtor the debtor must have real property constituting a single property or project other than residential real property with fewer than residential units,which generates substantially all of the gross income of the debtor,and on which no substantial business is conducted other than the business of operating the real property and activities incidental thereto.if a debtor fails to meet any prong,it is not a sare.
the noteholders argue that scopac should be considered a sare because it meets all three prongs of of the bankruptcy code.scopac argues that it does not qualify as a sare under any of the prongs.we find it unnecessary to consider whether scopac qualifies under the first two prongs because we conclude that it clearly does not qualify under the third conducts substantial business other than operation of the real estate.
the term sare was added to the bankruptcy code in.see in re kkemko.courts that have considered whether a debtor is a sare under the amendment to the bankruptcy code have examined various types of businesses in the context of whether they conduct substantial business other than operating the real property.the most frequently cited case for the discussion of this issue is in re kkemko.id.the bankruptcy court in that case considered whether a debtor that operated a marina was a sare.id.at.the court explained that the business of the marina is something more than simply rental of moorings.it stores,repairs,and winterizes boats.id.at.the marina also provides showers as well as activities for those using the marina,and it sells gas and other amenities.id.the court held that these diverse activities supported the conclusion that the debtor marina did not come within the definition of sare.id.
in a recent case,in re club golf partners,the eastern district of texas held that a golf club which conducted substantial business other than operating the real property was not a sare.wl,at.the court explained that in the years between and,bankruptcy courts took a practical view of the concept of single asset real estate in their interpretations of,including within its ambit only those debtors who have no revenue from their property except the passive collection of rent from tenants and excluding from its reach those entities that undertake and pursue various sorts of active economic,commercial,and business activities on the property.id.at further 
in order to be single asset real estate,the revenues received by the owner must be passive in nature the owner must not be conducting any active business,other than merely operating the real property and activities incidental thereto.under the prior jurisprudence,those passive types of activities are the mere receipt of rent and truly incidental activities such as arranging for maintenance or perhaps some marketing activity,or mowing the grass and waiting for the market to turn.
id.at internal quotations omitted.the court explained that the debtor golf club was not a sare because in addition to owning real estate,it also operated a variety of activities.id.at.these included the debtor employment of employees,the sale of memberships,the charging of fees for access to the golf course and other amenities,and the sale of merchandise,food,and beverages in its pro shop and restaurant.id.
because its business activities are variegated and multiple and are dependent on the entrepreneurial efforts and ongoing hard work of its principals and its other employees,and because it does not simply lease its property to tenants as the owner of true single asset real estate such as an apartment house does,the debtor golf course does not fall within the scope of the definition of single asset real estate 
id.internal quotations omitted.
in in re prairie hills golf ski club,a bankruptcy court held that the debtor,an operator of a golf and ski club,was not a sare because it conducted substantial business on the property.at.the court explained that the debtor does not simply hold a passive investment and does not merely own buildings and raw land.rather,it is involved in other significant activities.id.these activities included building and maintaining roads on the land,developing the golf and ski areas,and operating the farmland on the property.id.see also commerce bank and trust perry hollow golf club,in re perry hollow,cm,wl,at r unning a golf course is a substantial business other than the operation of the real property itself which includes the operation of a pro shop,a food and beverage operation,rental of carts,collection of fees,and maintenance of a labor force.in re cge shattuck,wl,at business of a golf course including pro shop,golf cart rentals,and other services constituted substantial business other than operation of the real property in re larry goodwin golf,at golf course which rents golf carts,has a pool,provides concessions,and owns adjacent land for sale conducts substantial business other than operating the real estate.
the ninth circuit bankruptcy appellate panel in in re cbj development held that a hotel was not a sare because it conducted substantial business other than operation of the real estate.at.the court concluded that the operation of a employment of a substantial number of people to clean rooms,sheets,and towels and to provide substantially more day to day activity than does the operation of an apartment complex.accordingly,the operation of the hotel is sufficiently active in nature to constitute a business other than the mere operation of property.id.at.see also in re whispering pines,at a full service hotel with rooms,cleaning and laundry services,and other guest amenities is not a sare because it conducts substantial business other than operating the real estate but see in re poplar,assuming that debtor who owned,operated,and collected rents from a comfort inn is a sare.
the noteholders contend that this court should find that scopac is not a sare based on a recent bankruptcy court case from new jersey in re kara homes.in that case,the debtor owned real estate and was engaged in the construction and sale of homes and condominiums.id.at.the court considered the activities of the debtor to determine whether the business operations were sufficiently active such that the debtor should not be deemed a sare.id.at.the debtor business included the acquisition of land,the design of homes and condominiums for that land,arranging for the construction of homes,the marketing and sale of homes,and finally,the building of a common space,amenities,and roadways.id.at.the court explained that a business would not be a sare if a reasonable and prudent business
