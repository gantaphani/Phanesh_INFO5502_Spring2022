factual and procedural background 
healthmarkets is a holding company incorporated in the state of delaware,with its principal place of business in the state of texas.healthmarkets,llc,is its subsidiary.is a subsidiary of healthmarkets,llc 
harry berman filed a complaint against healthmarkets,and others in april.he alleged that he was the victim of a fraudulent health insurance sales scheme perpetrated by the defendants and that he was wrongfully denied insurance benefits.he alleged that he purchased insurance from an agent working for cornerstone america cornerstone,that cornerstone was a division of healthmarkets,and that the policy was issued by.he also alleged that healthmarkets and were alter egos.he alleged counts against healthmarkets,and others for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,breach of the insurance contract,false advertising,negligent misrepresentation,and intentional misrepresentation.
healthmarkets moved to quash service of summons based on lack of personal jurisdiction.it filed a declaration describing the relationships noted above and also stating,among other things,that healthmarkets had no office and no employees in california,neither owned nor leased property in this state,was not registered to do business in this state,was not involved in the marketing or administration of insurance issued to california residents,and did not participate in handling berman claims.the declaration also stated that cornerstone was not a division of healthmarkets.
berman opposed the motion to quash,arguing that healthmarkets conducted business in california through as its alter ego.he also argued that cornerstone was a division of healthmarkets and that he had purchased insurance through a cornerstone agent.he submitted a report entitled market conduct examination of the healthmarkets.insurance companies market report an annual report and a form purportedly filed with the united states securities and exchange commission in by a company known as uici and pages purportedly printed from internet sites of uici,cornerstone,and.he argued that statements in those materials showed that healthmarkets owned and controlled cornerstone and had trained the insurance agent who sold him an insurance policy.he also requested a continuance of the hearing to allow him to conduct discovery on jurisdictional issues if the court was inclined to grant the motion to quash.berman filed an amended complaint in october,alleging the same five counts as the original complaint.
healthmarkets argued in reply that the term uici as used in the securities filings referred to the parent and its subsidiaries,that the internet sites and market report used the term healthmarkets in the same manner,and that those documents were not evidence of healthmarkets contacts with california.healthmarkets also argued that berman had failed to present any evidence to support his alter ego allegations and failed to support his request for discovery.healthmarkets filed evidentiary objections to the documents submitted by berman based on lack of authentication,relevance,and hearsay.
the trial court stated in its minute order that the declaration filed by healthmarkets showed that healthmarkets was a holding company,that it had no contacts with california,and that it was not involved in the insurance transaction that is the subject of the complaint.the court stated that berman had failed to provide any evidence beyond that presented by the defendant,and that the documents submitted by berman merely showed the same relationships described in the moving papers.the court nonetheless found a basis for specific personal jurisdiction.
citing bresler stavros d.bresler,the trial court stated that a nonresident defendant may be subject to personal jurisdiction if it intentionally engage s in local activities that the forum state treats as exceptional and subject to special regulation.the court stated further,california has a strong interest in providing its residents with effective redress against insurers.citation.
the trial court cited dvi,superior court th,d dvi for the proposition that a parent company ownership of a subsidiary,without more,does not subject the parent to personal jurisdiction based on the subsidiary forum contacts.it stated that berman had failed to present evidence demonstrating any of the three circumstances described in dvi as sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction over a parent company based on a subsidiary forum contacts.the trial court described those three circumstances as alter ego,representative services,and subsidiary is mere agent.it stated,however,that berman was entitled to conduct discovery on those issues.it stated further that the circumstances justifying the exercise of personal jurisdiction over a parent company were not limited to those three circumstances.the trial court concluded as a matter of law that,in light of california strong policy regarding insurance,an insurer contacts with the state of california may be attributed to the insurer parent company for purposes of specific personal jurisdiction.the court therefore denied the motion to quash,and overruled all of healthmarkets evidentiary objections.
healthmarkets petitioned this court for an extraordinary writ.we determined that the matter deserved immediate appellate review and issued an order to show cause.
contentions 
healthmarkets contends its mere ownership of an insurance company subsidiary does not justify the exercise of specific personal jurisdiction over healthmarkets in california based on its subsidiary contacts in this state,and the overruling of its evidentiary objections was error.
discussion 
constitutional limits on the exercise of personal jurisdiction 
a california court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant to the extent allowed under the state and federal constitutions.code civ.the exercise of personal jurisdiction is constitutionally permissible only if the defendant has sufficient minimum contacts with the forum state so that the exercise of jurisdiction does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.citations.internat.shoe washington.internat.shoe accord,pavlovich superior court cal th,d,pavlovich.in other words,the defendant contacts with the forum state must be such that the defendant had fair warning that its activities might subject it to personal jurisdiction in the state.burger king rudzewicz,d burger king accord,volkswagen woodson,d.in judging minimum contacts,a court properly focuses on the relationship among the defendant,the forum,and the litigation.citations.calder jones,d.each defendant contacts with the forum state must be assessed individually.id.at.
a defendant that has substantial,continuous,and systematic contacts with the forum state is subject to general jurisdiction in the state,meaning jurisdiction on any cause of action.perkins benguet mining.see vons companies,seabest foods,cal th,d,vons.absent such extensive contacts,a defendant may be subject to specific jurisdiction,meaning jurisdiction in an action arising out of or related to the defendant contacts with the forum state.helicopteros nacionales de colombia hall,fn,d vons,supra,cal th at,d.specific jurisdiction depends on the quality and nature of the defendant forum contacts in relation to the particular cause of action alleged.cornelison chaney cal d.
a nonresident defendant is subject to specific personal jurisdiction only if the defendant purposefully availed itself of the benefits of conducting activities in the forum state the controversy arises out of or is related to the defendant forum contacts and the exercise of jurisdiction would be fair and reasonable.burger king,supra,at.pavlovich,supra,cal th at,d.these guidelines are not susceptible of mechanical application,and the jurisdictional rules are not.rather,a court must weigh the facts in each case to determine whether the defendant contacts with the forum state are sufficient.burger king,supra,at,fn.at,fn.kulko california superior court,d vons companies,seabest foods,supra,cal th at,d.bridgestone superior court th,d.
standard of review 
a plaintiff opposing a motion to quash service of process for lack of personal jurisdiction has the initial burden to demonstrate facts establishing a basis for personal jurisdiction.snowney harrah entertainment,cal th,d,snowney.if the plaintiff satisfies that burden,the burden shifts to the defendant to show that the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable.ibid.if there is no conflict in the evidence,the question whether a defendant contacts with california are sufficient to justify the exercise of personal jurisdiction in this state is a question of law that we review de novo.ibid.if there is a conflict in the evidence underlying that determination,we review the trial court express or implied factual findings under the substantial evidence standard.vons,supra,cal th at,d.
the trial court here based its ruling not on a finding that healthmarkets purposely directed its activities at california,but on its conclusion as a matter of law that the company ownership,through a subsidiary,of an insurer that conducted activities in this state justified the exercise of specific personal jurisdiction over healthmarkets as the parent company.we independently review that legal conclusion.snowney,supra,cal th at,d.
the mere ownership of a subsidiary does not constitute purposeful availment 
the purposeful availment inquiry focuses on the defendant intentionality.citation.this prong is only satisfied when the defendant purposefully and voluntarily directs his activities toward the forum so that he should expect,by virtue of the benefit he receives,to be subject to the court jurisdiction based on his contacts with the forum.citation.pavlovich,supra,cal th at,d.
p urposeful availment occurs where a nonresident defendant purposefully direct s its activities at residents of the forum burger king,supra,at,purposefully derive s benefit from its activities in the forum id.at,create s a substantial connection with the forum id.at,deliberately has engaged in significant activities within the forum id.at,or has created continuing obligations between itself and residents of the forum id.at.by limiting the scope of a forum jurisdiction in this manner,the purposeful availment requirement ensures that a defendant will not be haled into a jurisdiction solely as a result of random,fortuitous,or attenuated contacts id.at.instead,the defendant will only be subject to personal jurisdiction if it has clear notice that it is subject to suit there,and can act to alleviate the risk of burdensome litigation by procuring insurance,passing the expected costs on to customers,or,if the risks are too great,severing its connection with the state.pavlovich,at,d,quoting volkswagen,supra,at.snowney,supra,cal th at,d.
the mere ownership of a subsidiary does not subject a nonresident parent company to specific personal jurisdiction based on the subsidiary forum contacts.ownership of a subsidiary alone does not constitute purposeful availment.rather,purposeful availment requires some manner of deliberately directing the subsidiary activities in,or having a substantial connection with,the forum state.burger king stated in dicta,we have previously noted that when commercial activities are carried on in behalf of an party those activities may sometimes be ascribed to the party,international shoe washington,at least where he is a primary participant t in the enterprise and has acted purposefully in directing those activities,calder jones,at.burger king,supra,at,fn.similarly,empire steel superior court cal d,held that specific personal jurisdiction over a foreign parent corporation was established based on the parent manipulation and control of its california subsidiary to the detriment of the subsidiary creditors.citing these authorities,we recently stated,activities that are undertaken on behalf of a defendant may be attributed to that defendant for purposes of personal jurisdiction if the defendant purposefully directed those activities toward the forum state.citations.anglo irish bank,plc superior court th,d anglo irish.
consistent with these authorities and the requirements for purposeful availment explained above,and particularly the focus on the defendant intentionality pavlovich,supra,cal th at,d,we conclude as follows a parent company purposefully avails itself of forum benefits through the activities of its subsidiary,as required to justify the exercise of specific personal jurisdiction,if and only if the parent deliberately directs the subsidiary activities in,or having a substantial connection with,the forum state.only in those circumstances should the parent company reasonably anticipate being haled into court volkswagen,supra,at.in the forum state based on the activities of its subsidiary.
california courts have held that the mere ownership of a subsidiary does not subject a nonresident parent company to general personal jurisdiction based on the subsidiary forum contacts.sonora diamond superior court th,d dvi,supra,th at,d.several courts have held or suggested,however,that principles of alter ego and agency,including the representative services doctrine,can justify the exercise of general personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant,sonora diamond,supra,at,d dvi,supra,at,d.moreover,some courts have applied the same reasoning to justify the exercise of specific personal jurisdiction.virtualmagic asia,th,d magnecomp athene d.northern natural gas superior court d.citing these authorities and some of the scholarly commentary regarding the inexact fit between rules of law designed to establish liability for the acts of another and an assessment of the defendant contacts with the forum for purposes of establishing general or specific personal jurisdiction anglo irish,supra,th at,fn,d,we concluded in anglo irish r eliance on state substantive law of agency and alter ego to determine the constitutional limits of specific personal jurisdiction is unnecessary and is an imprecise substitute for the appropriate jurisdictional question.the proper jurisdictional question is not whether the defendant can be liable for the acts of another person or entity under state substantive law,but whether the defendant has purposefully directed its activities at the forum state by causing a separate person or entity to engage in forum contacts.id.at,d.we reaffirm that conclusion here and conclude that purposeful availment by a parent company through the acts of its subsidiary must be evaluated under the rule that we have stated.
no special regulation or interest justifies the exercise of specific personal jurisdiction in these circumstances 
the trial court relied on bresler,supra,d,in ruling that california strong interest in providing residents of this state with redress against insurers justified the exercise of specific personal jurisdiction over healthmarkets.bresler involved an action for breach of contract and other counts arising from the purchase and sale of stock in a medical group organized as a california professional corporation.one of the defendant purchasers,george stavros,was an arizona resident.although he was licensed to practice medicine in california,stavros declared that he did not intend to practice medicine in this state or to take part in the corporation management,and that he purchased the stock solely for investment
