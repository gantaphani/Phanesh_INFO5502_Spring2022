introduction 
robert whitmore,chapter trustee for the estate of defendant grover joseph harvey mccoy,prosecutes this appeal from a judgment confirming an arbitration award against mccoy and codefendant mccoy creative contractors and interiors,the judgment found mccoy and the corporation liable to plaintiffs brian and katherine bosworth for damages of,and attorney fees and costs of.
we hold that absent a completion date set by agreement,code of civil procedure section gives the trial court the authority,on petition by a party to the arbitration,to set a date by which the arbitration proceeding must be concluded although the better practice is to set the date when the case is first ordered to arbitration,the court has discretion to entertain a petition to set a completion date while the arbitration is in progress.to the extent the decisions in equities group,superior court th,d,and blake ecker th,d blake,overruled on another ground in le francois goel cal th,footnote,d,suggest that the trial court can not set an arbitration deadline,we respectfully disagree.neither decision discusses the authority granted by section.
in the instant case,although the trial court properly set a completion date,we conclude that the court abused its discretion when it later removed the arbitrator who had been handling the case for almost two years.on the record presented,the arbitrator reluctance to promise completion by the court deadline did not constitute a fail ure to act under section so as to justify his removal.therefore,the court appointment of a successor arbitrator was unauthorized,and the successor arbitrator award was void.consequently,we reverse the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
the contract and its arbitration clause 
in may,plaintiffs brian and katherine bosworth entered a contract with defendant mccoy creative contractors and interiors,to construct a home in malibu,california,for approximately.as president,defendant joseph mccoy signed the agreement on behalf of the corporation.the contract contained an arbitration clause that provided in relevant part any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this contract,or the breach thereof,shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with construction industry arbitration rules of the american arbitration association,and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator s may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
in december,the parties retained builders disbursements,bdi to distribute the proceeds from the bosworths million loan as the work progressed.the parties contract with bdi also contained an arbitration clause requiring any disputes to be arbitrated in accordance with the construction industry arbitration rules of the american arbitration association aaa.
the lawsuit 
in november,the bosworths filed suit against mccoy and his corporation for,inter alia,breach of contract and fraud,and alleged that mccoy was the alter ego of the corporation.the bosworths claimed that the unfinished home had not been constructed in accord with the plans and specifications and that mccoy had breached the contract by accepting disbursement of funds before the work was completed.the bosworths further alleged that mccoy had failed to refund money to the bosworths that they had paid him before the funding of their construction loan.
in january,mccoy and the corporation filed a petition to compel arbitration and stay the lawsuit.and.at a hearing conducted on february,the parties stipulated to submit all substantive claims to binding arbitration except for the alter ego issue pursuant to the arbitration agreement,and also stipulated to a stay of the bosworths action.mccoy reserved the right to seek to compel arbitration of the alter ego claim.based on the stipulation,the court placed the petition to compel arbitration off calendar as moot.
commencement of arbitration proceedings 
on march,the bosworths submitted an arbitration demand to the aaa.they later amended their demand to add bdi as a party to the arbitration,claiming that bdi had negligently disbursed the loan proceeds to mccoy.in the meantime,on may,the aaa appointed alan dymond as arbitrator.on june,dymond conducted a telephonic preliminary hearing in which he directed the bosworths to complete a list of construction defects and damages as soon as possible.
approximately three months thereafter,on september,dymond held a hearing at which he issued several orders.he directed the bosworths to provide their final defect list,damage estimate,and expert reports by october.he also ordered them to permit mccoy to inspect the home.he directed mccoy to serve demands on any additional parties by october,and to produce various documents.
despite the october,deadline,the bosworths did not provide the required defect list,damage estimate,and expert reports until february.by april,mccoy and the corporation filed counterclaims against various subcontractors allegedly responsible for the bosworths claimed defects in construction.
approximately one month later may,dymond scheduled the arbitration to begin on september.however,although the subcontractors were required to appear on or before june,the aaa failed to properly notify them.consequently,on august,dymond vacated the september hearing date,and continued the arbitration to november,to allow proper notice to the subcontractors.the bosworths,mccoy and the corporation consented to the continuance.
on november,dymond cancelled the hearing because mccoy,the corporation,and several of its subcontractors did not pay their arbitration fees.by the first week of january,however,the fees were paid.
the bosworths seek judicial intervention to set a completion date 
on january,the bosworths moved ex parte for an order requiring the case to be arbitrated or tried before march.in their motion,the bosworths alleged that their lender had already twice extended the due date on their construction loan,and the delay in completing the arbitration jeopardized their ability to finance construction.the loan due date was now march,and if the bosworths did not obtain permanent financing by that date,the lender would consider the loan in default and commence foreclosure proceedings.the bosworths alleged they could not secure normal home financing because the house is not complete and a certificate of occupancy can not be issued.accordingly,they claimed they would lose their very unique and personally designed home unless proceedings were completed by march,
at the january hearing on the bosworths ex parte motion,the court announced that it would set the arbitration completion date as march.counsel for mccoy and the corporation noted that his clients were interested as well in a speedy resolution.he explained,however,that there had been a delay in arranging mccoy inspection of the home.brian bosworth insisted on being present,although an injunction was in effect barring him being within feet of mccoy,and bosworth had recently been found in contempt for violating that injunction.the parties then agreed to arrange a site inspection,and the trial court reaffirmed an arbitration completion date of march.
the bosworths seek appointment of a new arbitrator 
on january,two weeks after the setting of a completion date,the bosworths moved ex parte for appointment of a new arbitrator.according to the bosworths,the arbitration would take at least working days.the bosworths further claimed that in telephonic conferences dymond had stated that he was unable to represent that the arbitration would be completed by march.instead,he stated he could only make a good faith effort to complete as much as possible by march.the bosworths therefore sought appointment of one of two arbitrators they had contacted,each of whom could complete the arbitration hearing by march.one was george calkins,a member of the aaa panel of construction arbitrators.the other was retired judge david perez,who was employed by the judicial arbitration and mediation services jams.the bosworths expressed no preference for either arbitrator,and left the choice to the defense or the court.
at the january hearing on the ex parte motion,counsel for mccoy and the corporation argued that the parties contract required the bosworths to approach the aaa and use aaa rules to select a successor arbitrator counsel stated that mccoy and the corporation would not agree to either calkins or judge perez,but instead want ed the arbitrator chosen pursuant to aaa rules and under their contract.
the court continued the hearing to february,to permit the bosworths to obtain a written statement from dymond concerning his ability to complete the arbitration.dymond submitted a statement explaining that to the best of my ability and matters within my control,the evidentiary hearings involving the bosworths,mccoy,the corporation,and the subcontractors will be complete by march.however,if bdi participated,then dymond could make no representations that he could complete the arbitration by the march deadline.
at the hearing on february,the bosworths asserted that bdi participation in the arbitration was necessary.opposing the bosworths attempt to remove dymond,mccoy and the corporation argued that under,supra,th,d,the trial court had no authority to set a deadline to complete the arbitration.they therefore asked the court to vacate its january order setting an arbitration completion date of march.they also reiterated their earlier argument that the bosworths were required to comply with aaa rules in seeking relief.
the court declined to vacate the arbitration completion date.it also found that dymond inability to guarantee completion by the deadline constituted a failure to act under section,justifying the appointment of a new arbitrator.the court overruled the objection by mccoy and the corporation that the arbitration agreement required selection of an arbitrator from the aaa pursuant to aaa rules.invoking the appointment procedure of section,the court directed each side to present a list of five candidates within five days.
filed on february,the bosworths list resubmitted calkins and judge perez,and added one other choice,thomas craigo.mccoy and the corporation declined to submit any names.instead,they raised a continuing objection to the trial court appointment of a new arbitrator 
the court appoints judge perez 
on february,the trial court selected judge perez to arbitrate the cause,and one week later judge perez scheduled a hearing for february.on february,counsel for mccoy and the corporation wrote to jams objecting to judge perez appointment as arbitrator,and declining to participate in the proceeding.counsel explained that the arbitration agreement required the bosworths and the court to follow the aaa process of selecting and replacing arbitrators,and that judge perez and jams had no standing or authority to proceed in this matter.
on february,without the appearance of mccoy and the corporation,judge perez scheduled commencement of arbitration for march.mccoy and the corporation filed a notice to disqualify judge perez under section,subdivisions a and b.however,the trial court granted the bosworths request to strike the disqualification notice,concluding that mccoy and the corporation were guilty of laches 
judge perez conducts the arbitration 
the arbitration hearing began on march.neither mccoy nor the corporation participated.bdi also declined to participate.the bosworths called ten witnesses including six experts,and submitted documentary evidence.on march,judge perez filed his award in favor of the bosworths,finding mccoy and the corporation liable for in damages and in attorney fees,expert costs and other litigation expenses.he also found bdi jointly and severally liable for.
judicial confirmation of the arbitration award 
the bosworths petitioned the superior court to confirm the arbitration award.mccoy and the corporation petitioned to vacate it.
because bdi had filed a section challenge to the original judge,the matter was transferred to a successor judge.the court confirmed the arbitration award and denied the defense petition to vacate it.on the issue of whether dymond was properly removed and replaced by judge perez,the court found the earlier ruling binding.the court also found,however,that this matter has been before aaa for almost two years and foreclosure proceedings were imminent.the aaa arbitrator dymond advised the court that he would be unable to complete the matter by march,the conduct of the aaa arbitrator establishes that the arbitrator failed to act.
mccoy objected that the trial court had never decided whether he was the alter ego of the corporation.nonetheless,the court entered judgment against both mccoy and the corporation.this appeal by mccoy followed.see fn,ante.
discussion 
mccoy neither consented to the setting of an arbitration completion date,nor forfeited the right to object 
ii.section authorized the trial court to set an arbitration completion date 
section provides in relevant part the arbitration award shall be made within the time fixed therefor by the agreement or,if not so fixed,within such time as the court orders on petition of a party to the arbitration.
the grant of authority to direct that t he award shall be made within such time as the court orders is reasonably susceptible to at least two interpretations.perhaps,as mccoy argues,it means only that the trial court has the power to set a date after completion of the evidentiary hearing within which the arbitrator must render his award.if so,then the trial court has no jurisdiction to set a deadline by which the entire arbitration proceeding must be concluded on the other hand,perhaps the bosworths interpretation is correct by referring to the time within which the award must be made,the statute gives the trial court the power to regulate the duration of the arbitration proceeding itself.
to resolve the ambiguity,we examine the legislative history to ascertain the intent supporting the enactment of section.granberry islay investments cal th,d.reviewing that history,we conclude that section was intended to authorize the trial court to fix a deadline within which the arbitration proceeding must be completed and the award rendered.
section was adopted as part of a comprehensive revision of the statutory scheme governing arbitration et the revision was recommended by the california law revision commission recommendation and study relating to arbitration.the legislature unanimously enacted section without change,exactly as recommended by the commission.feldman,arbitration new california arbitration act,fn.consequently,the comments of the law revision commission are persuasive evidence of the legislature intent.van arsdale hollinger cal d,overruled on another ground in privette superior court cal th,fn,d.reports of commissions which have proposed statutes that are subsequently adopted are entitled to substantial weight in construing the statutes.citations.this is particularly true where the statute proposed by the commission is adopted by the legislature without any change whatsoever and where the commission comment is brief,because in such a situation there is ordinarily strong reason to believe the legislators votes were based in large measure upon the explanation of the commission proposing the bill.citations.jevne superior court cal th,d.
in the instant case,the law revision commission expressed concern over the delay that may occur if the parties have not specified a completion date for the arbitration in their agreement.the study supporting the law revision commission report noted that the present statute does not have a time limit within which an award must be rendered.the parties in their arbitration agreement often fix the time within which the arbitrator must make his award,and this time limit will be enforced by the court unless the parties have waived it.in support of this statement,the study cited willis porter,a case in which the parties set a date by which the entire arbitration proceeding was to be concluded and the award rendered.id.at.the study further observed arbitration is often used by the parties to achieve a speedy settlement of the dispute.this end may be defeated if the parties have failed to fix a time limit for the rendering of awards in their agreement.the present statute does not set a time limit and case law does not indicate that a court may set its own time limit.it is recommended that the statute include a provision giving the court power to fix the time within which the award must be made on the motion of a party to the arbitration.
consistent with the study,the law revision commission report recommended the adoption of section if the arbitration agreement does not provide a time limit within which the arbitrators must determine the dispute,the court should be able to fix a time within which the matter must be decided.the absence of such a provision in the present california law permits an arbitration proceeding to be delayed unnecessarily.a party may be prevented from obtaining any relief at all in such cases,for a court proceeding would be stayed until the arbitration is completed.
thus,the law revision commission study and report show that in the absence of an arbitration completion date set by agreement,section was intended to give the trial court power to prevent undue delay in completing the arbitration.by enacting section without amendment,the legislature manifested its acceptance of the law revision commission recommendation.indeed,in a letter to the governor sent with the bill that enacted the new statutory scheme assem.bill reg.sess,the author of the bill expressed the same policy reasons for enacting section as had the law revision commission.assemblyman clark bradley letter to the governor explained,in part this is a bill prepared and recommended by the california law revision commission.the major changes made in the existing law by the bill are.this bill grants the court power to set the time within which the arbitrators must decide the controversy if the parties themselves have not done so.no provision of the existing law gives the court this power,and,as a result,a party may be deprived of any relief because he can not get the arbitrators to act and he can not go to court as long as the arbitration is pending.will prevent this from occurring.
the conclusion that the legislature intended section to authorize the setting of an arbitration completion date is also supported by the legislative counsel report.the legislative counsel explained that the law revision commission proposals included making changes to,inter alia,the conduct of the arbitration proceeding,including the time within which the dispute may be decided.legis.counsel,report on assem.bill reg.sess.may.the report of the legislative counsel is entitled to great weight in construing the statute since the report is prepared to assist the legislature in its consideration of pending legislation.california of psychology providers rank cal d.
as recognized by the law revision commission,sound pragmatic considerations support the policy implemented by section.unreasonable delay in the resolution of the arbitration proceeding could effectively deprive a party of the speedy determination arbitration is intended to provide.this concern has prompted several courts to observe,albeit in dicta and without mentioning section,that the trial court does have the power to issue an order setting a deadline for the arbitration.see,burgess kaiser foundation hospitals th,d i f there is any delay by an arbitrator,the appropriate remedy is not tolling of the period,but rather a petition to the court for an appropriate order expediting the arbitration proceeding.boutwell kaiser foundation health plan d.in the arbitration context,a plaintiff may petition the superior court to assist her in expediting the proceedings by moving to set an arbitration date.preston kaiser foundation hospitals d.finding that a trial court which has ordered a matter to be arbitrated,has the power to entertain a petition by the plaintiff for judicial assistance in moving the arbitration forward where the matter is foundering for reasons beyond plaintiffs control.citing these decisions,three leading treatises similarly conclude that a party can petition the trial court for relief if the arbitrator unreasonably delays the proceeding.witkin,cal.procedure ed.proceedings without trial,d arbitration and award,knight et,cal.practice guide the rutter group alternative dispute resolution.
to support a contrary conclusion,the bosworths rely on,supra,th,d,and blake,supra,th,d.on analysis,neither decision is persuasive.
in,after the plaintiffs filed suit against the defendants,the parties submitted their dispute to contractual arbitration.the trial court denied the defendants petition to compel arbitration as moot,and stayed the lawsuit.for various reasons,the defendants became dissatisfied with the pace of arbitration and asked the trial court to take control of the case.id.at,d.the trial court did so,issuing a detailed set of orders.the trial court ordered the defendants to respond to discovery.it set a date for completion of the arbitration,and directed the defendants to obtain new counsel if dates convenient for current counsel could not be found.the court permitted the plaintiffs one continuance of the arbitration proceeding with good cause,but permitted no continuance for the defendants.the court directed that the arbitration would proceed with one defendant in default,and modified the claims to be arbitrated.finally,the court set a trial date in the event the parties failed to complete the arbitration by the date ordered.id.at,d.
on the defendants petitions for extraordinary relief,the appellate court held that the trial court exceeded its jurisdiction in ordering the arbitration to proceed under the stated conditions subject to reinstatement on the trial calendar.id.at,d.the court observed that after a petition to compel arbitration is granted and the lawsuit stayed,the trial court has only vestigial jurisdiction over the case.id.at,d.in discussing the scope of that vestigial jurisdiction,the court language suggests that a trial court has no power to set an arbitration completion date.thus,the court stated that i t is up to the arbitrator,and not the court,to grant relief for delay in bringing an arbitration to a resolution.id.at,d.further,the court observed that t he trial court may not step into a case submitted to arbitration and tell the arbitrator what to do and when to do it.id.at,d.
in blake,supra,th,d,the court of appeal used similar language in reversing the trial court dismissal of a lawsuit for the plaintiff delay in pursuing arbitration.in november the trial court had granted the defendants petition to compel arbitration,and stayed the plaintiff lawsuit.id.at,d.more than two years later,in october,the defendants moved in the trial court to dismiss the plaintiff complaint for lack of prosecution,arguing that the plaintiff had not commenced the arbitration proceeding,and the delay had prejudiced the defendants.in december,the court granted the motion to dismiss.id.at,d.the appellate court reversed,reasoning that the d efendants only avenue for redress when plaintiff failed to timely prosecute the arbitration was in the arbitration proceeding.id.at,d.further,the court stated that rather than seek relief from the trial court for plaintiff failure to proceed,defendants should have sought relief in the arbitration proceeding,by pursuing the remedies available under the arbitration agreement and the rules of the arbitration association designated therein.id.at,d.
on their facts,no doubt and blake were correctly decided.in each case,the trial court exceeded the scope of its authority after the case was ordered to arbitration.certainly in the trial court micromanaging of the arbitration and its conditional trial setting were improper.likewise,in blake the trial court dismissal of the complaint for failure to diligently prosecute the arbitration was unauthorized by law.but to the extent the language of the opinions suggests that a trial court has no authority to fix an arbitration completion date,we respectfully disagree.if the parties have not set a completion date in their arbitration agreement,section gives the trial court the power,on petition of a party to the arbitration,to set a date by which the arbitration must be decided.further,although it is the better practice to set the deadlin
