this appeal is one by the government from the district court allocation of surplus proceeds from the sale of real property in a foreclosure action.a bankruptcy estate owned the real property several creditors obtained relief from the automatic stay to pursue this foreclosure action.the government contends that the district court erred in these ways by applying florida law instead of federal common law to determine whether the government could recover from the surplus proceeds for tax liens against the property for taxes owned by the debtor alleged alter ego and by distributing the surplus proceeds in satisfaction of the government and coast liens instead of distributing the funds to the bankruptcy trustee or applying the bankruptcy code priority scheme.
background 
old west annuity and life insurance company old west commenced this foreclosure action in florida state court,seeking to foreclose its mortgage lien on a campground in clermont,florida the campground owned by apollo group,apollo.apollo acquired the campground in an auction associated with the bankruptcy of all seasons resorts,all seasons.soon after old west initiated the foreclosure action in a florida state court,apollo itself filed a petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code in the northern district of ohio.the filing of apollo bankruptcy petition automatically stayed the florida foreclosure action.see.two years later,the bankruptcy court granted old west relief from the automatic stay,allowing old west to assert its rights to the campground by continuing with the foreclosure action.
soon after,the government filed a proof of claim for unpaid taxes in the bankruptcy court.the claim was based on unpaid tax assessments against apollo for approximately and unpaid assessments against all seasons in excess of million.the government contends that apollo is the alter ego of all seasons,making apollo liable for all seasons delinquent taxes.the bankruptcy court granted the government relief from the stay to establish and enforce tax liens against the campground.the government then locally recorded notice of its tax assessments and intervened in this foreclosure action in state court.the government later removed this case the foreclosure action to federal district court in florida.
the bankruptcy court then granted creditors camp coast to coast,and affinity group,coast relief from the automatic stay.coast had won a substantial money judgment against apollo in a california case several years earlier.after coast obtained relief from the stay,it domesticated its california judgment in florida.coast obtained an order from a florida court declaring its judgment lien against campground the lien was recorded and thus perfected.coast then intervened in this foreclosure action.the district court ordered the sale of the campground,with the liens of old west,the government,and coast to attach to the proceeds of the sale to the same extent,and in the same priority,that they attached to the property prior to the sale.the sale resulted in proceeds of million.
by then,the bankruptcy court had converted the bankruptcy case from chapter to chapter.the government sought and obtained an order from the bankruptcy court confirming that the conversion to chapter did not affect that court earlier orders.the proceedings in the foreclosure action continued old west undisputedly held the first priority lien on the campground,and the government undisputedly held the second priority lien for apollo taxes.the contentious issue in the district court was whether the government could also recover for the taxes owed by apollo alleged alter ego,all seasons if so,the government recovery would deplete the remaining proceeds and preclude recovery by coast.the district court granted old west summary judgment and disbursed million of the proceeds in satisfaction of its undisputed first priority claim.the district court set the alter ego issue for trial.
meanwhile,the government filed an administrative claim in the bankruptcy court for the bankruptcy estate tax liabilities resulting from the sale of the campground,which amounted to over million more than the remaining proceeds in the district court register.the government then filed a supplemental complaint in the district court seeking to have the funds in the district court register returned to the bankruptcy trustee for distribution in accordance with the bankruptcy code.after that,the government filed a motion specifically requesting the transfer of the money.coast opposed the motion on standing grounds so the government obtained an order from the bankruptcy court allowing the government to represent the estate in the foreclosure proceedings in the district court to assert such claims or rights on behalf of the estate which the trustee may be entitled to assert in that action,including whether the bankruptcy estate has a senior right to the funds that are now held in the registry of that court.the bankruptcy court order noted,however,that it is not ruling,and has never previously ruled,on the issue of whether a grants the estate priority over the lien claim of coast.
now asserting the section a rights of the trustee,the government continued to argue in the district court that the funds there should be returned to the bankruptcy court or,in the alternative,that the district court should distribute the remaining funds in accordance with the bankruptcy code the crux of the government argument was that the bankruptcy court did not intend its orders to constitute an abandonment of the campground property and that therefore the surplus proceeds remained the property of the estate and were subject to the bankruptcy code.
the district court acknowledged that the trustee had not formally abandoned the campground,but denied the government motion to transfer the surplus proceeds.interpreting the bankruptcy court orders,the district court determined that,pursuant to its concurrent jurisdiction over the campground and in the absence of a contrary order from the bankruptcy court,its task was to adjudicate the rights of the parties before it and to distribute the remaining sales proceeds.the district court also rejected the government attempt to assert the trustee strong arm powers under section,concluding that those powers can only defeat liens arising 
after holding a bench trial on the alter ego issue,the district court concluded that it must apply florida opposed to the federal common law advocated by the determining liability the district court concluded that the government did not meet its burden to establish alter ego liability under florida law therefore,the court concluded that the government was only entitled to recover for apollo taxes and not all seasons taxes and that coast was entitled to the remaining foreclosure funds.the government now appeals.
ii.discussion 
applicable law to determine alter ego liability 
at trial,the government argued that apollo is the alter ego of all seasons,making apollo liable for all seasons tax liabilities.the government contends that the district court should have applied the federal common law alter ego test instead of the test under florida law.
the government contends that,because the tax code is a nationwide federal program,this court must apply the framework established by united states kimbell foods,d,to determine whether federal common law or state law determines alter ego liability.coast,on the other hand,contends that aquilino united states,d,and drye united states,d,require this court to look to state law.other circuits appear uniform in their application of state law to this issue.see,united states scherping,cir generally,federal courts will look to state law to determine whether an entity is an alter ego of a taxpayer.floyd,cir applying state law towe antique ford foundation,cir we apply the law of the forum state in determining whether a corporation is an alter ego of the taxpayer.zahra spiritual trust united states,cir in determining whether the appellants are the alter egos of the taxpayers,and whether the taxpayer has an interest in property to which the government tax lien attached,we look to state law.
