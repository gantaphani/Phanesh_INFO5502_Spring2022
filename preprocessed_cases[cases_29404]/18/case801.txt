this appeal arises out of a class action suit brought by howard montgomery on behalf of participants in aetna plywood employee stock ownership plan esop against aetna plywood and its directors,based on an allegation that aetna plywood had not adequately compensated the esop participants when the directors caused the esop to sell its shares back to the company.eventually,the parties reached a pair of settlements.this appeal,however,does not involve,directly at least,the settlements or the underlying class action suit.rather,it involves three ancillary matters the district court decided the legality of an ownership restructuring plan aetna plywood proposed,the amount of the settlement fund that should be awarded to class counsel and the lead plaintiff,and the proper disposition of a subsequent state law action brought by class counsel to enforce a term in one of the parties settlement agreements.with one minor exception,we affirm the district court decisions on each of these matters.
just before aetna plywood purchased the stock owned by its esop,the esop owned of the company outstanding shares.the remaining was owned by jeff davis,who served as aetna plywood chief executive officer,the chairman of its board of directors,and a member of the committee that managed its esop.sometime in,davis,along with the other three individuals who served on both aetna plywood board of directors and its esop committee,caused the esop to sell its shares of aetna plywood stock to the company.this transaction left davis as the sole stockholder in aetna plywood.
believing that davis and aetna plywood other directors had caused the esop to sell its shares of aetna plywood stock for too low a price,howard montgomery,a former aetna plywood employee and esop participant,filed,in may,a class action suit on behalf of esop participants against aetna plywood and the directors who had approved the stock sale the montgomery defendants.the class complaint alleged that,by causing the esop to sell its shares at a price,aetna plywood directors had breached fiduciary duties placed on them by erisa and delaware corporate law.
the case eventually went to trial before the district court in june.on the third day of the trial,two directors,both of whom were outside directors,entered into a settlement with the class.they agreed to pay the class in exchange for a release from liability.at the conclusion of the trial,the district court found aetna plywood,davis,and the other remaining,john francione the trial defendants,liable for causing the esop to sell its interest in aetna plywood without ensuring that the esop received adequate consideration.the district court further found that the defendants had undervalued the esop stock by a share.after making adjustments for the settlement with the outside directors and prejudgment interest,the court arrived at a damages figure of.
following the district court decision,the trial defendants initiated negotiations with the class,fearing that the judgment entered against them would bankrupt aetna plywood.these negotiations proved fruitful and the parties reached a comprehensive settlement agreement.the trial defendants agreed that aetna plywood would pay the class million cash,give the class of the company stock,and,if aetna plywood were to be sold within three years,turn over to the class of the sale proceeds in excess of million.davis promised to relinquish his aetna plywood stock and to give up all control of and involvement in the company.he also agreed to relinquish his ownership interest in the company headquarters,to forfeit any monies realized from the sale of his shares,and to forego any future remuneration from the company.moreover,both davis and francione agreed to give up any recovery they might be entitled to as esop participants.
in exchange for these promises,the class agreed to release all claims asserted and assertable against the trial defendants and promised not to seek further assets from davis.in addition,class counsel agreed to limit any attorneys fee request to of the settlement recovery plus reimbursements of costs and expenses not exceeding,and the defendants promised not to oppose a request within those bounds.the parties also agreed that aetna plywood would consult with class counsel regarding any sale or change of control transaction involving the company and that aetna plywood could submit any proposal in this regard,to which class counsel objected,to the court for approval.finally,the parties provided that the district court would retain jurisdiction over the case to enforce the terms of the settlement agreement.
after carefully reviewing the mid and settlements reached by the parties,the district court,in march,approved both settlement agreements,finding each to be fair,reasonable,and adequate.in the same order,the district court took up class counsel requests for attorneys fees,costs,and an incentive award for the lead plaintiff.although none of the montgomery defendants challenged class counsel requests,as the requests were within the bounds established by the settlement agreement,objections were received from class members.primarily,these came from three aetna plywood managers,larry rassin,keith weller,and jon minnaert.the district court reviewed carefully both class counsel requests and the objections submitted,as well as the numerous considerations relevant to determining an appropriate attorneys fee,expense reimbursement,and incentive award.based on this review,and using the method for awarding attorneys fees,the court awarded class counsel of the net settlement recovery amounting to,of any future class recovery,and in expense reimbursements.the court declined to award class counsel any portion of the stock promised to the class and refused to grant the lead plaintiff an incentive award.a subsequent order granted class counsel an additional in expense reimbursements,but reaffirmed the district court refusal to grant a reimbursement for legal research costs.
at the same time the district court was considering the fairness of the two settlements and the appropriateness of class counsel requests for attorneys fees,costs,and an incentive award,the parties also brought before the court an ownership restructuring plan proposed by aetna plywood.pursuant to this plan,which was submitted to the district court in february,davis would relinquish his stock to aetna plywood in exchange for and the company would give that stock as well as the to the class then,aetna plywood would issue new stock representing of the total number of outstanding shares finally,aetna plywood would turn of the company stock over to its attorneys to pay for services rendered and would sell the remaining to a group of managers rassin,weller,minnaert,and scott halden for.the class objected to the plan on the ground that it did not maximize the value aetna plywood could have received for selling a controlling interest in the company.after briefing on the issues raised by the restructuring plan,the district court,in april,gave its consent to the proposed restructuring.
around this same time,class counsel discovered that aetna plywood had funded the objections rassin,weller,and minnaert filed opposing class counsel request for attorneys fees.believing this violated the parties settlement agreement,class counsel filed suit against aetna plywood,rassin,weller,minnaert,and halden the krislov defendants in the circuit court of cook county,illinois,asserting a breach of contract claim.in response,the krislov defendants removed the case to federal court and filed a motion to dismiss.class counsel then filed a motion to remand the case to state court and,in the alternative,asked for leave to file an amended complaint.the district court denied the motion to remand,but granted class counsel leave to amend.class counsel then added claims of aiding and abetting a breach of contract and intentional interference with a contractual relationship against the individual krislov defendants.following a second motion to dismiss,the district court,in december,concluded that class counsel had failed to state a claim against the krislov defendants and dismissed class counsel suit.
in july,the district court entered final judgment in the montgomery class action suit,and in december,did the same in the krislov suit.timely appeals were filed in both cases.
legality of ownership restructuring plan 
the first issue raised in these appeals concerns the district court decision to allow aetna plywood to go forward with its proposed ownership restructuring plan.the class contends that the restructuring plan violates delaware corporate law by giving away control of the company for less than fair market value.specifically,the class alleges that,in adopting the restructuring plan,aetna plywood board of directors breached its fiduciary duty to maximize the value a corporation shareholders receive in a corporate control transaction see paramount communications qvc network.the district court rejected the class objections on the ground that the company stock belonged to davis and he could do with it what he wanted.the district court conclusion rests on a faulty premise,however davis stock went to the class and even then only after being sold to aetna plywood,while the stock given to the company attorneys and sold to the management group was stock.on appeal,the montgomery defendants attempt to defend the district court decision on the grounds that the class lacks standing to challenge the restructuring plan under delaware law and the proposed transaction did not trigger any fiduciary duty toward the class to maximize value received.we only discuss the first of these contentions,however,as it is dispositive.
delaware law requires that the plaintiff in a derivative suit the form that the parties assume the class objections take be a stockholder of the corporation at the time of the challenged transaction.to determine whether the class has standing under this rule,we must determine who is a stockholder and what is the time of the challenged transaction for purposes of.
taking the second question first,a review of delaware law reveals that the time of the challenged transaction depends on precisely what about the transaction is being challenged.where the plaintiff complains of the terms,rather than the actual consummation,of a transaction,the time of the challenged transaction is when the terms of the transaction are established.partners beck.for instance,in partners,the delaware supreme court considered a case involving a plaintiff that bought stock in an initial public offering at a price much higher than that paid by certain corporate executives to whom the corporation board of directors had decided to sell stock in a private placement accompanying the public offering.id.at.the court determined that the plaintiff lacked standing because the challenged transaction was the decision to set the price for the private placement,a decision that took place before the plaintiff bought its stock.id.at.the court reasoned that because the plaintiff challenged only the terms of the private placement,rather than the technicality of its consummation,the challenged transaction took place when the terms of the private placement were established.id.at.here,the class complains only about one of the terms of the restructuring price at which the board of directors sold control of aetna term that was announced and therefore established one month prior to final approval of the parties settlement agreement.thus,the challenged transaction took place before the class came into actual possession of the aetna plywood stock promised to it.
this conclusion brings into focus the question we have yet to,for standing purposes,is a stockholder.in light of our conclusion about when the transaction the class challenges took place,the class will have standing only if a prospective stockholder can be considered a stockholder for standing purposes.unfortunately for the class,delaware law treats actual stockholders and prospective stockholders quite differently.most significantly,prospective stockholders are not owed fiduciary duties.anadarko petroleum panhandle eastern.fiduciary duties arise only after a stockholder comes into actual possession of stock,regardless of how certain the stockholder future ownership was when the challenged transaction took place.id.for instance,in anadarko petroleum,the delaware supreme court held that directors of a corporate subsidiary about to be spun off owed no fiduciary duties to the stockholders even though those stockholders had been identified and those holders future stock interests were being traded on the new york stock exchange.id.the court reasoned that because the prospective stockholders did not acquire legal or equitable title over the stock of the subsidiary until the day the stock was distributed,they were not owed fiduciary duties until that day.id.at.that prospective stockholders are not owed fiduciary duties under delaware law leads us to conclude that prospective stockholders would not be considered stockholders for standing purposes.accordingly,we hold that the class was not a stockholder at the time of the transaction it challenges.
in an effort to avoid the necessary implication of this it lacks standing to challenge the restructuring plan under delaware class contends that erisa and the settlement agreement itself grant the class standing.certainly the settlement agreement and perhaps erisa as well grant the class standing to challenge the restructuring plan,but,so far as we can tell,neither grants standing to raise a challenge under delaware law that delaware law itself would not permit.and,the class has not cited any legal authority to the contrary,nor has it articulated a theory that suggests we should rule otherwise.as the class only challenges the restructuring plan under delaware law,it must satisfy the standing requirements of because it was not a stockholder at the time of the challenged transaction,the class can not do so.therefore,we must affirm the district court rejection of the class challenge to aetna plywood ownership restructuring plan.
attorneys fees,costs,and the incentive award 
class counsel challenges several aspects of the district court decisions regarding attorneys fees,costs,and the requested incentive award for the lead plaintiff.specifically,counsel argues that the district court should have awarded it of the gross settlement recovery awarded it a like percentage of the stock promised to the class included legal research costs in the expense reimbursement and granted the lead plaintiff an incentive award.we review the district court decisions respecting these matters for abuse of discretion,except where counsel challenges the methodology employed by the district court,in which case our review becomes plenary.harman lyphomed,cir.
before getting to class counsel specific challenges,we note that in cases like the present one,where the district court is asked to award reasonable attorneys fees or reasonable costs,the measure of what is reasonable is what an attorney would receive from a paying client in a similar case.cook niedert,cir in re continental.sec,cir.this standard obviates,at least to a certain extent,the need to assign a value to an attorney work based on nothing more than a subjective judgment regarding that work.it gives a court a background against which to work by requiring courts to look to evidence regarding the sorts of fees and costs generated in analogous suits funded by paying clients.to the extent possible,then,our analysis in this case will be guided by this methodology.
we begin with class counsel contention that its fee should be based on the gross settlement settlement recovery before counsel cost award is than the net recovery after the cost award is deducted.counsel cites no authority standing for the proposition that gross recovery is to be preferred over net recovery as the basis for calculating a fee under the method,nor has our review of the relevant case law revealed any authority to that effect.moreover,counsel has not come forward with evidence indicating that private contingent fee agreements typically employ one or the other basis,nor has counsel suggested any logical reason that gross recovery should be the preferred basis.as such,it is impossible to conclude that the district court abused its discretion in using net recovery as a basis for awarding attorneys fees.
we consider next class counsel complaint that the district court should have awarded counsel a greater percentage of the settlement recovery,rather than.counsel contends that the district court,in adopting what it found to be the median figure used in securities cases,failed to adequately appreciate the riskiness of this case.the district court concluded that the case was not particularly risky because the fact although not the amount of the montgomery defendants liability could not be doubted.although a reasonable argument can be made that the case was more risky than the district court thought,the district court assessment of the risk involved is not without support.it is fairly obvious that at least some of the montgomery defendants most notably jeff davis plainly were not acting in the best interests of aetna plywood shareholders or in the best interest of the esop.moreover,a lack of risk was not the only reason the district court gave for refusing to select a figure greater than the median the court also noted that the large settlement recovery counseled against a high figure.in fact,the court undertook a careful analysis of both the factors weighing in favor of a percentage figure and those weighing against such a figure.because it is impossible to say that the district court balancing of these factors was unreasonable,we can not conclude that the district court abused its discretion in selecting as the appropriate figure.
we come,then,to class counsel challenge to the district court refusal to award counsel a portion of the stock the settlement agreement promised to the class.counsel contends that the stock obtained for the class should be treated just as the cash obtained for the class is treated.the district court only reason for not awarding counsel stock was that counsel fee was already substantial.we do not believe this is an adequate reason for denying counsel stock.stock,like cash,is simply a form of compensation secured on the class behalf.there is no reason it should be treated differently than cash.in fact,treating it differently creates perverse incentives for attorneys by encouraging them to seek all cash recoveries even when a cash and stock recovery would be in their clients best interest or would otherwise be more appropriate.if a court believes a fee award would be too large if stock is made part of the award,then it should reduce the figure something which,as noted above,the district court here essentially did.although we have not discovered any significant authority on this matter,and the record does not reveal how private contingent fee arrangements in securities cases treat awards of stock,we are convinced that the district court refusal to award class counsel any of the stock obtained for the class is unreasonable.as such,we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in so ruling.
we next turn to class counsel claim that the district court erred in refusing to include in the expense reimbursement award legal research costs.counsel contends that the district court should have included these costs in the reimbursement award because the private market compensates lawyers for these costs and to do otherwise would violate the ethical rules regarding the payment of costs by attorneys.counsel arguments are misguided.computer research charges are considered a form of attorneys fees.haroco,american bank trust of chicago,cir harman,at.the idea is that legal research essentially raises an attorney average hourly rate as it reduces at least in theory the number of hours that must be billed.haroco,at harman,at.as a form of attorneys fees,the charges associated with such research are not separately recoverable expenses.when a court uses the method of calculating attorney fees,such charges are simply subsumed in the award of attorneys fees here,therefore,counsel arguments regarding the necessity of separately recoverable computer research charges are not persuasive because counsel has already been compensated for the computer research charges it incurred through the attorneys fee awarded it.thus,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion or otherwise err in excluding legal research charges from the expenses awarded class counsel.
finally,we take up class counsel challenge to the district court decision to deny the lead plaintiff an incentive award for his participation in this case.incentive awards are appropriate if compensation would be necessary to induce an individual to become a named plaintiff in the suit.cook,at continental.sec,at.counsel claims that the circumstances of the lead plaintiff participation require that he be awarded out of the settlement fund.without directly addressing whether the lead plaintiff participation justified an incentive award,the district court gave three reasons for refusing to grant such an award counsel failure to make any serious argument in favor of granting such an award especially in the amount requested counsel failure to include in the most recent notice to the class adequate information regarding counsel plan to seek an incentive award and the possibility that counsel could pay an incentive award out of the fees awarded it.
although the district court last reason for its ruling is not a particularly persuasive one,the other two carry significant weight.counsel uncertain and less than vigorous efforts to seek an incentive award in the district court can reasonably be interpreted as an abandonment of its request for such an award.in any event,the case for granting the lead plaintiff in this case an incentive award is not so overwhelming as to remove any doubt about whether an award would be appropriate.while the lead plaintiff was the only named plaintiff,was subjected to a rough deposition,and was portrayed by the montgomery defendants in an unfavorable light during the litigation,it does not appear that he had to devote an inordinate amount of time to the case or that,as a former employee,he suffered or risked any retaliation by aetna plywood.accordingly,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant the lead plaintiff an incentive award.
state law action 
the final issue in this case is whether the district court properly disposed of class counsel lawsuit against aetna plywood and the four managers who purchased control of the company the krislov suit.the district court assumed jurisdiction over the suit,which was filed originally in state court and alleged a variety of state law causes of action arising out of a purported breach of the attorneys fees provision of the settlement agreement,and dismissed the suit for failure to state a claim.class counsel challenges both the district court refusal to remand the lawsuit back to state court and the district court decision to dismiss the lawsuit on its merits.we consider counsel jurisdictional challenge first.
assumption of jurisdiction 
class counsel contends that there was no basis for removing the krislov suit to federal court and that,therefore,the district court should have remanded the case back to state court.ordinarily,a case filed in state court can be removed to federal court only if the case falls within the original jurisdiction of the federal district courts.because it is based entirely on state law and involves parties,however,the krislov suit does not come within the original jurisdiction of the federal district courts.the district court nevertheless concluded that removal was proper under the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction since the lawsuit involved claims relating to an alleged breach of the settlement agreement resolving the montgomery case and the court had expressly retained jurisdiction to enforce the terms of that settlement agreement when it entered a final judgment in the montgomery case.
precedent in this circuit firmly establishes that the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction confers federal jurisdiction over a case otherwise outside federal jurisdiction in which the plaintiff seeks to enforce a settlement agre
