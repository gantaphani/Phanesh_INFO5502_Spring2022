under the private attorney general statute code civ,sometimes hereafter section,a court may award attorney fees to the successful party in an action that has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest.in graham daimlerchrysler cal th,d,graham,we held the catalyst theory permits a court to award attorney fees under section even when litigation does not result in a judicial resolution if the defendant changes its behavior substantially because of,and in the manner sought by,the litigation.in so holding,we also adopted sensible limitations on the catalyst theory graham,at,d,to discourage meritless suits motivated by the hope of fees,without putting a damper on lawsuits that genuinely provide a public benefit ibid.
today we revisit one of the limitations on the catalyst theory adopted in graham,supra,cal th,d,the rule that the plaintiff in a catalyst case,to recover attorney fees under section,must have engaged in a reasonable attempt to settle its dispute with the defendant prior to litigation graham,at,d.while this is not a catalyst case see post,d at,at,defendant argues the rule just mentioned should apply whenever fees are sought under section.we hold that no such categorical rule applies in noncatalyst cases.in all cases,however,section requires the court to determine that the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement are such as to make the award appropriate,italics added.in making this determination,one that implicates the court equitable discretion concerning attorney fees,the court properly considers all circumstances bearing on the question whether private enforcement was necessary,including whether the party seeking fees attempted to resolve the matter before resorting to litigation.
introduction 
defendant and appellant the state of california petitions for review of a decision affirming an order awarding attorneys fees under section to plaintiff and respondent cristina vasquez.
proposition,known as the prison inmate labor initiative of approved by voters,and codified as,et,instructs the secretary of the department of correction and rehabilitation to establish joint venture programs with private employers within state prison facilities to employ inmates,see.the law provides,among other things,that inmates be paid wages comparable to wages paid by the joint venture employer to employees performing similar work for that employer or wages comparable to wages paid for work of a similar nature in the locality in which the work is to be performed.the law also requires the secretary to deduct up to percent of each inmate employee gross wages for taxes,room and board,restitution to the victims of crime,and support for the inmate family.ibid.
in august,inmates charles ervin and shearwood fleming,together with the union of needletrades,industrial textile employees,unite,filed a complaint stating various causes of arising out a joint venture between the state of california and cmt blues to manufacture clothing at the richard donovan correctional facility in san diego.as subsequently amended,the complaint named as defendants cmt blues,its manager pierre sleiman,and several corporations that resold cmt blues products under their own names.plaintiffs alleged defendants had committed unfair business practices by failing to pay comparable wages,or minimum wages,subd.e,by directing inmates to remove and replace made in honduras labels with others reading made in the usa,and by selling these garments to consumers throughout california.
in july,a second amended complaint added vasquez,the international of unite,as a plaintiff,and added as defendants the state of california and noreen blonien,assistant director of the department of corrections and rehabilitation for joint venture programs collectively hereafter the state.vasquez,who asserted standing as a taxpayer to prevent the waste of state property code civ,alleged the state had failed to collect and disburse payments due from joint venture employers,including cmt blues.this failure had occurred,vasquez alleged,because the state had permitted employers,in violation of proposition,to require inmates to complete unpaid training periods of to days and to pay less than comparable wages.
the state successfully demurred to vasquez taxpayer cause of action.vasquez appealed,and the court of appeal reversed.vasquez state of california th,d.the court rejected the state argument that a taxpayer claim for waste lies only to prevent the unlawful expenditure of funds,and held that such a claim may also challenge the state failure to collect funds,at,d.
while vasquez appeal was pending,the inmates claims against cmt blues were certified as a class action and tried without a jury.in august,the court entered judgment for the plaintiff class,ordering cmt blues to pay in wages,liquidated damages,waiting time,penalties and interest.the court also awarded,based on the parties stipulation,attorney fees of and costs of.
the trial of vasquez taxpayer claim commenced in january.the trial ended,however,when the parties agreed to a stipulated injunction,which the court approved on february,and later entered as a judgment.the injunction requires the state to submit written progress reports to the court every days,to obtain wage plans and duty statements from each joint venture employer,to comply with all applicable requirements,to provide payroll data to plaintiff counsel,to identify comparable wages as required by proposition,to require joint venture employers to notify inmates of their rights under proposition and the labor code,to establish grievance procedures for inmates,to require joint venture employers to post bonds to secure the payment of wages,to notify the court and plaintiff counsel of defaults in wage payments,and to take reasonable steps to collect overdue wages.the court retained jurisdiction to enforce,modify dissolve the injunction for a period of two years,subject to extension or termination for good cause,and also retained jurisdiction to award attorneys fees.
vasquez subsequently moved for attorney fees under section.on august,the court awarded,based on a lodestar amount of and a multiplier of.on october,the court entered judgment on the stipulated injunction and the award of attorney fees.
on december,we filed our decision in graham,supra,cal th,d,holding that the plaintiff in a catalyst case,to recover attorney fees under section,must have engaged in a reasonable attempt to settle its dispute with the defendant prior to litigation graham,at,d.
on december,the state in this case appealed the award of attorney fees.in its opening brief on appeal,the state argued vasquez was not entitled to recover fees under section because,among other reasons,she had not engaged in a reasonable attempt to settle before resorting to litigation.the court of appeal affirmed the fee award.concerning the state argument that vasquez was required to have attempted to settle her claim,the court observed that graham applied only to catalyst cases,that the instant case was not a catalyst case because vasquez had obtained a stipulated injunction that was reduced to judgment,and that the state had in any event waived the argument by failing to raise it in the trial court and by failing sufficiently to develop the argument in its opening brief.
the state petitioned for review of the judgment to the extent it awarded attorney fees.we granted review and limited the issue to be briefed and argued as follows does the rule that,in order to receive attorney fees under code of civil procedure section,the plaintiff must first reasonably attempt to settle the matter short of litigation,apply to this case see graham,supra,cal th,d,grimsley board of supervisors d.
ii.discussion 
section authorizes a court to award attorneys fees to a successful party in any action which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest the legislature enacted the provision to codify the private attorney general doctrine previously developed by the courts.woodland hills residents,city council cal d,woodland hills serrano priest cal d,approving the doctrine.the doctrine rests on the recognition that privately initiated lawsuits,while often essential to effectuate important public policies,will as a practical matter frequently be infeasible without some mechanism authorizing courts to award fees.graham,supra,cal th,d,see also maria riles cal d.accordingly,the fundamental objective of the doctrine is to encourage suits enforcing important public policies by providing substantial attorney fees to successful litigants in such cases.graham,at,d,quoting maria riles,supra,at.
a court may award attorney fees under section only if the statute requirements are satisfied.thus,a court may award fees only to a successful party and only if the action has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest ibid.three additional conditions must also exist a a significant benefit,whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary,has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons,b the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement,or of enforcement by one public entity against another public entity,are such as to make the award appropriate,and c such fees should not in the interest of justice be paid out of the recovery,if any.section codifies the courts traditional equitable discretion concerning attorney fees woodland hills,supra,cal d,and within the statutory parameters courts retain considerable discretion.t he legislature has assigned responsibility for awarding fees under section not to automatons,but to judges expected and instructed to exercise discretion.graham,supra,cal th,d,quoting buckhannon board care home,west virginia of health and human resources,d dis.opn.of ginsburg.in deciding whether to award fees,the court must realistically assess the litigation and determine,from a practical perspective,whether or not the action served to vindicate an important right so as to justify an attorney fee award under a private attorney general theory.woodland hills,at.a reviewing court will uphold the trial court decision to award attorney fees under section,unless the court has abused its discretion.graham,at,d.
may a court award attorney fees under section only if the plaintiff attempted to settle before resorting to litigation 
the state argues a court may never award attorney fees under section unless the plaintiff attempted to settle before resorting to litigation.neither the language of the statute nor the cases interpreting it impose such a categorical requirement.in determining,however,whether the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement are such as to make the award appropriate,a court properly takes into consideration whether the party seeking fees attempted to resolve the matter without litigation.
in construing section we begin with its plain language,affording the words their ordinary and usual meaning,as the words the legislature chose to enact are the most reliable indicator of its intent.see people watson cal th,d.the statute relevant language provides the court may award attorney fees if,among other things,the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement,or of enforcement by one public entity against another public entity,are such as to make the award appropriate,subd.b,italics added.this language does not expressly or by necessary implication require that the plaintiff have attempted to settle the dispute it requires,instead,only that the court determine that private enforcement was sufficiently necessary to justify the award.to be sure,failed attempts to settle can help to demonstrate that litigation was necessary,but the absence of settlement attempts does not logically or necessarily demonstrate the contrary.depending on the circumstances of the case,attempts to settle may have been futile,exigent circumstances may have required immediate resort to judicial process,or prior efforts to call the problem to the defendant by other parties or in other have been rebuffed.the language of section is sufficiently flexible to permit courts to consider these and all other relevant circumstances in determining whether private enforcement was sufficiently necessary to justify awarding fees 
the state points to nothing in the legislative history of section that might support the categorical requirement of a prelitigation settlement demand.moreover,the legislature clearly knows how to require prelitigation demands unambiguously when that is what it wishes to do.many statutes illustrate the point.for example,a plaintiff under the consumers legal remedies act,et must notify the defendant of the particular violations alleged and demand correction,repair,replacement,or other remedy at least days before commencing an action for damages,subd.a.the plaintiff in an action based on a health care provider professional negligence must give the defendant at least days prior notice before commencing an action.code civ,subd.a.a private plaintiff under the safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of health,et must give notice,more than days before commencing an action,to the alleged violator and to the attorney general and the district attorney,city attorney,or prosecutor in whose jurisdiction the violation occurred,subd.d.a plaintiff may not sue under the tort claims act,et unless he or she has first presented a written claim to the governing board of the defendant public entity and the board has acted upon the claim or the claim has been deemed rejected.the plaintiff in a derivative action against a corporation must allege with particularity his or her efforts to secure the desired relief from the board of directors,or the reasons for not making such efforts,and also allege that he or she has either informed the corporation or its board in writing of the facts underlying each cause of action or delivered a copy of the proposed complaint,subd.b.finally,the plaintiff in an action for libel in a newspaper or slander by radio broadcast may recover only special damages unless he or she first demands a correction,subd.
thus,section as written does not require prelitigation demands,even though the legislature is familiar with the language that will create such a requirement and has used such language on many occasions.under these circumstances,our own views concerning the theoretical desirability or value of such a categorical requirement are beside the point.in construing this,or any,statute,our office is simply to ascertain and declare what the statute contains,not to change its scope by reading into it language it does not contain or by reading out of it language it does.we may not rewrite the statute to conform to an assumed intention that does not appear in its language.doe city of los angeles cal th,d.
we have not interpreted section as imposing a prelitigation settlement demand requirement in noncatalyst cases.in graham,supra,cal th,d,we did require prelitigation demands,but only in catalyst cases.the question before us was the continuing viability of the catalyst theory,in other words,whether section permitted an award of attorney fees,as some courts had concluded,even when litigation does not result in a judicial resolution if the defendant changes its behavior substantially because of,and in the manner sought by,the litigation.graham,at,d.we held the catalyst theory should not be abolished but clarified.ibid.to award fees in catalyst cases,we reasoned,posed a greater risk of rewarding opportunistic litigation than to award fees in cases that end with changes in the parties legal relationships,because a defendant voluntary decision to change its behavior necessarily raises the question whether the plaintiff legal work in fact caused the change and thus deserves to be rewarded with fees.on the other hand,to have abolished the catalyst theory would have deterred attorneys from taking meritorious public interest litigation by permitting defendants,even after tenacious litigation,to avoid paying fees by providing relief voluntarily just before being ordered to do so by the court,at,d.to avoid subjecting public interest litigation to this increased risk without rewarding a significant number of extortionate lawsuits,we adopt ed sensible limitations on the catalyst theory that discourage the latter without putting a damper on lawsuits that genuinely provide a public benefit,at,d,italics added.we later summarized those limitations as follows in order to obtain attorney fees without such a judicially recognized change in the legal relationship between the parties,a plaintiff must establish that the lawsuit was a catalyst motivating the defendants to provide the primary relief sought that the lawsuit had merit and achieved its catalytic effect by threat of victory,not by dint of nuisance and threat of expense and that the plaintiffs reasonably attempted to settle the litigation prior to filing the lawsuit.city of los angeles cal th,d.
that we intended to impose these limitations,including the prelitigation demand requirement,only in catalyst cases is clear from our discussion of the point in graham,supra,cal th,d.there we wrote in addition to some scrutiny of the merits,we conclude that another limitation on the catalyst rule proposed by the attorney general,appearing as amicus curiae,should be adopted by this court.the attorney general proposes that a plaintiff seeking attorney fees under a catalyst theory must first reasonably attempt to settle the matter short of litigation.see grimsley board of supervisors,supra,d.we believe this requirement is fully consistent with the basic objectives behind section and with one of its explicit necessity of private enforcement of the public interest.awarding attorney fees for litigation when those rights could have been vindicated by reasonable efforts short of litigation does not advance that objective and encourages lawsuits that are more opportunistic than authentically for the public good.lengthy prelitigation negotiations are not required,nor is it necessary that the settlement demand be made by counsel,but a plaintiff must at least notify the defendant of its grievances and proposed remedies and give the defendant the opportunity to meet its demands within a reasonable time.see,faulkner,letter notifying defendants of plaintiffs grievances,plus discussions over period see also garrison board of directors th,d pub.resources code,subd.b requires california environmental quality act litigants to inform agency of objections before litigation to give agency opportunity to respond.what constitutes a reasonable time will depend on the context.graham,supra,cal th,d,italics added.
this passage from graham,supra,cal th,d,does not hold or,given its context,even suggest that the plaintiff in a noncatalyst case must make a prelitigation settlement demand in order to preserve the right to recover fees under section.the question was not before us,and i t is axiomatic that cases are not authority for propositions not considered.people avila cal th,d,quoting people ault cal th,fn,d.
if we had in graham,supra,cal th,d,described the prelitigation demand requirement in catalyst cases as compelled by the language of section,then the case for applying the same requirement to all fee awards under the statute would be stronger.but in graham we did no such thing.instead,we described the requirement as fully consistent with the basic objectives behind section and with one of its explicit necessity of private enforcement of the public interest.graham,at,d,italics added.that a rule adopted by this court to guide the exercise of judicial discretion is consistent with a statute does not mean the rule is compelled by the statute.as explained above,the language of section can not fairly be read as requiring prelitigation demands.
that we did not in graham,supra,cal th,d,derive the demand requirement from the language of section is also clear from graham companion case,supra,cal th,d.in,we held that plaintiffs seeking attorney fees under the california fair employment and housing act,et hereafter the feha under the catalyst theory must have attempted to settle before resorting to litigation,even though the feha provision concerning attorney fees,subd.b in contrast to section,contains no reference to the necessity of private enforcement code civ.rather than deriving the demand requirement from the language of the feha,subd.b,which would have been impossible,we simply imposed the requirement f or the reasons explained in graham,at,d,namely,that the catalyst theory entailed risks and benefits that,on balance,justified the adoption of sensible limitations on the catalyst theory that discourage extortionate suits without putting a damper on lawsuits that genuinely provide a public benefit graham,at,d,italics added.
in the four years since we decided graham,supra,cal th,d,no california court has applied graham demand requirement in a noncatalyst case.in,one federal district court relied on graham by analogy to impose a prelitigation demand requirement on motions seeking attorney fees under the americans with disabilities act et.ada see,attorney fees.doran del taco,d,doran.but the district court decision was reversed for that reason.the plaintiff in doran,who had encountered barriers to his wheelchair in the defendant restaurants,sued under the ada and then settled his claims in an agreement designating him as the prevailing party for purposes of attorney fees the district court,without noting that we had described the demand requirement as a limitation on the catalyst rule graham,at,d,misread graham as adopt ing the view that,to recover attorneys fees in a private attorney general case,a plaintiff must have engaged in a reasonable attempt to settle his or her dispute with the defendant before litigation.doran,supra,d.purporting to adopt a similar rule as a matter of federal law under the ada,the district court denied the plaintiff motion for fees.doran,at.the ninth circuit reversed,holding that the district court had denied fees by subjecting the plaintiff to a requirement not found in the ada or the case law.doran del taco,cir.
the state argues that a lower court decision,grimsley board of supervisors,supra,d.grimsley,established the general rule that no plaintiff may ever recover fees under section without having attempted to settle before resorting to litigation,and that years later in graham we merely applied the holding of grimsley to catalyst cases.nothing in graham,supra,cal th,d,however,suggests we believed that a generally applicable demand requirement existed or that we were merely applying a generally applicable requirement to catalyst cases.instead,in announcing the demand requirement we described it as a limitation on the catalyst rule,at,d,italics added see also,at,d,limitation on the catalyst theory.nor did we discuss grimsley in our opinion we cited the case without comment in describing the attorney general suggestion that we adopt a demand requirement in catalyst cases.graham,at,d.
the plaintiff in grimsley,supra,d,sought attorney fees under section after winning a judgment setting aside a county approval of a general plan and mandating compliance with certain statutory procedural requirements the county had neglected.the trial court denied the motion for fees,reasoning that the plaintiff had won on the narrowest grounds grimsley,at,had brought about no substantive change in the general plan,and had not enforced an important right affecting the public interest,as required by section ibid.on appeal,the reviewing court affirmed,emphasizing that trial courts decisions concerning fees under section are discretionary grimsley,at.and may be guided by equitable principles,italics added.applying its equitable discretion to the facts of the case,the court of appeal concluded that it was a near certainty that had grimsley timely pointed out to an appropriate county official or agency,the respects in which the relevant procedural statutes had not been followed,appropriate corrective action would have been promptly forthcoming,at,italics added.the grimsley court concluded its analysis by holding that attorney fees under section,will not be awarded unless the plaintiff seeking such fees had reasonably endeavored to enforce the important right affecting the public interest,without litigation and its attendant expense.ibid.
as we have explained,section does not require prelitigation settlement deman
