the truth in lending act tila,et,limits the liability of a cardholder for unauthorized use of a credit card,id.a,which is defined as use without actual,implied,or apparent authority that does not benefit the cardholder,id.o.the principal issue on appeal is what creates apparent authority to limit cardholder protection under.the district court,in granting summary judgment to american express services amex,ruled that dbi architects,dbi clothed its accounting manager with apparent authority to use its corporate amex account by failing to examine monthly billing statements that identified all cardholders and their charges.we hold that,while dbi did not clothe its accounting manager with apparent authority by failing to inspect its monthly billing statements,dbi did clothe its accounting manager with apparent authority by repeatedly paying after notice all charges made by the accounting manager on its corporate amex account,thereby misleading amex reasonably to believe that the accounting manager had authority to use the account.we remand dbi claim to the district court to determine precisely how many payments created apparent authority and thus limited dbi protection under tila.otherwise,we affirm the grant of summary judgment.
dbi is a corporation with its principal place of business in the district of columbia.it had an amex corporate credit card account,which it authorized certain employees to use.on march,dbi appointed kathy moore as the accounting manager for its district of columbia and virginia offices.in that position,moore was in charge of both approval and payment functions in the cash disbursement system she controlled accounts receivable,accounts payable,corporate checking,corporate credit cards,and all other financial aspects of dbi business.she had authority to issue dbi corporate checks to pay bills and invoices from vendors,was entrusted with the duty of affixing authorized signatures and approvals to checks and other documents,and was responsible for the receipt,review,and payment of dbi amex invoices.aff.of alan storm in supp.of pl.mot.for partial summ.
on or about august,amex added moore as a cardholder on dbi corporate account at moore request and without dbi knowledge or approval.on august,amex sent dbi an account statement identifying moore as a corporate cardholder and itemizing her annual membership fee.from august to may,moore charged a total of to dbi corporate amex card,including in authorized corporate charges and in unauthorized charges for clothing,travel,jewelry,and other personal items.during this period,amex sent dbi ten monthly billing statements,each listing moore as a corporate cardholder and itemizing her charges.between august and june,moore paid for these charges with thirteen dbi checks made payable to amex.in addition,between july and march,moore paid for in charges on her personal amex card with fourteen dbi checks made payable to amex.most of these checks were signed or stamped in the name of alan storm,the president of dbi none were signed in moore own name.
on may,dbi notified amex of moore fraudulent charges and requested a refund of for the corporate account and for the personal account.amex denied the request.dbi sued amex in the superior court for the district of columbia,alleging,in count one of the complaint,that amex had violated tila,by refusing to repay dbi for the in fraudulent charges made by moore on dbi corporate amex card.count two of the complaint alleged that amex was liable for conversion for using dbi corporate funds to credit the in charges on moore personal amex card.following amex removal of the case to the united states district court for the district of columbia,amex moved for summary judgment,and dbi moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability.the district court granted amex motion for summary judgment,denying dbi recovery except for two months of charges on the corporate account,and dbi appeals.our review of the grant of summary judgment is de novo.see tao freeh.
congress enacted the credit card provisions of the truth in lending act in large measure to protect credit cardholders from unauthorized use perpetrated by those able to obtain possession of a card from its original owner.towers world airways phh aviation,cir see,at cong.rec.responding to concerns about the abuse of uninformed cardholders by a growing credit card industry,see generally john weistart,consumer protection in the credit card industry federal legislative controls,congress strictly limited the cardholder liability for unauthorized charges,see a,placed the burden of establishing cardholder liability on the card issuer,see id.b,and imposed criminal sanctions for the fraudulent use of credit cards,see id.specifically,provides that a cardholder is not liable for the unauthorized use of a card unless the issuer previously provided the cardholder with information about potential liability,a means of reporting a lost or stolen card,and a means of identifying the authorized user.id.a c,d,f.even then,the cardholder maximum liability is,id.at a b,and in any event,the cardholder is not liable for unauthorized charges incurred after the cardholder notifies the issuer of the fraud.id.a e.
the protections under,however,apply only to unauthorized use,which congress defined as a use of a credit card by a person other than the cardholder who does not have actual,implied,or apparent authority for such use and from which the cardholder receives no benefit.id.o see regulation z,b.because the parties agree that moore had neither actual nor implied authority to use dbi corporate amex card,the question is whether moore charges were authorized as a result of her apparent authority to use the card and thus fall outside the protections available to dbi under.credit card serv.ftc.
the federal reserve board official staff interpretation of regulation z,b,states that whether apparent authority exists must be determined under state or other applicable law.pt,supp.i,at.the second circuit observed in towers world airways,at,that b y defining unauthorized use as that lacking in actual,implied,or apparent authority,congress apparently contemplated,and courts have accepted,primary reliance on background principles of agency law in determining the liability of cardholders for charges incurred by card bearers.the common law rule provides that apparent authority arises from the written or spoken words or any other conduct of the principal which,reasonably interpreted,causes a third person to believe that the principal consents to have an act done on his behalf by the person purporting to act for him.restatement second of agency,at.the district of columbia has adopted a similar definition apparent authority of an agent arises when the principal places the agent in such a position as to mislead third persons into believing that the agent is clothed with authority which in fact he does not possess.stieger chevy chase sav.bank,quoting jack pry,harry drazin.the existence of apparent authority is a question of fact that should normally be left to the jury.see,herbert constr.continental ins,cir.however,a principal may be estopped from denying apparent authority if the principal intentionally or negligently created an appearance of authority in the agent,on which a third party relied in changing its position.see restatement second of agency,at.we need not decide whether district of columbia law or the common law of agency provides the rule of decision,as we discern no difference between them for the purposes of this case.
the district court ruled that moore did not have apparent authority to become a cardholder on dbi corporate amex account.but distinguishing between the acquisition and use of a credit card,the court ruled that dbi negligent failure to examine its monthly billing statements from amex created apparent authority for moore use of the corporate card.the court relied on an analogy to district of columbia banking law,under which depositors are required to exercise reasonable promptness in examining the statement to determine whether any payment was not authorized,c,and embraced the analysis of the second circuit in minskoff american express travel related services,cir,which involved a nearly identical fact situation.there,as here,an employee of a corporation fraudulently acquired a corporate credit card from amex,charged personal expenses to the card,and paid for the charges with corporate checks.amex sent monthly statements listing the employee as a cardholder and itemizing the employee charges,but the corporation failed to review the statements,continued to make payments,and demanded a refund upon discovering the fraud.see id.at.
the second circuit held in minskoff that tila clearly preclude s a finding of apparent authority where the transfer of the card was without the cardholder consent,as in cases involving theft,loss,or fraud.id.at quoting towers world airways,at.regarding the employee use of the card,however,the court drew an analogy from new york banking law,under which depositors are obligated to exercise reasonable care and promptness in examining their bank statements and reporting unauthorized charges,id.at quoting,and held that a cardholder failure to examine credit card statements that would reveal fraudulent use of the card constitutes a negligent omission that creates apparent authority for charges that would otherwise be considered unauthorized under the tila.id.at.the court noted that the corporation negligence enabled the employee to pay all of the american express statements with forged checks,thereby fortifying american express continuing impression that nothing was amiss.id.at.the court reasoned that,as a policy matter,cardholders are in a better position than card issuers to discover fraudulent charges,and that n othing in the tila suggests that congress intended to sanction intentional or negligent conduct by the cardholder that furthers the fraud or theft of an unauthorized card user.id.at.accordingly,the court concluded that amex was liable only for the fraudulent charges incurred before the corporation had a reasonable opportunity to examine its first billing statement,and remanded the case for the district court to make this determination,including whether,as the record developed on remand,any issues required submission to the jury.see id.at.
on appeal,dbi contends that the district court erred in following minskoff.because tila and regulation z oblige the card issuer to protect the cardholder from fraud,dbi maintains that the district court erred in imposing on the cardholder a novel duty derived from a rough analogy to banking law to inspect monthly billing statements and to notify the card issuer of fraud.appellant br.at see c.amex responds that,by continuing to pay without objection all charges on its corporate account,dbi vested moore with apparent authority to use its corporate credit card.we conclude that both parties are correct.dbi is correct that its failure to inspect its monthly billing statements did not clothe moore with apparent authority to use its corporate amex account.amex is correct that dbi clothed moore with apparent authority to use its corporate amex account by repeatedly paying without protest all of moore charges on the account after receiving notice of them from amex.
nothing in the law of agency supports the district court conclusion that dbi mere failure to review its monthly billing statements created apparent authority for moore to use its corporate amex account.dbi silence without payment would be insufficient to lead amex reasonably to believe that moore had authority to use dbi corporate account,as such silence would be equally consistent with dbi never having received the statements.whetstone candy kraft foods,cir.indeed,in crestar bank,cheevers,the district of columbia court of appeals held that a cardholder failure to object to the disputed charges within a reasonable time did not constitut e ratification and acceptance of those charges.id.at first alteration in original.the court distinguished minskoff as involving more than mere silence whereas in crestar bank there was no relationship between the cardholder and the third party who made the fraudulent charges,and the cardholder neither received notice of the charges nor paid them,in minskoff the cardholder employee made the fraudulent charges,and the cardholder both received notice of the charges and paid them in full for sixteen consecutive months.id.at see minskoff,at.
further,the view that mere silence does not confer apparent authority is consistent with the text and purpose of and regulation z.the plain language of does not require a cardholder to inspect monthly billing statements in order to invoke its protections.the text sets no preconditions to its protections,such as an exhaustion requirement,and makes no reference to other remedies,such as those under the fair credit billing act,which permits but does not require a cardholder to seek correction of billing errors by reporting them to the card issuer in writing rather,places the risk of fraud primarily on the card issuer.designed to remedy the problem that if a consumer does not immediately discover and report a card loss,he can be liable for thousands of dollars in unauthorized purchases made by a fast working thief,at,requires the card issuer to demonstrate that it has taken certain measures to protect the cardholder from fraud before it can hold a cardholder liable for any unauthorized charges.a,b.the text of thus indicates that congress intended for the card issuer to protect the cardholder from fraud,not the other way around.explaining the rationale underlying congress policy decision that it is preferable for the issuer to bear fraud losses from credit card use,one commentator has suggested that congress understood that a system of issuer liability is preferable because it stimulates more efficient precautions against losses,with cardholder liability incurred only to the degree necessary to ensure proper control of his card and prompt notice of loss to the issuer.see weistart,supra,at.
regulation z likewise reflects the remedial purpose of.filling in the gap between tila and the fair credit billing act,the federal reserve board explains in regulation z that a cardholder need not contest charges under in order to pursue remedies under.see crestar bank,at.specifically,the board official staff interpretation of b states that t he liability protections afforded to cardholders in under do not depend upon the cardholder following the error resolution procedures in under.although and apply only to consumer credit and not to corporate credit,see a,h,they nevertheless support the general proposition that a cardholder failure to report fraudulent charges does not create apparent authority for such charges.congress instructed the federal reserve board to promulgate regulations to carry out the purposes of tila,see a,and the supreme court has held that courts owe deference to the board regulations and its interpretation of its regulations under tila.see anderson.ford valencia,d citing ford motor credit milhollin,d.because the board interpretation is consistent with and,deference to regulation z is due.see anderson,at.at milhollin,at.at.indeed,in crestar bank,at,the district of columbia court of appeals deferred to regulation z and rejected an interpretation that reads into a presumption that if the cardholder fails to notify the card issuer that the disputed charges are not his,they will be deemed to have been authorized by the cardholder.
thus,there is no need for a court to look to banking laws to resolve the risk allocation and public policy issues regarding credit card fraud.while the district court duly noted that dbi had paid moore charges in full for ten months,minskoff,at,the court ultimately relied on an analogy to district of columbia banking law in concluding that dbi negligent failure to examine its monthly billing statements created apparent authority for moore to use its corporate amex account.in so doing,the district court gave insufficient weight to the fact that places the risk of fraud primarily on the card issuer.under the district court approach,once a card issuer sends a billing statement to the cardholder,the statutory burden shifts to the cardholder to prove
