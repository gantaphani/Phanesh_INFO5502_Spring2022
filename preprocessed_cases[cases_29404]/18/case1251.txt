the government appeals from a judgment entered in the court of federal claims on july,granting partial summary judgment to state company quaker in its suit seeking a refund under section of the internal revenue code.that section gives relief to a taxpayer when an item of income previously included in gross income is repaid in a year in which the tax rate is lower.quaker cited payments it made in settlement of an antitrust suit brought by its suppliers of crude oil and argued that those payments retroactively increased quaker cost of goods sold cogs in past years,and thus supported retroactive recalculation of taxes previously paid.the court of federal claims agreed.we reverse in part.
background 
income taxes must be paid on income received or accrued during an annual accounting period.united states lewis.annual accounting calculates tax due on events taking place during the taxable year without regard to events in prior or subsequent years.under the claim of right doctrine,the taxpayer must include an item of income over which it has a claim of right,or full control,even if that right is is,even if the taxpayer may have to give up,or repay,that income down the road.should it later appear that the taxpayer was not entitled to keep the money,he would be entitled to a deduction in the year of repayment the taxes due for the year of receipt would not be affected.united states skelly oil,d.the offset afforded by the claim of right doctrine can become imperfect if the tax benefit from the deduction in the year of repayment differs from the increase in taxes attributable to the receipt.id.at.
congress passed to make the taxpayer whole in cases where the tax rate is lower in the year of repayment than in the year of original receipt.section applies when a taxpayer repays money in a current year that belongs to someone else,but was money that the taxpayer received and included in gross income in a prior year.culley united states.the title of the section is computation of tax where taxpayer restores substantial amount held under claim of right.the provision operates in the following contingency 
an item was included in gross income for a prior taxable year or years because it appeared that the taxpayer had an unrestricted right to such item 
a deduction is allowable for the taxable year because it was established after the close of such prior taxable year or years that the taxpayer did not have an unrestricted right to such item or to a portion of such item and 
the amount of such deduction exceeds 
a.in that event,the taxpayer is entitled to either the equivalent of a refund for income tax paid in the earlier year,or a deduction from income in the year of repayment,whichever is more beneficial to the taxpayer.chernin united states,cir.
to qualify for relief,the taxpayer must satisfy various requirements,two of which are relevant here.first,the taxpayer obligation to repay must arise out of the specific circumstances,terms and conditions of the transaction whereby the amount was originally included in income.bailey comm r,cir quoting pahl comm r,wl.this has been called the same circumstances test.second,the deduction must be allowable under a provision of the code other than.see skelly oil,at.
section is further limited by the inventory exception,which precludes relief for any deduction allowable with respect to an item which was included in gross income by reason of the sale of inventory or stock in trade.b.
quaker claim for relief.
quaker refines and blends crude oils,and sells its petroleum products to consumers.in,quaker was sued in a class action by its suppliers of penn grade crude.the suppliers charged that,beginning in,quaker fixed crude oil prices,and lowered and maintained them,in violation of of the sherman act.quaker settled with the class in december for million,of which million was paid to the suppliers.
on its and tax returns,quaker deducted the settlement payments as other deductions,a treatment the irs did not challenge.later,quaker filed amended tax returns seeking a refund under on the theory that its taxable gross income for the years through had been overstated by million,the cost of settling the class action lawsuit.
the irs disallowed quaker claim for relief.quaker challenged that determination in the court of federal claims,contending that if it had incurred the settlement costs during the years when it was buying penn grade crude from the suppliers,its cogs would have been higher and its gross income lower by a corresponding amount the settlement payments established that quaker no longer had an unrestricted right to its prior understatement of cogs applies to the settlement payments,which paid or restored to its suppliers an item included in gross income,understated cogs.the court of federal claims granted quaker motion for partial summary judgment on that claim the only claim then left in the case.state united states.the government appealed.
the federal circuit has jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to a.

discussion 
the government argues chiefly that relief is unavailable because quaker fails to link its settlement payments to its understatement of cogs and because even if quaker otherwise satisfies the elements of a the inventory exception bars relief.
we agree that quaker claim fails because the settlement payments did not arise from the same circumstances as quaker past understatement of cogs.moreover,even if quaker claim did not suffer that fatal flaw,relief under would be barred by the inventory exception.
the claim of right interpretation of the tax laws has long been used to give finality to the annual accounting period,and is deeply rooted in the federal tax system.lewis,at.section is an exception to the claim of right doctrine.the same circumstances test,formulated by the tax court,provides appropriate,workable limits to that exception.dominion res.united states,cir.the limitations are that the requisite lack of an unrestricted right to an income item permitting deduction must arise out of the circumstances,terms,and conditions of the original payment of such item to the taxpayer.id.quoting pahl,at.
an example of the rule in practice is bailey,in which the taxpayer received dividends,salary,and bonuses as the officer of a corporation,and later paid a civil penalty for violating an ftc order in the work he did for the company.the taxpayer claimed that his payment of the penalty restored an item of income included in his gross income in previous years.the sixth circuit invoked the same circumstances test to deny relief,reasoning that the ftc penalty arose from the fact that bailey violated the consent order,and not from the circumstances,terms,and conditions of his original receipt of salary and dividend payments,and that the amount of the penalty was not computed with reference to the amount of his salary,dividends,and bonuses,and bears no relationship to those amounts.id.at.
the same circumstances test likewise barred relief in uhlenbrock commissioner,wl.there,the executor of estate received compensation as executor and funds as legatee subsequently,the irs assessed the estate and found the executor partly liable for additional taxes as both transferee and fiduciary of estate.the tax court held that did not apply to the executor share of the assessment because his 
receipt of commissions and his liability for payment of the penalty were separate and distinct transactions unquestionably,he would have incurred the liability,even if he had received no commissions.moreover,the amount he received from the estate as commissions bore no relationship to the amount he became obligated to pay the united states 
id.at.similarly,in kraft united states,cir,the court barred application of where the item included in income medical fees from blue cross did not arise out of the same circumstances,terms and conditions as taxpayer restitution payment for fraud to blue cross.id.at.see reynolds metals united states,d,denying relief where corporation revenues in prior taxable years bore no relationship to the amount it became obligated to pay for environmental in later year,which was the result of the enactment of retroactive environmental laws griffiths united states,concluding that taxpayer settlement of claims for negligence and breach of fiduciary duty arising out of her business had no connection to consulting fees she received after selling the business.
in short,where the later payment arises from a different commercial relationship or legal obligation,and thus is not a counterpart or complement of the item of income originally received,the same circumstances test precludes application of.dominion,at finding same circumstances test satisfied where public utility authorization from regulatory authorities to collect the charges and its obligation to repay portions of the charges arose from liability to the federal government for deferred income taxes,even though the utility did not repay the same customers who paid the original charges.
quaker characterizes as follows the connection between the item previously included in its gross income understatement of cogs and the item recently restored the settlement payments 
f rom to quaker purchased penn grade crude from independent oil producers who were later plaintiffs in the class action t hese plaintiffs alleged that quaker underpaid on its purchases,the origin of the claim is quaker to purchases of crude oil from the independent oil producers t he payment at issue related to quaker singular transactional relationship with its crude oil suppliers.
quaker br.at.the government argues that this connection does not satisfy the same circumstances test,and we agree.
quaker fails the test because the two transactions are not complementary in terms of the theory of deductibility,the taxpayer tax treatment,or the underlying transactions.
section applies only if a deduction is allowable for the year in question.in other words,the item referred to in must qualify for a deduction under some other portion of the code.midamerican energy comm r,cir quoting wicor,united states,cir.the parties agree that quaker can deduct the settlement payments as an ordinary and necessary business expense pursuant to.the irs did not dispute that treatment in quaker initial filings for and.but cogs,the item quaker claims was included in its gross income,is not deductible.the cost of goods sold,if underreported,is not a deduction from income.rather it is an expenditure which,when correctly stated,the taxpayer is entitled to subtract from his or her gross receipts in the process of computing gross profit and,thus,total income.united states fawaz,cir see in re lilly,cir such costs can not logically be treated as deductions from gross income metra chem.comm r,wl cogs is not treated as deduction from gross income,but rather is subtracted from gross receipts to arrive at gross income.
it follows that quaker claim contains a defect for purposes of the item included requirement under subsection a,quaker treats the million as cogs but for purposes of deduction allowable requirement under subsection a,quaker treats it as a settlement payment.there is thus a disconnect between the purported item included in gross income understatement of cogs and the item restored a negotiated lump sum payment to settle a lawsuit.this problem is intractable cogs can not be deducted,and settlement payments are not included in gross income.
there was no restoration at work here.quaker received funds from its petroleum product customers quaker subsequently passed some of those funds to its crude oil suppliers under the settlement agreement.we need not decide whether restoration requires the repayment of a sum calculated according to the same principles,in respect of the same transaction,paid to the same person here,the sum was calculated to meet the needs of a different transaction with payment to another party altogether.
the government makes this argument forcefully,and quaker largely concedes that it has not restored a sum to the same party on account of the same transaction or series of transactions.instead,quaker argues that because the term restoration appears nowhere in the text of only in the is no restoration requirement at all.
true,the title of a statute can not limit the plain meaning of the text.dep t of corrs.yeskey,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.but restoration is a requirement of imposed by the courts,which we decline to revisit.see culley united states,explaining that taxpayer must also show that the million he restored related to items included in his gross income in the prior taxable year and that it appeared he had an unrestricted right to those items in that year emphasis added chernin united states,cir we therefore conclude that under section a,funds must actually be repaid to establish that the unrestricted right to those funds has been lost.reynolds metals,d at noting the simplicity embodied by so that taxpayer is restoring an amount previously received to his boss,an estate,a partnership or a trust,for example see also mertens law of federal income taxation a taxpayer relief under section resides in the computation of the tax for the year for which he may be allowed the deduction of the amount restored.emphasis added.moreover,the treasury regulation that interprets is binding so long as it implement s congressional mandate in some reasonable manner and is not arbitrary,capricious or manifestly contrary to the internal revenue code,suzy zoo comm r,cir speaks directly to a restoration requirement.titled restoration of amounts received or accrued under claim of right,the regulation explains that applies i f the taxpayer is entitled to a deduction because of the restoration to another of an item which was included in the taxpayer gross income for a prior taxable year or years under a claim of right.a emphasis added.the regulation goes on to define restoration to another as a restoration resulting because it was established after the close of such prior taxable year or years that the taxpayer did not have an unrestricted right to such item or portion thereof.id.
accordingly,we hold that quaker can not invoke for its settlement payments.
section does not apply here for an alternative reason the inventory exception.the inventory exception precludes relief for 
any deduction allowable with respect to an item which was included in gross income by reason of the sale or other disposition of stock in trade of the taxpayer or other property of a kind which would properly have been included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the prior taxable year or property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business.
b.significantly for a reason set forth infra,the inventory exception is inapplicable 
if the deduction arises out of refunds or repayments with respect to rates made by a regulated public utility if such refunds or repayments are required to be made by the government,political subdivision,agency,or instrumentality referred to in such section,or by an order of a court,or are made in settlement of litigation or under threat or imminence of litigation.
quaker and the government read the inventory exception to say different things.for purposes of analysis,the relevant language is in the following three phrases 
a any deduction allowable 
b with respect to an item which was included in gross income 
c because of the sale or other disposition of property such as inventory 
the controversy is over which phrase,a or b,is modified by c.
quaker argues that c modifies a,and therefore that the exception applies only where the deduction in the current year is allowable by reason of the sale or other disposition of inventory,an deduction such as sales returns,allowances and similar items.quaker br.at.if this reading is correct,quaker claim withstands the exception because its proposed deduction for class action settlement expenses does not stem from a return of sales.
the government argues that c modifies b,and therefore that the exception applies when the item of gross income received in a prior year was attributable to the taxpayer sale of products properly classified as inventory.gover
