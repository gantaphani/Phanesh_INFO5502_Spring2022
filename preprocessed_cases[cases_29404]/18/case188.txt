defendants appellants tonga partners,tonga,cannell capital,llc cannell capital,and carlo cannell cannell collectively,defendants,appeal from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york wood,entered june,holding defendants liable to plaintiff appellee analytical surveys,asi in the total amount of,and from a may,opinion and order denying defendants motion for reconsideration.the matter requires us,among other things,to consider the debt exception to liability under b of the securities exchange act of exchange act,b,and to address the unsettled issue of the treatment of hybrid derivative securities under b.
tonga,having previously invested in asi through the purchase of a million promissory note in,exchanged that note in june for another note from asi,with the same million face value but somewhat different terms.both notes could be converted into shares of asi stock at either a or a floating price that depended on asi share price over a defined period prior to conversion.in november,tonga converted that note into shares of asi stock,all of which it sold in the week following conversion.asi,seeking to recoup the profits earned by tonga on the sale of asi shares,brought suit under b,which prohibits statutory insiders such as tonga from profiting on the trade of securities on a basis that is,from a,or,of a security in a six month period 
the district court held that the note issued in was sufficiently different from the note issued in to be considered a new,rather than amended note,and thus that tonga acquisition of the note was a b purchase it further held that the conversion of that note into asi shares five months later was also a purchase under the statute,and that both of these purchases could be matched to the ensuing sale of asi stock for purposes of disgorgement of profits earned on transactions prohibited by b.the court rejected defendants argument that regardless whether its transactions were covered by the b prohibition,defendants were shielded from b liability by the statute exceptions for acquisitions of securities in connection with a debt previously contracted and for certain borderline transactions.the court further held that all defendants,not merely cannell,were liable for the profits earned on the transactions at issue.
defendants moved for reconsideration,arguing that the district court decision had overlooked new controlling precedent of this court,pursuant to which their actions were sheltered by an exemption from b liability contained in regulations issued by the securities and exchange commission sec.the district court,noting that defendants could have advanced that argument prior to the court decision,but did not do so,denied the motion for reconsideration.
we affirm the judgment of the district court on liability,and its denial of the motion for reconsideration 
background 
the events culminating in the present case began in,when tonga made a million investment in asi.asi,at that time,was a provider of digital mapping services at all times relevant to the action,it was publicly traded,and its common stock was registered pursuant to of the exchange act.tonga is and was a limited partnership,created by defendant appellant cannell as an investment vehicle for himself and other private investors.at all relevant times,tonga sole general partner was defendant appellant cannell capital cannell was the sole managing member of cannell capital,and,working through cannell capital,he in turn directed and controlled the operation of tonga.
in april,tonga paid asi million to acquire a senior secured convertible promissory note with a maturity date in april the note.under the note terms,at any time prior to the maturity date,tonga could convert part or all of the note principal and accrued interest into shares of asi common stock the number of shares received for a given amount of depended on the price per share,as determined by a conversion formula in the note.that formula,in turn,defined the conversion price per share as the least of a fixed price either or,depending on the timing of the conversion and two possible floating prices each based on asi average stock price in certain defined periods prior to conversion section of the note provided that,at maturity,the outstanding balance of the note would automatically be converted into shares,based on the conversion price on the maturity date 
simultaneous to the acquisition of the note,tonga and asi also entered into an agreement the registration rights agreement by which asi was obligated to file a registration statement with the sec for the shares acquirable by conversion of the note,and then to have that statement declared effective,within a certain period of time failure to have the statement declared effective within the specified period days after its filing with the sec constituted an event of default under c of the note.
as relevant here,if a c default occurred,of the note gave tonga the option to,at a time of its choosing,accelerate the entire unpaid principal balance of the note rendering that balance immediately due and payable or demand prepayment of at least of the principal amount of the note or demand that the outstanding principal and accrued interest be converted into shares,with the default date serving as the date of conversion for purposes of the conversion price.alternatively,if tonga did not wish to exercise one of these options,it was free to ignore the event of default and proceed as otherwise provided for by the terms of the note.
in october tonga converted of the note into approximately shares of asi common stock,at a price,determined under one of the provisions of the note,of per share at the same time,asi issued an amended convertible note to tonga on the same terms as before,now in the amount of million the note.by the time the note issued,the deadline for asi to file a registration statement had been moved back,under various amendments to the registration rights agreement,to december,asi was therefore obligated under the note to have said statement declared effective by the sec by the end of may.
no declaration of effectiveness issued,however.on may,days having passed after the filing of asi registration statement with the sec,an event of default was triggered under c of the note.tonga did not,however,exercise any of the remedies available to it under rather,following negotiations between asi and tonga,asi issued another note to tonga in the amount of million on june,the note the note carried a maturity date of january,rather than the previous maturity date of april.the note also eliminated the mandatory conversion required by the and notes at maturity,tonga now had the option to convert the principal balance into shares,but could,if it wished,insist on payment in full in cash 
on november,tonga converted the outstanding principal of the note million into shares of common stock at the applicable floating price of per share.between november and november,tonga sold all shares of that stock in the open market,at prices ranging from to per share.
on april,asi filed an action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,seeking disgorgement under b of the exchange act of the profits earned by tonga on its november sale of asi shares.in response,tonga argued that its acquisition of the note in june,and its conversion of that note in november,did not constitute purchases of stock such that the ensuing sale of shares came within the prohibition of b.tonga also argued that the november sale fell within b debt previously contracted exemption from liability,and the borderline transaction exception to liability of kern county land occidental petroleum,d.finally,tonga maintained that even if liability were appropriate,asi could obtain disgorgement only to the extent of cannell personal interest in the profits earned in november,and not any additional profits realized by cannell capital and tonga.
on opposing motions for summary judgment,the district court wood,rejected each of these arguments and denied tonga motion in its entirety.instead,on september,the district court granted summary judgment in part to asi,and ordered tonga to disgorge in profits,with cannell and cannell capital jointly and severally liable for their respective pecuniary interests in those profits.analytical surveys,tonga partners,wl.the district court,however,denied summary judgment as to the precise amounts of the pecuniary interests of cannell and cannell capital.id.at.
on november,the district court so ordered a stipulation between the parties,both as to the amounts of cannell and cannell capital pecuniary interests and that in light of agreement on these amounts,that entry of judgment in favor of asi was therefore warranted defendants reserved their right to contest the findings of fact and conclusions of law in the district court opinion and order of september.on november,defendants moved for reconsideration of the september summary judgment decision,arguing that this court had issued new precedent that made clear that defendants were shielded from liability under b by certain of the sec implementing regulations.the district court denied the motion for reconsideration on may.analytical surveys,tonga partners,wl may.an amended judgment was entered on june,and this appeal followed.
discussion 
section b of the exchange act requires statutory insiders those with a beneficial ownership interest of more than in an equity security to disgorge all profits realized from any purchase and sale or sale and purchase of the same security made within a six month period.the exchange act defines purchase and sale broadly,see a,and we have said that b applies to acquisitions and dispositions of equity securities in transactions such as conversions,options,stock warrants,and reclassifications,huppe wpcs int l,cir citing blau lamb,cir.
the statute imposes liability without fault for all transactions within its terms,foremost mckesson,provident sec,d,to remove any temptation for insiders to engage in transactions that would enable the realization of profits based on access to inside information,magma power dow chem,cir quoting kern county,at.internal quotation marks omitted.section b thus operates mechanically,and makes no moral distinctions,penalizing technical violators of pure heart,and bypassing corrupt insiders who skirt the letter of the prohibition.magma power,at.this blunt instrument approach,huppe,at internal quotation marks omitted,is leavened only by limited exceptions the debt and borderline transaction exceptions for transactions otherwise subject to disgorgement.in our de novo review of the district court grant of summary judgment,anemone metro.transp,cir,we begin by considering whether defendants actions were within the scope of either or both of these exceptions,as suggested by bruh bessemer venture partners iii,cir.
ii.the debt exception 
section b states that its prohibition does not apply to transactions involving a security that was acquired in good faith in connection with a debt previously contracted.tonga contends that this debt exception applies here because it acquired the note from asi in satisfaction of the debt asi owed as a result of asi default on the note.we are not persuaded 
though jurisprudence on the contours of the debt exception is sparse,certain principles may be gleaned from the existing precedents.for a transaction to qualify for the debt exception,the debt at issue must constitute an obligation to pay a fixed sum certainly and at all events,rheem rheem,cir,and be a matured debt which existed apart from any existing obligation to transfer the securities,heli coil webster,cir citing booth varian,cir accord romeo dye,at.here,the debt exception does not apply because,at minimum,the note was not acquired in connection with a matured debt 
at the outset,the note provides,and the parties do not dispute,that it is governed by the internal law of new york.neither b itself nor the extant precedents on the debt exception provide a source of law for determining whether a debt is matured.in giving content to this aspect of the b inquiry for purposes of federal law,we adopt state law as providing the appropriate rule of decision.new york serv,cir sotomayor,quoting united states kimbell foods,d.we thus look to new york law in assessing whether the debt owed to tonga by virtue of asi default on the note had matured and was legally enforceable at the time the note was issued.
the note specifies a maturity date of april,absent an extension of that date,or other specific provision in the note.tonga contends,nonetheless,that the debt owed pursuant to the note was mature and legally enforceable when asi issued the note in june of that year,because of the consequences of the may event of default.accordingly,tonga concludes that it acquired the note in connection with a debt previously contracted for the purpose of b.
it is true that under new york law,t he parties to a loan agreement are free to include provisions directing what will happen in the event of default of the debt,supplying specific terms that super s ede other provisions in the contract if those events occur.nml capital republic of argentina.and if the agreement terms require the acceleration of the debt upon default,that acceleration changes the date of maturity from some point in the future to an earlier date based on the debtor default under the contract.id.in this case,however,as earlier described,the terms of the note did not require acceleration upon the type of default present here.rather,they permitted acceleration,on demand,as one of several possible options available to tonga,including demanding prepayment of at least of the note principal amount and conversion of the note at a share price tied to the date of default the availability of these options did not displace the note provisions for conversion at tonga option or at maturity.it is undisputed,moreover,that tonga never demanded acceleration or prepayment of the note.as such,the note maturity date continued to be april,and the note was not a matured debt in june.
tonga argues that such a conclusion exalts form over substance.but the note itself treats the distinction between automatic acceleration and optional acceleration as meaningful.section,defining the remedies available upon an event of default,expressly distinguishes between certain categories of default,which render the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest automatically due and payable,from other categories including the type of default that occurred here in the event of which the note principal and accrued interest shall be accelerated and so due and payable only at the option of the holder.interpreting the permissive remedy applicable here as if it were a mandatory remedy would read this distinction out of the note,and fail to give effect to the language chosen by the parties in the agreement,nml capital,at.
we decline to so depart from the note clear meaning.in the absence of a demand by tonga for acceleration or prepayment following the may default,the obligation of the note had not matured at the time that asi issued the note,and the acquisition of the note was therefore not made in connection with a debt previously contracted for the purpose of b the district court did not err in rejecting tonga argument that the debt exception was applicable here.
iii.the borderline transaction exception 
as recognized by the supreme court in kern county occidental petroleum,b prohibition contains a limited exception for certain borderline transactions that do not serve as a vehicle for the evil which congress sought to prevent the realization of profits based upon access to inside information.huppe,at quoting kern county,at.we have suggested on several occasions,however,that kern county only applies when the transaction at issue is an involuntary transaction by an insider having no access to inside information.id.at quoting at home cox commc ns,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
here,tonga does not contend that it lacked inside information.rather,it argues that the kern county inquiry is not limited in this circuit to involuntary transactions where the statutory insider did not have access to insider information.appellant br.tonga urges that even assuming it had access to such information,it was impossible for tonga to gain any speculative advantage from inside information,because its acquisition of the note was the product of direct negotiations between asi and tonga in which asi and its board had access to the same information as tonga,and was approved by asi board of directors,appellants br.
we disagree.in huppe,this court specifically rejected the argument that a transaction should be exempted from b pursuant to the borderline transaction exception because it was the product of direct negotiations between a company and an insider and was approved by the company board of directors.at.we repeated yet again our suggestion that both an involuntary transaction and lack of access to inside information are prerequisites to the kern county analysis,and added,we have been clear that section b should be applied without further inquiry if there is at least the possibility of speculative abuse of inside information,id.at citing blau,at.
huppe also made clear that,contrary to tonga assertion,our decision in roth ex rel.beacon power perseus,cir parker,upholding sec rules exempting certain transactions from b liability does not mean that we believe such transactions lack any risk of speculative abuse,such as the possible exploitation of information asymmetry,or that every transaction is invulnerable to information asymmetry.huppe wpcs int l,cir parker,first emphasis added.rather,perseus merely gave chevron deference to the sec position that such transactions bear a substantially diminished risk of speculative abuse,see perseus sec amicus brief at,and thus come within the sec broad exemptive authority under the statute even if some possibility of abuse remains,huppe,at.tonga has not shown that in this case the possibility of abuse was not simply diminished but nonexistent.
nor has tonga cited any authority drawing into question this understanding of kern county and the borderline transaction exception.two of the three cases on which tonga relies in fact specifically concluded that the statutory insiders in question lacked the access to inside information that tonga possessed here.see steel partners ii,bell,cir realty crotty,cir and in the third decision,at home cox communications,we noted that kern county presented a borderline case in part because it involved an insider who was atypical because it lacked access to inside information,at we emphasized,moreover,that the kern county borderline transaction approach does not control cases involving a insider who had such access,accord huppe,at.because tonga,like the insiders in at home and huppe,had access to inside information about asi,its acquisition of the note can not come within the borderline exception 
iv.acquisition of the note 
since neither the debt exception nor the borderline transaction exception to liability are applicable here,we turn next to whether the district court erred in concluding that tonga acquisition of the note and its later conversion of that note into shares constituted purchases that should be matched to tonga november sale of asi stock for the purpose of b.we begin,however,by examining whether the note was in fact a new note,or,like the note,merely an amended version of the note.asi does not dispute that if it were the latter,the acquisition of the note could not be considered a b purchase.
as discussed above,the terms of the note differed from those of the note in extending the note maturity date from april,to january,and eliminating the requirement that the principal be converted into shares at maturity.we consider whether these differences were sufficiently material that the later note constituted a,rather than amended security.see romeo dye,at.
tonga argues that the changes in terms should not be deemed material because,in the particular circumstances present here,tonga could not possibly have gained any speculative advantage from its access to inside information at the time that the changed terms of the note were negotiated and the note issued.but even indulging the assumption that a examination of the possibility of speculative abuse of inside information is appropriate in this context,tonga frames the inquiry incorrectly.
in emphasizing the potential for abuse of inside information as of june,tonga looks only to whether the note and the changed terms thereof provided a greater opportunity for trading and profit at acquisition.but our inquiry is not limited to whether the note enhanced tonga ability to abuse inside information merely when tonga acquired the note such an approach inappropriately disregards the possibility of abuse of inside information in deciding whether and when to convert the note once acquired.
nor do we look only to whether the new terms would have made more likely that possibility in the six months following tonga acquisition of the note.the clock would only be relevant if,at this stage of the inquiry,we were to treat the acquisition of the note as a b purchase.true,that the acquired security be is necessary for the acquisition to be a purchase but,as discussed in part v,infra,some acquisitions of securities are nonetheless not b purchases.whether the security is is logically and legally distinct from whether acquiring such a security constitutes a purchase.here,we defer the latter question for the moment,and consider simply whether the june transaction at issue was an acquisition of a,rather than amended security.and for that purpose,the relevant question is whether the changed terms in the note gave tonga a greater opportunity to abuse inside information in trading at any time from acquisition in june to maturity in january.
considered from that standpoint,we agree with the district court view that the changes made from the note to the note were material.the changes allowed tonga more time from april,when the note was to mature,until january within which to use inside information in determining whether and when to convert the note into shares tonga could,in fact,choose to wait until the maturity date itself to make that call,if need be,because the note lacked the mandatory conversion element of the previous note moreover,at maturity,the elimination of that mandatory conversion provision gave tonga latitude to use inside information to determine whether it could realize a greater return from taking the principal balance in cash or from converting that principal into shares for later sale thus,even on tonga preferred approach,the terms of the note were materially altered from those of the note,such that tonga acquired a new security in june.
section b and hybrid derivative securities 
to be clear,the mere fact that tonga acquired a new convertible note in june does not,in itself,mean that this acquisition was a purchase for the purpose of b.although we do conclude that it was,explaining this conclusion requires delving into the intricacies of the regulatory treatment of derivative securities under b and,in particular the different treatment afforded to convertible securities providing an option to acquire shares at a fixed price and securities providing an option to acquire at a floating price and the treatment of hybrid securities.
regulation of derivatives for purposes of b 
derivative securities are financial instruments that derive their value hence the name from an underlying security or index.magma power,at.for purposes of b,derivatives are governed chiefly by regulations adopted by the sec in.see ownership reports and trading by officers,directors and principal security holders,exchange act release,wl,release.these regulations apply broadly,defining derivative securities as any option,warrant,convertible security,stock appreciation right,or similar right with an exercise or conversion privilege at a price related to an equity security,or similar securities with a value derived from the value of an equity security.exchange act rule c,a c emphasis added.underlying the derivative regulations is the sec recogni tion that holding derivative securities is functionally equivalent to holding the underlying equity securities for purposes of section,since the value of the derivative securities is a function of or related to the value of the underlying equity security.release,wl,at.
for b purposes,acquiring a derivative security that gives the holder the option to purchase shares at a fixed price or to convert into shares at a fixed price is treated as equivalent to purchasing the shares directly thus,the sec regulations treat the acquisition of a option rather than its exercise as the triggering event for b purposes.magma power,at this is because the insider opportunity to profit by access to nonpublic information commences when the insider engages in options or other derivative securities that provide an opportunity to obtain or dispose of the stock at a fixed price.magma power,at quoting release,wl,at omission in original.in essence,an insider who takes an option position is making a bet on the future movement of the price of the underlying securities the odds in the insider favor are foreshortened if the wager is backed by inside information.id.in such circumstances,inside information may be advantageous at the time of the acquisition of the option,which is why the sec rules regard acquisition of a option as the relevant b event 
the rules are quite different,however,for options,convertible securities,and the like that allow the purchase of shares at a floating price.rule c excludes r ights with an exercise or conversion privilege at a price that is not fixed from the definition of derivative security.a c.the acquisition of a option or convertible security is therefore not a purchase under b.this is because acquisition of such an option do es not provide an insider the same kind of opportunity for profit since the purchase price of the underlying security is not known in advance.the opportunity to lock in a profit only begins when the exercise price is fixed at that time,the right becomes a derivative security subject to section.release,wl,at emphasis added.thus,because only at exercise is the price fixed and,therefore,the extent of the profit opportunity defined,id.at,a right with a floating exercise price will not be deemed to be acquired or purchased,for section purposes,id.at,until exercise or conversion.
b.the proper b approach to hybrid derivatives 
the sec complementary approach to fixed and options and convertibles is comparatively straightforward.the treatment of a hybrid security with both fixed and features such as presented in this case presents more complications.in this context,we have said,the regulatory mechanism has wheels within wheels.at home,at.it is at least evident under our decision in at home that a hybrid security exercised at a fixed price is properly treated as though it were solely a option,making the timing of acquisition the only relevant transaction for purposes of the b clock.see id.at.but precisely because at home dealt with a hybrid exercised at the fixed price,it had no occasion to address hybrids exercised at a floating price,id.at,the situation presented here.
district courts in this circuit have taken varying approaches in this situation.one view is that a hybrid exercised at a floating price is dealt with as if it were a security,such that its acquisition is a cognizable b purchase,while conversion is a for purposes of the statute.lerner millenco,d,see id.at.the district courts taking this approach reason that where there is a hybrid conversion privilege the fixed price has enabled the investor who has received inside information to lock in his position with a minimum number of shares,and,thereby,realize a minimum profit.levy oz master fund,wl,at july.given this baseline,as the lerner court found,the investor position and his potential for profit can only be enhanced by the operation of the floating component,id.at,and the investor knowledge of these facts creates an incentive to conduct transactions on the basis of inside information,id.
the lerner and oz courts were rightly concerned at the prospect of deeming acquisition irrelevant to b if exercise occurs at the floating price.levy clearwater fund iv,wl,treating a hybrid security exercised at a floating price as containing only a component.but the method of these decisions runs counter to our statement in magma power that where a security contain s two options a fixed price option and a floating price option,the better approach is to treat each option as analytically distinct,and consider them each in turn.at.
in particular,the view,though accounting for the potential abuse of inside information to lock in a minimum number of shares and thus a minimum opportunity for profit,ignores an insider additional opportunity to rely on inside information to time the date of exercise or conversion,so as to maximize the number of shares obtained above the baseline set at acquisition.true,after acquisition,the investor potential for profit can only be enhanced by the operation of the floating price component,oz,wl at but that is little reason to think the floating component irrelevant.section b was,as we have said,intended to be thoroughgoing,to squeeze all possible profits out of stock transactions carried out on inside information,smolowe delendo,cir emphasis added,not merely minimum guaranteed profits.
we thus prefer the approach taken by the district courts in schaffer ex rel.lasersight cc,ldc,d,at home cox commc ns,d,and the present case,analytical surveys,tonga partners,wl.under this bifurcated approach,the acquisition of a hybrid instrument that allows for the purchase of shares constitutes a b purchase of the minimum number of shares that could be acquired if exercise were at the fixed price conversion of the instrument at a lower floating price is a separate b purchase of any additional shares acquired based on the difference between the fixed price and the floating price.but,as discussed above,see supra at,conversion at the fixed price is not an additional purchase for b purposes 
here,for example,it is undisputed that the note had a principal of,that the applicable fixed price at acquisition was,and that tonga converted the note into a total of shares.thus,the district court correctly held that acquisition of the note on june,constituted a b purchase of shares of asi stock,and conversion of the note on november,constituted a b purchase of additional shares.both of these purchases are matchable under b with tonga sale of shares of asi stock between november and november.the district court,applying the b principle of lowest price in,highest price out,smolowe,at,concluded that tonga realized disgorgeable profits on its sale of asi stock of.defendants do not contest these calculations on appeal,and we therefore take them as correct 
vi.beneficial ownership 
defendants argue,next,that even assuming,as we have held,that a b requiring disgorgement occurred,disgorgement should be limited to cannell pecuniary interest in the profits realized from the transactions at issue.on their view,because tonga and cannell capital delegated sole voting and investment power to cannell,under b implementing regulations he was the sole beneficial owner of the securities purchased and sold by tonga,and thus the sole party subject to disgorgement.again,we disagree.
this position is foreclosed by our recent decision in huppe wpcs international.in huppe,as here,defendants included limited partnerships that vested exclusive management and control of the partnerships investment decisions to their respective general partners,which in turn delegated that power over investments to two individuals.at.faced with a b lawsuit,the defendants in huppe argued that given this delegation of authority,the limited partnerships could not be beneficial owners for b purposes.id.at.we held that this inventive argument could not be squared with basic principles of agency law,would be inconsistent with the text and purposes of section b,and if accepted,would seriously weaken the provision.id.at.we concluded that the limited partnerships there were indeed beneficial owners under b,and thus subject to disgorgement.id.at.
we see no distinction between huppe and the present appeal.tonga,like the defendants in huppe,is a limited partnership organized under the laws of delaware,under which cannell
