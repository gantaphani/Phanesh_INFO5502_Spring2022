we hold in this case that a tenant preemptive purchase rights under a commercial lease are not triggered by the conveyance of an interest in the property between copartners in a family limited partnership that owns the property and is the landlord.we affirm the judgment for the defendants.
factual and procedural background 
william signs,owned bill signs trucking,later called bill signs trucking,llc bst.robert neal began managing the business in,with the understanding he would eventually obtain an ownership interest in it.signs and neal became close friends.signs married lori signs in his only child,tammy duncan,is from a former marriage.lori was not on friendly grounds with duncan or neal.
in signs purchased several parcels of land totaling approximately acres on channel road in lakeside,california.signs and neal began developing the parcels and bst moved its operation to approximately six acres of the property.other portions of the property were used for other purposes.
in december signs created the signs family limited partnership sflp and transferred ownership of the channel road property to it,along with other real and personal property.signs was the sole general partner in sflp and he was originally the sole limited partner.his general interest was valued at four percent of the total value of the partnership and his limited interest was valued at percent.
also in december signs created the william signs.children trust children trust to benefit duncan and her children.signs conveyed percent of his limited interest in sflp to duncan as trustee of the children trust.
shortly before their april marriage,signs and lori entered into a prenuptial agreement.it provided that on signs death,lori was to receive percent of his limited interest in sflp and other assets.
in september signs executed the william boyd signs.trust signs revocable trust and transferred his assets to it.duncan and her children were beneficiaries on his death,and lori was eligible to become a beneficiary under the prenuptial agreement.further,signs four percent general interest in sflp and percent of his interest in bst were to be distributed to neal,and neal was named first successor trustee.
in february signs gave neal a percent interest in bst and they entered into an operating agreement for the business.additionally,signs and lori amended their prenuptial agreement to give her percent of his limited interest in sflp on his death.further,the agreement required lori to cooperate to enable neal to purchase the remainder of bst on signs death.
on april,sflp and bst entered into a lease agreement lease of the portion of the channel road property on which the business operates.the lease contains preemptive purchase rights that are the subject of this appeal.
section a of the lease provides landlord sflp agrees that it will not sell the premises to any person until landlord has given to tenant bst notice in writing of its intent to sell,specifying the price and terms of the contemplated sale.under section a,bst had an option to purchase the property at the same price and on the same terms and conditions set forth in the notice of intent to sell.
section b of the lease provides if at any time during the term of this lease landlord receives from any third party a bona fide offer to purchase the premises at a price and on terms acceptable to landlord,landlord shall give written notice of the offer to tenant.within thirty days after landlord gives tenant written notice of the offer,tenant shall have the right to purchase the premises at the same price and on the same terms and conditions set forth in the offer.
also on april,signs amended the signs revocable trust to remove neal as first successor trustee and to designate lori and duncan as cotrustees,and to delete the bequests to neal.duncan was upset about sharing trustee duties with lori,but signs explained he wanted them to learn to get along,and it would all work out and flow smoothly.
in november signs amended sflp in recognition of neal efforts to develop approximately acres of additional land signs purchased for a sand mining venture.this land is referred to separately as the east willow property,but it is also included within the definition of the channel road property.the amendment stated sflp agrees to specially allocate and distribute of net profits from such property east willow property to neal.net profits shall be defined as gross income from rents,royalties,licenses,environmental land bank credits,sale or other income producing uses of the property,net of expenses incurred in generating the gross income.
signs died in january,at which time he held general and limited interests in sflp of four percent and percent,respectively.neal exercised an option to purchase signs interest in bst.
lori and duncan became embroiled in disputes and litigation regarding the management of sflp and duncan wanted out of the partnership.
among the disagreements was the division of signs four percent general interest in sflp.in october,after mediation,lori and duncan approved the signs family limited partnership distribution agreement sflp distribution agreement,under which partnership assets are to be divided and it is to be dissolved.duncan,for herself and the children trust,is to receive two and percent of the general interest increasing her total interest to percent,and lori is to receive percent of it increasing her total interest to percent.additionally,lori is to buy out duncan interest in the channel road property for million.
sflp sent neal a letter notifying him of the sflp distribution agreement and stating it believed the agreement did not trigger bst preemptive purchase rights as to the portion of the property on which bst conducts business.neal disagreed and he and bst sued sflp,lori,duncan and the children trust for specific performance and related counts pending resolution of this litigation,the sflp distribution agreement has not gone into effect.
the parties agreed to a bifurcated procedure,in which the trial court would first determine whether the proposed transfer triggered bst preemptive purchase rights in the lease and the special amendment to sflp.the court found the lease ambiguous and allowed parol evidence on signs intent.the court determined signs did not intend that a transfer between family members would trigger neal preemptive purchase rights,and the proposed transaction was not a bona fide sale to a third party.the court denied neal claim for specific performance of the lease,and also found the special amendment to sflp was not triggered.
discussion 
ilease of review 
a lease agreement is subject to the general rules governing the interpretation of contracts.asp properties group,fard,th,d asp.a contract must be so interpreted as to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties as it existed at the time of contracting,so far as the same is ascertainable and lawful.when possible,the parties mutual intention is to be determined solely from the language of the lease.the clear and explicit meaning of these provisions,interpreted in their ordinary and popular sense,controls judicial interpretation.asp,at,d.interpretation of a contract must be fair and reasonable,not leading to absurd conclusions.citation.ibid.
if a lease is ambiguous on its face,parol evidence is admissible to interpret it.severns union pacific railroad th,d.further,a lease is latently ambiguous if it appears clear on its face,but parol evidence shows it is reasonably susceptible to two or more interpretations.asp,supra,th at,d.in that instance,the decision whether to admit parol or extrinsic evidence involves a process.first,the court provisionally receives without actually admitting all credible evidence concerning the parties intentions to determine ambiguity,whether the language is reasonably susceptible to the interpretation urged by a party.if in light of the extrinsic evidence the court decides the language is reasonably susceptible to the interpretation urged,the extrinsic evidence is then admitted to aid in the second the contract.ibid.the test of admissibility of extrinsic evidence to explain the meaning of a written instrument is not whether it appears to the court to be plain and unambiguous on its face,but whether the offered evidence is relevant to prove a meaning to which the language of the instrument is reasonably susceptible.pacific gas thomas drayage.cal d.
the trial court threshold finding of ambiguity is a question of law subject to our independent review.the court ultimate construction of ambiguous language is subject to our independent review if the extrinsic evidence is not in conflict,even when the parties draw different inferences from the evidence.if the extrinsic evidence conflicts,we uphold any reasonable construction supported by substantial evidence.asp,supra,th at fn,d.
admission of parol evidencea 
bst principal contention is that the court erred by adopting the defendants argument the lease is ambiguous based on section d,which provides the transfer of landlord title to the premises by will or intestancy shall not be deemed to be a sale under the provisions of this section.the court explained the channel road property was transferred to lori and duncan pursuant to signs s will and trust,and thus a transfer between them may not constitute a sale that would trigger bst preemptive purchase rights.bst argued the term any person in section a is necessarily confined to parties other than third parties,because if it means third parties section b,which expressly refers to third party offers,would be redundant.the court found both parties interpretations plausible and admitted parol evidence as to signs intent.
bst contends section d of the lease is inapplicable because the sflp distribution agreement was drafted more than two years after signs death and the proposed transfer of property between lori and duncan is not a transfer by will.bst points out that a decedent property passes on the decedent death to the person to whom it is devised in the decedent last will.
we agree that section d of the lease is inapplicable that does not mean,however,that reversal is warranted.no rule o r decision is better or more firmly established by authority,nor one resting upon a sounder basis of reason and propriety,than that a ruling or decision,itself correct in law,will not be disturbed on appeal merely because given for a wrong reason.if right upon any theory of the law applicable to the case,it must be sustained regardless of the considerations which may have moved the trial court to its conclusion.asp,supra,th at,d.
a preemptive purchase right is a grant from a landowner that gives the grantee the first opportunity to purchase the property if the landowner decides to sell.greenwald asimow,cal.practice guide real property the rutter group,hereafter greenwald asimow.a preemptive purchase right takes one of two forms,a right of first refusal or a right of first offer.
under a right of first refusal,the landowner seller first procures an offer to purchase from a third party on terms and conditions acceptable to the seller.the seller must then present the third party offer to the grantee of the right of first refusal who,in turn,has a limited period to either match the offer or reject it.greenwald asimow,supra.a right of first refusal does not become an option to purchase until the owner of the property voluntarily decides to sell the property and receives a bona fide offer to purchase it from a third party.campbell alger th,d.
because rights of first refusal can adversely affect an owner ability to market its property,a preemptive purchase right often takes the form of a right of first offer.here,the seller,upon deciding to market its property,must first make an offer to the grantee of the right of first offer.if the grantee does not accept that offer,the seller is then free to sell to anyone else on the terms rejected by the grantee or on terms which are not the seller in other words,no other buyer can get a better deal than that which was presented to the grantee.greenwald asimow,supra.
it appears that a lease would ordinarily not contain both a right of first offer and a right of first refusal.the advantage of using a right of first offer rather than a right of first refusal is that once the grantee has rejected the seller offer,the seller is free to proceed with a sale to another buyer without having to go back to the grantee provided the sale is on terms no better than those offered to the grantee.also,once the grantee elects not to accept the seller offer,brokers are more willing to undertake a listing of the property.on the other hand,the seller will at least theoretically have to present to the grantee its price and best terms,since the seller will not be able to accept any price lower than that offered to the grantee.greenwald asimow,supra,at,to,italics added.
here,however,the lease contains both a right of first offer section a and a right of first refusal section b.contrary to bst position,the provisions are not merely alternative ways of stating a right of first refusal.the two sections have different purposes and criteria,and section a may be interpreted to apply only to offers from the landlord to third parties,without rendering redundant section b,which applies to offers from third parties to the landlord.contrary to bst view,interpreting section a to refer to third parties does not render section b surplusage.
additionally,bst concentrates on the any persons language in section a and virtually ignores that it is the landlord who agrees not to sell to any persons without first offering the property to bst on like terms.the term any persons logically refers to parties other than the landlord.under bst interpretation,section a would essentially read landlord sflp agrees that it will not sell the premises to any person sflp until landlord sflp has given to tenant bst notice in writing of its intent to sell,specifying the price and terms of the contemplated sale.
although perhaps the lease could be interpreted as a matter of law,albeit against bst,we can not fault the court for allowing parol evidence to explain the any persons language in section a.the court gave bst the benefit of the doubt by finding section a was reasonably susceptible to its interpretation.the section is also reasonably susceptible to the interpretation that any persons refers exclusively to third parties,and not to of sflp.
bst also asserts that since the lease contains an integration clause,parol evidence was inadmissible.section of the lease provides this instrument constitutes the sole and only agreement between landlord and tenant respecting the premises,the leasing of the premises to tenant,and the lease terms contained in this lease,and correctly sets forth the obligations of landlord and tenant to each other as of its date.any agreements or representations respecting the premises or their leasing by landlord to tenant not expressly set forth in this instrument are null and void.
bst cites code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,under which t erms set forth in a writing intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement with respect to such terms as are included therein may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior agreement or of a contemporaneous oral agreement.the statute is inapplicable as the parol evidence here was introduced to explain the language of section a of the lease,and not to add to or vary the terms of the lease.
section a of the intent 
bst agrees the parol evidence is not in conflict and thus presents a question of law for our independent review.
lawrence faas,a certified public accountant,began doing estate planning and tax work for signs in the.faas testified that signs told him he wanted the channel road property to remain in the family,and for lori and duncan to benefit from the income from that real estate.further,faas testified the property was always intended to be a hold,whether signs held it or whether the family held it,it was expected that it would take a long period before it was sold.
dale mills,an attorney,represented signs for more than years.mills prepared the lease.when asked about signs input on the lease,mills testified that signs was concerned about the continuation of business operations for his trucking
