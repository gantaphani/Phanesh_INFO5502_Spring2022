statutory background 
in,congress responded to perceived abuses of federal securities class action litigation by passing the private securities litigation reform act of pslra,stat.codified at.see merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,dabit,d.the pslra imposed certain limits on such litigation,including limits on recoverable damages and attorneys fees,a safe harbor for statements,mandated sanctions for frivolous litigation,a stay of discovery pending any motion to dismiss,and heightened pleading requirements.id.at.citing dura,broudo,d.these limits on federal securities class actions,however,had an unintended consequence 
they prompted at least some members of the plaintiffs bar to avoid the federal forum altogether.rather than face the obstacles set in their path by the pslra,plaintiffs and their representatives began bringing class actions under state law,often in state court.the evidence presented to congress during a hearing to evaluate the effects of the pslra suggested that this phenomenon was a novel one litigation of class actions involving nationally traded securities had previously been rare.

the unanticipated shift in securities class actions from federal to state court,and from federal to state law,created several problems.as the senate report explained 
disparate,and shifting,state litigation procedures may expose issuers to the potential for significant liability that can not easily be evaluated in advance,or assessed when a statement is made.at a time when we are increasingly experiencing and encouraging national and international securities offerings and listings,and expending great effort to rationalize and streamline our securities markets,this fragmentation of investor remedies potentially imposes costs that outweigh the benefits.rather than permit or foster fragmentation of our national system of securities litigation,we should give due consideration to the benefits flowing to investors from a uniform national approach.

congress responded by passing the securities litigation uniform standards act of slusa,stat.slusa provides for preclusion of certain securities class actions brought under state law 
f limitations on remedies 
class action limitations 
no covered class action based upon the statutory or common law of any state or subdivision thereof may be maintained in any state or federal court by any private party alleging 
a a misrepresentation or omission of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security or 
b that the defendant used or employed any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.
f see also potter janus inv.fund,d,thus,an action will be dismissed under slusa if it is a covered class action,that is based on a state law,alleging a misrepresentation or omission of a material fact or use of any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security,and all of these elements must be present for preclusion to apply.this is not a preemption provision,but rather a preclusion provision it does not itself displace state law with federal law but makes some claims nonactionable through the class action device in federal as well as state court.kircher putnam funds trust,d.
moreover,slusa provides federal courts with removal jurisdiction over class actions that are precluded under f 
removal of covered class actions 
any covered class action brought in any state court involving a covered security,as set forth in paragraph,shall be removable to the federal district court for the district in which the action is pending,and shall be subject to paragraph.
f.if,after removal,the federal court determines that slusa does not preclude the class action,then the federal court must remand it to state court 
preservation of certain actions 
d remand of removed actions 
in an action that has been removed from a state court pursuant to paragraph,if the federal court determines that the action may be maintained in state court pursuant to this subsection,the federal court shall remand such action to such state court.
f d.under these provisions,the jurisdiction conferred upon the federal courts by slusa is,in essence,limited to determining whether f precludes the plaintiffs claims 
once removal jurisdiction under f is understood to be restricted to precluded actions defined by f,a motion to remand claiming the action is not precluded must be seen as posing a jurisdictional issue.if the action is precluded,neither the district court nor the state court may entertain it,and the proper course is to dismiss.if the action is not precluded,the federal court likewise has no jurisdiction to touch the case on the merits,and the proper course is to remand to the state court that can deal with it.in either event,the district court order comes because its adjudicatory power has been exercised and its work is done.

procedural and factual background 
is a defunct new mexico corporation whose stock was previously listed on the nasdaq exchange.john rendall,who is not a party to this action,founded in to develop processes for the extraction of bitumen from oil sands.during all relevant time periods,rendall was the chairman,ceo,and largest individual shareholder of.in march,merrill lynch made a personal loan to rendall for million.as part of the loan agreement,rendall moved an existing million margin account loan to merrill lynch,and he agreed to secure the million in total loan amounts with million shares of his common stock,which represented more than ten percent of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock.in april,barely a month later,merrill lynch informed rendall that it was demanding payment of the entire million debt,and that it intended to sell million of his shares if he could not pay.starting in may,merrill lynch sold of rendall shares on the open market.during this time period,the share price of common stock plunged from on april,to slightly under on june.in july,filed a petition for bankruptcy,and in september,the nasdaq its stock was,and remains,dormant.
on october,plaintiffs filed the instant action against merrill lynch in new mexico state court.plaintiffs alleged that martin zweig and his related entities the zweig entities had maintained prime brokerage relationships with merrill lynch during the time that rendall had pledged his shares to merrill lynch as security for the loans.according to plaintiffs,the zweig entities engaged in of stock throughout and,using merrill lynch prime brokerage accounts,often without closing out their positions within upc rule closeout period.the complaint alleged fourteen separate counts against merrill lynch.in count i,plaintiffs requested an equitable bill of discovery,permitting them to conduct depositions and compel document production in order to determine whether merrill lynch other parties acted inappropriately in stock.in the alternative,in counts ii through xiv of the complaint,plaintiffs set forth claims against merrill lynch under new mexico common and statutory law,alleging breach of fiduciary duty count ii,aiding and abetting tortious action count iii,oppressive conduct count iv,prima facie tort count v,civil conspiracy count vi,negligence count vii,violations of the new mexico securities act of counts viii and ix,violations of the new mexico unfair practices act count x,negligent supervision count xi,control person liability count xii,respondeat superior count xiii,and punitive damages count xiv.the essence of the claims was that merrill lynch induced rendall to open the margin loan account,secured by the million shares of,and then liquidated those shares,flooding the market and driving down the price of solvex stock.
merrill lynch removed the action to the united states district court for the district of new mexico.as its jurisdictional bases for removal,merrill lynch relied upon,as well as slusa,c,f.merrill lynch then filed a motion to dismiss under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,relying upon slusa,f.
on april,the district court granted the motion to dismiss,holding that slusa barred all of plaintiffs claims.the district court held that plaintiffs claims were a covered class action under slusa,despite plaintiffs attempt to seek an equitable bill of discovery as an alternative remedy.the district court also rejected plaintiffs request for leave to amend their complaint to assert a derivative action against merrill lynch on behalf of.the district court explained that plaintiffs have not attached a proposed amended complaint to their response as is required by this district local rules.dist,roa,vol.i,at citing civ.in addition,plaintiffs did not explain how they will be able to meet the requirements for filing an exclusively derivative action under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,or offer any enlightenment on how they could pursue the required exclusive derivative action on these facts.id.the district court further noted that new mexico law does not permit a shareholder to recover for injuries done to the corporation.id.citing marchman ncnb.bank.
the district court then held that slusa barred plaintiffs claims.the district court rejected plaintiffs argument that slusa only precluded claims having elements identical to those required for federal securities fraud,such as scienter.id.at.the district court explained that it is not necessary that the state law claim line up exactly with the requirements of federal securities statutes to be barred by slusa.id.plaintiffs made several allegations in their complaint regarding misrepresentation s or omission s of a material fact and manipulative or deceptive device s,in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security,and the district court held that this was all that slusa required.id.at.
on appeal,plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in determining that slusa precluded their claims.alternatively,they argue that the district court should have granted them leave to amend their complaint.
plaintiffs claims under slusa 
the district court correctly held that slusa precluded plaintiffs claims and mandated dismissal.we review de novo a district court decision on a rule b motion for dismissal for failure to state a claim.alvarado,cir.in doing so,w e must accept all the allegations of the complaint as true and must construe them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.in addition,in determining whether to grant a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,we look to the specific allegations in the complaint to determine whether they plausibly support a legal claim for relief.id.at.
the seminal case on the scope of slusa is the supreme court decision in dabit,in which the court concluded that slusa precluded claims by not just purchasers or covered securities.the court rejected a narrow interpretation of the statutory phrase,in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security,f a,b,despite the plaintiffs argument that those words incorporated the same requirement into slusa that the court had adopted in blue chip stamps manor drug stores,d,for private actions under rule.see dabit,at.the court explained that the limitation adopted in blue chip stamps for private actions did not stem from the text of,but rather from policy considerations.id.at.citing blue chip stamps,at.the court had espoused a broad interpretation when giv ing meaning to the phrase in the context of b and rule,and this broader interpretation of the statutory language comports with the longstanding views of the sec.id.at.under the ordinary principles of statutory construction,therefore,congress intended to incorporate this broad construction when it incorporated the identical language into slusa.id.at.
further,the court in dabit based its broad reading of slusa on the purpose of statute 
the presumption that congress envisioned a broad construction follows not only from ordinary principles of statutory construction but also from the particular concerns that culminated in slusa enactment.a narrow reading of the statute would undercut the effectiveness of the pslra and thus run contrary to slusa stated purpose,to prevent certain state private securities class action lawsuits alleging fraud from being used to frustrate the objectives of the pslra.as the blue chip stamps court observed,class actions brought by holders rather than just purchasers or sellers pose a special risk of vexatious litigation.it would be odd,to say the least,if slusa exempted that particularly troublesome subset of class actions from its sweep.
id.at.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.a narrow interpretation of slusa would squarely conflict with the congressional preference for national standards for securities class action lawsuits involving nationally traded securities.id.at.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.in addition,the court in dabit concluded that the general presumption against preemption of causes of action 
carries less force here than in other contexts because slusa does not actually any state cause of action.it simply denies plaintiffs the right to use the class action device to vindicate certain claims.the act does not deny any individual plaintiff,or indeed any group of fewer than plaintiffs,the right to enforce any cause of action that may exist.
moreover,the tailored exceptions to slusa command demonstrate that congress did not by any means act cavalierly here.the statute carefully exempts from its operation certain class actions based on the law of the state in which the issuer of the covered security is incorporated,actions brought by a state agency or state pension plan,actions under contracts between issuers and indenture trustees,and derivative actions brought by shareholders on behalf of a corporation.the statute also expressly preserves state jurisdiction over state agency enforcement proceedings.the existence of these both evinces congressional sensitivity to state prerogatives in this field and makes it inappropriate for courts to create additional,implied exceptions.
id.at.citing f a c,f,f c.
plaintiffs argument in the instant case parallels the argument that the supreme court rejected in dabit.the essence of plaintiffs argument is that,because slusa employs language similar to that in rule slusa only precludes state law claims that are virtually identical to a federal securities fraud claim under,claims requiring plaintiffs to allege the essential elements of scienter and reliance.under this standard,plaintiffs argue,slusa does not preclude any of their claims under new mexico law,because none of their claims are required to elements of scienter and reliance.
plaintiffs are not unique in making this argument,and courts have almost uniformly rejected it as contrary to the structure,intent,and plain language of slusa.as the eleventh circuit has explained 
slusa amends both the act and the act,preempting claims brought under both of those statutes.the sections of slusa that amend the act track the language of and a,and claims under and a of the act do not require a showing of scienter.thus,slusa preempts some,those brought under or a of the lack a scienter requirement.accordingly,we can not accept the plaintiffs contention that scienter is the dispositive
