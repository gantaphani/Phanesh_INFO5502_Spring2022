this appeal concerns the standing of the trustee of a bankrupt corporation litigation trust to sue third parties who allegedly assisted corporate insiders in defrauding the corporation creditors.the appeal primarily raises the issue of whether,under new york law,the acts of the corporate insiders can be imputed to the corporation,in which event,pursuant to the wagoner rule,the trustee for a debtor corporation lacks standing to recover against third parties for damage to the creditors,see shearson lehman hutton,wagoner,cir,or whether the adverse interest exception precludes imputation.marc kirschner the trustee,in his capacity as the trustee of the refco litigation trust,appeals from the may,judgment of the district court for the southern district of new york gerard lynch,then district judge,dismissing the trustee suit for lack of standing under the wagoner rule.see kirschner grant thornton llp,civ,wl.the trustee brought the suit on behalf of refco group,llc rgl,its indirect subsidiary,refco capital markets,rcm,and refco,the entity created by refco initial public offering collectively refco against senior management of refco,law firms,and accounting firms that allegedly participated in defrauding refco creditors.
the trustee principally argues that the district court erred in imputing the insiders wrongdoing to refco because,the trustee contends,the refco insiders,in perpetrating the fraud,totally abandoned refco interests,and therefore the adverse interest exception to imputation applies.we conclude that the issues concerning imputation and the adverse interest exception raise questions of new york law as to which considerable uncertainty exists.we therefore certify to the new york court of appeals questions the answers to which will govern our ultimate disposition of this appeal.
background 
making clear why we believe certification of state law questions is needed requires a detailed account of the trustee factual allegations and a full understanding of the district court opinion.
the background facts are taken from the trustee complaint,the allegations of which are assumed to be true for purposes of adjudicating the defendants motion to dismiss.these facts are well summarized in the district court opinion 
i.the refco fraud 
prior to its collapse in the fall of,refco was among the world largest providers of brokerage and clearing services in the international derivatives,currency,and futures markets.compl.beginning in the late,refco controlling bennett,tone grant,robert trosten,and santo maggio collectively,the insiders with the aid of certain professionals and financial advisors,orchestrated a complex fraudulent scheme to artificially enhance refco performance and conceal refco true financial condition,so that these insiders,through the company august leveraged lbo and its august ipo,could cash out their interests in refco on lucrative terms.compl,that scheme,which has been thoroughly discussed in the district court prior opinions,involved both concealment of refco uncollectible debt and the misappropriation of customer assets.
the concealment of refco uncollectible debt involved a process.first,hundreds of millions of dollars in uncollectible trading losses and other operating expenses were transferred and converted into legitimate receivables owed to refco by rghi,a holding company,or,owned by bennett and grant.compl,these transfers offloaded debt from refco,specifically holding company through which refco business was primarily conducted prior to the ipo and which was controlled by artificially inflated rgl earnings capability.compl.refco apparent financial outlook was further improved by the fact that refco then charged rghi as much as percent interest on the sham receivables,which between and amounted to at least million.compl.although that accrued interest was recorded as income at refco,it was never,in fact,collected.id.
next,the insiders disappeared the receivables parked at rghi through a series of loans.this additional maneuver was necessary because the disclosure of large sum of which dwarfed refco net have raised red flags among investors and regulators.compl.these loans,which straddled the end of each fiscal year starting in and,after the lbo,at the end of several fiscal quarters as well,all worked in essentially the same way.compl.several days before refco closed its books for each financial period,unregulated,indirect subsidiary wholly owned by rgl and thus by bennett and grant compl,would loan hundreds of millions of dollars to a customer who then,through the customer account at refco,simultaneously loaned the same amount to rghi.compl.the loan agreements between the third party and were done on a book basis the principal never changed hands were meticulously structured so that they were essentially to the customers the customers loans to rghi were guaranteed by refco,and the customers profited for their participation in the loans through interest earned on their loans to rghi,which by design exceeded the interest they were charged by rcm.compl.rghi,in turn,used the loans from the customers to pay down the money it owed to refco for its uncollectible receivables.compl.the net effect of these transactions was that at the close of each reporting period,refco books would show apparently legitimate loans to customers,and the rghi receivables would be gone.id.then,just days after the financial period closed,the transactions were loans were repaid,and the uncollectible receivables from rghi were returned to refco books.compl.through these transactions,refco lent money to itself,through third parties,to conceal its trading losses,its true operating expenses,and the fictitious nature of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.compl.
in addition to concealing refco debt,the insiders routinely misappropriated customer assets held at rcm in order to obtain cash infusions to prop up other refco entities.compl,this cash was distributed to refco affiliates through a series of intercompany transfers that contained no safeguards and for which no appropriate documents were kept.compl,although the receiving entities had no ability to repay these loans,refco overall financial health depended on the steady influx of these illicit rcm assets compl,and,accordingly,the insiders kept careful track of these transactions and distributed among themselves daily cash flow statements that calculated the amount of customer assets available for diversion to other refco entities.compl.the size of these uncollateralized intercompany the size of refco concealed substantial they involved hundreds of millions of dollars and dwarfed refco total capital.compl,at the time of the lbo,refco affiliates owed rcm approximately two billion dollars.compl.
ii.the lbo and ipo 
the illusion of a thriving company enabled refco insiders to position refco for,and ultimately to carry out,what appeared to be a legitimate of the insiders interests for far more than those interests were worth.in,after a number of unsuccessful attempts at the partial or complete sale of their interests in refco compl,thomas lee partners thl,a private equity firm,purchased a percent controlling interest in refco for million as part of a leveraged transaction lbo compl.for its part,refco sold million in unregistered notes to the investment bank defendants and obtained million in financing.compl,this billion of bank and bond debt,which refco could not possibly repay compl,became senior to the debt owed to rcm,refco largest creditor.compl.the lbo was lucrative,however,for the insiders bennett and others received million,with at least million going to bennett personally.compl.
less than a year after the lbo,with refco still concealing its grim financial condition,refco insiders and thl led refco through an initial public offering of its stock.the offering generated million in proceeds for refco and approximately million in proceeds for the selling shareholders.compl.some of the ipo proceeds were used to retire part of rgl lbo move that the trustee characterizes as waste because rgl was already insolvent compl.but,consistent with maintaining refco good reputation and the ongoing concealment of
