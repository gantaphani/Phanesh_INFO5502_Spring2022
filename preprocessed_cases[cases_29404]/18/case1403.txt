the responsible corporate officer doctrine was developed by the united states supreme court to hold corporate officers in responsible positions of authority personally liable for violating strict liability statutes protecting the public welfare.hustis gotanda,the responsible corporate officer designated felon or legal fiction loyola chi,citing united states dotterweich.dotterweich and united states park,d park.it is a common law theory of liability separate from piercing the corporate veil or imposing personal liability for direct participation in tortious conduct.celentano rocque,fn.
the trial court here used the responsible corporate officer doctrine to impose in monetary civil penalties on two individuals defendants john roscoe and ned roscoe hereafter the roscoes who were officers,directors,and shareholders of a family company for an underground storage tank that leaked over gallons of gasoline into the ground.the family company that owned and operated the tank was also held jointly and severally liable.
the majority of the monetary penalties were imposed pursuant to the laws governing underground storage of hazardous substances,which we collectively refer to as the tank laws.health et the main statute of the tank laws at issue here is section,subdivision a,which imposes on a ny operator of an underground tank system a civil penalty of not less than five hundred dollars or more than five thousand dollars for each underground storage tank for each day of violation for v iolation of any regulation adopted by the state water resources control b oard 
we hold that the responsible corporate officer doctrine applies to section,subdivision a of the tank laws and thus subjects to liability as an operator a corporate officer who has a responsible share in the furtherance of the transaction which the statute outlaws dotterweich,supra,at.at.at,even where the corporation itself is also found to be the operator.
factual and procedural background 
in an underground storage tank owned and operated by the customer company leaked over gallons of gasoline into the ground in the city of galt.the customer company was a family company in which the roscoes were officers,directors,and shareholders.after the leak occurred,employee john johnson notified the sacramento county environmental management department the department about the leak,and consultant parker environmental services was eventually hired to oversee the remediation.
cleanup of the leak did not proceed timely and adequately,however,and the department sent multiple notices to the customer company that it was violating federal and state statutes and regulations.these notices were opened by john roscoe,who considered them to be form letters,which he passed on to employee johnson.when johnson received the notices,he referred them to jim parker to find out how to resolve the matter.johnson did nothing further,and nobody else from the customer company attempted to make sure the problems were addressed.
in,the sacramento county district attorney filed a civil lawsuit against the customer company and the roscoes among others for violating the tank laws.the lawsuit alleged,among other things,that the customer company and the roscoes failed to submit mandatory work plans for source removal of an existing unauthorized fuel release,failed to take or contract for mandatory interim remedial actions to abate or correct the effects of the unauthorized fuel release,failed to submit appropriate work plans,and failed to timely submit mandatory quarterly reports.
after a bench trial,the trial court issued a statement of decision holding the customer company and the roscoes jointly and severally liable for in penalties the court based its holding of the corporation liability on a finding that the customer company was in fact the owner and operator of the tank at the time the leak occurred the court based its holding of the roscoes personal liability on the responsible corporate officer doctrine.the court found that overall authority for company affairs was retained by john and ned roscoe.they could have prevented or remedied promptly the noticed violations of the regulations,but they did not exercise their responsibilities and power to use all objectively possible means to discover,prevent,and remedy any and all violations.had a timely cleanup operation occurred,the cost likely would have been approximately instead of the million already paid by the state of california underground storage cleanup fund.
the roscoes appeal the judgment.providing only a clerk transcript,they contend generally the court erred in applying the responsible corporate officer doctrine to hold them personally liable and the penalties imposed were excessive.
as explained below,we disagree with both contentions.
discussion 
ithe responsible corporate officer doctrine applies to the tank law violations at issue here and the roscoes are personally liable under that doctrine 
the roscoes contend the court erred in applying the responsible corporate officer doctrine to hold them personally liable for violations of the tank laws.they argue the doctrine should not be applied to civil cases,can not be applied to them because the trial court found the customer company to be the owner and operator of the tank,and can not be applied where there is no evidence of wrongful conduct.as we will explain,the roscoes are mistaken on all counts.
we begin with the language of the tank law statutes at issue here.section,subdivision a reads in pertinent part any operator of an underground tank system shall be liable for a civil penalty of not less than five hundred dollars or more than five thousand dollars for each underground storage tank for each day of violati ng any regulation adopted by the state water resources control b oard for purposes of the tank laws,an operator is any person in control of,or having daily responsibility for,the daily operation of an underground storage tank system,subd.j.a person is an individual,trust,firm,joint stock company,corporation,including a government corporation,partnership,limited liability company,or association.person also includes any city,county,district,the state,another state of the united states,any department or agency of this state or another state,or the united states to the extent authorized by federal law,subd.l.
using section as the operative statute,the trial court held the roscoes personally liable under the responsible corporate officer doctrine.the roots of this doctrine are found in the supreme court cases of dotterweich and park.iverson cir.
in dotterweich,the supreme court addressed whether the manager of a corporation,as well as the corporation itself,could be liable under the food,drug,and cosmetics act of the act,which imposed criminal liability on a ny person shipping adulterated or misbranded drugs.dotterweich,supra,at.at.at.the federal appellate court had reversed dotterweich conviction on the ground that only the company was the person subject to prosecution unless the company was a counterfeit corporation serving as a screen for dotterweich.dotterweich,at.at,at.the supreme court disagreed and held that the offense is committed by all who have a responsible share in the furtherance of the transaction which the statute outlaws.dotterweich,at.at.at.central to the court holding was that the act was public welfare legislation and the statute imposed strict liability.dotterweich,at.at.at.specifically,the act extended the range of congress control over illicit and noxious articles and stiffened the penalties for disobedience,thus touch ing phases of the lives and health of people which,in the circumstances of modern industrialism,are largely beyond.dotterweich,at.at.at.and the statute allowed for criminal conviction without proof of awareness of some wrongdoing,thus put ting the burden of acting at hazard upon a person otherwise innocent but standing in responsible relation to a public danger.dotterweich,at.at,at.
the supreme court further explained why dotterweich,and not just the corporation,was liable.the statute makes any person who violates it guilty of a misdemeanor.it specifically defines person to include corporation.citation.but the only way in which a corporation can act is through the individuals who act on its behalf if,then,dotterweich is not subject to the act,it must be solely on the ground that individuals are immune when the person who violates the statute is a corporation,although from the point of view of action the individuals are the corporation.dotterweich,supra,at.at,at.the court examined the evolution of the establishment of criminal liability for a corporation,noting that it had taken time to establish criminal liability also for a corporation and not merely for its agents and were the court to hold the act freed all individuals,except when proprietors,from culpability,such a holding would defeat the very object of the new act,which was designed to enlarge and stiffen the penal net and not to narrow and loosen it.dotterweich,at.at.at.
using this reasoning,the court found that dotterweich had a responsible share in the furtherance of the transaction which the statute outlaws dotterweich,supra,at.at.at,even though he had no personal connection with either shipment of misbranded and adulterated drugs and was simply in general charge of the corporation business and had given general instructions to its employees to fill orders received from physicians united states buffalo pharmacal,revd.sub,dotterweich,at.at,at.
the supreme court further defined the scope of the responsible corporate officer doctrine over years later in park.there,the court considered whether the chief executive officer of a national corporation with approximately employees was subject to liability under the act for storage of food that had become contaminated by rodents.park,supra,at.at,d at.park had argued he was not liable because he employed a system in which he relied upon his subordinates even though he was ultimately responsible for this system.park,at.at,d at.finding he was liable,the court enunciated the following standard for corporate officer liability under the act the government establishes a prima facie case when it introduces evidence sufficient to warrant a finding by the trier of the facts that the defendant had,by reason of his position in the corporation,responsibility and authority either to prevent in the first instance,or promptly to correct,the violation complained of,and that he failed to do so.the failure thus to fulfill the duty imposed by the interaction of the corporate agent authority and the statute furnishes a sufficient causal link.the considerations which prompted the imposition of this duty,and the scope of the duty,provide the measure of culpability.park,at.at,d at.
in the years following dotterweich and park,lower federal courts have applied the responsible corporate officer doctrine to other federal statutes,including the clean water act et iverson,supra,at and the resource conservation and recovery act united states johnson towers,cir.similarly,state courts have applied the doctrine to state statutes,including california hazardous waste control act et people matthews th,d,minnesota hazardous waste laws matter of dougherty,indiana environmental management act com r,of envir.management rlg,washington water pollution control act state,of ecology lundgren,and wisconsin solid and hazardous waste laws state rollfink.
with this background in mind,we turn to whether the responsible corporate officer doctrine applies to the tank law violations here.similar to the statute at issue in dotterweich,section,subdivision a is a strict liability statute because it imposes penalties on any operator of an underground tank system for violation of regulations adopted by the state water resources control board without any mens rea dotterweich,supra,at.at.at.also similar to dotterweich,the roscoes contend the corporation was the only operator subject to prosecution because the trial court found the corporation to be the owner and operator of the tank at the time the leak occurred.see dotterweich,at.at.at.the roscoes contention would be persuasive if an individual corporate officer is immune from liability when the operator that violates section,subdivision a is a corporation.see dotterweich,at.at.at.to determine whether this is true,we turn first to the statutory language at issue.see california forestry california fish game commission th,d the first step in any statutory analysis is to examine the language of the statute if there is no ambiguity,the plain meaning governs.
the plain language of the statutes does not readily answer whether a corporate officer is immune from liability under the responsible corporate officer doctrine if the corporation has been found to be the operator.on one hand,section,subdivision a does not limit liability to a single operator rather it imposes liability on a ny operator.similarly,section,subdivision j does not define operator as the person in control of or having daily responsibility for the tank rather it defines operator as any person.this broad language could be read as supporting imposition of liability on both the corporate officer and the corporation when appropriate.on the other hand,section,subdivision l does not specifically include a corporate officer in the definition of person.this could be read as a limitation on a corporate officer liability.
to resolve this ambiguity,we look to extrinsic sources in construing the statutes,keeping in mind that we must choose the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the lawmakers,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute s.california forestry california fish game commission,supra,th at,d.
in enacting the tank laws,the legislature found and declared,the protection of the public from releases of hazardous substances is an issue of statewide concern,subd.a.it therefore is in the public interest to establish orderly procedures that will ensure existing tanks be properly maintained,inspected,tested,and upgraded so that the health,property,and resources of the people of the state will be protected,subd.a b.using language from dotterweich,regard for these purposes should infuse construction of the legislation if it is to be treated as a working instrument of government and not merely as a collection of english words.dotterweich,supra,at.at.at.
consistent with these purposes,the legislature has repeatedly amended the tank laws to cast a broader net of liability by expanding the definition of person and operator.for example,when section was adopted in,it contained narrower definitions of person and operator.specifically,former section defined person as any individual,trust,firm,joint stock company,corporation,including a governmental corporation,partnership,and association.stats,ch.person also included any city,county,district,the state,or any department or agency thereof.ibid.operator meant the operator of an underground storage tank.stats,ch.one year later,the legislature expanded the definition of person to include the united states,to the extent authorized by federal law.stats,ch.in,the legislature expanded the definition of operator to read any person in control of,of having daily responsibility for,the daily operation of an underground storage tank system.stats,ch.in,the legislature expanded the definition of person again to include a limited liability company.stats,ch.and in,it expanded the definition yet another time to include another state,or the united states.stats,ch.this expansion of the persons subject to liability strongly indicates the legislature intent was to increase the reach of the tank laws instead of narrow it.
based on the legislative history of the tank laws,specifically their purposes and the evolution of the statutory language,section,subdivision a is the type of strict liability public welfare statute about which the court in dotterweich was concerned when articulating that a corporate officer can be held responsible without awareness of some wrongdoing.dotterweich,supra,at.at,at.we therefore hold that the responsible corporate officer doctrine applies to section,subdivision a of the tank laws and subjects to liability as a ny operator a corporate officer who h
