this is a dispute over the exercise of an option to acquire a interest in a limited partnership.tenaska vi,and tenaska grimes partners,two affiliates of tenaska,collectively,tenaska who held a majority interest in the limited partnership,allege lg e capital violated the option provision by exercising the option with an agreement already in place to transfer the interest to a third party.tenaska also alleges lg e failure to disclose the reason for requesting an extension of the option deadline which tenaska granted should void the exercise of the option.the district court rejected tenaska claims.we affirm.
in,four,ku capitol kucc,and affiliates of illinova generating illinova and continental energy services continental formed a partnership called tenaska power partners power partners to develop power plant projects in the western united states.tenaska served as managing partner.
in,power partners considered developing a power plant in grimes county,texas.after power partners spent over million on the project,including of kucc money,tenaska determined the grimes plant did not meet power partner criteria for project development.when the other partners objected,tenaska invited continental and illinova to form a separate limited partnership called tenaska frontier partners,frontier partners to develop and operate the grimes plant.tenaska wanted to exclude kucc because howard hawks,tenaska,disagreed with positions taken by kucc in the operation and financing of power partners.the other partners,however,believed kucc should be allowed to join the new limited partnership.tenaska ultimately relented and invited kucc to join frontier partners,but by that time it was too late for kucc to obtain corporate approval.so,instead of joining frontier partners outright,kucc negotiated an option to participate in frontier partners.
the option allowed kucc to acquire a interest in frontier partners in exchange for kucc promise to advance up to million to fund the grimes plant,and other funding promises.the option agreement contained an provision which stated t his agreement may not be assigned by any party to any other person.app.the agreement placed no restrictions,however,on kucc ability to transfer the interest after the option was exercised.lg e had to use or lose the option by june.
as a result of a corporate merger in the spring of,lg e became kucc parent company and succeeded to kucc rights and obligations under the option agreement.lg e evaluated whether to exercise the option and ultimately decided not to participate in frontier partners.at the same time,illinova wanted a bigger share of the limited partnership illinova had,continental,and the two tenaska affiliates,and approached lg e about exercising the option for the sole purpose of immediately transferring the interest to it.lg e was willing to deal,but it wanted to be fully protected from the economic consequences of exercising the option.lg e therefore insisted that an agreement be in place with illinova prior to the option exercise.
by june,the date the option was to expire,lg e had not reached an agreement with illinova.lg e called tenaska and asked for a extension.lg e did not say why it needed the extension and tenaska did not ask.tenaska granted a extension.during that week,lg e and illinova finalized a memorandum of agreement in which illinova agreed to purchase lg e interest after lg e exercised the option.illinova also agreed to indemnify lg e for all financial obligations resulting from the exercise of the option.
on july,lg e exercised the option and then immediately transferred the interest to illinova.lg e waited about a month before telling tenaska about the transfer.by that time,the financial closing on the grimes plant was just a week away.tenaska claims it objected to the transfer,but because it was concerned about the closing,tenaska represented to the lender that it approved of the transfer.tenaska assured lg e in correspondence regarding lg e financial obligations that it would straighten out all of the disarray after financial closing.app.
after exercising the option,lg e provided letters of credit for the project totaling million,which illinova independently guaranteed.in addition,after the material terms of the memorandum of agreement were disclosed,tenaska accepted certain payments directly from illinova to satisfy funding obligations for the project.but after a successful closing,tenaska refused to convey the interest to lg tenaska claimed the exercise of the option was void because it would not have extended the option deadline if lg e had disclosed the reason for requesting the extension.tenaska also claimed lg e exercise of the an agreement already in place to transfer the interest to the option provision.
lg e filed an action in federal district court alleging breach of contract and requesting the court to order a transfer of the interest.the parties brought for summary judgment.the district court found in lg e favor and ordered tenaska to transfer the interest to lg tenaska timely appealed the district court decision.
the district court determination that lg e had no duty to disclose the reason for requesting an extension of the option deadline,as well as its determination that the lg transaction was not an impermissible assignment of the option,present issues of nebraska law we review de novo.see actonet,allou health beauty care,cir.
a.the request to extend the option deadline 
tenaska contends lg e failure to disclose the reason for requesting an extension of the option deadline supports a claim of fraudulent concealment under nebraska law.a claim of fraudulent concealment consists of several elements,the first of which requires proof that a party had a duty to disclose a material fact.streeks,diamond hill farms.the parties dispute whether tenaska has shown lg e had a duty to disclose its reason for requesting an extension of the option deadline.
in determining whether a duty to disclose has been triggered,nebraska follows the restatement second of torts,streeks,at,which provides in relevant part that 
o ne party to a business transaction is under a duty to exercise reasonable care to disclose to the other before the transaction is consummated,
a matters known to him that the other is entitled to know because of a fiduciary or other similar relation of trust and confidence between them and 
e facts basic to the transaction,if he knows that the other is about to enter into it under a mistake as to them,and that the other,because of the relationship between them,the customs of the trade or other objective circumstances,would reasonably expect a disclosure of those facts.
restatement second of torts.tenaska relies on these provisions to contend lg e had an obligation to disclose the reason for the requested extension.
fiduciary relationship 
tenaska contends lg e owed it a fiduciary duty because of the contractual relationship between the parties,that is,the option agreement.we disagree.the general rule is that a contract between two parties does not give rise to a fiduciary relationship or trigger a duty to disclose material facts.lincoln benefit life edwards,d,aff,cir.tenaska nevertheless argues a fiduciary relationship arose because lg e was planning to assign the option in violation of the contract.we are not persuaded by that argument because it presupposes lg e transaction with illinova breached the contract,a premise we reject.furthermore,it suggests a party intended breach of contract triggers a fiduciary duty to disclose that intention.that would transform many breach of contract actions into tort actions involving a fiduciary duty to disclose,a proposition we reject out of hand.
tenaska next asserts that,if the option agreement alone did not create a duty to disclose,lg e other business relationships with tenaska did.as a result of its acquisition of kucc,lg e obtained interests in several tenaska projects.tenaska argues those ancillary business relationships triggered a fiduciary duty,as well as lg e prospective partnership in frontier partners.we disagree.whatever fiduciary duties lg e may have owed tenaska in other tenaska projects were limited to those ventures,silverman miller in re silverman,f iduciary status can not be extended beyond this corporate relationship to apply to all subsequent business dealings between these parties.gcm.cent.life ins,whether a partner owes a fiduciary duty to another partner or the partnership,the scope of that duty is limited to partnership dealings.lipinski lipinski,addressing a joint venture and holding that the relationship between the parties was fiduciary in character but that such relationship and its obligations were limited to the enterprise in which they were mutually engaged.in addition,the partnership agreement for frontier partners was governed by texas law,which imposes no duties on a prospective partner.see also.eliminating the fiduciary duty nebraska had previously recognized during the formation stage of a partnership.
finally,tenaska argues lg e had a fiduciary duty to disclose the reason for requesting the extension of the option deadline because illinova,as an existing partner,breached a fiduciary duty to tenaska by negotiating with lg e behind tenaska back.tenaska contends illinova fiduciary duties should extend to lg e.we disagree with this novel position,for which tenaska cites no authority.whether illinova breached a fiduciary duty to tenaska by dealing with lg e is entirely separate,we believe,from whether lg e itself had a duty to disclose its reason for requesting an extension.
facts basic to the transaction 
tenaska also claims lg e had an obligation to disclose the reason for the extension request because it was a fact basic to the transaction.the district court concluded lg e intent to sell the prospective partnership agreement to illinova did not concern the basis or essence of lg e transaction with tenaska,and thus did not give rise to a duty to disclose.we agree with the district court.
the facts basic to the transaction between lg e and tenaska concerned the value of the partnership interest,and the other consideration exchanged for the right to the option.lg e possible intentions after exercising the option were immaterial to the option agreement itself.thus,when lg e requested an extension,it was not obligated to disclose its intention to sell to illinova because that transaction was not a fact basic to the transaction with tenaska.
violation of the provision 
tenaska argues the lg transaction should be construed as an assignment of the option thereby breaching the provision,because lg e had already reached an agreement with illinova to transfer the interest before the option was exercised.we disagree for several reasons.
first,we conclude tenaska is estopped from contending lg e breached the option provision.tenaska received a copy of the lg memorandum of agreement on august,and thus knew all the material details regarding the lg transaction on that date.nevertheless,tenaska subsequently accepted letters of credit from lg e totaling million.tenaska also accepted money directly from illinova in response to a cash call to fund a turbine payment for the grimes project.the cash call occurred after the memorandum of agreement had been disclosed and tenaska accepted illinova payments without reserving its right to contest the exercise of the option.thus,contrary to the dissent suggestion,it is undisputed that tenaska accepted benefits resulting from lg e exercise of the option and subsequent sale to illinova with full knowledge of the material terms of the memorandum of agreement.despite this,tenaska now wants to avoid its corresponding obligation to transfer the interest.the acceptance of any benefit from a transaction or contract,with knowledge or notice of the facts and rights,will create an estoppel.baye airlite plastics,collecting nebraska cases setting forth the test for applying estoppel in a contract case see also total petroleum,davis,cir holding equitable estoppel prevents a party who has full knowledge of the facts from accepting the benefits of a transaction,contract,or order and subsequently taking an inconsistent position to avoid corresponding obligations.
second,even if we turn a blind eye to the estoppel issue,and further assume the lg transaction constituted an assignment of the option,we still could not side with tenaska.in several cases involving contracts,the nebraska supreme court has refused to enforce provisions where the contract has been fully performed or if assignee offers and is able to complete performance.panwitz miller oil,emphasis in original see also obermeier bennett,martin baxter,riffey schulke,wagner cheney.the nebraska supreme court recently applied this principle to a case outside the context.folgers architects kerns,citing panwitz.the court noted the intent of a provision against assignment of rights under a contract is generally to allow the parties to choose with whom they contract,and refused to enforce an provision where the assignment did not affect the parties actual performance of the contract.id.when read together,we believe these cases indicate nebraska would not enforce an provision under the circumstances involved in this case.clearly,the alleged assignee,illinova,had offered and was able to complete performance of its obligations under the limited partnership.
furthermore,tenaska can hardly complain that its right to choose with whom it contracts is hindered,since illinova is already an existing partner in the limited partnership.the dissent disagrees,emphasizing tenaska right to control with whom and at what time it chose to offer a percentage of its own partnership interest.post at.but the facts of record undercut this argument.before the lg e option was exercised,tenaska had engaged in negotiations to transfer to illinova an additional interest in the limited partnership in the event lg e elected not to participate in the partnership.app.indeed,the facts suggest tenaska was more than willing to transfer some of its partnership share to illinova,so long as tenaska received the financial benefit of that transaction.see app.recounting hawks displeasure with the lg transaction merely b ecause i did get anything.
finally,and most importantly,the lg transaction was a permissible sale of the interest following an exercise of the option,and did not constitute an assignment of the option itself.under nebraska law,the intention of the assignor must be to transfer a present interest in the debt or fund or subject matter if this is clearly expressed,the transaction is an assignment otherwise not.tilden beckmann,emphasis added.tenaska can not show that the memorandum of agreement reflects lg e clear intention to transfer to illinova a present interest in the option agreement.the memorandum of agreement states that lg e hereby grants illinova the exclusive right and option to purchase the kucc partnership interest at any time after the transfer of such partnership interest to lg e pursuant to the option agreement.app.emphasis added.thus,the memorandum of agreement expressly sets forth lg e intention to transfer a future interest should it exercise the option.
in craig farmers mut.ins,the nebraska supreme court applied tilden to the assignment provisions of a ranch sale agreement,and drew a clear distinction between agreements transferring present and future interests.id.at.the ranch at issue was an asset of a bankrupt corporation,to which the bankruptcy trustee,craig,was found to have title in late.in february,craig purchased a policy from farmers mutual that provided property damage coverage for certain ranchhouses and buildings,then made attempts to sell the property.before craig negotiated a sale,some of the ranch buildings were vandalized.in august,craig sold the ranch in an agreement that provided 
seller craig shall assign to buyer big b,all right,title and interest of seller to any insurance proceeds for damage in regard to any claims prior to the date of this agreement and for damage in regard to any claim subsequent to the date of this agreement provided,however,that buyer shall use any insurance proceeds to repair or improve the property.
in the suit brought by craig to recover insurance proceeds for the vandalism,farmers mutual argued that craig assigned his entire interest in the insurance contract to big b,and therefore was not the proper party and lacked standing to bring the suit against farmers mutual.id.at.craig contended the language of the sale agreement indicates an agreement for future assignment of interest in the proceeds of an insurance policy and that while the insurance proceeds were assigned,the cause of action to obtain the proceeds was not.id.emphasis added.the nebraska supreme court agreed,stating the evidence shows that craig had no intent to transfer a present interest in the policy,but,rather,that he agreed to transfer the proceeds,if any,of the policy when those proceeds were obtained.id.
the lg memorandum of agreement is comparable to the b ranch sale agreement.neither agreement expresses an intent to transfer a present interest in the subject matter of the agreement.both agreements demonstrate an intent to transfer the subject matter in the future should that interest be obtained.we believe the interest distinction made in craig controls this case,and thus conclude the lg transaction did not constitute an impermissible assignment of the option.
the dissent claims section of the memorandum of agreement made illinova obligated for all financial burdens associated with the option interest before lg e even became a partner of tfp.post at emphasis added.we disagree.section sets forth the manner in which the purchase price of the partnership interest was to be is its clear and only purpose.one of the three components of the purchase price was the amount needed to reimburse lg e for any funding obligations it might incur prior to exercising its option.app.the agreement reference to that amount as part of the purchase price did not somehow impose a present financial obligation upon illinova triggered before lg e even exercised the option or before illinova had purchased the interest,and thus did not transform the memorandum of agreement into the transfer of a present interest in the option agreement.
we feel obliged to respond to an argument tenaska did not make in the district court,and did not make on appeal,but which the dissent raises for the first time.the dissent contends lg e breached the power partners limited partnership agreement,specifically,that the e transaction violates section iii,which the dissent construes as a notice provision.post at.
first,we disagree that section iii operates as a notice provision.that section provides,in its entirety,that no partnership interest may be transferred by sale,transfer,or otherwise if iii such transfer would adversely affect the financial and operating integrity of the partnership,any individual partner,parent,or affiliate thereof.app.thus,the partnership could refuse to approve a transfer of interest because the transfer would adversely affect the financial and operating integrity of the partnership,but not because a partner failed to give notice prior to the transfer.
second,tenaska never claimed or argued in the district court or before this court that lg e breached the limited partnership agreement,either on the ground the transfer would adversely affect the financial and operating integrity of the partnership,or because of an alleged deficiency in notice.therefore,any such claim has been waived.turpin county of rock,cir.
finally,the dissent suggests lg e violated the partnership agreement to the extent the agreement incorporates the notice requirements of the texas revised partnership act.see post at.but.d addresses a partnership duty to give effect to a transferee rights after receiving notice of a transfer the statute does not impose a duty on the transferor to give notice to the partnership prior to the transfer.it is undisputed that lg e notified tenaska it had transferred its interest to dispute concerns tenaska refusal to give effect to illinova the transferee rights after receiving notice.thus,the dissent suggestion that texas law and the limited partnership agreement imposed a notice obligation upon lg e is simply unfounded.
we affirm the judgment of the district court in all respects.
because i believe the provision of the option agreement controls the outcome here,i dissent.i adopt the facts set forth in the court opinion with one clarification.the option agreement placed no restrictions on kucc ability to transfer the interest after the option was exercised,ante at,only because once the option was exercised,the tenaska frontier partners,tfp partnership agreement controlled the party rights regarding transfers,not the option agreement.so,there was no need for the option agreement to be concerned with these future requirements.i additionally note that at all times,i refer to kucc as lg e for practical purposes in this dissent.
lg e violated the provision of the option agreement when it attempted to exercise the option and carry out its duties under the option agreement as a strawman for the real party in interest,illinova.lg e did not merely transfer its economic interest in tfp to illinova,but rather purported to transfer its entire partnership interest whereby illinova would be substituted for lg e as partner,thus increasing illinova stake in tfp.the decisions of the district court as well as this court permit this transfer without limitation and i disagree.the court partially refutes tenaska claim of fraudulent concealment by determining that lg e had no duty to disclose the reason for requesting an extension of the option deadline.however,we need not reach this issue because lg e purported exercise of the option was a breach of contract and ineffective.
first,tenaska is not estopped from contending lg e breached the option provision,contrary to the court conclusion.in a claim of contract fraud,acts in affirmance of the contract amount to a waiver of the fraud only where they are done with full knowledge of the fraud and of all material facts and with the intention clearly manifested of abiding by the contract and waiving all right to recover for the deception.nathan mckernan,quoting dargue chaput,quoting.fraud and deceit thus,in its claim of fraudulent concealment,tenaska is estopped from contending lg e breached the option agreement only if the facts are undisputed regarding tenaska knowledge of the memorandum of agreement moa between lg e and illinova,and that when tenaska proceeded with the closing of the grimes project in spite of that alleged knowledge,it did so with the intent to waive all right to object to lg e deception these facts are clearly in dispute,and summary judgment can not be supported as a matter of law on this issue.
second,the court asserts that even if the lg transaction constituted an assignment of the option,lg e did not breach the provision because illinova could presumably meet lg e obligations in the tfp partnership.i wholly disagree that tenaska can hardly complain that its right to choose with whom it contracts is hindered,since illinova is already an existing partner in the limited partnership.ante at.undoubtedly,parties have the right to freely contract tenaska certainly had the right to control with whom and at what time it chose to offer a percentage of its own partnership interest.the difference between illinova existing ten percent partnership interest and the increase to a twenty percent interest by way of the agreement with lg e is significant,make no mistake.any speculation to the contrary only diminishes contract and partnership principles.whether illinova could presumably fulfill lg e obligations is irrelevant.
likening this situation to one that involves the sale of land is misplaced.see panwitz miller oil,holding that in a relationship,the majority view is that if the assignee offers and is able to complete performance,a contract provision requiring a seller consent has limited application.a contract is wholly different than an interest in a partnership,which carries with it ongoing obligations,liabilities and duties.thus,it is not for a court to determine that since illinova is an existing partner of tfp,tenaska necessarily would have sold illinova this additional ten percent interest in tfp a sort of no harm,no foul argument.
the district court also adopted the no harm,no
