prior proceedings 
in,saxton voluntarily restated its financial results to correct a miscalculation of certain interest expenses.the incorrect interest calculation had caused saxton to overstate its earnings in several public filings and accompanying press releases in and.certain of the individual defendants were signatories of the regulatory filings,and defendant deloitte touche was responsible for auditing and approving those filings.the restatement resulted in an increase of approximately in saxton total expenses for the first three quarters of.
following the restatement,certain parties to this a securities class action in nevada federal district court against saxton,several of its directors and officers,and deloitte touche.the complaint alleged that defendants issued false financial statements in order to inflate the price of saxton stock,and that class members relied upon the misrepresentations to purchase the stock at that inflated price.the nevada complaint further alleged that saxton used its shares as payment for its acquisition of several entities,including diamond key homes and homebank mortgage corporation.
the nevada district court dismissed the complaint for failure to comply with the substantive and procedural requirements of the private securities litigation reform act of,pslra.the dismissal of the nevada lawsuit was the subject of a separate appeal to this court 
following dismissal of the federal claim,present plaintiffs filed a substantially similar complaint in arizona state court and a first amended complaint fac in the same court several months later.both the nevada and arizona complaints pled the same essential misconduct,but the arizona complaint claimed violations of arizona state law rather than federal law while the nevada complaint only presented allegations concerning the purchase of saxton stock,the fac pled that the plaintiffs had loaned saxton money as investment interests and listed several specific projects to which these loans related.the fac includes an extensive list of individual investors who extended loans to saxton in support of various real estate projects the essential theory of liability in the fac is that the loans would not have been made,renewed,or continued if plaintiffs had known saxton true financial condition or had plaintiffs not relied on saxton erroneous financial statements.
the defendants removed the action to the arizona district court under slusa.plaintiffs filed a motion to remand,claiming that slusa did not apply to their lawsuit,and submitting a declaration purporting to add additional facts to supplement the complaint.the district court denied plaintiffs remand motion,holding that slusa barred the complaint.while the district court noted that slusa authorizes outright dismissal of a slusa barred lawsuit,it nevertheless gave plaintiffs an opportunity to file a second amended complaint in an attempt to meet the requirements of slusa while avoiding the impediments of the pslra.
plaintiffs filed a sac that differed substantially from the fac in form,but not in substance.whereas the fac gave one comprehensive list of all plaintiff lenders and one comprehensive set of factual allegations,the sac divides the plaintiff lenders into twelve overlapping sets and alleges individualized facts regarding the twelve loan transactions.as alleged in the sac,some factual differences exist among the different loan transactions however,the underlying allegations of saxton misconduct remain virtually unchanged.as was done in the fac,the sac claims that saxton,through its officers and employees,made material misrepresentations concerning the financial status of the company in its sec filings and other public statements that deloitte touche failed to comply with the applicable accounting standards in approving those misrepresentations and that the plaintiff lenders reasonably relied on the misrepresentations and,as a result,suffered damages.
the essential theories of legal liability also remained unchanged in the sac.the fac alleges five theories of liability negligence,negligent misrepresentation,and fraud against all defendants breach of fiduciary duty against the individual defendants and aiding and abetting breach of duty against deloitte touche.the sac alleges these same five theories of liability against these same defendants,but it subdivides them based on the particular transaction involved and also adds additional theories regarding several of the transactions.the sac also clarifies that sec rules and regulations are the sources of defendants duties and that those duties were allegedly breached by misrepresentations in public filings and other public statements.
the district court dismissed the sac with prejudice.plaintiffs appeal the dismissal to this court.

discussion 
statutory background.
the historical background of congress enactment of the pslra and its subsequent enactment of slusa is and elsewhere.see,merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,dabit,d falkowski imation,cir spielman merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir.nevertheless,we briefly summarize key points of this history that are relevant to the resolution of this case.in,congress passed the pslra because it was distressed with the proliferation and cost of allegedly meritless federal securities class actions.the pslra sought to curb abusive and frivolous securities suits by imposing new procedural and substantive requirements.among other things,the pslra required plaintiffs to identify in their pleadings actual statements alleged to have been misleading and particular facts supporting a strong inference that the defendants acted with the required scienter,imposed an automatic stay of discovery during the pendency of any motion to dismiss,and established for certain statements.dabit.at see also patenaude,at in re silicon graphics.sec,cir.
although the pslra was effective in reducing allegedly frivolous federal securities claims,this was largely because class action attorneys avoided its reach by filing their securities class actions in state court under state and common law.congress recognized this unexpected development in a joint committee report,noting that the decline in federal securities class actions following the enactment of the pslra was accompanied by a corresponding increase in state class actions.see conf.congress enacted slusa to foreclose this alternative.patenaude,at.to that end,slusa permits removal and dismissal of covered class actions,brought under state law,alleging a misrepresentation or omission of material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.f and falkowski,at.
ii.propriety of the initial removal of the arizona action.
as noted,defendants removed the arizona action to federal court under slusa and plaintiffs filed a motion to remand the case back to arizona state court.in their opening brief,plaintiffs conceded that if the remand motion were to be determined solely on the basis of the first amended complaint allegations,their motion to remand was properly denied because it did not clearly delineate the varying facts and circumstances applicable to each loan.appellant opening brief at.while this concession arguably resolves the question of initial removability,plaintiffs still argue that the district court erred by failing to look beyond the face of the fac to consider a declaration that plaintiffs presented in support of the motion detailing the specifics of the various loans at issue.this argument fails.
slusa expressly applies to covered class actions alleging fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security,f,and authorizes removal and dismissal based on the allegations in the complaint and does not require any additional evidentiary showing from either party.see williams costco wholesale,cir the propriety of removal is determined solely on the basis of the pleadings filed in state court citing sparta surgical ass of sec.dealers,cir.while the court may permit the defendant to support removal by supplementing the pleadings with additional evidence of slusa applicability,see lasley new eng.variable life ins,d,no authority requires that a district court must consider additional evidence from the plaintiffs on a motion to remand.moreover,any error that may have occurred due to the district court failure to take account of the additional evidence in plaintiffs declaration was cured by its grant of leave to amend.plaintiffs incorporated the essential factual information in the declaration into their sac,and the district court considered those facts in its evaluation of that amended complaint.
iii.slusa does not prohibit amendment of a complaint.
whether slusa allows or prohibits amendment of the complaint in a removed action is an issue of first impression in this circuit.as a general rule,a plaintiff may not compel remand by amending a complaint to eliminate the federal question upon which removal was based.sparta surgical,at.this principle is applicable to slusa,which stands as an express exception to the complaint rule,and its preemptive force can not be circumvented by artful drafting.rowinski salomon smith barney,cir.following this rationale,other circuits that have considered the issue have not allowed a plaintiff class to amend its way around a slusa dismissal,at least where the amended complaint,fairly read,still contains allegations of fraud or deception involving a covered security.see dudek prudential,cir plaintiffs omission of certain fraud allegations previously pled in a different case did not save complaint from slusa dismissal behlen merrill lynch,cir dismissing claims under slusa despite attempt to remove federal claims by amendment.
however,congress included no express prohibition against amendment and no court has held that slusa completely and categorically bars any amendment of the complaint following removal.moreover,there is precedent in the district courts of this circuit for the view that a plaintiff may avoid slusa dismissal through amendment.for example,in schuster gardner,d,the district court permitted plaintiffs to amend their complaint to avoid slusa dismissal.the court credited the plaintiffs argument that any federal claim in the original complaint was inadvertently pled,allowed amendment,and remanded the resulting action to state court.id.at similarly,in chinn belfer,wl,the court noted that i nterpreting ninth circuit authority,other district courts have granted leave to amend a removed complaint to eliminate federal claims.id.at collecting cases.the court accordingly allowed plaintiffs the opportunity to amend to eliminate any federal claim and thereby avoid slusa dismissal.
we are not,of course,bound by district court decisions,and there are certainly defensible policy justifications for the defendants position.allowing amendment of claims to avoid dismissal could allow plaintiffs to artfully plead their way around federal jurisdiction and back into state some accounts,precisely what slusa was meant to prevent.see rowinski,at.however,district courts that have confronted the issue have also recognized the inequity of dismissing otherwise valid and viable state law claims on the ground that plaintiff cause of action that may be construed as federal in nature.in light of the statutory silence on the issue in slusa,the existence of competing policy rationales,and the fact that the granting or denial of leave to amend is ordinarily a matter left to the discretion of the district court,we hold that slusa does not prohibit amendment of the complaint after removal.
iv.the district court properly dismissed the second amended complaint for failure to state a claim in conformity with slusa.
having concluded that the arizona action was properly removed and that the district court properly permitted plaintiffs to amend the fac,we turn to the propriety of the district court dismissal of the sac with prejudice on appeal,plaintiffs concede the first three elements of slusa preemption that the class action here is a covered class action,and that it alleges state and common law claims and a misrepresentation or omission of material fact plaintiffs do,however,challenge elements four and five,claiming that the misrepresentations or omissions at issue were not in connection with the purchase or sale of a security under f a,and the action does not involve covered securities within the meaning of f e.both arguments fail.
in merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,dabit,d,the supreme court dramatically simplified the analysis of whether a particular complaint alleges fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security within the meaning of slusa.in dabit,the plaintiff class members were stock brokers who purchased and held various stocks during a period of approximately one year.the plaintiffs filed suit against merrill lynch in federal court under oklahoma state law,alleging that the investment banking firm violated the fiduciary duty and covenant of good faith and fair dealing it owed its brokers by disseminating misleading research and thereby manipulating stock prices,and that this misleading research induced them to hold shares they would have sold had they known the truth.id.at.the plaintiff brokers argued that their claim was not subject to slusa preemption because it was a pure holding claim and did not allege the purchase or sale of any particular security.
a unanimous supreme court flatly rejected a strict requirement and endorsed an expansive view of slusa preemptive scope.the court began its analysis by noting that t he magnitude of the federal interest in protecting the integrity and efficient operation of the market for nationally traded securities can not be overstated.id.at.the court reasoned that,for purposes of slusa preemption,t he identity of the plaintiffs does not determine whether the complaint alleges fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.the misconduct of which respondent complaints manipulation of stock qualifies as fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.id.at.it did not matter that the plaintiffs themselves did not purchase or sell a covered security rather,it was enough that the fraud alleged coincide with a securities by the plaintiff or by someone else.id.at emphasis added 
plaintiffs in this case seek to avoid slusa dismissal by arguing that they did not purchase or sell any listed security in response to the misrepresentations,and that,therefore,they do not allege fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of a security.this is the very argument that dabit rejected.plaintiffs allege a scheme to fraudulently hide saxton financial the necessary effect of artificially inflating the price of saxton publicly traded material misrepresentations in saxton public filings and other public statements.they allege harm from this scheme through inducement by misleading financial information to refrain from exercising rights under their several loan documents.while plaintiff
