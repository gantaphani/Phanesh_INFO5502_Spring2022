opinion of the court 
in this securities class action,defendants constar international,crown holdings,salomon smith barney,citigroup global markets,citigroup,deutsche bank securities,morgan securities,and lazard freres appeal the district court order granting class certification.defendants argue that the district court erred by adopting a liberal construction of rule in favor of class certification,by not conducting a rigorous analysis of the rule requirements for class as to the predominance by failing to consider the opinion of defendants expert.we disagree,and conclude that the district court properly granted class certification.
constar manufactures pet polyethylene terephthalate plastic food and beverage containers.its initial public offering ipo occurred on november,when its parent company and,crown holdings,sold million shares to the public at an offering price of per share.plaintiffs who purchased registered shares from that offering,claim that this price was inflated because constar registration statement contained materially false and misleading statements,and because it omitted required information.plaintiffs seek relief against constar under of the securities act of,which provides a private right of action to individuals who have suffered harm from misstatements in an issuer registration statement.in re merck.sec,cir.they also seek judgment against constar underwriters and controlling entities the remaining defendants named above under of the securities act.
according to plaintiffs,the registration statement misrepresented constar as a competitive business with a strong future when,in fact,its business was deteriorating and weak.specifically,they allege that constar materially misrepresented the company goodwill,assets,operational strength and capacity,equipment quality,and customer base.plaintiffs also allege that constar parent,crown holdings,had transferred a substantial part of crown debt to constar as part of constar ipo.
plaintiffs allege that these misrepresentations became apparent to the market in the summer of.on july,constar acknowledged in a press release that its results were disappointing,and in a conference call the next day attributed these results to the loss of important customers and the absence of an expected technological superiority compared to its competitors.plaintiffs allege that these disclosures caused constar stock to drop thirty percent,from per share on july,to per share on july.on august,constar issued a press release reflecting the impairment of its financial goodwill d ue to the trading price of the company common stock and other factors.joint app.according to plaintiffs,this was a belated disclosure because the market had already absorbed the information regarding the goodwill impairment and other business problems.however,defendants maintain that the truth about the alleged goodwill misrepresentations did not become apparent to the market until the august press release.moreover,they claim that the losses after the july disclosures were predicated on lower sales and higher inventory costs due to unseasonable weather conditions,not the factors identified by plaintiffs.
plaintiffs filed suit on september,by which time constar stock was trading at per share.the district court referred plaintiffs motion for class certification to retired magistrate judge diane welsh and appointed her as special master.the special master recommended class certification,and the district court adopted the special master reasoning and approved her report.the court certified the class,concluding that plaintiffs established the elements required by rules a and b.joint app.defendants filed a timely appeal.

our review of a district court grant of class certification is for abuse of discretion,which occurs if the district court decision rests upon a clearly erroneous finding of fact,an errant conclusion of law or an improper application of law to fact.in re hydrogen peroxide antitrust,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we review de novo whether an incorrect legal standard has been used.id.since each requirement of rule must be met,a district court errs as a matter of law when it fails to resolve a genuine legal or factual dispute relevant to determining the requirements.id.at.any matter relevant to rule prerequisites for class certification,including an expert opinion,requires a rigorous analysis,in which a court must assess all of the relevant evidence admitted at the class certification stage.id.at quoting in re initial pub.offering sec,cir.the mandates set out in rule are not mere pleading rules.id.at.unless each requirement is actually met,a class can not be certified.id.at.
rule contains two sets of requirements.first,a party seeking class certification must demonstrate that the class satisfies the requirements of rule a 
the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable numerosity there are questions of law or fact common to the class commonality the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class typicality and the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class adequacy.
a.second,plaintiffs must show that the requirements of one of the provisions of rule b are met.plaintiffs here sought certification under rule b,which requires a finding by the district court that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.b.these requirements are known as predominance and superiority.
although we afford a district court broad discretion in rule matters,we require that each rule component be satisfied.hydrogen peroxide,at citing amchem,windsor,d breyer,concurring in part and dissenting in part stating that rule decisions implicate highly,complex,and difficult matters.class certification is an especially serious decision,as it is often the defining moment in class actions for it may sound the death knell of the litigation on the part of plaintiffs,or create unwarranted pressure to settle nonmeritorious claims on the part of defendants.newton merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir.
the standards by which this court evaluates class certification motions are well established.in hydrogen peroxide,we instructed district courts,where appropriate,to delve beyond the pleadings to determine whether the requirements for class certification are satisfied.at quoting newton,at.an overlap between a class certification requirement and the merits of a claim is no reason to decline to resolve relevant disputes when necessary to determine whether a class certification requirement is met.id.the predominance inquiry is especially dependent upon the merits of a plaintiff claim,since the nature of the evidence that will suffice to resolve a question determines whether the question is common or individual.id.at quoting blades monsanto,cir.if proof of the essential elements of the cause of action requires individual treatment,then predominance is defeated and a class should not be certified.id.quoting newton,at.
defendants argue that the district court made several errors in certifying the class.first,they claim that the district court improperly applied a liberal construction of rule requirements for class certification,and failed to conduct a sufficiently rigorous analysis of whether the proposed class satisfied these requirements.second,they argue that the district court inadequately described the class definition and the claims at issue in the litigation.third,they argue that it was improper for the district court to have decided the class certification motion without deciding whether the market for constar stock was efficient.fourth,they argue that the district court should not have found that the predominance requirement could be met with respect to the issues of loss causation and injury.fifth,they claim that the district court failed to consider the testimony of their expert when deciding the class certification motion.none of these arguments are convincing.
our decision is guided by hydrogen peroxide,which was decided after the district court granted class certification.even without the benefit of that case,however,the district court application of the class certification standards comported with the guidelines established by this court.
defendants suggest that the district court applied a liberal construction of rule requirements for class certification.defendants argument relies on a statement that appears in both the special master report and the district court order this court has adopted a liberal construction of rule when considering shareholder suits,declaring that the interest s of justice require that in a doubtful case any error,if there is to be one,should be committed in favor of allowing a class action.joint app,quoting in re regal commc ns.sec,wl,at,quoting eisenberg gagnon,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
defendants argue that this statement was representative of the district court and special master analyses.however,after noting the language from eisenberg,the special master cited the need for a rigorous analysis to meet the requirements of rule,and spent the next pages undertaking such an analysis.the special master discussed the four requirements of rule a,numerosity,commonality,typicality,and adequacy of representation in turn,and addressed defendants arguments as to each element.the special master then considered the predominance and superiority requirements and addressed defendants arguments on those elements.the district court reviewed the special master analysis and conclusions and adopted her findings,noting that after careful examination of the substantial materials presented by the parties,the report correctly found that plaintiffs established the elements required by rules a and b.joint app.emphasis added.nowhere in the analysis does the special master or the district court identify a presumption in favor of class certification or suggest that class certification is appropriate in close cases.
in fact,even though this case predates hydrogen peroxide,the special master analysis and treatment of eisenberg is quite similar to our analysis in that case.in hydrogen peroxide,we clarified the eisenberg language at issue,stating 
although the trial court has discretion to grant or deny class certification,the court should not suppress doubt as to whether a rule requirement is matter the area of substantive law.accordingly,eisenberg should not be understood to encourage certification in the face of doubt as to whether a rule requirement has been met.eisenberg predates the recent amendments to rule which,as noted,reject tentative decisions on certification and encourage development of a record sufficient for informed analysis.we recognize the supreme court has observed that p re dominance is a test readily met in certain cases alleging consumer or securities fraud or violations of the antitrust laws.amchem,at.but it does not follow that a court should relax its certification analysis,or presume a requirement for certification is met,merely because a plaintiff claims fall within one of those substantive categories.
at certain citations omitted.similarly,after citing the liberal eisenberg language,the special master continued nevertheless,since courts may approve class actions only after a rigorous analysis and findings that the class satisfies all the requirements of rule,it is necessary to address each of the four elements of rule a and the elements of rule b joint app.
in sum,defendants characterization of the class certification standard applied by the district court is incorrect.defendants misleadingly emphasize the eisenberg language without discussion of the lengthy class certification analysis by the special master that followed in her report,which was adopted by the district court.the eisenberg references in the special master report and the district court opinion were not conclusions,but rather a preface to further analysis.further,there was no tie breaking or erring on plaintiffs side.the rule standard applied by the district court and special master was proper.
contrary to defendants contention,we also find no error in the district court description of the class definition and claims at issue in the litigation.under wachtel guardian life insurance of america,cir,we require that each class certification order contain a readily discernible,clear,and precise statement of the parameters defining the class or classes to be certified,and a readily discernible,clear,and complete list of the claims,issues or defenses to be treated on a class basis.in wachtel,we found the district court certification order defective because its discussion of class claims,issues,or defenses was unclear,intermittent,and incomplete,and because it failed to define which claims,issues,or defenses are to be treated on a class basis for the remainder of the litigation.id.at.here,the district court and special master stated the parameters of the putative class and outlined how the plaintiffs claims under and of the securities act,and the defendants affirmative defenses,would proceed on a classwide basis.the district court order was clearly sufficient.
defendants principal argument on appeal is that the district court could not have properly decided the class certification motion without first deciding whether the market for constar securities was efficient.according to defendants,if the market was inefficient,then questions of materiality,loss causation,and injury would need to be decided on an individual basis,and the class would not satisfy the predominance requirement of rule b.defendants also contend that if the market was efficient,the alleged misrepresentations could not have caused a loss because subsequent disclosures did not actually correct the misrepresentations or cause constar stock price to decline.
the error in this reasoning is that plaintiffs case is brought under of the securities act,rather than b of the exchange act.a prima facie case under is straightforward,requiring only a showing of a material misrepresentation or omission from a defendant registration statement.herman maclean huddleston,d.that is,imposes liability if a registration statement,as of its effective date contained an untrue statement of material fact omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.in re suprema specialties.sec,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
we have previously stated that and b share the tests for materiality,including the test set forth by the supreme court in tsc industries,northway,and the test for materiality in an efficient market.merck,at.under tsc,a fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important in making an investment decision.tsc,northway,d.we have also fashioned a special rule for measuring materiality in the context of an efficient securities market.oran stafford,cir.in that context,the materiality of disclosed information may be measured post hoc by looking to the movement,in the period immediately following disclosure,of the price of the firm stock.id.thus,while materiality can be shown by a drop in price in reaction to a disclosure in an efficient market,that does not mean that it is necessary to consider the efficiency of a market in assessing materiality in a case,whether an individual or class action.indeed,as is discussed below,it is not at all relevant.
loss causation under is even less complex than the materiality inquiry.in a case,plaintiffs do not have the burden of proving causation,although defendants may assert,as an affirmative defense,that a lower share value did not result from any nondisclosure or false statement.in re adams golf.sec,cir.similarly,plaintiffs do not need to establish reliance on an issuer statements,unless they purchased the stock more than twelve months after the effective date of the registration statement.a un
