harvard scientific corporation hsc and its founder jackie see claimed to be developing a new product to treat male and female sexual dysfunction.see touted hsc success in creating this product in a series of press releases and securities filings.this attracted an investment by rk company rk.unfortunately,hsc claims of success were not true,and following a bench trial,the court found see violated federal and state securities laws,state deceptive practices law,and committed common law fraud.see appeals the judgment,and argues that rk company is not the real party in interest,that the magistrate judge findings are clearly erroneous,and that the district court abused its discretion in admitting deposition testimony at trial.see also objects to the awarding of prejudgment interest and the calculation of attorneys fees to rk.we reject these arguments.see has waived any argument based on the real party in interest defense,the findings of liability were more than adequately supported,and there was no abuse of discretion in the awarding of prejudgment interest and attorneys fees.see has failed to include the transcript of the relevant motion hearing that led to the admitting of the deposition testimony,so we dismiss that claim as well.for these reasons,we affirm the court judgment.
background 
though there are a myriad of characters,family relations,and employees involved in this litigation and discussed in the briefs we only recount those facts that are relevant to our analysis.in,jackie see founded hsc,a development company.see was hsc founder,largest shareholder,and served at various points on its board of directors,executive committee and management committee.he was also the director of research and development and intellectual property holder of lypohilized liposome prostaglandin,the male sexual dysfunction product that hsc hoped to bring to the market.
to obtain approval to begin clinical trials and test on humans,the united states food and drug administration fda required hsc to submit an investigational new drug ind application.in an october meeting between see and the fda,the fda learned that hsc had falsified the findings of a study included in its ind application and told hsc that it must cease further clinical studies until an audit was completed.despite this meeting and deepening investigations by the fda throughout and,hsc released various press releases touting its alleged successes.in november,hsc claimed it had accelerated its progress towards the completion of clinical trials.in may,hsc announced that a female dysfunction product was moving forward with its male product.in june,hsc released a statement that it had received notification from the fda that it was free to initiate phase ii clinical trials,and in a separate release,announced it had developed a topically applied sexual dysfunction product.when these statements were released,the fda clinical hold was still in effect and fda investigations continued to increase.no clinical trials were moving forward on any products.
in addition to these press releases,hsc filed various forms with the united states securities and exchange commission sec.in march,for the fiscal year ending december,hsc stated that the phase i trials of showed possible benefits of therapy and that hsc was in substantial compliance with all laws during its october meeting with the fda.in a march filing,for the fiscal quarter ending march,hsc announced plans for its female sexual dysfunction product using.see actual or electronic signature was on both filings.
in june,barbara berry,who worked for hsc as its secretary and chief operating officer,was asked by thomas waite,hsc executive officer,to approach her father,robert krilich,about whether he would be interested in investing in hsc.berry forwarded a solicitation letter to her brother,robert krilich,so that he could send information to their father,who was in prison at the time krilich received her letter,as well as hsc sec filings and press releases.in june and july of,krilich investment vehicle,rk company,purchased shares of stock from hsc for.rk was unable to resell this stock.
in,following a press release acknowledging a may,warning letter from the fda,hsc stopped operations and went bankrupt.on june,rk filed suit against hsc and a variety of hsc employees,including see,for inducing rk to buy hsc stock through its misleading and false press releases,sec filings,and reports.following protracted litigation,see remained the last defendant and the parties agreed to a bench trial and consented to proceeding before a magistrate judge,see c.the court found for rk on all claims,and see appeals.
ii.analysis 
real party in interest argument waived 
see strenuously challenges rk identity,calling it an unlawful beast which does not own the claim and could not have brought this suit in the midst of trial,after krilich testified that rk company was the name under which he did business,see investigated rk identity on an illinois public records website and discovered that rk was not a legally registered corporation.the next day,see brought a motion for judgment as a matter of law,claiming that rk was not the party alleged in the complaint.he claims that rk is an unlawful common law trust created for tax evasion purposes,and as such,the trust is the real party in interest and any action needed to be brought by its trustee.
rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure requires that an action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest.the real party in interest is the person who possesses the right or interest to be enforced through litigation,and the purpose of this procedural rule is to protect the defendant against a subsequent action by the party actually entitled to recover.a advisory comm.note see also rawoof texor petroleum,cir moore federal practice.but the rule also reflects an understanding that such disputes would be easy to resolve,as it further provides 
the court may not dismiss an action for failure to prosecute in the name of the real party in interest until,after an objection,a reasonable time has been allowed for the real party in interest to ratify,join,or be substituted into the action.after ratification,joinder,or substitution,the action proceeds as if it had been originally commenced by the real party in interest.

see acknowledges that the defense that rk was not the real party in interest is subject to waiver,appellant br.at,but insists that his motion was timely because he filed it as soon as he discovered that rk was not duly incorporated.see claims he had no reason to doubt rk legal status and that he was blindsided by the realization that rk was not the registered corporation he believed it to be.see misunderstands what it means to be timely
