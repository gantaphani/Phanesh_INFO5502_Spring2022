investors who purchased stock of the clorox company between october,and august,appeal the district court summary judgment and judgment on the pleadings in their action against clorox,first brands corporation,and several officers of the two companies collectively clorox,for violations of section b and rule of the securities exchange act of,as amended by the private securities litigation reform act pslra.in its published order,in re clorox company securities litigation,d,the court limited discovery to two viable claims having to do with statements allegedly made by clorox officers about its merger with first brands and as to them,held that the statements were either not made as alleged or were statements accompanied by meaningful disclaimers of uncertainty or caution that were protected by the safe harbor provision of the pslra,c,and the bespeaks caution doctrine,and granted judgment on the pleadings for the remainder of investors claims.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and affirm.
without belaboring the factual background,which we construe in investors favor,first brands began searching for a potential buyer in early.to enhance its financial attractiveness,the company engaged in a practice that investors call trade loading trade promotions that inflated sales by inducing customers to stock inventories in excess of consumer consumption experience.these promotions boosted sales by committing to retailers that first brands would rebate up to of the shipments in future quarters.this meant that first brands recorded the full revenue of the shipments in the immediate term,but deferred recognition of the rebates or promotional allowances for the future,thereby artificially inflating first brands short term profits.
clorox,which was looking for a possible acquisition in the spring of,targeted first brands and discovered its practices.nevertheless,clorox decided to acquire first brands in a transaction.the exchange rate was determined by the average price of clorox stock during a preset pricing period.
on the day the merger was announced,october,clorox president and ceo,craig sullivan,told brokers on a conference call that w e expect that the transaction will be immediately accretive to earnings per share before charges associated with the merger,and will accelerate the growth rate above revenue and earnings per share for clorox.
clorox learned in january that the first brands trade promotions would not expire for up to months.the problem was discussed internally.on march,gerald johnston,clorox chief operating officer,gave a scripted powerpoint presentation at a merrill lynch conference,and during the month he,sullivan,and karen rose,clorox chief financial officer,spoke to analysts at donaldson,lufkin jenrette,nationsbank montgomery securities,morgan stanley,and paine webber about the first brands inventory problem.merrill lynch reported on march that clorox has identified million in excess inventory could be less than this amount that it will work through the system over the next months and that first brands has trade promotion plans through the end of calendar that can not be undone.paine webber reported on march that we recently met with the management of clorox and while we walked away believing that its fundamentals have never been better t he outlook over the next six months is less visible and predictable than at any point in the past few years however,we believe these issues are largely transitory in nature and should last for two or so quarters.
clorox reported its results on april,and rose participated in a conference call with analysts,money and portfolio managers,institutional investors,and large clorox shareholders.among other things,she stated w e obligated to live with first brand old programs and spending levels against the trade in some form until january.it will be at that time,similar to what we saw with armor all a prior acquisition,that you will begin to see the beginning of the conversion to our programs.she also said that clearing out the inventory would involve a slow bleed and would be a process approximately.analysts variously reported that fixing the first brands excessive inventory problem would take over three quarters,or one year,or should begin to pay off for clorox in the second half of fiscal.
when clorox stock price declined from on august,to on august,sullivan wrote shareholders that the softness in sales of first brands products was mainly the result of our eliminating inefficient trade promotion practices that had induced trade customers in previous years to stock inventories well in excess of consumption,and that none of this was news to us.
this action was filed on october.the district court granted clorox motion to dismiss the second amended complaint on june,reasoning that the complaint failed to adequately allege scienter.investors filed a third amended complaint,attaching to it declarations of former clorox employees gary mucica and joseph.the declarations generally state that clorox knew about the unbelievably high first brands trade promotions both before and after the acquisition that shortly after the closing in january,clorox officers believed the company had gotten in over its head and that clorox knew the acquisition would not be immediately accretive to sales and earnings.on march,the district court denied clorox motion to dismiss the third amended complaint,indicating that statements from the march merrill lynch conference and the april conference call adequately alleged scienter and should be allowed to proceed.however,the court found that the other allegations in the complaint still failed to adequately allege scienter.
the parties disagreed about the scope and timing of discovery.clorox position,ultimately sustained by the district court,was that investors were only entitled to discovery about the march and april statements investors believed they should have complete discovery because the court had upheld the complaint in its entirety.
on september,clorox moved for partial summary judgment on the johnston and rose statements,and for judgment on the pleadings on the remaining claims.investors filed a motion to compel discovery on all claims,and sought a continuance pursuant to rule f of the federal rules of civil procedure.the district court denied a continuance,and granted clorox motion for summary judgment on the ground that investors produced no evidence that johnston made the alleged temporary or transitory statement on march,and that rose statements were within the pslra safe harbor provision and the bespeaks caution doctrine.it granted judgment on the pleadings because the third amended complaint failed to allege scienter under pslra standards with respect to sullivan immediately accretive statement.investors timely appealed.
investors argue that the district court abused its discretion in denying a continuance pursuant to.f to prevail under this rule,parties opposing a motion for summary judgment must make a a timely application which b specifically identifies c relevant information,d where there is some basis for believing that the information sought actually exists.visa int l serv.ass bankcard holders of,cir.the burden is on the party seeking additional discovery to proffer sufficient facts to show that the evidence sought exists,and that it would prevent summary judgment.chance teletrac,cir.the district court does not abuse its discretion by denying further discovery if the movant has failed diligently to pursue discovery in the past,or if the movant fails to show how the information sought would preclude summary judgment.cal.union ins.am.diversified sav.bank,cir citations omitted.
clorox motion for summary judgment went only to whether johnston or rose said that problems with first brands were temporary or transitory,and to whether rose statements were protected.in support of their rule f application,investors argued that they needed all documents concerning the march,paine webber report that described the first brands inventory problem as largely transitory in nature,the march,merrill lynch report following the conference,and the march,morgan stanley report that stated that the transition from inventory destocking was expected to be completed in calendar.they also maintained that discovery was necessary regarding what clorox officers knew at the time the false statements were made.in addition,counsel declaration explained that investors were waiting until they had reviewed documents before noticing depositions,including those of johnston and rose,but expected to do so.
clorox had produced all documents in its possession related to the march,conference.investors had issued subpoenas to analysts in april,but no follow up had occurred nor had depositions been noticed even after clorox gave notice in june of its plans to move for partial summary judgment.this calls their diligence into question.regardless,the district court could reasonably find that investors showing of need fell short of identifying any material that would suggest that johnston or rose said anything other than what their declarations aver and the script in johnston case or transcript in rose case reveal.nothing in the merrill lynch march,report indicates that johnston spoke beyond his script or said that first brands inventory problems were temporary or transitory the report does not attribute any such comment to johnston,and does not appear to paraphrase anything that johnston said.the march,paine webber report and march,morgan stanley report were written by analysts who were not at the march conference both were issued before the rose telephone conference,so neither report is relevant to either issue on summary judgment.and,as the district court held,investors were not entitled to discovery bearing on scienter or other claims raised in the complaint because the motion for summary judgment focused narrowly on whether johnston characterized the inventory problems as temporary or transitory and whether the statements that rose made on april were protected as a matter of law.for these reasons,we see no abuse of discretion in denying the requested continuance.
investors argue that even apart from being premature,summary judgment should not have been granted because the court overlooked eight other analyst reports suggesting that clorox communicated the same the first brands inventory problem had been quantified and would be other occasions in addition to march and april.this,in investors view,creates a triable issue of fact that other false statements were made.they make a related contention that the court should not have accepted declarations by johnston and rose that they do not recall stating that the first brands inventory problem was temporary or transitory as evidence that they in fact said nothing false during conversations.however,we do not believe that these points are properly before us.the district court held that claims based on any statement except for those made on march and april fail to meet the pleading requirements of the pslra,and investors have not appealed this part of the ruling.also,clorox motion for partial summary judgment was directed only to statements made on these two occasions.in these circumstances,analysts reports and declarations about different conversations on different dates are not relevant.
beyond this,investors fault the district court for having held that no evidence exists that johnston made false statements at the march conference,when they offered the merrill lynch report which states that first brands has trade promotion plans through the end of calendar and that clx has identified million in excess inventory.neither of these statements was in johnston script but,as the district court concluded,the analyst statement about impact was consistent with allegedly concealed information that the problem would extend into fiscal year,and nothing in the report suggests that it was johnston representation rather than the analyst independent judgment that the problem would be resolved in the near term.
johnston script,slides,and declaration show that he did not say that the problems with first brands were temporary or transitory.as clorox established that there was no evidence to support investors claim that johnston stated that the inventory problem was minor and temporary,summary judgment was properly entered on the march statements.see celotex catrett,d.
investors do not challenge the district court determination that rose statements were.rather,they argue that the court incorrectly held that knowingly false statements made by rose during her april conference call are not actionable as long as they are short,and that it improperly relied on limited and general cautions to protect clorox under the pslra safe harbor and the bespeaks caution doctrine.
although investors cite a number of statements in the same vein,the most representative and problematic are rose response to a question about the impact the trade deals inventory problem would have regarding what happens when we move to our own programs,this is going to be,you know,a slow bleed over this year where we keep the trade deals,but we are going to be jamming,just as i just described to you happened here in third quarter.so it going to be a process approximately,getting that extra inventory out of the trade.it is with respect to these statements that the court observed that rose spoke only a couple of sentences and provided an approximate timetable.d at.investors submit that the court holding that short whoppers do count is error,but we read its decision as turning on context rather than word count.
the court held that in context,rose timetable estimate was qualified by approximately and accompanied by other cautionary statements that were meaningful her disclaimer of certainty at the beginning of the call,her reference to additional cautions in clorox june,form filing,and her indication that clorox anticipated it would be losing money on first brands for several quarters.investors maintain that the warnings were not meaningful because reasonable minds could differ as to the efficacy of the cautions in light of the specificity and intensity of the false statements.see provenz miller,cir holding that s ummary judgment based on the bespeaks caution doctrine is only appropriate when reasonable minds could not disagree as to whether the mix of information in the document is misleading quoting fecht price,cir.we disagree.
the bespeaks caution doctrine provides a mechanism by which a court can rule as a matter of law typically in a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action or a motion for summary judgment that defendants representations contained enough cautionary language or risk disclosure to protect the defendant against claims of securities fraud.in re worlds of wonder sec,cir internal quotation and citation omitted.the pslra created a statutory version of this doctrine by providing a safe harbor for statements identified as such,which are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements see c grossman novell,cir calling the safe harbor a statutory form of the doctrine citing shaw digital equip,cir helwig vencor,cir stating that the safe harbor for statements is based on the judicial bespeaks caution doctrine.
rose began the conference call by stating 
now before i begin,i need to remind you that any statements made on this call represent our best judgment as to what may occur in the future.the company actual results will depend on a number of competitive and economic factors,some of which may be outside the control of the company.we refer you to our form filing for the year ended june,filed with the sec last september,for a discussion of the most important of those factors.
the,in turn,cautioned that there can be no assurance that clorox will be able to successfully integrate acquisitions into its operations and that risks in integration of acquisitions could cause results to differ from expectations.in addition to qualifying her timetable estimate by approximately,many of rose statements were cautions in themselves.rose told listeners that first brands had a trade promotion program that encouraged the trade to stock extra inventory that clorox wanted to get this out of the system,and that first brands had a routine of pushing sales to levels not w
