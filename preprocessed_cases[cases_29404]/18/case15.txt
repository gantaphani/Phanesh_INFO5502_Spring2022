respondents,california citizens,sued petitioner hertz corporation in a california state court for claimed violations.hertz sought removal to the federal district court under d,a,claiming that because it and respondents were citizens of different states,a,c,the federal court possessed jurisdiction.respondents,however,claimed that hertz was a california citizen,like themselves,and that,hence,diversity jurisdiction was lacking under c,which provides that a corporation shall be deemed to be a citizen of any state by which it has been incorporated and of the state where it has its principal place of business.to show that its principal place of business was in new jersey,not california,hertz submitted a declaration stating,among other things,that it operated facilities in states,that california accounted for only a portion of its business activity,that its leadership is at its corporate headquarters in new jersey,and that its core executive and administrative functions are primarily carried out there.the district court concluded that it lacked diversity jurisdiction because hertz was a california citizen under ninth circuit precedent,which asks,inter alia,whether the amount of the corporation business activity is significantly larger or substantially predominates in one state.finding that california was hertz principal place of business under that test because a plurality of the relevant business activity occurred there,the district court remanded the case to state court.the ninth circuit affirmed.
respondents argument that this court lacks jurisdiction under c which expressly permits appeals of remand orders such as the district court only to court s of appeals,not to the supreme court,and provides that if a final judgment on the appeal in a court of appeals is not issued before the end of days with a possible extension,the appeal shall be denied makes far too much of too little.the court normally does not read statutory silence as implicitly modifying or limiting its jurisdiction that another statute specifically grants,felker turpin.here,replicating similar,older statutes,specifically gives the court jurisdiction to revie w b y writ of certiorari cases that are in the courts of appeals when it grants the writ.the court thus interprets c requirement as simply requiring a court of appeals to reach a decision within a specified time not to deprive this court of subsequent jurisdiction to review the case.see,aetna casualty surety flowers.
the phrase principal place of business in c refers to the place where a corporation high level officers direct,control,and coordinate the corporation activities,its nerve center,which will typically be found at its corporate headquarters.
a a brief review of the legislative history of diversity jurisdiction demonstrates that congress added c principal place of business language to the traditional test in order to prevent corporations from manipulating jurisdiction as well as to reduce the number of diversity cases.
b however,the phrase principal place of business has proved more difficult to apply than its originators likely expected.after congress amendment,courts were uncertain as to where to look to determine a corporation principal place of business for diversity purposes.if a corporation headquarters and executive offices were in the same state in which it did most of its business,the test seemed straightforward.the principal place of business was in that state.but if those corporate headquarters,including executive offices,were in one state,while the corporation plants or other centers of business activity were located in other states,the answer was less obvious.under these circumstances,for corporations with business activities,numerous circuits have looked to a corporation nerve center,from which the corporation radiates out to its constituent parts and from which its officers direct,control,and coordinate the corporation activities.however,this test did not go far enough,for it did not answer what courts should do when a corporation operations are not but rather limited to only a few states.when faced with this question,various courts have focused more heavily on where a corporation actual business activities are located,adopting divergent and increasingly complex tests to interpret the statute.
c in an effort to find a single,more uniform interpretation of the statutory phrase,this court returns to the nerve center approach p rincipal place of business is best read as referring to the place where a corporation officers direct,control,and coordinate the corporation activities.in practice it should normally be the place where the corporation maintains its headquarters provided that the headquarters is the actual center of direction,control,and coordination,the nerve center,and not simply an office where the corporation holds its board meetings.
i three sets of considerations,taken together,convince the court that the nerve center approach,while imperfect,is superior to other possibilities.first,c language supports the approach.the statute word place is singular,not plural.its word principal requires that the main,prominent,or most important place be chosen,commissioner soliman.and the fact that the word place follows the words state where means that the place is a place within a state,not the state itself.a corporation nerve center,usually its main headquarters,is a single place.the public often considers it the corporation main place of business.and it is a place within a state.by contrast,the application of a more general business activities test has led some courts,as in the present case,to look,not at a particular place within a state,but incorrectly at the state itself,measuring the total amount of business activities that the corporation conducts there and determining whether they are significantly larger than in the state.second,administrative simplicity is a major virtue in a jurisdictional statute.sisson ruby.a nerve center approach,which ordinarily equates that center with a corporation headquarters,is simple to apply comparatively speaking.by contrast,a corporation general business activities more often lack a single principal place where they take place.third,the statute legislative history suggests that the words principal place of business should be interpreted to be no more complex than an earlier,numerical test that was criticized as too complex and impractical to apply.a nerve center test offers such a possibility.a general business activities test does not.
ii while there may be no perfect test that satisfies all administrative and purposive criteria,and there will be hard cases under the nerve center test adopted today,this test is relatively easier to apply and does not require courts to weigh corporate functions,assets or revenues different in kind,one from the other.and though this test may produce results that seem to cut against the basic rationale of diversity jurisdiction,accepting occasionally counterintuitive results is the price the legal system must pay to avoid overly complex jurisdictional administration while producing the benefits that accompany a more uniform legal system.
iii if the record reveals attempts at jurisdictional manipulation for example,that the alleged nerve center is nothing more than a mail drop box,a bare office with a computer,or the location of an annual executive retreat the courts should instead take as the nerve center the place of actual direction,control,and coordination,in the absence of such manipulation.
d although petitioner unchallenged declaration suggests that hertz nerve center and its corporate headquarters are one and the same,and that they are located in new jersey,not in california,respondents should have a fair opportunity on remand to litigate their case in light of today holding.

justice breyer delivered the opinion of the court.
the federal diversity jurisdiction statute provides that a corporation shall be deemed to be a citizen of any state by which it has been incorporated and of the state where it has its principal place of business.c emphasis added.we seek here to resolve different interpretations that the circuits have given this phrase.in doing so,we place primary weight upon the need for judicial administration of a jurisdictional statute to remain as simple as possible.and we conclude that the phrase principal place of business refers to the place where the corporation high level officers direct,control,and coordinate the corporation activities.lower federal courts have often metaphorically called that place the corporation nerve center.see,wisconsin knife works national metal crafters,scot typewriter underwood,supp,sdny weinfeld.we believe that the nerve center will typically be found at a corporation headquarters.
in september,respondents melinda friend and john nhieu,two california citizens,sued petitioner,the hertz corporation,in a california state court.they sought damages for what they claimed were violations of california wage and hour laws.app.to pet.for cert.and they requested relief on behalf of a potential class composed of california citizens who had allegedly suffered similar harms.
hertz filed a notice seeking removal to a federal court.d,a.hertz claimed that the plaintiffs and the defendant were citizens of different states.a,c.hence,the federal court possessed jurisdiction.friend and nhieu,however,claimed that the hertz corporation was a california citizen,like themselves,and that,hence,diversity jurisdiction was lacking.
to support its position,hertz submitted a declaration by an employee relations manager that sought to show that hertz principal place of business was in new jersey,not in california.the declaration stated,among other things,that hertz operated facilities in states and that california which had about of the nation population,pet.for cert.accounted for of hertz car rental locations about of its employees about million of its billion in annual revenue and about million of its approximately million annual transactions,rentals.the declaration also stated that the leadership of hertz and its domestic subsidiaries is located at hertz corporate headquarters in park ridge,new jersey that its core executive and administrative functions are carried out there and to a lesser extent in oklahoma city,oklahoma and that its major administrative operations are found at those two locations.app.to pet.for cert.
the district court of the northern district of california accepted hertz statement of the facts as undisputed.but it concluded that,given those facts,hertz was a citizen of california.in reaching this conclusion,the court applied ninth circuit precedent,which instructs courts to identify a corporation principal place of business by first determining the amount of a corporation business activity state by state.if the amount of activity is significantly larger or substantially predominates in one state,then that state is the corporation principal place of business.if there is no such state,then the principal place of business is the corporation nerve center,the place where the majority of its executive and administrative functions are performed.friend hertz,no.mmc nd,hereinafter order tosco communities for a better environment,per curiam.
applying this test,the district court found that the plurality of each of the relevant business activities was in california,and that the differential between the amount of those activities in california and the amount in the next closest state was significant.order.hence,hertz principal place of business was california,and diversity jurisdiction was thus lacking.the district court consequently remanded the case to the state courts.
hertz appealed the district court remand order.c.the ninth circuit affirmed in a brief memorandum opinion.fed.appx.hertz filed a petition for certiorari.and,in light of differences among the circuits in the application of the test for corporate citizenship,we granted the writ.compare tosco,supra,at,and capitol indemnity russellville steel,applying total activity test and looking at all corporate activities with wisconsin knife works,supra,at applying nerve center test.
at the outset,we consider a jurisdictional objection.respondents point out that the statute permitting hertz to appeal the district court remand order to the court of appeals,c,constitutes an exception to a more general jurisdictional rule that remand orders are not reviewable on appeal.d.they add that the language of c refers only to court s of appeals,not to the supreme court.the statute also says that if a final judgment on the appeal in a court of appeals is not issued before the end of days with a possible extension,the appeal shall be denied.and respondents draw from these statutory circumstances the conclusion that congress intended to permit review of a remand order only by a court of appeals,not by the supreme court at least not if,as here,this court grant of certiorari comes after c time period has elapsed.
this argument,however,makes far too much of too little.we normally do not read statutory silence as implicitly modifying or limiting supreme court jurisdiction that another statute specifically grants.felker turpin,ex parte yerger,wall.here,another,federal statute gives this court jurisdiction to revie w b y writ of certiorari cases that,like this case,are in the courts of appeals when we grant the writ.this statutory jurisdictional grant replicates similar grants that yet older statutes provided.see,stat,stat.amending,stat,stat.evarts act,stat.this history provides particularly strong reasons not to read c silence or ambiguous language as modifying or limiting our jurisdiction.
we thus interpret c requirement as simply requiring a court of appeals to reach a decision within a specified time not to deprive this court of subsequent jurisdiction to review the case.see aetna casualty surety flowers,gay ruff.
we begin our principal place of business discussion with a brief review of relevant history.the constitution provides that the judicial power shall extend to controversies between citizens of different states.art.iii.this language,however,does not automatically confer diversity jurisdiction upon the federal courts.rather,it authorizes congress to do so and,in doing so,to determine the scope of the federal courts jurisdiction within constitutional limits.kline burke constr,mayor cooper,wall.
congress first authorized federal courts to exercise diversity jurisdiction in when,in the first judiciary act,congress granted federal courts authority to hear suits between a citizen of the state where the suit is brought,and a citizen of another state.stat.the statute said nothing about corporations.in,chief justice marshall,writing for a unanimous court,described a corporation as an invisible,intangible,and artificial being which was certainly not a citizen.bank of united states deveaux,cranch.but the court held that a corporation could invoke the federal courts diversity jurisdiction based on a pleading that the corporation shareholders were all citizens of a different state from the defendants,as the term citizen ought to be understood as it is used in the constitution,and as it is used in other laws.that is,to describe the real persons who come into court,in this case,under their corporate name.at.
in louisville,letson,how,the court modified this initial approach.it held that a corporation was to be deemed an artificial person of the state by which it had been created,and its citizenship for jurisdictional purposes determined accordingly,at.ten years later,the court in marshall baltimore ohio,how,held that the reason a corporation was a citizen of its state of incorporation was that,for the limited purpose of determining corporate citizenship,courts could conclusively and artificially presume that a corporation shareholders were citizens of the state of incorporation,at.and it reaffirmed letson,at.whatever the rationale,the practical upshot was that,for diversity purposes,the federal courts considered a corporation to be a citizen of the state of its incorporation.wright,miller,cooper,federal practice and procedure,ed.hereinafter wright miller.
in this court made clear that the state of incorporation rule was virtually absolute.it held that a corporation closely identified with state a could proceed in a federal court located in that state as long as the corporation had filed its incorporation papers in state b,perhaps a state where the corporation did no business at all.see black and white taxicab transfer brown and yellow taxicab transfer,refusing to question corporation reincorporation motives and finding diversity jurisdiction.subsequently,many in congress and those who testified before it pointed out that this interpretation was at odds with diversity jurisdiction basic rationale,namely,opening the federal courts doors to those who might otherwise suffer from local prejudice against parties.see.through its choice of the state of incorporation,a corporation could manipulate jurisdiction,for example,opening the federal courts doors in a state where it conducted nearly all its business by filing incorporation papers elsewhere,at since the supreme court has decided that a corporation is a citizen it has become a common practice for corporations to be incorporated in one state while they do business in another.and there is no doubt but that it often occurs simply for the purpose of being able to have the advantage of choosing between two tribunals in case of litigation see also hearings on et before a subcommittee of the senate committee on the judiciary,letter from george norris to attorney general william mitchell may,citing a common practice for individuals to incorporate in a foreign state simply for the purpose of taking litigation which may arise into the federal courts although various legislative proposals to curtail the corporate use of diversity jurisdiction were made,see,sess,none of these proposals were enacted into law.
at the same time as federal dockets increased in size,many judges began to believe those dockets contained too many diversity cases.a committee of the judicial conference of the united states studied the matter.see reports of the proceedings of the regular annual meeting and special meeting,in doc.and on march,that committee,the committee on jurisdiction and venue,issued a report hereinafter.committee rept.
among its observations,the committee found a general need to prevent frauds and abuses with respect to jurisdiction,at.the committee recommended against eliminating diversity cases altogether,at.instead it recommended,along with other proposals,a statutory amendment that would make a corporation a citizen both of the state of its incorporation and any state from which it received more than half of its gross income,at requiring corporation to show that less than fifty per cent of its gross income was derived from business transacted within the state where the federal court is held if,for example,a citizen of california sued under state law in state court a corporation that received half or more of its gross income from california,that corporation would not be able to remove the case to federal court,even if delaware was its state of incorporation.
during the spring and summer of committee members circulated their report and attended circuit conferences at which federal judges discussed the report recommendations.reflecting those criticisms,the committee filed a new report in september,in which it revised its corporate citizenship recommendation.it now proposed that a corporation shall be deemed a citizen of the state of its original creation and shall also be deemed a citizen of a state where it has its principal place of business.judicial conference of the united states,report of the committee on jurisdiction and venue,hereinafter.committee rept.the source of the statutory language.see hearings on et before subcommittee of the house committee on the judiciary,hereinafter house hearings.the committee wrote that this new language would provide a simpler and more practical formula than the gross income test.committee rept.it added that the language ha d a precedent in the jurisdictional provisions of the bankruptcy act.at.
in the committee presented its reports to the house of representatives committee on the judiciary.house hearings see also,hereinafter reprinting and.committee repts,hereinafter same.judge albert maris,representing judge john parker who had chaired the judicial conference committee,discussed various proposals that the judicial conference had made to restrict the scope of diversity jurisdiction.in respect to the principal place of business proposal,he said that the relevant language ha d been defined in the bankruptcy act.house hearings.he added 
all of those problems have arisen in bankruptcy cases,and as i recall the cases and i would want to be bound by this statement because i have them before me i think the courts have generally taken the view that where a corporation interests are rather widespread,the principal place of business is an actual rather than a theoretical or legal one.it is the actual place where its business operations are coordinated,directed,and carried out,which would ordinarily be the place where its officers carry on its business,where its accounts are kept,where its payments are made,and not necessarily a state in which it may have a plant,if it is a big corporation,or something of that sort.but that has been pretty well worked out in the bankruptcy cases,and that law would all be available,you see,to be applied here without having to go over it again from the beginning.ibid.
the house committee reprinted the judicial conference committee reports along with other reports and relevant testimony and circulated it to the general public for the purpose of inviting further suggestions and comments.at iii.subsequently,in,congress both codified the courts traditional place of incorporation test and also enacted into law a slightly modified version of the conference committee proposed principal place of business language.a corporation was to be deemed a citizen of any state by which it has been incorporated and of the state where it has its principal place of business.stat.
the phrase principal place of business has proved more difficult to apply than its originators likely expected.decisions under the bankruptcy act did not provide the firm guidance for which judge maris had hoped because courts interpreting bankruptcy law did not agree about how to determine a corporation principal place of business.compare burdick dillon,holding that a corporation principal office,rather than a factory,mill,or mine constitutes the principal place of business with continental coal roszelle,identifying the principal place of business as the location of mining activities,rather than the principal office see also friedenthal,new limitations on federal jurisdiction,stan,the cases under the bankruptcy act provide no rigid legal formula for the determination of the principal place of business 
after congress amendment,courts were similarly uncertain as to where to look to determine a corporation principal place of business for diversity purposes.if a corporation headquarters and executive offices were in the same state in which it did most of its business,the test seemed straightforward.the principal place of business was located in that state.see,long silver,pinnacle consultants,leucadia nat.
but suppose those corporate headquarters,including executive offices,are in one state,while the corporation plants or other centers of business activity are located in other states in a distinguished federal district judge,edward weinfeld,relied on the second circuit interpretation of the bankruptcy act to answer this question in part 
where a corporation is engaged in and varied activities which are carried on in different states,its principal place of business is the nerve center from which it radiates out to its constituent parts and from which its officers direct,control and coordinate all activities without regard to locale,in the furtherance of the corporate objective.the test applied by our court of appeals,is that place where the corporation has an office from which its busi
