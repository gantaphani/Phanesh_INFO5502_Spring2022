factual background and procedural history 
on january,a judgment in the amount of was entered in favor of part properties and against corning capital in an action filed in los angeles county superior court the judgment.on july,part properties assigned all of its rights,title,and interest in the judgment to pacific west one.on july,the franchise tax board suspended pacific west one corporate powers,rights,and privileges for the failure to pay taxes pursuant to revenue and taxation code section.on august,while still suspended,pacific west one assigned all of its rights,title,and interest in the judgment to cal western.
four years later,on april,cal western filed the instant action against corning capital to enforce the judgment.as of the date the action was filed,pacific west one corporate status had not been reinstated and its suspension remained in effect.on february,following several rounds of pleadings,cal western filed a fifth amended complaint alleging causes of action for fraud,deceit,fraudulent concealment,fraudulent conveyance,abuse of process,conspiracy,constructive trust,cancellation of instrument,and declaratory relief.the gravamen of cal western complaint was that corning capital had not paid any portion of the judgment,but nevertheless had caused to be filed a false and fraudulent full satisfaction of judgment for the purpose of avoiding collection of the judgment.cal western also alleged that corning capital had sought to conceal real property assets that could be used to satisfy the judgment by engaging in a series of fraudulent conveyances.as the assignee of the judgment,cal western sought to recover the principal amount of and accrued interest of.
in january,the trial court held a bifurcated jury trial on whether any of the smithams had caused,or was part of a conspiracy to cause,the full satisfaction of judgment to be filed with the court or recorded with the county recorder.the jury returned a special verdict finding that kathryn smitham was liable for causing the satisfaction of judgment to be both filed and recorded,but that thomas and elaine smitham were not liable.following the verdict,the trial court set a status conference and ordered further briefing to determine the remaining issues to be tried and whether thomas and elaine smitham should be dismissed from the action in light of the jury verdict.
on june,corning capital submitted a status conference brief in which it raised,for the first time,the issue of whether cal western had a right to sue on the judgment as the assignee of a suspended corporation.in support of its argument that cal western was precluded from suing,corning capital presented evidence that cal western assignor,pacific west one,was suspended at the time of its assignment,that its corporate powers had never been revived,and that it remained a suspended corporation.the evidence showed that pacific west one assignor,part properties,also was a suspended corporation,although it was unclear whether it was suspended at the time of its assignment to pacific west one on august,the trial court set the matter for a further status conference and ordered the parties to submit supplemental briefing on the issue.
on november,following the status conference and briefing,the trial court issued an order finding that cal western lacked the capacity to sue to enforce the judgment as the assignee of a suspended corporation.the court reasoned that t he fact that cal western is a corporation in good standing does not confer upon it the right to enforce the judgment and maintain an action based on the same.because pacific west and,perhaps,part properties too was a suspended corporation at the time of the assignment and remains a suspended corporation,cal western is,in essence,a suspended corporation as it relates to the judgment.the court acknowledged that a defense based on lack of capacity to sue had not been timely raised by corning capital,but found that the defense could still be asserted given that one or both of the assignors had been suspended for over a decade and did not appear to intend to pay the delinquent taxes owed.the court concluded that unless and until cal western can bring to this court proof of reviver it remains incapacitated and thus has no right to further pursue this lawsuit.
on march,the trial court,on its own motion,issued an order striking cal western fifth amended complaint and dismissing the action in its entirety pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision b.in its written order,the court stated as previously discussed in detail by this court,cal western obtained the judgment by means of an assignment from a suspended corporation.therefore,in relation to the judgment,cal western stands in the shoes of a suspended corporation.citation.a suspended corporation lacks capacity to enforce a judgment maintain a lawsuit.citation.the court further noted that cal western had represented to this court that it has no intention of reviving the corporate powers of the assignor suspended corporation,and a s a result,this court sees no reason why this action should be further entertained.the court also rejected cal western argument that public policy favored allowing an assignee in good standing to sue to enforce a judgment,reasoning that it would frustrate the purpose of revenue and taxation code section if a suspended corporation could evade its tax obligations but still retain the right to profit from or enforce its judgment by means of an assignment.on june,following the trial court entry of a judgment of dismissal,cal western filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
among other arguments,cal western contends that the trial court erred in striking its complaint and dismissing the action in its entirety on the basis that cal western lacked the capacity to sue to enforce the judgment.cal western asserts that,as a matter of statutory construction and public policy,revenue and taxation code section only applies to suspended corporations,and thus,pacific west one lack of capacity to sue as a suspended corporation did not preclude cal western from suing as an assignee in good standing.cal western also argues that,even if an incapacity defense could be applied to assignees of suspended corporations,the defense was waived here by corning capital failure to timely assert it.based on the facts presented in this case,we conclude that cal western lacked the legal capacity to bring an action to enforce the judgment as an assignee,and accordingly,its action against corning capital was properly dismissed.
