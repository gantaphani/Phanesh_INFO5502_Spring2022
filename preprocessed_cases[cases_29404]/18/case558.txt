the summary judgment record indicates that hardesty had a history of making inappropriate advances towards female employees at fox and that his tendencies were to fox managers.ken smith,a vice president in fox beaumont office,testified that,prior to the events at issue here,two female employees complained that hardesty called them asking for dates.a third complained that hardesty forcibly kissed her without her consent.there was also testimony that dianna thibodeaux,the designated manager for complaints under fox sexual harassment policy,requested that all new female employees be warned about hardesty flirtatious behavior.

the employees brought supervisor sexual harassment claims against national communications alleging that the corporation was liable for the conduct of its president,hardesty the plaintiff in any title vii sexual harassment case must,as an initial matter,establish that she belongs to a protected class she was subjected to unwelcome sexual harassment and the harassment was based on sex.watts kroger,cir see also la day catalyst,cir i t is important to note that judicial inquiry into the question whether a given instance of harassment constitutes discrimination is entirely separate from inquiry into whether the harasser conduct was serious enough to constitute either quid pro quo or hostile environment harassment.with the exception of myers,it is undisputed that the plaintiffs have satisfied these preliminary requirements for summary judgment purposes.
although myers does not allege that she was ever harassed by hardesty,she nevertheless contends that she should survive summary judgment on her sexual harassment claim because she was removed as thibodeaux assistant as a result of hardesty favoritism for gross and then was terminated for complaining about that favoritism.as we noted in green administrators of the tulane educational fund,cir,however,courts have held that when an employer discriminates in favor of a paramour,such an action is not discrimination,as the favoritism,while unfair,disadvantages both sexes alike for reasons other than gender.here,any discrimination suffered by myers with respect to her transfer was based not on her gender but instead on the fact that she happened to occupy a position in which hardesty allegedly wished to place gross.similarly,the fact that myers may have been terminated for complaining about favorable treatment received by gross is unrelated to myers gender.accordingly,myers can not state a claim for sexual harassment under title vii.
with regard to the remaining plaintiffs,they argue that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of national communications on the issue of vicarious liability.in holding that national communications was not vicariously liable for hardesty conduct,the district court found that hardesty was not the corporation proxy,and national communications successfully raised the faragher ellerth affirmative defense to liability.in its reasons,the district court explained that,hardesty could not be an of fox in any event because he owned only of the stock and he answered to lester langley,the corporation outside cpa.the issue of whether hardesty was national communications proxy is central to the resolution of this case because an employer is automatically liable for its proxies harassment of employees.harris forklift systems,d.
in two opinions published the same day,the supreme court addressed the issue of an employer vicarious liability and established an affirmative defense that may be raised in some hostile environment cases.faragher city of boca raton,d burlington industries,ellerth,d.the court held in these cases that 
an employer is subject to vicarious liability to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor with immediate or successively higher authority over the employee.when no tangible employment action is taken,a defending employer may raise an affirmative defense to liability or damages,subject to proof by a preponderance of the evidence,see fed.rule civ.proc.c.the defense comprises two necessary elements a that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior,and b that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.
faragher at.the district court and national communications ask us to read these opinions to allow an employer to raise the affirmative defense in every case not involving a tangible employment action.we decline to read the opinion so narrowly.
in faragher,the supreme court began its discussion of vicarious liability by outlining the development of the title vii caselaw.the court recognized that it established the foundation of employer liability in meritor savings bank,fsb vinson,d,when it held that title vii does not make employers always automatically liable for sexual harassment by their supervisors.faragher at.citing meritor at.the court went on to summarize caselaw,and cited with approval its earlier decision in harris forklift systems,d,where it held a corporation vicariously liable for the harassment of its president who was indisputably within that class of an employer organization officials who may be treated as the organization proxy.id.at.the court further suggested that an owner,supervisor holding a sufficiently high position in the management hierarchy,proprietor,partner,or corporate officer may also be treated as a corporation proxy.faragher at.internal citations omitted.the court made it clear that it was not abandoning the reasoning and analysis of harris and these earlier cases the soundness of the results in these cases and their continuing vitality in light of basic agency principles,was confirmed by this court only discussion to date of employer liability,in meritor id.at.while declining to issue a definitive rule on employer liability in meritor,the court stated that congress intended for courts to be guided by the principles of agency.meritor at.
we read the supreme court opinions in faragher and ellerth as the seventh circuit did in johnson west,cir,that the employer is vicariously liable for its employees activities in two types of situations there is a tangible employment action or the harassing employee is a proxy for the employer.the seventh circuit explained 
in ellerth and faragher,the supreme court considered an employer vicarious liability for the sexually harassing conduct of its supervisory staff.an employer is subject to vicarious liability to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile work environment created by a supervisor with immediate or successively higher authority over the employee.ellerth,at,d faragher,at,d.vicarious liability automatically applies when the harassing supervisor is either indisputably within that class of an employer organization officials who may be treated as the organization proxy,faragher,at,d,or when the supervisor harassment culminates in a tangible employment action,such as discharge,demotion,or undesirable reassignment.id.at.absent either of these situations,however,an employer may avoid vicarious liability by showing a that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior,and b that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.ellerth,at.
cir emphasis added.the seventh circuit ruled that the harasser,the chief of police at a va hospital,was not a proxy for the va because he had no less than two supervisors within the hospital and no doubt others within the va bureaucracy.as such,he was not a manager whose actions spoke for the id.the court also pointed out that the harasser had no authority to change the terms and conditions of the employee employment,and the employee worked for several supervisors.
similarly,the ninth circuit has cited faragher s discussion of harris for the proposition that an individual sufficiently senior in the corporation must be treated as the corporation proxy for purposes of liability,which constitutes a bar to the successful invocation of the faragher ellerth defense passantino johnson johnson consumer products,cir.because the seniority of the harassers was unclear from the record,the ninth circuit remanded the case to the district court for a determination of whether the harassers were sufficiently senior to be considered proxies so that the imposition of punitive damages against the corporate employer was proper.id.at.
the fox employees presented summary judgment evidence that at the time of the harassment,hardesty was the president and general manager of fox as well as a stockholder and member of the board of directors.national
