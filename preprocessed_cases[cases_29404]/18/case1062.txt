background 
oracle designs and markets computer software that enables businesses to manage information.it is the software company in the world,and,since the,has been the market leader in the arena of database management systems.plaintiffs allege that by the year,however,the database market had become substantially saturated.
in the late,oracle developed the suite,which was designed to permit businesses to manage their financial,manufacturing,sales,logistics,and supplier information without having to purchase and integrate separate software from different vendors.according to oracle,the benefit to customers of the suite was that it like lego blocks.once you have one piece in,the other pieces just snap together.there no systems integration required.
plaintiffs allege that oracle released the suite in may without sufficient technical development and that numerous defects in the program soon became apparent.around the same time,the national economy began to decline.plaintiffs allege that growing customer awareness of the defects in the suite and the declining economy had hurt oracle sales by the second quarter of oracle fiscal year september,but that oracle covered up its losses by creating phony sales invoices and improperly recognizing past customer overpayments as revenue.because of this alleged,oracle was able to report revenues of billion as well as earnings of eleven cents per share,rather than the cents per share that oracle allegedly actually earned.oracle second quarter report came out on december,and oracle stock price rose from on december to on december.
oracle predicted that,in the third quarter of its fiscal year,it would earn twelve cents per share and have revenues of billion.it also predicted that applications sales,sales of the suite would grow and that database sales would grow.moreover,during the class period,december,oracle made several statements that it would achieve its growth estimates because the suite was functioning well,a strong number of sales were in the pipeline in the united states,europe,and asia,and the declining economy was not affecting oracle overall performance.for example,executive vice president and chief financial officer jeffrey henley said in a radio interview on december that the economy right now even though it slowing does seem to be affecting us.we see no difference in demand for our upcoming third fiscal quarter,and lawrence ellison,chief executive officer of oracle,was quoted as saying,the economic slowdown is hurting oracle because the company has spent the past three years updating its product line to focus on software that helps companies use the internet to cut costs and boost efficiency.on january,executive edward sanderson reportedly told analysts at salomon smith barney that oracle was seeing robust demand for both its database and applications businesses oracle says it is also seeing sustained demand for its database product,despite concern over contracting it budgets.oracle spokeswoman stephanie aas told reporters that,as of january,oracle has yet to see any sign that its business is being hurt by the economic slowdown or reported cuts to budgets.further,analysts reported that,on february,oracle management was not seeing the effects of a slowing economy at this point,and was not changing its forecasts.two days later,oracle spokeswoman jennifer glass reiterated that oracle had not changed its projections and said that the slowdown is going to provide new opportunities for oracle as companies need to streamline and be more strategic about the technology they buy.
between january and january,ellison sold more than million shares of oracle stock for almost million.it was the first time he had sold oracle shares in five years.million of the shares were options that ellison had acquired for cents per share he sold the stock for per share.chief financial officer jeff henley sold one million shares of oracle stock on january for per share he had paid between and for the shares.
on march,approximately one month after ellison stock sales,oracle revealed that it would earn only ten cents per share and would post revenues of only billion in the third quarter.it also reported that applications sales would grow significantly less than predicted,and that database sales would show either flat or negative growth.the next day,oracle stock prices fell from to.plaintiffs allege that oracle had known much earlier in the quarter that its sales were declining due to the slowing economy and the suite defects and that it would not meet its growth estimates.
the first complaint was filed by local nursing home pension fund on march.following certification and consolidation of related actions,plaintiffs filed a consolidated class action complaint against oracle alleging violations of section b of the act and rule on august.plaintiffs also alleged that oracle was liable under section a of the act.
a series of dismissals and filings of amended complaints ensued until,on march,the district court granted oracle motion to dismiss plaintiffs revised second amended complaint the operative complaint with prejudice for failure to state a claim under.b because the pleadings did not meet the heightened pleading requirements of the pslra.
plaintiffs filed timely notice of appeal.we have jurisdiction under.

discussion 
the district court agreed with plaintiffs that oracle forecasts regarding the third quarter,that the declining economy was not hurting its business and that oracle would earn twelve cents per share and would see applications revenues grow and database revenues grow,as well as oracle statements that the suite is and fully interoperable out of the box and that no systems integration is required,were actionable.however,the district court held that the allegations in the complaint did not create a strong inference that these statements were known to be false when made.we hold that the allegations in the complaint did create such an inference.
the most direct way to show both that a statement was false when made and that the party making the statement knew that it was false is via contemporaneous reports or data,available to the party,which contradict the statement.past securities fraud litigants have relied on the fact that corporations typically produce internal reports,and have alleged that such reports contained negative information without ever having seen any particular documents.see in re silicon graphics,at noting that the district court had taken judicial notice of five other securities class action complaints containing the same boilerplate allegations of negative internal reports found in the complaint at hand.at its worst,this strategy allowed plaintiffs to bring securities fraud suits with little more basis than the fact that the stock price had fallen.we have held that a proper complaint which purports to rely on the existence of internal reports would contain at least some specifics from those reports as well as such facts as may indicate their reliability.id.at.
here,plaintiffs allege that oracle maintained an internal database covering global information about sales of oracle products and services.according to the complaint,sanderson said 
i n the sales area,in the sales automation area,i can ellison can look at,for example,our forecast on a global basis,our forecast around the world up to the minute at any level of detail that you want to see now i can see every deal out there that my reps around the world are working.
ellison is quoted as saying,all of our information is on one database.we know exactly how much we have sold in the last hour around the world,emphasis in original.plaintiffs allege that,since all sales information was in this database,and since the top executives admit to having monitored the database,oracle must have been aware that it was not going to meet its sales projections earlier in the third quarter,and that its statements to the contrary were therefore made with scienter.
at first glance,these allegations might seem comparable to those made in lipton pathogenesis,cir.there,plaintiffs alleged that defendant corporation pathogenesis could regularly track its sales data and that the company tracked patient demand using data provided by ims health,an information vendor,which indicated that patient demand was flat.id.at.we held that such allegations were insufficient to plead scienter under the pslra because,although plaintiffs referr ed to the existence of the ims data and ma d e a general assertion about what they think the data show ed,they had no hard numbers or other specific information.id.at.
by contrast,plaintiffs here have hard numbers and make specific allegations regarding large portions of oracle sales data.the complaint contains specific statements from former employees and managers in various regions of the united states and working in a number of different departments testifying to a major slowdown in sales.for example,an account manager for the western united states said that by the summer,the telephones in general business west went dead.a former vice president of finance stated that,on the basis of the information available to them,the defendants would have known at least six weeks prior to the end of the third quarter that the applications sales growth would miss projections by at least.an staff consultant reported a severe slowdown of consulting work in the southeast.
although oracle has more than salespeople located in sixty different countries,the united states accounts for approximately half of oracle annual revenue,which typically exceeds billion.plaintiffs witnesses evaluations of oracle financial health in the united states thus offer a substantial window into the overall financial health of the corporation in combination with the remaining allegations in the complaint,these statements create a strong inference of scienter.
to begin with,a number of large deals were either lost or delayed early in the third quarter.four of those deals alone would have totaled up to million.these deals account for nearly of the total shortfall.it was clear by december and january that these deals had either fallen through entirely or would not take place during the third quarter.it is reasonable to believe that oracle had known,prior to its march report,that it would not reach its projected earnings,particularly since ellison acknowledged that i was involved in an awful lot of these deals.
second,between january and january,in his first stock sales in five years,ellison sold more than million shares of oracle stock for almost million henley sold one million shares of oracle stock on january for per share.stock trades are only suspicious when dramatically out of line with prior trading practices at times calculated to maximize the personal benefit from undisclosed inside information.silicon graphics,at.
to evaluate suspiciousness of stock sales,we consider,inter alia,three factors the amount and percentage of shares sold timing of the sales and consistency with prior trading history.id.ellison sold a large amount of stock million shares of oracle stock worth almost million in total.in holding that ellison and henley stock sales were not suspicious,however,the district court noted that ellison sold only of his holdings,and henley sold.
ellison stock sale presents a novel situation few others could sell million worth of stock and only sell of their holdings.in the past,we have given great weight to the percentage of stock sold.see,am.west,at most of the individuals sold of their shares,with the lowest percentage being.the proceeds from these sales totaled over million.silicon graphics,at all but two of the officers in this case sold a relatively small portion of their total holdings.however,where,as here,stock sales result in a truly astronomical figure,less weight should be given to the fact that they may represent a small portion of the defendant holdings.
the timing of the stock sales is also suspicious.ellison sold his shares between january and january,approximately one month prior to the march report of sales.henley had sold his shares on january.moreover,while there are no allegations with regard to henley prior trading history,the complaint alleges that e
