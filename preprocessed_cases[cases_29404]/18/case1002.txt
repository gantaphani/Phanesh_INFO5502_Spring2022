in his capacity as president of noll manufacturing company noll and its successors,clair couturier,together with his fellow directors,diverted almost million of corporate assets at least a third of the corporation value,even in couturier own estimation to his own possession through the buyout of deferred compensation agreements.plaintiffs,all of whom are participants in noll employee stock ownership plan esop,filed suit against couturier and two other directors alleging,inter alia,breach of fiduciary duties under the employee retirement income security act of erisa.this case requires us to consider whether the district court abused its discretion when it enjoined advancement of defense costs and froze couturier assets.we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion,but remand to allow the district court,in the first instance,to set the terms and conditions of a surety bond sufficient to secure couturier and the other defendants against any harm that might wrongfully befall them as a result of the issuance of each injunction.
noll,a closely held corporation founded in,manufactured and sold galvanized sheet metal products.through restructuring,noll was succeeded first by n nw holding company n nw in,and then by the employee ownership holding company teohc in.
noll founder,who died in,established the esop in to give the company employees an opportunity to share in its success.his will reflects an intent that the esop own the entire company.however,for reasons we can not discern from the record,the esop did not acquire full ownership of noll until.
clair couturier,became president of noll in.noll board of directors designated couturier the sole trustee for the esop as of april.attorney david johanson,who had previously represented the esop in connection with its leveraged purchase of all remaining noll stock,was appointed a noll director on june,joining couturier and noll general counsel on the board.however,after the transfer of ownership to n nw later that year,couturier and johanson remained as the sole directors.
this litigation traces its genesis to the sizeable deferred compensation awarded to couturier during his tenure as president of noll and its successors.prior to,retired noll executives were entitled to continue receiving percent of their base salary,with an adjustment made every three years,under a compensation continuation agreement cca.in,however,johanson drafted three documents that tied deferred executive compensation to company value an equity incentive plan eip establishing an incentive stock option plan for key management personnel an incentive stock option agreement iso granting couturier shares at a strike price of and a value enhancement incentive plan veip creating additional synthetic equity.at the time these plans were enacted,one director reportedly opined that this is not too good for the esop they were nonetheless approved by the board on june,
after the reorganization of noll under n nw,johanson and couturier,remaining as the sole directors,orchestrated additional incentive agreements in february.the eip allowed for issuance of up to shares,with no more than shares being awarded to a single grantee.the iso again granted to couturier shares at a strike price of per share.the veip created additional synthetic equity for couturier.couturier and johanson also increased couturier monthly cca stipend by about percent and enacted a supplemental executive retirement plan providing additional deferred compensation 
the advent of heralded further expansion of couturier compensation.that year,couturier and johanson approved a retroactive annual cash bonus to couturier equaling ten percent of the dollar amount of external debt repaid on certain loans.some of these loans were refinanced later that same year.n nw then purchased a million home the palm desert home and a private golf club membership in palm desert,california,for couturier personal use.
after unsuccessful negotiations with alliance holdings,for the acquisition of n nw during which the value of couturier interest in the company became a point of contention couturier and johanson appointed couturier financial advisor,robert eddy,as special trustee to the esop.eddy role was to evaluate proposed transactions involving n nw and the esop,including monetization of couturier financial interest in n nw.couturier and johanson ultimately opted to merge n nw into teohc,which johanson had incorporated in delaware on december.as the incorporator,johanson appointed himself,couturier,eddy,and accountant james roorda as directors.pursuant to a new plan,the esop was now to be administered by trustees appointed by the teohc board of directors the board members appointed themselves as trustees.
on july,pursuant to the merger transaction,couturier received over million in cash,title to the palm desert home,a bentley automobile valued at,and various other benefits in exchange for his deferred compensation interests.the parties value this buyout package at million accordingly,couturier overall compensation package equals about percent of teohc assets as of june,and about percent of n nw assets as of each of the prior two years.the package also exceeded by more than n nw stock market value.
on october,several former and current noll employees collectively,plaintiffs,all of whom are esop participants,filed suit against couturier,johanson,and eddy collectively,defendants in the united states district court for the eastern district of california.claiming that couturier was vastly overcompensated,plaintiffs amended complaint seeks relief from defendants alleged breach of fiduciary duties in their capacities as erisa fiduciaries and corporate directors.under erisa,plaintiffs seek to hold defendants jointly and severally liable for all esop losses related to their misconduct creation of a constructive trust for disgorgement of defendants wrongful profit and removal of eddy as esop trustee.plaintiffs also seek to hold couturier and johanson jointly and severally liable for losses suffered by noll and n nw because of directorial misconduct,and all three defendants jointly and severally liable for losses suffered by teohc because of directorial misconduct.finally,plaintiffs also accuse johanson and his law firm of professional negligence,and on this basis seek to hold them jointly and severally liable for losses suffered by noll,n nw,and teohc.
the defendant directors,officers,and trustees entered into multiple and largely identical indemnification agreements with noll and its successors between and.these agreements generally indemnify defendants for any liabilities incurred in their service as directors and,in the case of couturier and eddy,in their service as esop trustees so long as any such liability did not involve deliberate wrongful acts or gross negligence.the agreements are governed by california law to the extent not preempted by federal law couturier trustee indemnification further specifies that it is s ubject to the relevant provisions of erisa.
at issue here are provisions within the indemnification agreements requiring teohc to advance defense costs.seeking advancement as promised in the indemnification agreements,each defendant has executed an undertaking to repay teohc for any expenses paid by it on my behalf in advance of the final disposition of the instant suit,if it shall ultimately be determined that i am not entitled to be indemnified by the company under delaware law.
after learning that johanson and eddy had asserted a claim for advancement of defense costs against teohc in a related commercial arbitration proceeding conducted before the american arbitration association aaa,plaintiffs and the department of labor dol sought to intervene.the arbitrator declined to allow intervention,finding that determination of the contract interpretation questions presented here would not be aided by input from these third parties,and ordered teohc to advance johanson and eddy defense costs.after plaintiffs obtained an order to show cause why the advancement should not be enjoined,the district court on september,found that plaintiffs were not bound by the aaa decision and had met their burden justifying issuance of a preliminary injunction prohibiting the advancement of defense costs.couturier,johanson,and eddy all timely appealed this injunction 
on october,the district court also granted a second preliminary injunction preventing couturier from transferring,secreting,assigning,pledging,mortgaging,or hypothecating the assets he received as part of the buyout package without prior court approval and ordering an accounting of these assets within days.however,the court limited this injunction to allow couturier to cover normal living expenses and legal fees.couturier timely appealed this second preliminary injunction.
a subsidiary of gibraltar industries,purchased teohc assets on april,for almost million.approximately million of the sale proceeds remained for distribution to the esop after payment of bank debt,executive compensation,closing costs,and escrow.consulting fiduciaries,the current esop trustee,distributed million to the participants in january.the balance of funds has been withheld,at least partly in escrow,to allow teohc to pay for its own legal expenses once directors and officers liability d o insurance coverage is exhausted and to satisfy the indemnification agreements with defendants.
defendants collectively make three separate arguments to avoid invalidation of these agreements under erisa that they are not erisa fiduciaries that the setting of executive compensation is a business decision not subject to erisa and that whether teohc is obligated to advance their defense costs is purely a matter of state contract law.we consider and reject each argument in turn.
congress enacted erisa to establish minimum standards assuring the equitable character of benefit plans and their financial soundness.a.to accomplish this goal,erisa requires that plan assets be held in trust for the exclusive benefit of plan participants and their beneficiaries.id.moreover,authority to control and manage the operation and administration of the plan must be vested in one or more named fiduciaries.id.a.in order to protect the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries,erisa also imposes standards of conduct,responsibility,and obligation for fiduciaries of employee benefit plans.id.b.these standards include duties of loyalty and care,id.a,as well as a prohibition on,id.b.

we construe erisa fiduciary status liberally,consistent with erisa policies and objectives.state carpenters pension trust fund citibank,cir.erisa defines fiduciary not in terms of formal trusteeship,but in functional terms of control and authority over the plan.mertens hewitt,d.thus,erisa and esop fiduciaries include not only those specifically named in the employee benefit plan,a,but also any individual who exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of such plan or exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets,a i.we have accordingly recognized that where members of an employer board of directors have responsibility for the appointment and removal of erisa trustees,those directors are themselves subject to erisa fiduciary duties,albeit only with respect to trustee selection and retention batchelor oak hill med.group,cir.
because all three defendants served as esop trustees,each was an erisa fiduciary subject to the duties of loyalty and care and to the prohibition against.couturier served as the sole trustee of the noll esop beginning on april.eddy was appointed special trustee to the esop in.after noll merged into teohc in,all three defendants were appointed to the esop board of trustees.
johanson argues,without any citation to the record,that he served on the teohc esop board of trustees for only one day,and thus never had the opportunity to take any actions that would subject him to erisa fiduciary duties.be that as it may,johanson,together with couturier and eddy,also served on the teohc board of directors.the teohc esop plan specified that it was to be administered by a board of trustees composed of individuals who will be appointed by the unanimous action of the board of directors of teohc.emphasis added.the plan further vested the power of trustee removal in the teohc board of directors.thus,as the de facto decision makers of closely held and related entities,all three defendants including johanson also served as erisa fiduciaries with respect to appointment and removal of esop trustees.see batchelor,at d.
erisa confers upon federal district courts exclusive jurisdiction over any civil action brought by a plan participant or beneficiary for equitable relief from a trustee breach of fiduciary duty.a,e.johanson argues,however,that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the instant case because the actions challenged by plaintiffs actions that resulted in the allegedly excessive compensation of couturier are business decisions not subject to erisa.
decisions relating to corporate salaries generally do not fall within erisa purview.but where plan assets include the employer stock,the value of those assets depends on the employer equity.employee compensation levels are,of course,one of the many business expenditures reducing the value of the overall equity of any company.on the other hand,v irtually all of an employer significant business decisions affect the value of its stock,and therefore the benefits that esop plan participants will ultimately receive.martin feilen,cir.taken to its logical conclusion,therefore,this line of thinking would,in the case of an esop,extend the application of erisa to a corporation annual expenditures on office supplies clearly an absurd result.the eighth circuit has on this basis limited an erisa fiduciary duties to transactions that involve investing the esop assets or administering the plan.id.setting executive compensation levels does not obviously fall into either category.see eckelkamp beste,d,holding that a corporate director is not acting as an esop fiduciary in setting compensation levels.
nonetheless,we conclude that applying erisa to the instant case does not risk encompassing within its confines any and all corporate decisions shielded by the business judgment rule.where,as here,an esop fiduciary also serves as a corporate director or officer,imposing erisa duties on business decisions from which that individual could directly profit does not to us seem an unworkable rule.to the contrary,our holding merely comports with congressional intent in establishing erisa fiduciary duties as the highest known to the law.howard shay,cir quotation omitted.to hold otherwise would protect from erisa liability obvious,as plaintiffs allege occurred here,to the detriment of the plan beneficiaries.
defendants argue that whether teohc is obligated to advance their defense costs is purely a matter of state contract law,and that erisa simply does not apply.erisa preemption is a question of law that we review de novo.elliot fortis benefits ins,cir.
erisa contains a broad preemption clause,such that with only limited exceptions it supersede s any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.a.as in boggs boggs,we can begin,and in this case end,the analysis by simply asking if state law conflicts with the provisions of erisa or operates to frustrate its objects,d see also branco ufcw northern cal.employers joint pension plan,cir holding that erisa surviving spouse annuity preempts a testamentary transfer.
defendants indemnification agreements specify that they are governed by california law.california allows advancement of defense costs upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the agent to repay that amount if it shall be determined ultimately that the agent is not entitled to be indemnified as authorized in this section.cal.f.couturier,johanson,and eddy all submitted the requisite undertakings,thus apparently rendering advancement of their defense costs enforceable under state law.
however,defendants indemnification agreements provide complete indemnity so long as the challenged acts or omissions do not involve deliberate wrongful acts or gross negligence.erisa,by contrast,requires that a fiduciary act with the care,skill,prudence,and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims.a b.the indemnification agreements thus effectively limit defendants liability under erisa because,so long as they do not engage in deliberate wrongful acts or gross negligence,defendants will be indemnified even if they violated the erisa prudent man standard of care.accordingly,application of state law in the instant case conflicts with erisa and is preempted.see boggs,at.in the face of a direct clash between state law and the provisions and objectives of erisa,the state law can not stand.
with these principles in mind,we turn to an evaluation of the district court decision to enjoin advancement of defense costs.a plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits,that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief,that the balance of equities tips in his favor,and that an injunction is in the public interest.winter natural res.defense council,d.we review the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.am.trucking ass ns city of los angeles,cir.this review is limited and deferential,and it does not extend to the underlying merits of the case.id.quoting lands council martin,cir.a district court necessarily abuses its discretion when it bases its decision on an erroneous legal standard or on clearly erroneous findings of fact.id.quoting lands council,at.but a s long as the district court got the law right,it will not be reversed simply because the appellate court would have arrived at a different result if it had applied the law to the facts of the case.id.quoting wildwest inst.bull,cir alteration in original.
we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in preliminarily enjoining teohc from advancing defendants defense costs.plaintiffs established all four elements of the governing standard,and defendants have failed to demonstrate that the district court based its decision either on an erroneous legal standard or on clearly erroneous findings of fact.
plaintiffs have established that they are likely to succeed in proving that defendants breached their fiduciary duties under erisa.plaintiffs allege that defendants breached these obligations by engaging in a series of transactions that improperly diverted much of the equity in teohc and thus in the esop to couturier.plaintiffs claim that by engaging in these transactions,defendants impermissibly placed couturier financial interests ahead of the esop.the district court correctly compared the size of couturier million buyout package with the company overall value,and properly noted its concern that this comparison by itself constitutes strong evidence that defendants breached their fiduciary duties under erisa.couturier buyout package of million equaled nearly percent of the company total assets as of june,and exceeded by more than twofold n nw value.
in,moss adams advisory services moss adams recommended that couturier be given no more than between million and million,the value of the deferred compensation agreements which n nw carried on its books at that time.the record reveals that the moss adams team was clearly uncomfortable with the package proposed by couturier and johanson,and refused to opine on the fairness of what ultimately became a million package.on january,moss adams qualified its opinion to specifically exclude the issues of whether the executive compensation for various executives and related packages represent reasonable compensation,deferring to others the resolution of these matters.at least at this stage in the proceedings,it is difficult to understand how an erisa fiduciary exercising the requisite care,and acting exclusively in the esop interest,could have acquiesced to a buyout package for couturier that apparently exceeded the fair market value by some million.as trustees,defendants should have opposed the buyout package.and as directors with authority over the selection and retention of trustees,defendants should have recognized that couturier was hopelessly mired in a clear conflict of interest involving such blatant and sought his removal as an esop trustee.
because plaintiffs are likely to succeed in proving that defendants breached their erisa duties,they are also likely to succeed in proving that defendants are not entitled to indemnification,nor to advancement of defense costs,because section a of erisa renders the governing agreements void.section a specifies that any provision in an agreement or instrument which purports to relieve a fiduciary from responsibility or liability for any responsibility,obligation,or duty under this part shall be void as against public policy.a.thus,i f an erisa fiduciary writes words in an instrument exonerating itself of fiduciary responsibility,the words,even if agreed upon,are generally without effect.it am.life ins,cir.
admittedly,erisa does not bar the purchase of liability insurance by a plan,fiduciary,or employer.b.the dol has therefore interpreted section to permit indemnification of fiduciaries so long as the agreement do es not relieve a fiduciary of responsibility or liability under erisa.in other words,an indemnification provision is valid if it merely permit s another party to satisfy any liability incurred by the fiduciary in the same manner as insurance.id.this dol exemption does not,however,extend to indemnification of a fiduciary by the erisa plan itself.id.the department of labor interprets section a as rendering void any arrangement for indemnification of a fiduciary of an employee benefit plan by the plan.the dol has explained that s uch an arrangement would have the same result as an exculpatory clause,in that it would,in effect,relieve the fiduciary of responsibility and liability to the plan by abrogating the plan right to recovery from the fiduciary for breaches of fiduciary obligations.id.
the indemnification agreements and associated advancement provisions at issue here clearly purport to relieve defendants from their fiduciary responsibilities under erisa.erisa requires that a fiduciary discharge its duties with the care,skill,prudence,and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims.a b.the indemnification agreements,by contrast,indemnify defendants so long as the liability for which coverage is sought did not involve any deliberate wrongful acts or gross negligence.nor do the signed undertakings provide the esop with any recourse should defendants be found to have violated only their fiduciary duties under erisa.consequently,because plaintiffs have shown probable success on the merits of their erisa claims,they have also shown that section a likely renders void the indemnification agreements and advancement provisions therein.
defendants nonetheless argue that section a does not apply because advancement would be made from corporate,not plan,assets.see h establishing that corporate assets are not plan assets where the plan is an esop.but given that teohc plan of liquidation provides for payment of all remaining equity to esop participants as shareholders,this is not a case where,in accordance with,the indemnification agreement merely permit s another party other than the plan to satisfy any liability incurred by the fiduciary.to the contrary,any proceeds taken from teohc remaining funds to pay defendants defense costs will,dollar for dollar,reduce the funds available for distribution to esop participants.in other words,advancement is here tantamount to asking esop participants to pay for defendants defense costs,with no recovery possible or at least highly unlikely even if defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the esop so long as defendants did not engage in deliberate wrongful acts or gross negligence.such a result is impermissible under section a.
finally,because the agreement indemnifying couturier as a trustee specifies that it is s ubject to the relevant provisions of erisa,couturier argues that his right to advancement is not void under section a.this assertion overlooks two key points.first,the remaining three agreements indemnifying couturier as a director contain no such limitation,even though in his capacity as director couturier was subject to erisa fiduciary duties with respect to appointment and retention of esop trustees.second,as we explain above,plaintiffs are likely to succeed in proving that couturier did in fact breach his erisa obligations,thus also rendering this particular indemnification agreement unenforceable.
the supreme court recently clarified that preliminary injunctive relief is available only if plaintiffs demonstrate that irreparable injury is likely in the absence of an injunction.winter.at.in so doing,the court rejected the ninth circuit possibility of irreparable harm test,noting that i ssuing a preliminary injunction based only on a possibility of irreparable harm is inconsistent with our characterization of injunctive relief as an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.id.at.defendants allege that the district court failed to apply the requisite likelihood of harm standard and relied instead on a possibility of harm.we disagree.
the district court correctly found that plaintiffs will likely succeed in proving that defendants breached their fiduciary duties under erisa.the district court therefore also correctly found that plaintiffs will likely succeed in proving that the indemnification agreements are void under section a of erisa because they exculpate defendants from their fiduciary obligations.consequently,there is more than a possibility that defendants will be required to reimburse teohc for any advanced defense costs there is at least a likelihood.
similarly,there is a likelihood that defendants will not have the resources to reimburse teohc if defense costs are advanced.plaintiffs are not required to submit detailed financial statements in support of this assertion.rather,it is enough that couturier himself alleged that defendants even now would not be able to pay their legal bills without advancement of funds.moreover,defendants have already expended the million in d o insurance coverage previously available to defend this suit,are represented by multiple attorneys raising a vigorous defense,and are facing a potential judgment in the tens of millions of dollars if found to have breached their fiduciary duties.nor have defendants submitted any financial data demonstrating that they will be able to reimburse teohc if a judgment is rendered against them.thus,the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that plaintiffs established a likelihood of irreparable harm if injunctive relief were denied.
the balance of equities tips in plaintiffs favor.admittedly,if the preliminary injunction is upheld,defendants will be forced either to find a way to pay for their own defense and seek recovery after trial to find attorneys willing to accept the risk of payment after trial to continue litigation without representation or to settle.we recognize that these options are accompanied by real and difficult consequences for each defendant.nonetheless,any such consequences are outweighed by the potential hardship to plaintiffs if advanced defense costs are not reimbursed.
if,as is likely,defendants are found to have violated their fiduciary obligations under erisa,section a renders their indemnification agreements void and they are not entitled to advancement of defense costs.even if that were not the case,plaintiffs are willing to place the potential defense costs in escrow if they do so,defendants will ultimately be able to recover their costs if so entitled.by contrast,as explained above,recovery by plaintiffs of any advanced defense costs seems remote,a result that would leave esop participants without the benefits whose security erisa strives above all else to protect.
in exercising their sound discretion,courts of equity should pay particular regard for the public consequences in employing the extraordinary remedy of injunction.winter.at quoting weinberger romero barcelo,d.defendants invoke the public interest in ensuring that talented individuals remain willing to serve as corporate directors and officers.but this concern,while significant,is far outweighed by the interests that erisa protects.in enacting erisa,congress noted 
that the continued and security of millions of employees and their dependents are directly affected by these plans that they are affected with a national public interest that they have become an important factor affecting the stability of employment and the successful development of industrial relations that despite the enormous growth in such plans many employees with long years of employment are losing anticipated retirement benefits owing to the lack of vesting provisions in such plans that owing to the inadequacy of current minimum standards,the soundness and stability of plans with respect to adequate funds to pay promised benefits may be endangered that owing to the termination of plans before requisite funds have been accumulated,employees and their beneficiaries have been deprived of anticipated benefits and that it is therefore desirable in the interests of employees and their beneficiaries,for the protection of the revenue of the united states,and to provide for the free flow of commerce,that minimum standards be provided assuring the equitable character of such plans and their financial soundness.
a.in order for erisa to promote the interests of employees and their beneficiaries in employee benefit plans,shaw delta air lines,d,congress chose to hold plan fiduciaries to a high standard in fact,the highest known to the law.howard,at quotation omitted.congress also chose to render void any agreement that would exculpate a fiduciary from responsibility for a breach of that standard.a.accordingly,the public interest here favors upholding the preliminary injunction barring advancement of defense costs by teohc.
we also reject the numerous additional arguments through which defendants attempt to invalidate this preliminary injunction.defendants attack the preliminary injunction as based on insufficient evidence,as failing to give due deference to the arbitration order,as improper under supreme court precedent,as impermissibly granting relief of a different character than any judgment that might finally issue,and as improperly imposing a constructive trust.none of these arguments has merit.
defendants first allege that the district court failed to rely on credible and admissible evidence in granting the preliminary injunction.see,am.passage media cass commc ns,cir finding an insufficient showing of irreparable harm in part because submitted affidavits from plaintiff own executives are conclusory and without sufficient support in facts.they object in particular to the district court reliance on the interested declaration of plaintiffs counsel and unverified client complaints.
