in,peter hoffman borrowed from jay firestone,and drafted and executed a promissory note for the amount of the loan.firestone sued hoffman on the note,alleging that the loan was never repaid.at trial,firestone persuaded the court to exclude nearly all of the evidence that hoffman sought to introduce in his defense,and the jury returned a verdict for firestone.in the published portion of our opinion,we hold that firestone canadian tax returns are relevant and not privileged,and that the trial court abused its discretion when it concluded to the contrary.in the unpublished portion of our opinion,we conclude that this evidentiary error and others were sufficiently prejudicial to warrant reversal.
background 
firestone claim and hoffman defenses 
hoffman borrowed from firestone and memorialized the loan in a promissory note the note that hoffman drafted himself and executed on june.the note provides that t he outstanding principal balance shall bear interest at the rate of seven and percent per annum all principal and interest shall be due and payable on the day of july.the note also provides that a ll principal and interest not paid when due shall bear interest from such date until paid in full at a rate equal to the federal rate determined pursuant to section d of the internal revenue code of in addition,the note provides that a ny extensions of time granted to the undersigned shall not release the undersigned nor constitute a waiver of the rights of the holder of this note.and the note includes the following attorneys fees provision in the event the holder of this note incurs any loss,cost,or expense in enforcing any of the terms hereof,the undersigned agrees to pay the costs and expenses so paid or incurred by the holder,including,without limitation,reasonable attorneys fees and costs.the provisions of the note are to be governed by the laws of the state of california 
in,firestone sued hoffman on the note.firestone alleged that on or about november,he had demanded that hoffman pay the principal and accrued interest under the note,and that hoffman had breached the note by failing to pay.firestone sought to recover the principal and interest due under the note,as well as attorneys fees and costs.
hoffman principal defenses,as developed in subsequent proceedings,were these first,hoffman claimed that he and firestone had extinguished the obligations under the note by means of a novation.under the alleged novation,the note was to be extinguished,firestone was to the note as uncollectible on his canadian taxes,and hoffman was to arrange for a corporation under his direction to pay firestone from two tax shelter transactions in ireland.second,hoffman claimed that firestone was already paid on the note by a third party,can west global entertainment or one of its subsidiaries can west,when can west purchased firestone company,fireworks entertainment,fireworks.third,hoffman claimed that any recovery by firestone on the note should be set off against any amounts that hoffman recovers from firestone on certain tort claims concerning their business dealings.hoffman and a business entity with which he is associated have alleged those tort claims in a separate lawsuit filed in the superior court against firestone hoffman firestone,bc.hoffman attempt to have the tort suit consolidated with this one failed when firestone removed the tort suit to federal court,where it remained until after the jury returned its verdict in the instant case.on december,the federal district court entered an order remanding the tort suit to the superior court,where it is now stayed.
ii.summary judgment proceedings 
on may,firestone moved for summary judgment or,in the alternative,summary adjudication.hoffman opposed on the basis of the defenses described above,among others.
in reply,firestone argued that the novation was void because the alleged new contract,involving the canadian tax and the irish tax shelters,was illegal in numerous ways,including purported attempts to violate canadian community property and tax laws at the very least.as regards the claim that firestone has already been paid on the note by can west,firestone argued that the claim was conclusively disproved by the contract for can west acquisition of fireworks from firestone.firestone did not introduce the contract but said he was willing to provide it to the court for in camera review,and he claimed that hoffman cocounsel had reviewed the contract and agreed that it did not address the note.by way of supplemental declaration,hoffman cocounsel stated that he had said no such,he had told firestone counsel that he could not tell from the text of the agreement whether over million in consideration paid to firestone included reimbursement of the amounts due under the note.finally,as regards hoffman defense,firestone acknowledged the existence of hoffman tort suit but nonetheless argued,without further explanation,that the defense failed because hoffman has no demand for money against firestone,so there are clearly no mutual debts at issue.
the trial court denied firestone motion.the court determined that there were triable issues of fact concerning hoffman novation and reimbursement defenses.it further concluded that firestone had not introduced a properly authenticated copy of the note.
iii.discovery proceedings 
hoffman deposed firestone but was dissatisfied with the results because firestone counsel instructed firestone not to answer numerous questions that,according to hoffman,were relevant to hoffman defenses.the questions related,for example,to the irish tax shelters,to prior business dealings between hoffman,firestone,and affiliated business entities,and to conversations between firestone and greg gilhooly,an attorney who was an executive at fireworks,concerning the note.hoffman moved to compel answers to the unanswered questions,and the trial court granted the motion in its entirety on june.
after prevailing on the motion to compel,hoffman moved for a continuance of the trial date,then set for july,in order to complete discovery.he also moved for letters rogatory to compel witnesses in canada,ireland,and the united kingdom to testify and produce documents.the court ultimately executed the letters rogatory and continued the trial to november,but the court ordered hoffman to pay firestone attorneys fees and costs in connection with the discovery that was the basis for the continuance.
further proceedings on the letters rogatory quickly broke down,however,because hoffman refused to pay firestone estimated attorneys fees in advance,despite the fact that the trial court had expressly ordered him to do so.hoffman eventually took some sort of discovery from some of the foreign witnesses.firestone counsel did not participate,and the parties dispute whether the discovery complied with the terms of the letters rogatory and with applicable law.
iv.motions in limine and trial 
the parties appeared for trial on november,in department of the superior court before the honorable irving feffer,who had presided over the case from its inception.firestone announced ready,but hoffman orally moved for another continuance.judge feffer denied hoffman motion and transferred the case to department for trial before the honorable joseph kalin.
firestone had previously filed several motions in limine,all of which were still pending when the case was transferred.after the transfer,judge kalin heard oral argument on the motions and ruled on them.
firestone motion in limine number sought an order forbidding any testimony relating to firestone tax returns during trial.firestone counsel confirmed at the hearing that the motion related exclusively to firestone canadian tax returns in support of the motion,firestone argued that the returns were subject to the tax records privilege set forth in california civil code section he also argued that california courts have interpreted state taxation statutes as creating a statutory privilege against disclosing tax returns.previously,in his opposition to hoffman request for letters rogatory concerning the canadian tax returns,firestone had relied on a different source for the alleged privilege he argued that the returns were protected by business and professions code section,which makes it illegal for paid tax preparers to disclose information obtained in the course of their work.noting that this statutory prohibition applies only to federal or state income tax returns bus,firestone had argued that the canadian returns in question are federal as well.and in addition to the privilege claim,firestone argued that the canadian tax returns were irrelevant,because firestone tax returns are not in any way germane to hoffman refusal to make good on his debt.hoffman opposed the privilege claim and argued that the returns were relevant because if firestone did write off the note on his canadian taxes,then that would be circumstantial evidence that the purported novation,which called for just such a,was real.the trial court granted the motion,excluding the canadian tax returns on the grounds that they were privileged and not relevant.
firestone motion in limine number sought an order forbidding any testimony relating to firestone sale of his interest in fireworks entertainment,to canwest.in support of the motion,firestone argued that hoffman claims that firestone sold his interest in the promissory note,but,as firestone has stated in discovery,he has not done so.firestone consequently sought to prevent hoffman from bringing his speculative fabulations and unadulterated speculation before the jury,because they could be severely prejudicial.in opposition,hoffman argued that he wished to introduce testimony from gilhooly,a former fireworks executive,to the effect that can west paid off the note to firestone as part of can west acquisition of fireworks.the trial court granted the motion on the grounds that the evidence at issue was not relevant and would lead the jury to speculation.
firestone motion in limine number sought an order forbidding any testimony relating to the alleged novation and the irish tax shelters.in support of the motion,firestone argued that the object of the novation would have been an illegal contract,and that w here a novation is voidable or invalid,the original agreement is never actually extinguished,and is thus still enforceable.he further asserted that the alleged novating contract is illegal in numerous ways,including purported attempts to violate canadian family and tax law at the very least.and at the hearing on the motion,counsel for firestone orally represented to the court that the irish tax shelters had been disallowed by the irish tax authorities and were on appeal in a similar vein,he asserted that the irish tax deal is being considered by the irish court of appeals,because the tax authority denied it.in opposition,hoffman argued that the novation was not illegal and that even if it were,it would still serve to extinguish the parties obligations under the note.
the trial court evidently was persuaded by firestone argument that an illegal novation fails to extinguish the original contract and that the irish tax shelters and the canadian tax were of doubtful legality.for example,at one point the court asked hoffman,but can you have a novation on an illegal situation i mean,if in fact you ca write this off in canada,you ca get tax credit for it in ireland or the united kingdom,then you saying you have a valid novation later,the court stated that if hoffman were allowed to introduce evidence that the novation involved the irish tax shelters,then hoffman would have to argue the validity of these other agreements that would allow firestone to collect,because unless the agreements are valid,he never going to get the.the court concluded that it would not allow the introduction of evidence beyond the fact that these parties may have had some kind of an oral agreement,but i do want to try the english tax laws or the canadian tax laws to get there.the court ruled in its minute order that firestone motion in limine was granted as to the exclusion of evidence regarding the irish tax shelters.the motion is denied as to defendant arguing the issue of novation,and the court will make rulings during the trial as to issues of novation without trying the law and validity of canadian,irish and law.block capitals omitted.
firestone motion in limine number sought an order forbidding any testimony relating to can w est advance of plaintiff legal fees.in support of the motion,firestone argued that evidence that can west was paying firestone legal fees,with the understanding that firestone would reimburse can w est upon resolution of the suit,would be irrelevant and highly prejudicial.in opposition,hoffman argued that can west payment of firestone attorneys fees should prevent firestone from recovering attorneys fees from hoffman in this lawsuit.the trial court granted the motion on the ground that a ttorney fees are an issue for the court post trial.
firestone motion in limine number sought broadly to prohibit hoffman from commenting about or introducing any witnesses or any expert opinions that were not disclosed in discovery.the only undisclosed potential witness whom firestone originally identified was marian salas,an accountant,but firestone later supplemented his motion to identify hoffman wife as well.in opposition,hoffman argued that he did not intend to present any expert witnesses at all,that salas is his bookkeeper and would testify as a percipient witness concerning the treatment of the note in hoffman own financial records,and that any testimony of his wife should not be excluded either.the trial court denied the motion without prejudice.
firestone motion in limine number sought an order barring admission of any sworn statements or other such narratives or declarations that hoffman may offer from the witnesses identified in the british and irish letters rogatory.in support of the motion,firestone argued that hoffman had obtained the evidence at issue in violation of the trial court order that he first advance firestone attorneys fees,and that the evidence was otherwise obtained in violation of applicable law and consequently inadmissible.in opposition,hoffman argued that the evidence was properly obtained and admissible.the trial court granted the motion both because hoffman did not comply with the court order concerning advancing costs and fees for firestone counsel to appear at the foreign depositions,and because s aid discovery was performed unilaterally and additionally raises issues of proper procedure and compliance with foreign law.
with the scope of admissible evidence thus circumscribed,the matter proceeded to trial.the court rigorously enforced its in limine rulings,prohibiting virtually all evidence and argument concerning the irish tax shelters,firestone canadian taxes,and can west acquisition of fireworks.the following examples of the court evidentiary rulings at trial are by no means exhaustive.
although the court permitted hoffman to ask firestone whether anyone at any time ever reimbursed you for the funds you loaned,reflected in this note of,the court prohibited any questioning about firestone deposition testimony concerning hoffman theory that firestone was in fact reimbursed through can west acquisition of fireworks.the court based its ruling on the ground that the testimony deal s with other matters,and they not directly related to this case.
the court likewise permitted hoffman to testify in extremely general terms that,under the novation,firestone would receive instead of the originally due under the note.but the court prevented hoffman from testifying in more detail concerning the terms of the novation or the transactions involved.
again,on the basis of its narrow construction of the issues being tried,the court prohibited hoffman from introducing a memorandum that,according to hoffman,spelled out the terms of the novation.firestone counsel did not articulate a specific ground for objecting to the document,and the court only stated basis for excluding it was that it was a letter to firestone from hoffman,and it indicates other business deals.at the same time,the court permitted firestone to introduce a document in which hoffman told firestone that all my previous offers or acknowledgements are wi
