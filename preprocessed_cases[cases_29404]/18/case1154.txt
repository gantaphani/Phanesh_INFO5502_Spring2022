innovative communications company icc and belize telecom bt appeal from a district court judgment holding that the government of belize did not breach the parties agreements or the belize telecommunications limited btl articles of association when it removed six directors from the btl board and appointed new directors in their place.appellants also appeal the district court decision to vacate a contempt order entered against the government of belize prior to the district court final adjudication of the case.
the primary issue in the parties dispute is the proper interpretation of two of the btl articles that govern the appointment and removal of btl directors.prior to final judgment in the district court,the belize court of appeals,in parallel proceedings,ruled on the interpretation of one of these articles,article d ii.the district court judgment is,in part,contrary to the belize court interpretation.therefore,in reviewing the district court interpretation of the btl articles of association,this court must consider whether the district court should have deferred to the belizean judgment in regard to article d ii.for the reasons explained below,we affirm the district court judgment in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings.
the dispute in this case arises from a sale of stock in belize telecommunications limited and the subsequent removal and election of directors to the btl board.btl is a belizean limited liability company and the primary provider of telecommunications in belize.in the fall of,the government of belize government entered into negotiations with innovative communications company for the sale of btl shares.under the anticipated agreement,icc would gain a ownership interest in btl.icc negotiated a memorandum of understanding and share purchase agreement with the government,but created a subsidiary in belize,belize telecom,to close the share purchase agreement and take ownership of the shares.
the btl articles of association provide for an board.there are three classes of shares the special share,b shares,and c shares.two directors are appointed and removed by the holder of the special share.a majority of b shareholders can appoint and remove another two directors,known as b directors.pursuant to article d i,a majority of c shareholders apart from the holder of the special share or any associate of such holder can appoint the remaining four directors,known as c directors.however,under article d ii,the special shareholder can appoint and remove two of the four c directors so long as it the special shareholder is the holder of c ordinary shares amounting to or more of the issued share capital of the company.under article e,c directors appointed pursuant to article d i can be removed by a majority of c shareholders.article e provides each c director shall hold office subject only to article of table a as extended hereunder,but except as regards any director appointed pursuant to paragraph d ii above may at any time be removed from office by the holders of a majority of the c ordinary shares.thus,the c directors appointed under d ii are removable by the special shareholder and are specifically exempted from the article e removal provision 
pursuant to the parties agreement,icc and bt collectively appellants obtained class b shares,class c shares,and the special share.appellants thus owned of the b shares and approximately of the c shares.in accordance with these shareholdings,on april,appellants appointed three new c directors,two new b directors,and two special share directors.
after appellants were unable to obtain financing to complete their payment for the btl shares,the parties entered into a new set of agreements.these agreements the payment agreement,the forbearance agreement,and the share pledge agreement obligated appellants to make payments to the international bank of miami bank on unrelated debts owed to the bank by the government.in exchange for making these payments,the government would extend the deadline for appellants debt and give a credit against the amount owed for the payments made to the bank.in addition,appellants pledged part of their btl shares as security for the agreement.if appellants defaulted on a payment,the government could cure the default and receive the shares pledged as security in return.appellants retained their voting rights in the btl shares as long as there was no default.
appellants made the scheduled debt payments from may to september.however,appellants failed to make the november,payment.the government stepped in to cure the default,resulting in an assignment of the pledged shares to the government on november.appellants appointed an entirely new board of directors on november.on december,the government granted appellants a day extension to make the missed payment,giving them until february.unable to obtain financing,appellants failed to make the payment on february.two days later,the government seized the pledged btl shares,removed all four c directors who had been appointed by appellants and appointed four new c directors at that time,appellants owned the special share,a minority of b shares,and approximately of the c shares,amounting to approximately of the issued share capital the government owned the majority of b shares and approximately of the c shares.the remaining c shares were owned by minority shareholders.
in response to the government appointments,appellants filed suit in the district court for the southern district of florida,pursuant to the forum selection clause in the parties payment and share pledge agreements.the district court granted a preliminary injunction on march,reinstating appellants four c directors to office and requiring that any further removal and appointment of c directors be conducted in accordance with the btl articles.on march,the government and minority c shareholders,who together held a majority of the c shares,voted to replace the c directors appointed by appellants.appellants initiated contempt proceedings against the government,resulting in a contempt order entered against the government after an evidentiary hearing.the contempt order provided for attorneys fees and a per diem fine of that would accrue until the government complied with the preliminary injunction.after a bench trial in june,the district court held for the government,finding that the government had breached neither the share pledge agreement nor the florida uniform commercial code.the court also vacated the preliminary injunction and contempt order.
after the issuance of the preliminary injunction,the government filed an action in belize for a declaratory judgment on the proper interpretation of the btl articles of association.on april,chief justice abdulai conteh of the belize supreme heard the case.both parties participated in the proceedings.justice conteh issued a ruling on the interpretation of article d ii that was favorable to the government position.the government urged the district court to recognize the ruling at trial.holding that it was not obligated to defer to the belizean decision,the district court considered the opinion along with the other evidence presented at trial.after an appeal to the belize court of appeals resulted in a reversal of the supreme court decision,appellants filed a motion for reconsideration with the district court.the district court upheld its earlier decision not to defer to the belizean court decisions and declined to change its ruling.in the initial briefs,neither party challenged the district court refusal to defer.however,because this case involves deference to a foreign court and therefore raises international comity concerns,we sought supplemental briefing.we consider the propriety of these rulings below and find that the district court should have abstained from ruling on article d ii.

iii.discussion 
appellants argue that the district court erred in holding that the government did not breach the share pledge agreement and abused its discretion in vacating the preliminary injunction and the contempt order.specifically,appellants challenge the district court interpretation of article d ii of the btl articles of association and the district court decision to rule on the interpretation of article d i.appellants also argue that the district court abused its discretion in vacating the portion of the contempt order that awarded attorneys fees and costs to appellants.appellants asked for a permanent injunction in their initial brief,but after learning that the government had sold the remainder of its btl shares,appellants filed a reply brief conceding that injunctive relief was inappropriate and requesting damages instead we consider each of appellants contentions below.
interpretation of btl articles of association 
appellants argue that the government appointment of four c directors in february violated the share pledge agreement and the btl articles of association.appellants contend that they are entitled to damages for their wrongful loss of control of the board as a result of the government appointments.the parties do not dispute that at the time in question the government owned a majority of the b shares,entitling it to the two b directorships,and that appellants owned the special share,entitling them to the two special share directorships.thus,the only directorships contested before this court are the c directors appointed pursuant to articles d i and d ii.
article d i directors 
appellants assert that the interpretation of article d i was not properly before the district court,and the court therefore ruled on a question when it interpreted article d i.we find this argument to be entirely without merit.courts may consider issues antecedent to and ultimately dispositive of the case before them.bank of or.indep.ins.agents of,d quoting arcadia ohio power,d.the propriety of appellants appointment of the article d i directors was relevant to whether the government had improperly replaced those directors in february.the interpretation of article d i was therefore antecedent to and dispositive of part of the case before the district court,and the court did not err in ruling on it.because appellants do not challenge the merits of the district court ruling,we affirm the district court interpretation of article d i 
article d ii directors 
our affirmance of the district court interpretation of article d i means that the government is entitled to the two c directors appointed pursuant to that article.this leaves only the two c directors appointed pursuant to article d ii.the proper interpretation of article d ii was resolved by litigation in belize.the trial court the belize supreme court issued a decision on the interpretation of article d ii,which was later reversed by the belize court of appeals.this resolution of the status of the two article d ii c directors is described below.because the belize court resolved the status of these c directors in favor of appellants,as opposed to the district court contrary resolution in favor of the government,we must decide whether to defer to the belize court.
the district court refused to recognize either belizean decision,and the parties in their initial briefs did not contest the district court decision not to defer.because this court was concerned about the international comity implications of any decision we issued,we asked the parties to submit supplemental briefing on what deference we should give to the belize court of appeals decision,pursuant to the principles of international comity after reviewing the parties briefs,we conclude that international comity principles indicate that deference to the belizean decision is appropriate 
in general,federal courts have an obligation to exercise the jurisdiction conferred upon them.river water conservation dist.united states,d.however,as this court stated in turner entertainment degeto film gmbh,cir,abstention from the exercise of jurisdiction is appropriate in some private international disputes.we note that the posture of the instant case is very similar to turner,and we find its analysis helpful in reaching the correct result here in turner,this court considered whether to stay or dismiss domestic litigation after a german court issued a judgment on the merits in parallel proceedings.id.we identified three factors for determining whether abstention is appropriate international comity fairness to litigants and efficient use of scarce judicial resources.id.
international comity 
international comity encompasses the principle of respect for the acts of sovereign nations.id.as the supreme court has explained 
t he comity thus extended to other nations is the voluntary act of the nation by which it is offered,and is inadmissible when contrary to its policy,or prejudicial to its interests.but it contributes so largely to promote justice between individuals,and to produce a friendly intercourse between the sovereignties to which they belong,that courts of justice have continually acted upon it as part of the voluntary law of nations.
bank earle,pet.consistent with this explanation of the principles and limitations of international comity,this circuit identified the primary concerns in an international comity analysis whether the judgment was rendered via fraud whether the judgment was rendered by a competent court utilizing proceedings consistent with civilized jurisprudence and whether the foreign judgment is prejudicial,in the sense of violating american public policy because it is repugnant to fundamental principles of what is decent and just.turner,at internal citations omitted.we also identified the relative strengths of the foreign and domestic interests in the litigation as relevant to a consideration of international comity.id.at.
in this case,neither party has argued that the belizean judgments were rendered via fraud or that the belizean proceedings lacked any element of civilized jurisprudence.we see no evidence that the belizean judicial system affords litigants treatment that is inconsistent with american notions of due process.our analysis therefore turns to whether the belizean judgment violates american public policy 
the belize court of appeals ruled on the proper interpretation of article d ii,which reads t he holder of the special share shall so long as it is the holder of c ordinary shares amounting to or more of the issued share capital of the company be entitled to appoint two of the directors designated c directors and by like notice to remove.appellants argued that under a proper interpretation of the article,only a special shareholder with the required amount of shares could remove a director appointed pursuant to the article if the special shareholder ceased to own enough c shares,the article d ii c directors could not be removed.in contrast,the government argued that the so long as language meant that the article d ii c directors were entitled to their positions only so long as the special shareholder owned the requisite amount of shares.if the special shareholder c stockholdings dropped below of the total issued stock,the article d ii c directors would lose their positions.the belize court of appeals agreed with appellants,finding that the plain language of article d ii did not speak to the tenure of the article d ii directors,but only to their appointment and removal.construing the article consistent with its language,the court held that directors appointed under article d ii remain in office until they are removed by a special shareholder with the required amount of shares.
thus,under the belize court of appeals decision,the two c directors appointed under article d ii may only be removed by a special shareholder who also owns c shares amounting to or more of the issued share capital of the company.if the special shareholder does not have the requisite amount of shares,the two c directors appointed under article d ii remain in office until the special shareholder obtains the required amount of shares or the special share passes into the hands of a shareholder who owns the requisite amount of shares.this interpretation allows for the possibility of entrenched directors.this is so because directors appointed pursuant to article d ii can only be removed by a special shareholder owning c shares amounting to of the total issued stock.thus,if the special shareholder sells c shares resulting in ownership of less than the requisite amount and retains the special share,the article d ii directors can not be removed by any shareholder.the district court considered this result to be commercially unreasonable,which informed its decision to rule that the article d ii directors only stayed in office while the special shareholder owned the requisite amount of shares.
while we acknowledge the potential difficulty created by the possibility of entrenched directors,we can not say that the belize court of appeals decision violates american public policy.the court of appeals decision merely gives effect to the plain language of the btl articles of association.under belize law,which the parties agree governs this case,corporate articles of association are interpreted under contract law principles.under federal law,the plain meaning of a contract language governs its interpretation textron def.widnall,leicht bateman eichler,hill richards,cir.in this case,article d ii states when and how c directors can be appointed or removed pursuant to that article.article e,which discusses removal of directors generally,specifically exempts the article d ii directors.while the so long as language in article d ii is arguably ambiguous,we can not find that the belize court of appeals decision to construe that article terms strictly violates our public policy.
the final element in our consideration of international comity is the relative strengths of the domestic and foreign interests in the litigation.in this case it is clear that the interests of belize far outweigh the american interests.this case involves the interpretation of the articles of association of a belizean corporation pursuant to belize law.the consequences of the litigation affect belizean parties,and to the extent that the litigation might have any effect on the delivery of telecommunications services,the effect would be on the citizens of belize.none of the parties to the litigation is an american corporation the lawsuit connection to the united states results from the renegotiated payment arrangements involving,tangentially,the international bank of miami.therefore,the belizean interests easily outweigh the american interests in this case.accordingly,we find that all of the international comity factors clearly favor deference to the belizean decision.
fairness to litigants 
three considerations are relevant to the second factor,fairness to litigants in the international abstention analysis the order in which the suits were filed the more convenient forum and the possibility of prejudice to parties resulting from abstention.turner,at internal citations omitted.here,appellants filed suit in the district court in february and the government commenced the action in belize in march.therefore,the order in which the suits were filed tilts somewhat towards the american forum.however,as the turner court noted,the location of the suit is not dispositive of this factor.id.at.
the other two considerations favor the belizean forum.the above discussion indicating that the interests of belize far outweigh any american interests also leads to the conclusion that the belizean forum was more convenient than the american forum.with respect to the prejudice factor,this consideration focuses on whether the party opposing deference to the foreign forum will receive a fair and impartial trial in the foreign forum.turner,at.we readily conclude that the government received a fair and impartial trial and appeal in belize.indeed,we note that it was the government that initiated the litigation in belize.
thus,in weighing the three considerations under the fairness factor,we conclude that in the overall they weigh in favor of deference to the belizean decision.
efficient use of judicial resources 
finally,the considerations for the third factor,efficient use of judicial resources,are the inconvenience of the federal forum avoidance of piecemeal litigation whether the actions have common parties and issues and whether the alternative forum will issue a prompt decision.turner,at internal citations omitted.as noted above,of the two forums,belize was the more convenient.deference to the belizean court will minimize the chances of piecemeal litigation and inconsistent judgments the actions do have common parties and issues the government and appellants were parties to the belizean and american suits,and the proper interpretation of article d ii was at issue in both cases,although the american litigation included some additional claims as well.finally,the belizean court has already issued a prompt decision at the appellate level.overall,we conclude that considerations of efficient use of judicial resources favor deference to the belizean decision.
in sum,the international comity factor weighs heavily in favor of deference while the fairness and judicial efficiency factors also point in that direction.in deciding whether to defer to the belize court of appeals decision,the district court did not apply the turner factors.failure to apply the correct legal standard is an abuse of discretion.ass of disabled ams.neptune designs,cir.we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in failing to apply the turner analysis and refusing to defer to the belizean judgment.as our discussion here makes clear,abstention in regard to the interpretation of article d ii was warranted.therefore,we hold that,as the belize court of appeals determined,appellants were entitled to the two article d ii c directorships.appellants may be entitled to damages as a result of the wrongful loss of these two directorships we thus remand the case to the district court for further proceedings.because the briefs mentioned in passing that an appeal has been taken to the privy council,we leave for the district court to determine whether a hearing on damages should proceed or a stay should be granted pending the outcome of the appeal,a matter with respect to which we have received no briefing.
attorneys fees and costs related to the contempt order 
on april,the district court found the government in contempt of the preliminary injunction and issued a contempt order.the court imposed a per diem fine until the government complied with the order and awarded appellants attorneys fees and expenses for bringing the contempt motion.after a bench trial,at the conclusion of which the court held for the government,the district court vacated the preliminary injunction and contempt order.appellants contend that they are entitled to attorneys fees and costs connected to bringing the motion for contempt,and that the district court abused its discretion in vacating that portion of the contempt order
