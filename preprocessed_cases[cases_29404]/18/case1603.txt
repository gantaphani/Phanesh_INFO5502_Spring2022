the principal question in this case is whether consideration received for the sale of a business interest is subject to equitable forfeiture as a remedy for breach of fiduciary duty.we hold that when a partner in a business breached his fiduciary duty by fraudulently inducing another partner to buy out his interest,the consideration received by the breaching party for his interest in the business is subject to forfeiture as a remedy for the breach,in addition to other damages that result from the tortious conduct.here,the trial court ordered equitable forfeiture,but the court of appeals reversed,concluding that forfeiture was not an available remedy.we reverse the court of appeals judgment in part and remand the case to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
larry snodgrass and mark swinnea owned equal interests in two business entities,eri consulting engineers,and malmeba company,which they operated together for approximately ten years.eri is a small consulting company that manages asbestos abatement projects for contractors.it leased office space from malmeba,a partnership that owned the building.
snodgrass and eri purchased swinnea interest in eri in.eri paid swinnea to redeem swinnea eri stock,and snodgrass transferred his in malmeba to swinnea.eri agreed to employ swinnea for six years,and swinnea agreed not to compete with eri.at the same time,eri agreed to continue leasing from malmeba for six years 
unknown to snodgrass,the wives of swinnea and chris power,an eri employee,had created a new company called air quality associates a month before swinnea and snodgrass executed the buyout agreement.air quality associates was created to perform mold abatement,but later engaged in asbestos abatement as a contractor even though neither wife had experience in the asbestos abatement field.swinnea did not disclose the existence of air quality associates to snodgrass during the eri buyout negotiations.in fact,because swinnea believed snodgrass would run eri into the ground,swinnea told power to b e patient because we can buy this company back cents on the dollar.the trial court found that swinnea placement of his wife,dawn swinnea,and tracy power as principals of air quality associates,was deceptive,a sham and constituted fraud.
after the buyout,swinnea revenue production as an eri employee dropped.snodgrass testified that although swinnea supervisory responsibilities were to cease under their agreement,swinnea revenue production was to remain the same,if not increase.soon thereafter,snodgrass learned about swinnea relationship with air quality associates from one of eri asbestos contractors,merico,with whom air quality associates was competing.because of the personal relationship between the individuals involved with eri and air quality associates,merico told snodgrass that merico would no longer work with eri if eri were to accept bids from air quality associates on asbestos abatement projects.eri had been accepting bids from air quality associates without snodgrass knowing of swinnea or power relationship with air quality associates.
power and his wife later bought out the swinneas interest in air quality associates.eri subsequently worked with air quality associates,while its work with merico declined.meanwhile,swinnea and his wife formed a new company,brady environmental.the swinneas told snodgrass that brady environmental was going to clean homes and air ducts.however,brady environmental began performing asbestos abatement using the resilient floor covering institute method.evidence suggests that eri clients use of this method impacted eri business because rfci does not require a consultant like eri.although he was employed by eri,swinnea encouraged eri clients to use rfci instead,contrary to eri interest and policy.after the relationship between swinnea and eri deteriorated,snodgrass ultimately fired swinnea,releasing him from his obligations.swinnea obtained a license to perform asbestos consulting work the next day and began working for brady environmental as a consultant.snodgrass moved eri out of malmeba building and pursued this lawsuit with eri against swinnea,malmeba,and brady environmental.
after a bench trial,the trial court found for snodgrass and eri on their claims for statutory fraud in a real estate and stock transaction,common law fraud,breach of the clause in the contract,as well as for breach of fiduciary duty.it rendered judgment awarding eri and snodgrass combined damages of,and million in exemplary damages.the damages awarded by the trial court consisted of both equitable forfeiture and actual damages forfeiture of,a portion of the paid to swinnea by eri forfeiture of,the value of snodgrass interest in malmeba transferred to swinnea forfeiture of,constituting the sum of the lease payments from eri to malmeba after the buyout and as eri lost profits from its business relationship with merico.the trial court found that a civil conspiracy existed between swinnea and brady environmental,and held brady environmental jointly and severally liable with swinnea for the damages.
the court of appeals reversed and rendered judgment in favor of swinnea because it found the evidence legally insufficient to support the damage awards.in particular,the court of appeals found that eri failed to prove any actual damages.id.at.it found that the equitable remedy of forfeiture was unavailable because there was no fee paid to swinnea to be forfeited.id.it concluded further that eri failed to prove that swinnea obtained any gains subject to disgorgement.id.it determined that the lease payments were not recoverable because the evidence that the lease payments were intended as consideration for the buyout was incompetent parol evidence.id.at.finally,the court of appeals concluded that there was no basis for joint liability as to brady environmental because there was no evidence of a conspiracy between swinnea and brady environmental.id.at.
swinnea does not dispute his liability for fraud,breach of contract,or breach of fiduciary duty.rather,he disputes the damages the trial court awarded.he asserts that the forfeiture award is unsupported by law.he also asserts that the lost profits award is unsupported by legally sufficient evidence.brady environmental primarily disputes whether it can be jointly liable for any of the particular damages awarded by the trial court regardless of whether it later conspired in certain wrongful acts.
ii.equitable forfeiture 
the primary question we must address is whether forfeiture of contractual consideration is available as a remedy against swinnea.we have previously upheld equitable remedies for breach of fiduciary duty,burrow arce,upholding remedy of forfeiture upon attorney breach of fiduciary duty.in kinzbach tool,we stated the principle behind such remedies 
it is beside the point for defendant to say that plaintiff suffered no damages because it received full value for what it has paid and agreed to pay it would be a dangerous precedent for us to say that unless some affirmative loss can be shown,the person who has violated his fiduciary relationship with another may hold on to any secret gain or benefit he may have thereby acquired.it is the law that in such instances if the fiduciary takes any gift,gratuity,or benefit in violation of his duty,or acquires any interest adverse to his principal,without a full disclosure,it is a betrayal of his trust and a breach of confidence,and he must account to his principal for all he has received.
quoting united states carter.we later reiterated that a fiduciary may be punished for breaching his duty the main purpose of forfeiture is not to compensate an injured principal rather,the central purpose is to protect relationships of trust by discouraging agents disloyalty.burrow,at.
accordingly,courts may fashion equitable remedies such as profit disgorgement and fee forfeiture to remedy a breach of fiduciary duty.for instance,courts may disgorge all profits from a fiduciary when a fiduciary agent usurps an opportunity properly belonging to a principal,or competes with a principal.see,johnson brewer pritchard,tex stating the rule that courts may disgorge any profit where an agent diverted an opportunity from the principal or engaged in competition with the principal,and the agent or an entity controlled by the agent profited or benefitted in some way.similarly,even if a fiduciary does not obtain a benefit from a third party by violating his duty,a fiduciary may be required to forfeit the right to compensation for the fiduciary work.see,burrow,at a person who renders service to another in a relationship of trust may be denied compensation for his service if he breaches that trust.the difficulty comes in categorizing the damages awarded in this case.here,the damages awarded by the trial court were not profits from an outside opportunity or external competition,or compensation for work done by the fiduciary.rather,the trial court returned a significant part of the contractual consideration paid by eri and snodgrass to swinnea as part of the buyout agreement.the situation arises because here the contracting party,swinnea,was a fiduciary,such that we must consider whether under the circumstances an equitable remedy may cross the line from actual damages for breach of contract or fraud redressing specific harm to further,equitable return of contractual consideration.
the trial court found swinnea liable for fraudulent inducement as to the buyout agreement,and swinnea does not challenge this liability.the trial court also found that swinnea owed fiduciary duties both to eri and to snodgrass.it follows that swinnea actions in fraudulently inducing the buyout agreement contracts were willful breaches of his fiduciary duty.we hold that where willful actions constituting breach of fiduciary duty also amount to fraudulent inducement,the contractual consideration received by the fiduciary is recoverable in equity regardless of whether actual damages are proven,subject to certain limiting principles set out below.
the situation in this case is akin in many respects to the fee forfeiture scenario between a principal and agent,which we discussed at length in burrow,at.in that case,former clients sued their attorneys alleging breach of fiduciary duty arising from settlement negotiations in a previous lawsuit.id.at.we held that a client need not prove actual damages in order to obtain forfeiture of an attorney fee for the attorney breach of fiduciary duty to the client.id.at.we repeated that the central purpose of the remedy is to protect relationships of trust from an agent disloyalty or other misconduct.id.that policy applies equally to the relationship of trust at issue here and the duties swinnea owed to eri and snodgrass.we cited section of the restatement second of agency,which states that if conduct that is a breach of his duty of loyalty constitutes a wilful and deliberate breach of his contract of service,he is not entitled to compensation even for properly performed services for which no compensation is apportioned.id.at.we also stated 
t he possibility of forfeiture of compensation discourages an agent from taking personal advantage of his position of trust in every situation no matter the circumstances,whether the principal may be injured or not.the remedy of forfeiture removes any incentive for an agent to stray from his duty of loyalty based on the possibility that the principal will be unharmed or may have difficulty proving the existence or amount of damages.
id.at.the same principles apply to circumstances where a fiduciary takes advantage of his position of trust to induce a principal to enter into a contract.the remedy of forfeiture is necessary to prevent such abuses of trust,regardless of proof of actual damages.
although forfeiture of contractual consideration may have a punitive effect like forfeiture of compensation,id.at,it may nevertheless be necessary to protect fiduciary relationships.as we said in the context 
an attorney who has clearly and seriously breached his fiduciary duty to his client should not be insulated from fee forfeiture by his client ignorance of the matter.nor should an attorney who has deliberately engaged in professional misconduct be allowed to put his client to the choice of terminating the relationship and risking that the outcome of the litigation may be adversely affected,or continuing the relationship despite the misconduct.
id.at.the same reasoning applies here a fiduciary who breaches his duty should not be insulated from forfeiture if the party whom he fraudulently induced into contract is ignorant about the fraud,or fails to suffer harm.likewise,the innocent party should not be put into a difficult choice regarding termination of the contract upon discovering the breach of duty.
where equitable remedies exist,however,the remedy of forfeiture must fit the circumstances presented.id.at.in burrow,we listed several factors for consideration when fashioning a particular equitable forfeiture remedy in the context of relationships 
t he gravity and timing of the violation,its wilfulness,its effect on the value of the lawyer work for the client,any other threatened or actual harm to the client,and the adequacy of other remedies.these factors are to be considered in determining whether a violation is clear and serious,whether forfeiture of any fee should be required,and if so,what amount.the list is not exclusive.the several factors embrace broad considerations which must be weighed together and not mechanically applied.for example,the wilfulness factor requires consideration of the attorney culpability generally it does not simply limit forfeiture to situations in which the attorney breach of duty was intentional.the factor does not preclude forfeiture when a client can be fully compensated by damages.even though the main purpose of the remedy is not to compensate the client,if other remedies do not afford the client full compensation for his damages,forfeiture may be considered for that purpose.
id.at quoting restatement third of the law governing lawyers proposed final draft.we also cited comment c to section of the restatement second of trusts 
it is within the discretion of the court whether the trustee who has committed a breach of trust shall receive full compensation or whether his compensation shall be reduced or denied.in the exercise of the court discretion the following factors are considered whether the trustee acted in good faith or not whether the breach of trust was intentional or negligent or without fault whether the breach of trust related to the management of the whole trust or related only to a part of the trust property whether or not the breach of trust occasioned any loss and whether if there has been a loss it has been made good by the trustee whether the trustee services were of value to the trust.
id.at.several of these factors are also relevant in this context.the gravity and timing of the breach of duty,the level of intent or fault,whether the principal received any benefit from the fiduciary despite the breach,the centrality of the breach to the scope of the fiduciary relationship,and any threatened or actual harm to the principal are relevant.likewise,the adequacy of other any punitive damages also relevant.above all,the remedy must fit the circumstances and work to serve the ultimate goal of protecting relationships of trust.
there is no indication the trial court followed these principles in fashioning its award.accordingly,we direct the court of appeals to remand the case to the trial court for consideration of these factors upon resolution of the issues remaining for the court of appeals 
iii.evidence of contractual consideration 
we next consider whether the trial court properly admitted undisputed testimony offered to show that the lease agreement was intended to be consideration for the buyout agreement,and thus subject to potential forfeiture under our analysis above.the court of appeals concluded that such testimony was incompetent parol evidence.at.we disagree.
the general rule for an unambiguous contract is that evidence of prior or contemporaneous agreements is inadmissible as parol evidence.david sacks,haden,per curiam.however,an exception exists for consistent collateral agreements.as we stated over half a century ago in hubacek ennis state bank,the parol evidence rule does not preclude enforcement of prior or contemporaneous agreements which are collateral to an integrated agreement and which are not inconsistent with and do not vary or contradict the express or implied terms or obligations thereof,accord haden,at under the exception,parol evidence can be used to demonstrate a prior or contemporaneous agreement that is both collateral to and consistent with a binding agreement,and that does not vary or contradict the agreement express or implied terms or obligations.a collateral agreement between parties concerning the relationship of several distinct obligations between them falls within the exception.see,hubacek,at a and b in an integrated contract respectively promise to sell and to buy blackacre for.a contemporaneous oral agreement between them that the price shall be paid partly by discharge of a judgment which b has against a is operative.quoting with approval restatement first of contracts section cmt.d.here,if the parties agreed that the lease obligation was to be additional consideration for the buyout,then such an agreement was a consistent collateral agreement.nothing in such an agreement would contradict the written contracts.see id.at if the parol evidence rule precludes enforcement of the oral agreement,it is because the agreement varies or contradicts the terms or obligations of the written contracts.accordingly,swinnea testimony conceding this fact was properly admitted under this exception to the parol evidence rule.the fact that the lease agreement was consideration for the buyout agreement as a whole is thus established by legally sufficient evidence.
therefore,as contractual consideration,the lease payments from eri to malmeba are subject to forfeiture for swinnea breach of fiduciary duty.the trial court should consider whether to include them in fashioning an appropriate equitable forfeiture.
iv.lost profit damages 
we turn next to the question of actual damages.here,where the only actual damages that the trial court awarded were lost profit damages,the issue is whether eri provided legally sufficient evidence of those lost profits 
the rule concerning adequate evidence of lost profit damages is well established 
recovery for lost profits does not require that the loss be susceptible of exact calculation.however,the injured party must do more than show that they suffered some lost profits.the amount of the loss must be shown by competent evidence with reasonable certainty.what constitutes reasonably certain evidence of lost profits is a fact intensive determination.as a minimum,opinions or estimates of lost profits must be based on objective facts,figures,or data from which the amount of lost profits can be ascertained.although supporting documentation may affect the weight of the evidence,it is not necessary to produce in court the documents supporting the opinions or estimates.
holt atherton,heine,citations omitted.
the trial court awarded in lost profits constituting the loss of income from eri and snodgrass business relationship with merico.our legal sufficiency analysis thus reviews whether competent evidence establishes this amount with reasonable certainty.see id.
snodgrass testified that based on information from his accountant,eri net profit margin on revenue from merico was approximately as a and then sole owner of small,profitable was competent to testify as to eri estimated profit margin on the merico account.bowen robinson,dist,pet.denied competent evidence of lost profits relating to property can be proved by the testimony of an expert or the owner of the property.swinnea directs us to no evidence contradicting this testimony concerning eri profit margin eri also introduced dozens of detailed that from january through august months,eri averaged in revenue per month from merico.later,from september through may months,average revenue dropped to per month contrasting revenue from a time period immediately before the period at issue is an established method of proving revenue for a lost profit damages calculation.see.instruments,teletron energy,it is permissible to show the amount of business done by the plaintiff in a corresponding period of time not too remote,and the business during the time for which recovery is sought.quoting sw.battery owen.thus,eri method for proving its lost profits in a reasonably certain its lost revenue with comparative evidence from a recent time period,and establishing its profit margin on that revenue by competent testimony of its legally adequate under holt atherton.
however,eri method does not support a calculation yielding the amount of damages awarded by the trial court.even assuming a profit margin on the work from merico,snodgrass maximum profit margin estimate,the damages award would be only for the period at issue when eri profits from merico declined eri evidence thus fails to meet the minimum requirements for legal sufficiency that we set out in holt atherton regarding reasonable certainty as to the amount awarded by the trial.up to this point,the court of appeals reached the same conclusions that we have.see at reciting the same evidence and reaching the same conclusion regarding whether such evidence is legally sufficient to prove of lost profit damages with reasonable certainty.
still,while the evidence does not prove in lost profits,eri evidence is legally sufficient evidence to prove a lesser,ascertainable amount of lost profits with reasonable certainty.in this situation,such a discrepancy between two reasonably certain amounts will not defeat recovery by eri.see sw.battery at u ncertainty as to the fact of legal damages is fatal to recovery,but uncertainty as to the amount will not defeat recovery.instruments,at explaining that southwest battery and subsequent cases required reasonable certainty as to the amount of lost profit damages akin,gump,strauss,hauer feld,dev.research,remanding to the court of appeals where there was some evidence of damages,but not enough to support the full amount awarded by the trial court.eri proved lost profit damages its entitlement to recover them survives the trial court error in awarding too much.accordingly,the appropriate remedy is to remand the case to the court of appeals to consider the possibility for remittitur on lost profit damages.see,providing procedures for remittitur by courts of appeals.
swinnea argues that eri lost profits calculation is inadequate because it fails to apply certain credits or deduct certain expenses.first,swinnea asserts that because eri lost profits were on the merico account,which were in turn lost because of swinnea involvement with air quality associates,we must offset any amount that eri gained by doing business with air quality associates.that is,where the two accounts were mutually exclusive,loss from one must be offset by gain from the other.this argument is unpersuasive in part because the exclusivity arose out of merico ultimatum to eri about air quality associates us or them not because it was otherwise impossible for eri to pursue both business relationships simultaneously.the evidence shows that merico came to give eri its ultimatum because of swinnea.merico did not object to eri work with air quality competitor of merico in asbestos it discovered that swinnea and power were involved with air quality associates.nothing suggests that eri could not have profited from working both with air quality associates apart from swinnea and merico accordingly,because nothing indicates that eri could not work with both companies,any profits from eri work with air quality associates need not be offset against the lost profits from merico caused by swinnea position with air quality associates.
even assuming that swinnea is correct that profits from air quality associates must be credited against the lost profits figure,he can point to no evidence to support his assertion that eri profited from work with air quality associates as a substitute for merico.the plaintiff bears the burden of providing evidence supporting a single complete calculation of lost profits,which may often require certai
