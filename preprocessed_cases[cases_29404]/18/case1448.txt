petitioner joe machado challenges an order disqualifying his counsel,ed freidberg in a pending action.the motion was filed by a nonparty,michael atherton,freidberg former client and business partner.we conclude that although ordinarily a nonparty must file a separate action to prevent former counsel from continuing with an adverse representation,in this case atherton has standing to make the motion because he is alleged to be the alter ego and coconspirator of a party,and because this case was filed in order to evade a prior disqualification order in a related case in which atherton is a named party.we also conclude,contrary to some published authority,that because a disqualification order may be appealed immediately,it may not be reviewed on appeal from a final judgment.for this reason,the prior disqualification order in the related case is a final order for purposes of issue preclusion.because the disqualification motions in the two cases raised the same issues,review of the merits of the latter order is precluded.we deny the writ.
factual and procedural background 
this matter involves three superior court cases,which we refer to as the brocchini,woodward and calone cases.for convenience we group some parties together,as was done in some of the trial court papers and in the briefing in this court.
the freidberg law corporation,with freidberg as the principal,represented atherton in a partnership dispute.atherton brocchini,san joaquin county super.after we reversed an order disqualifying freidberg atherton brocchini may,no.nonpub.opn,the matter was settled such that atherton and freidberg became partners in a company holding realty acquired during the lawsuit freidberg interest satisfied the legal fees atherton owed freidberg.the partnership dissolved in after the last parcel was sold.
woodward,a joint venture controlled by atherton,sued machado,alleging breach of a realty contract.woodward machado,san joaquin county super.no.this case is not factually related to brocchini.machado retained freidberg,who filed a against woodward and atherton on march.the alleges in part that machado prior attorney,richard calone,cheated machado by advising him to agree to sale terms favorable to atherton in furtherance of the conspiracy,atherton agreed to pay richard calone a secret finder fee bribe,and memorialized such agreement in writing dated april,five months before the execution of the contract at issue dated september.calone is not a named,although several does are sued and alleged to be the agents,alter egos or coconspirators of all other.
atherton moved to disqualify freidberg,based on his representation of atherton in brocchini through and based on the ensuing land partnership which dissolved at the end of.atherton alleged freidberg was privy to a substantial amount of atherton private information including,but not limited to,business secrets,business practices,litigation preferences and personal tendencies.
in opposition machado declared it was critical that freidberg represent him.freidberg declared that after our reversal of the disqualification order in brocchini,he had performed few legal services for atherton,but he admitted the land partnership lasted until.
on july,judge saiers granted atherton motion to disqualify freidberg.on september,we denied machado petition for a writ to overturn that ruling.machado superior court,no.nonpub.order.machado did not appeal from the disqualification order.
on september,machado,represented by freidberg,sued calone for breach of fiduciary duty and related malpractice claims,based on the same alleged bribe from atherton to calone alleged in the woodward.machado calone san joaquin county super.no.
the complaint alleges the action is partially related to woodward.see cal.rules of court,rule counsel must give notice of related case.it alleges the malpractice claims could be litigated in calone without affecting woodward and the delay caused to the woodward case by consolidation would harm the marketability of machado property.
the complaint pleads doe defendants and alleges each defendant acted as the agent,employee,privy,conspirator and aider and abettor of each and every other defendant and are jointly and severally liable.the complaint alleges that unbeknownst to the machados while calone was negotiating the terms and conditions of the sale of the property on behalf of the machados,calone was secretly conspiring with the athertons and possibly other doe defendants to deceive and defraud the machados into selling the property to the athertons upon terms and conditions that are grossly unconscionable and outrageously onerous to the machados hereinafter the conspiracy.italics added.
thus,although atherton is not a named defendant,the complaint names him as calone coconspirator.
atherton moved to disqualify freidberg,alleging calone was a bald attempt to avoid the woodward disqualification order.he also raised the same reasons for disqualification as he had raised in woodward,namely,freidberg legal representation in brocchini,freidberg knowledge of atherton business practices,and the ensuing land partnership.
in opposition machado argued atherton lacked standing and argued the motion lacked merit,reiterating the points tendered in opposition to the woodward motion.
in reply atherton emphasized the view that calone was an attempt to circumvent this court prior disqualification order by filing a new,separate action that identifies freidberg former clients by name as unindicted conspirators.
at the hearing,machado counsel argued that although atherton suspects that my firm somehow may surreptitiously try to depose atherton which would be inconsistent with this court prior order in the other action,naming atherton as a conspirator was just an allegation.the trial court pierced this rhetoric well,pleadings would give rise to that suspicion.you saying that atherton conspired with calone concerning this land deal.machado counsel then argued the motion was premature and should be denied unless discovery probed into matters foreclosed by the trial court prior order he also argued atherton was at best,a percipient witness to things and is only connected to the case by a word or two in a complaint.
judge saiers granted the motion to disqualify freidberg and on march,machado filed an appeal.machado calone,no.on april,machado filed this writ petition.on june,we issued an alternative writ and stayed the proceedings pending resolution of this petition.
standard of review 
a trial court has discretion when ruling on a motion to disqualify counsel,but such discretion must be exercised according to the relevant law.when the trial court resolves factual disputes in ruling on the motion,such findings are reviewed for substantial evidence where the facts are undisputed,whether to order disqualification is a legal question.people ex rel.of corporations speedee oil change systems,cal th,d.
discussion 
we conclude atherton,although not a named defendant in calone,may move to disqualify machado attorney.
a leading treatise states a motion to disqualify conflicted counsel can not be brought where there is no pending litigation or the person seeking the disqualification whose interests are adversely affected is not a party to the litigation.in this situation,a separate lawsuit to enjoin the representation is generally appropriate.vapnek et,cal.practice guide professional responsibility the rutter group conflicts of interest,vapnek.
