this appeal from the united states court of federal claims requires us to construe section h of the internal revenue code,a provision that addresses deductions for employers who use property transfers other than money to compensate employees.that statute provides that the amount of the employer deduction is equal to the amount included in the employee gross income as a result of the transfer.the issue presented to us is whether the amount of the employer deduction is the value of the transferred property that is includible in the employee gross income as a matter of law or only the amount that is actually included in the employee gross income.the court of federal claims held that the amount of the employer deduction under section h is limited to the value of the transferred property that is actually included in the employee gross income,either on the employee return or as a result of a final determination between the employee and the irs that is binding on the employee.robinson united states.we disagree with that construction of the statute and therefore reverse.
appellants james robinson and barbara robinson are the sole shareholders of a group of related collectively known as morgan creek.the tax consequences of an flow through to the shareholders,so the shareholders recognize the corporation income and expenses on their individual tax returns.
from to,gary barber was the chief operating officer of morgan creek and was responsible for all of the company legal,financial,administrative,and other business affairs.in january,morgan creek entered into an employment agreement with barber that gave him a percent ownership interest in the company.under that contract,full ownership of the stock representing the percent ownership share would vest gradually over time according to a schedule that would lead to partial forfeiture of his ownership rights in the event of early termination of his employment.barber paid morgan creek million as consideration for the stock.
because the stock given to barber was part of his salary,and because it was conveyed with restrictions on barber ownership rights,the tax treatment of the transfer of the stock is governed by section a of the internal revenue code the code,a.section a provides that the transfer of property in connection with performance of services yields taxable income to the service provider in the amount of the excess of the fair market value of such property over the amount if any paid for such property.that amount is known as the bargain element of the property transfer.section a provides that the amount of the bargain element shall be included in the gross income of the service provider.id 
section a addresses,inter alia,transfers that include restrictions on vesting or on retransfer of the property.in the case of property that is conveyed subject to such restrictions,the bargain element is ordinarily treated as income to the employee in the year that the employee rights in the property are no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.a see also reg.a,a b.it is then taxed as ordinary income.section b of the code,however,gives the employee the opportunity within days of the transfer to elect to recognize the income in the year of receipt,notwithstanding the existence of restrictions on ownership.b.by making that election,the employee is subject to immediate tax liability for the amount of the compensation.however,electing that option enables the employee to treat as a capital gain any appreciation in the value of the property between the time of the transfer and the time that the restrictions lapse.see venture funding,comm r,wl,aff,cir unpublished table decision.
section h addresses the tax consequences to the employer of a property transfer made under section.with respect to value,section h states that the employer shall receive a deduction under section of the code in an amount equal to the amount included under subsection a,b,or d in the gross income of the person who performed the services.h.with respect to timing,section h states that the deduction shall be allowed for the taxable year of such person in which such amount is included in the gross income of the person who performed such services.id.
in,barber made a timely election under section b to include the bargain element of the morgan creek stock in his income for that tax year.however,because barber represented that the million that he paid for the stock reflected its fair market is,that the bargain element of the transfer was did not report any income from the transfer.the robinsons allege that barber was incorrect to assign a zero value to the bargain element,because the million payment represented only a small fraction of the stock true value,which they contend was approximately million at the time of the transfer.
under treasury department regulations,barber was required to file a copy of the section b election with his employer notifying the employer of his election.see reg.c,d.because barber was the chief operating officer of morgan creek,the person he notified was himself.subsequently,in june,morgan creek and barber terminated their relationship.as part of the separation agreement,morgan creek repurchased from barber the portion of the stock that had vested.the purchase price was million,based on an estimated company value of million.at that point,the robinsons discovered that barber had made a section b election in.as a result,morgan creek calculated the value of the property that had been transferred to barber and issued corrected forms reflecting that value.the modification increased barber wage income by more than million.morgan creek also paid the employer share of the employment taxes for that compensation.the irs has since audited barber tax return and issued an audit report proposing to increase his gross income by based on a stock value of.however,the agency and barber have not yet reached a final determination as to the amount,if any,by which his gross income will be increased for purposes of calculating his tax liability.
in the robinsons filed an administrative claim with the irs seeking a refund of a portion of their taxes.they contended that because barber made a section b election,morgan creek was entitled to deduct the bargain element of the stock transfer under section h.when their administrative claim proved unsuccessful,the robinsons filed suit in the court of federal claims seeking a refund of overpaid income taxes in the amount of plus interest.the robinsons later moved for partial summary judgment,arguing that morgan creek was entitled to a deduction under section h for the compensation paid to barber in and that the case should proceed to trial to determine the value of the stock.the government filed a for dismissal or,in the alternative,for summary judgment on the ground that the case was not ripe for adjudication.in its summary judgment motion,the government contended that the robinsons were not yet entitled to any deduction for the stock transferred to barber because he had not included any amount in gross income on his tax return for receipt of that stock and the irs had not made a final determination regarding the amount,if any,that barber must include on that return.
the court of federal claims granted the government summary judgment motion.the court ruled that the value of transferred property is included in an employee gross income,for purposes of the deduction allowed to the employer under section h,only when that amount is actually taken into account in determining the tax liability of the employee for that year.robinson.at.the court noted that its interpretation was consistent with the applicable treasury regulation,which defines the amount included in the employee gross income to mean the amount reported on an original or amended return or included in gross income as a result of an irs audit of the service provider,deductions for transfers of property,fed.reg,july,and with a decision of the tax court,which construed the term included in section h to mean the amount actually taken into account in determining the employee tax liability,venture funding,at.merely because the employee shou
