this is a dispute about a lease for new commercial property between tenant and plaintiff thrifty payless,doing business as rite aid rite aid,and landlord and defendant mariners mile gateway,llc mariners.the lease,negotiated in and,required a heavy investment of time and money by mariners to build a new,shopping center,while rite aid had few obligations until the lease began.the parties agreed that unless the lease began by june,either party would have the right to terminate for any reason.one of mariners many obligations was obtaining the necessary approvals for a traffic signal.
the years went by with various communications between the parties,including a request by mariners to increase rite aid rent and the prospect of a substitute tenant.eventually,relations deteriorated,leading to this lawsuit.despite the problems and this litigation,there was clear evidence that mariners continued to attempt to develop the property,including trying to obtain approvals for the traffic signal.such approval,however,was never granted,and the center was never built.on july,mariners exercised its right to terminate the lease for any reason by notifying rite aid.
during trial,which began a few months later,the court granted mariners motion for nonsuit.the court concluded that the lease gave mariners the absolute right to terminate,and therefore,rite aid could not recover as a matter of law.the court later granted mariners expert witness fees pursuant to a provision in the lease over rite aid objection.rite aid argued that mariners had failed to specially plead and prove its entitlement to and the amount of expert witness fees at trial.we reject rite aid arguments and find that granting the nonsuit was proper as a matter of law,and we uphold the court decision to permit mariners to recover its expert witness fees.the judgment and postjudgment order are affirmed.
in,mariners,the owner of a parcel of property at the corner of west pacific coast highway pch and dover drive in newport beach the site or the property,contacted rite aid regarding a potential new drug store at the site.david goldman,one of mariners partners,presented the project as upscale and the nicest thing that any of us had seen in newport beach.mariners development plan,as presented to the city of newport beach the city,included a number of variances and exemptions.the plan also called for widening pch and installing a traffic signal at the main entrance.
in february,the parties signed a letter of intent to negotiate a lease,which included such basic terms as proposed rent and the term of the lease.tracy verastegui,a real estate manager who signed on rite aid behalf,noted in the letter that the agreement was conditional upon mariners obtaining a traffic signal.
while such discussions were beginning with rite aid,mariners also began the process of reviewing the proposed development with the city.notes from a march meeting of the city design review committee noted a number of potential issues,and specifically suggested moving forward with an environmental impact report eir mariners submitted its application for entitlements to the city on july.some of the required technical studies were incomplete,although this was not unusual,because some of the work had to be commissioned by the city,not mariners 
rite aid and mariners continued negotiations and went through several drafts before signing a lease on august.the basic provisions included a term of years with several options to extend,and annual rent of for the first years and for the second half of the lease.the building mariners agreed to construct for the rite aid store was approximately square feet.
the lease also included a number of termination provisions of import to this case.article of the lease gave mariners an early termination right.this lease is expressly contingent upon landlord satisfying or waiving the following contingencies within the time period set forth below.if landlord,exercising commercially reasonable efforts and due diligence,is unable to satisfy such contingencies to landlord satisfaction,as determined in landlord sole discretion by june,then landlord shall have the right to terminate this lease upon written notice to tenant.the contingencies listed were obtaining financing and all necessary entitlements,permits,approvals and licenses from applicable governmental authorities for the development of the center and the performance of landlord work.
article of the lease addressed the commencement of the lease term,and stated that the lease would begin days after the property was delivered by mariners,or when rite aid opened for business,whichever came first.article also stated if,for any reason other than delays caused by tenant the lease term has not commenced by june,tenant and landlord shall each have the right to terminate this lease by giving written notice to the other provided,however,that if tenant gives such notice to landlord and landlord delivers the leased premises to tenant and satisfies the conditions of the lease term commencement within ninety days after the date of the termination notice,then such termination notice shall be conclusively deemed to be null and void and not of force and effect.this provision was different from the initial draft proposed by rite aid,which gave only rite aid the right to terminate in the event the lease could not begin by the designated date.
article c of the lease required mariners to diligently prosecute to completion the construction of the center so that the completion date will occur no later than june,and article a stated that all improvements would comply with all laws including environmental,ordinances,rules,regulations and orders of any duly constituted authority article a also included the installation of the traffic signal as part of the landlord required work.
article b stated failure by landlord to complete construction by june,shall be a default by landlord and in the event of such default,tenant shall have,the right to terminate this lease by giving landlord at least thirty days written notice of such termination during which time landlord shall have the right to cure its default,and if landlord does so during such time period,then notice of termination shall be deemed rescinded.
several other provisions of the lease are also of import here.article limited rite aid damages in the event of a breach by mariners,stating that in the event of mariners default on the performance of any covenant or agreement herein tenant shall be entitled to sue landlord for damages but not consequential or punitive damages or loss of profits sustained by tenant as a direct result of landlord breach.article of the lease states the prevailing party is entitled to reasonable expenses including attorney fees,court costs,witness and expert fees.
after the lease was signed,in october,mariners consultant released a draft of the mnd.they also continued to take steps to work with caltrans on traffic issues.in january,the city planning commission unanimously approved the project.doug beiswenger,a mariners partner,informed rite aid of the approval shortly thereafter,with the caveat that caltrans was the variable in the construction timeline.
the city issued a notice of final approval in early february.the approval included conditions that had to be met before the city final certification once construction was complete.several of these reflected an expectation that caltrans would approve the application for a traffic signal.
around,mariners proposed what it refers to as a lease amendment and what rite aid refers to as a campaign of deception and threats to increase the rent.goldman and verastegui apparently had a number of conversations in which goldman informed verastegui that construction costs had increased.goldman also referred to a termination right if the lease did not begin by june.rite aid was neither interested in terminating the lease or in paying more rent at that time.from rite aid perspective,mariners misrepresented that it could not currently complete construction by june,including alter ing construction schedules.
on june,goldman sent a letter to rite aid stating that construction had been delayed due to the caltrans review.he proposed a lease amendment altering the final outside completion date from june,to december.this amendment was not executed.there was further correspondence in july,with rite aid representative terry halbur requesting a status update,and a reply from beiswenger that the caltrans approval was an outstanding issue.halbur met with beiswenger in august to discuss the matter further.rite aid,for its part,points out that during this period,and as late as february,mariners continued to represent to other potential tenants that the property would be open in the spring of.
on october,mariners counsel sent a letter to rite aid stating despite exercising commercially reasonable efforts and due diligence,landlord has not been able to obtain all such necessary entitlements,permits,approvals and licenses for the development of the center.the letter further stated that mariners was considering its options,referencing the article termination provision,and asking rite aid to contact mariners to discuss further options.
on november,rite aid filed,but apparently did not serve,the instant action.the initial complaint alleged three separate claims for breach of contract,and causes of action for declaratory relief,specific performance,and injunctive relief.
on november,goldman and verastegui had another conversation regarding mariners construction costs.verastegui stated that rite aid would not pay rent in excess of the amount stated in the original lease.goldman informed her the alternative might be termination,and he asked rite aid to reconsider its position.as of december,correspondence regarding construction continued to be exchanged between the parties.
rite aid filed a first amended complaint the complaint on december,and the complaint was,apparently,served on mariners around that time.the complaint included two claims for breach of contract,and causes of action for declaratory relief,promissory estoppel,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and fraud 
starting in early december,mariners began discussing leases with potential replacement tenants.in january,mariners signed a letter of intent with walgreens indicating an annual fixed rent of for the first years,plus a percentage of sales.this amount was more than rite aid rent under its lease,plus percentage sales.by contrast,in a february,to another potential tenant,goldman continues to state that june,as an expected turnover date.
the draft lease between mariners and walgreens contemplated a substantial completion date of november,and an outside completion date of june.the draft lease also included,as an express condition,that a traffic signal be installed adjacent to the primary entrance.in the absence of the traffic signal,walgreens would be entitled to cancel the lease without liability.
on march,mariners filed a later dismissed and answer to rite aid complaint on march,mariners sent rite aid a letter purporting to terminate the lease under article.in response,rite aid filed a motion for preliminary injunction,seeking to enjoin mariners from leasing the property to anyone else and from developing the property in any manner not consistent with the lease.on may,the court granted the injunction.once walgreens,who had already signed a lease,learned of the court ruling,it notified mariners that they no longer had any interest in the property and revoked its offer to lease.
meanwhile,in november and march,mariners filed additional submittals with caltrans regarding the street improvements.caltrans responded in april,stating the application could not be approved as submitted.additional information was requested about some matters,and with respect to the traffic light,caltrans denied mariners request and suggested some possible alternatives.mariners filed an additional submittal in july,including a report which stated that the lack of a traffic signal would result in issues with adjacent signals.in august,caltrans once again denied mariners application,again disagreeing with mariners arguments about the necessity of a traffic light.
mariners did not continue its submissions to caltrans thereafter,apparently believing that the result was unlikely to change.further,based on the preliminary injunction,mariners decided it could not proceed with the project,which required a traffic light under article a,by developing a new plan that did not include a traffic light.mariners then waited until june,and sent a letter terminating the lease under article.to date,nothing has been built on the property.
the case proceeded to trial in august.mariners moved for nonsuit in september,arguing,as pertinent to this appeal,that under article,either party had the right to terminate if the lease had not commenced by june.mariners motion did not rely on article,which gave it a right to terminate if the financing and entitlement contingencies were not satisfied by june.
rite aid opposed,arguing that the jury must decide if mariners breached the lease in before the court could determine if a right to terminate on june,existed.rite aid argued that the attempted termination in march under article was an anticipatory breach,which deprived mariners of the right to rely on article to terminate later.further,rite aid claimed mariners lost the right to terminate by prematurely ceasing efforts to construct the rite aid store in violation of the lease and that mariners proposed interpretation of article rendered the contract absurd.finally,rite aid argued that it had the right to defer the commencement date under article.
the court granted mariners motion for nonsuit,finding that mariners validly exercised its right to terminate the lease pursuant to article thereof by sending written notice of termination to rite aid on july,thereby ending any and all further obligations owed by the parties under the lease judgment was entered on october.the court subsequently denied rite aid motion for new trial.
after the judgment was entered,rite aid filed a motion to tax costs,including in expert witness fees for experts that had not been ordered by the trial court.specifically,rite aid argued such costs had not been specially pled and proved at trial.at the hearing on the motion,the trial court granted mariners,including the disputed expert witness fees.pursuant to stipulation,rite aid agreed not to challenge the remainder of the award,but reserved the right to appeal the in expert witness fees.

we begin our review with some basic principles of contract interpretation.we must interpret a contract so as to give effect to the mutual intent of the parties at the time the contract was formed.the language of a contract is to govern its interpretation,if the language is clear and explicit,and does not involve an absurdity.courts must also endeavor to give effect to every part of a contract,if reasonably practicable,each clause helping to interpret the other s.
article was a freely negotiated provision between sophisticated parties.its first clause,the part relevant here,states if,for any reason other than delays caused by tenant the lease term has not commenced by june,tenant and landlord shall each have the right to terminate this lease by giving written notice to the other the trial court concluded that article meant what it said and therefore mariners was entitled to terminate the lease pursuant to article terms.
rite aid now argues that the drafts of the lease exchanged between the parties require a different interpretation,specifically,that the parties intended that only rite aid be given a right to terminate if mariners failed to complete construction by june.such an interpretation,however,would be legally untenable.under the parol evidence rule,when a contract is integrated as this one is under article,extrinsic evidence can not be used to vary or contradict the instrument express terms.code civ,cerritos valley bank stirling th.this rule is based on sound logic and policy when a contract is reduced to writing,it is presumed to contain all of the material terms,and it can not reasonably be presumed that the parties would intend two contradictory terms to be part of the same agreement.gerdlund electronic dispensers international d,gerdlund.
further,even if a contract is not integrated,extrinsic evidence can not be used to contradict the contract terms unless the language is reasonably susceptible to the proposed interpretation.pacific gas thomas drayage.cal d.indeed,unless the language is reasonably susceptible to the proposed meaning,extrinsic evidence can not even be considered to explain or otherwise shed light upon the parties intent.gerdlund,supra,d at.
here,rite aid proposed interpretation is that only rite aid had the right to terminate under article.the express language of article tenant and landlord shall each have the right to terminate is not reasonably susceptible to an interpretation which limits the termination right to one party.parol evidence can not be used to to flatly contradict the express terms of the agreement.citation.thus if the contract calls for the plaintiff to deliver to defendant pencils by july,parol evidence is not admissible to show that when the parties said pencils they really meant car batteries or that when they said july,they really meant may.consolidated world investments,lido preferred th.article is simply not reasonably susceptible to such an interpretation,and it must be rejected.
we also reject rite aid arguments that the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing prevents giving article a plain language reading.the implied covenant can not contradict the express terms of a contract.carma developers cal,marathon development california,cal th,carma we are aware of no reported case in which a court has held the covenant of good faith may be read to prohibit a party from doing that which is expressly permitted by an agreement.similarly,the implied covenant can not be used to limit or restrict an express grant of discretion to one of the contracting parties new hampshire ins.ridout roofing th.when the contract is unambiguous,n o obligation can be implied which would result in the obliteration of a right expressly given under a written contract.gerdlund,supra,d at.
rite aid also contends that reading article literally would mean this situation is one of the relatively rare instances when reading the provision literally would,contrary to the parties clear intention,result in an unenforceable,illusory agreement.third story music,waits th,third story music.by giving article its plain language meaning,rite aid argues,mariners unqualified obligation to construct the shopping center was rendered illusory.
we disagree.third story music involved a simple promise on one party part to sell a product in exchange for a fixed sum of money and the right to receive a percentage of the amount earned by a third party assignee from its exploitation of the music.the contract provided that the assignee could at its election refrain from marketing and selling the music.the court noted that the assignee promise was illusory,but supported by the fixed minimum as consideration.thus,third story music could not maintain a cause of action for breach of the implied covenant based on the assignee alleged failure to exercise its discretion in good faith.third story music,supra,th at.
this case,obviously,is quite different.promises of future performance on each side were exchanged,although by the nature of the contract,rite aid would have few or no obligations to perform for years,while mariners was required to invest large sums of money very quickly to develop the property.as part of the lease,the parties negotiated provisions to cover various contingencies,including the three separate termination clauses,one of which was mutual article and two of which were article on mariners part,and article b on rite aid part.unlike the contract in third story music,mariners performance,as expressly stated in the lease,was contingent on a variety of government approvals,without which it could not proceed.further,article c specifically required mariners to diligently prosecute construction to completion,and even rite aid own evidence demonstrates that mariners took steps to gain the necessary approvals to complete the shopping center to discharge its obligations under article.
thus,this is not one the relatively rare instances third story music,supra,th at,where reading a contract provision literally would render it illusory there were explicit promises included in the lease,and the termination provisions were part of freely negotiated contingencies.indeed,the court in third story music noted the courts can not make better agreements for parties than they themselves have been satisfied to enter into or rewrite the contracts because they operate harshly or inequitably.it is not enough to say that without the proposed implied covenant,the contract would be improvident or unwise or would operate unjustly.parties have the right to make such agreements.the law refuses to read into contracts anything by way of implication except upon grounds of obvious necessity.citation.third story music was free to accept or reject the bargain offered and can not look to the courts to amend the terms that prove unsatisfactory.third story music,supra,th at.
further,courts have held that a contract with a mutual termination provision is not illusory when conditioned on notice.roehm distrib.burgermeister brewing d,roehm.in roehm,the parties had an oral agreement under which plaintiff would distribute defendant product,which was later confirmed by two letters.id.at.the letters confirmed that either party could terminate the agreement at any time,by written notice to that effect.id.at.the defendant terminated the contract by written notice,and the plaintiff sued.the defendant was granted summary judgment,and plaintiff,among other things,claimed that the contract was illusory,arguing that the right to terminate at any time rendered the contract illusory.id.at.
the court rejected this contention,noting that until notice of termination was provided,there was mutuality of obligation.each had the right to terminate on written notice.mutuality was present in all parts of the contract nothing was unilateral.such a contract is binding on the parties until written notice of termination has been given.both had not only the right but the mutual duty to give written notice to the other if they desired to terminate the relation.citations.roehm,supra,d 
at.the same principle holds true in this case.unlike the cases in which contracts have been declared illusory,in this case,each party had the right to terminate,and the rest of the lease included mutual obligations as well.the lease was binding until it was terminated according to its terms.thus,we find the lease was not illusory.it included the termination clauses,which were freely negotiated,to effectuate the mutual intent of the parties.
rite aid next argues that mariners lost the right to terminate under article when it repudiated the lease and stopped construction of a rite aid store on march.rite aid omits,of course,the fact that it had filed the instant lawsuit against mariners in november,at which time any reasonable party would call into question the viability of a continuing business relationship.nonetheless,even if mariners actions constitued an attempted repudiation,the evidence demonstrated that mariners continued to spend time and money to gain the necessary app
