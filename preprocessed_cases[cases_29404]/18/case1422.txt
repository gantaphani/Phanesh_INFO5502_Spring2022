introduction 
ron wilson,a disabled person,brought this lawsuit against frances murillo,doing business as murillo restaurant murillo,alleging he was refused service and subjected to ridicule and harassment at the restaurant in retaliation for his efforts to ensure that the restaurant was accessible for use by the disabled under the americans with disabilities act of et ada.in granting summary judgment for murillo,the trial court found wilson had failed to establish a prima facie case of unlawful retaliation because the retaliatory action allegedly taken by murillo against wilson was too trivial to be judicially cognizable.in a postjudgment order,the trial court awarded murillo her attorney fees under civil code section we reverse,concluding that the record presents material issues of disputed fact which could support a finding that murillo conduct was unlawful under the governing standards of the ada.therefore,the summary judgment entered in her favor should have been denied.
ii.facts and procedural history 
in reviewing a grant of summary judgment,the law requires that the facts be reviewed in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party,in this case wilson.therefore,we must assume as true wilson version of all disputed facts presented in opposition to murillo motion.saelzler advanced group cal th,d,saelzler birschtein new united motor manufacturing,th,d birschtein levy skywalker sound th,fn,d.with this standard in mind,the declarations,deposition transcripts,footage from a security camera,and other evidence disclose the following facts,viewed in a light most favorably to wilson.
murillo owns and operates a restaurant,murillo mexican food,located in vacaville.wilson is a disabled person who primarily relies on a wheelchair for mobility.he is as an activist for disabled persons seeking to make places of public accommodations abide by state and federal access codes wilson visited the restaurant over several years,but he was not a regular customer.following each of his visits,he sent handwritten letters to murillo identifying accessibility problems that he encountered.murillo promptly responded to each of the letters.
murillo ultimately spent in excess of in bringing the restaurant into compliance with applicable law.among other modifications,murillo installed entrance ramps with detectable warning surfaces,braille accessibility signage,a lowered bar section,accessible tables,automatic sensors for the faucets and paper towel dispensers in the men and women restrooms,and twice and concrete in the parking lot.she also installed three doors at all public entrances to the restaurant.it is undisputed that at all pertinent times,the restaurant was fully compliant with all federal and state disability access regulations.
on march,wilson went to the restaurant to have lunch with a friend who also uses a wheelchair.they arrived at the restaurant and instead of immediately asking for a table,stopped at the bar for a drink.they rolled up to the lower accessible section of the bar and when the bartender came,they ordered a soda and a beer and asked to see a menu.
the bartender brought their drinks,a basket of chips,salsa,and two menus.a few minutes later murillo walked up to them.murillo admitted in her deposition that she was angry when she saw wilson at her restaurant.she testified that she went to them and said you guys are not welcome here,and you know that and they asked me why,and i said,you only here to harass me.you not here for the food.in wilson declaration he recalls,she asked us to leave,and we told her we would after we got our lunch and had finished eating it.then she walked around to the back of the bar and as she came up to us again from the other side of the bar,she was holding up a sign which said,we reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.
another few minutes passed,and wilson and his companion stayed at the bar drinking their drinks and eating chips.murillo came up to them again and asked them to leave.they refused.eventually,the bartender removed their chips and salsa from the bar and tried to remove wilson beer when asked why she was removing the chips and drinks,the bartender told wilson that the owner,murillo,had told her not to serve them.wilson told her he was going to finish his drink,took hold of the bottle,poured the contents into his glass and gave her the empty bottle.
murillo said she was calling the police to have them removed from the restaurant.in murillo deposition testimony she admitted she called the police because they refused to leave and i just did want them in the premises period.i was upset.
at some point,wilson and his companion were confronted by a man they believed to be an employee of the restaurant,who began taking photographs of them as they sat at the bar.while pointing his camera in their faces,this individual sarcastically told wilson to smile for the camera.
the police eventually came into the restaurant.in his deposition testimony,one of the responding police officers reported that when he arrived at the restaurant murillo told him that she wanted two men in wheelchairs removed from her restaurant.murillo explained to the officer that they came in on a regular basis,took measurements they were sending letters,demanding money and changes to the restaurant.the officers talked to murillo and explained that there was no lawful reason they could make the two men leave.wilson waited to see if the police officers were going to talk to them.they waited until the police left,and then they,too,left the restaurant.
when wilson and his companion got to the parking lot they saw the police officers standing outside talking to each other.after obtaining the officers names,they rolled over to their cars and were preparing to leave when the man who had taken the photographs inside the restaurant came out with a waitress.the waitress started taking photographs and taunting them just as the man had done inside the restaurant.at the same time,the man stood by the front door making an offensive gesture with his middle finger.wilson and his companion eventually left the restaurant parking lot in separate vehicles.
on august,wilson filed a complaint against murillo seeking injunctive relief and damages for retaliation for past activities in promoting the civil rights of persons with disabilities to have architectural barriers removed in places of public accommodation wilson alleged the following retaliatory acts r efusing to serve plaintiff ron wilson at the bar,removing his food,demanding that plaintiff ron wilson leave the restaurant,calling law enforcement to remove plaintiff from the premises at murillo restaurant and the taking of photographs of plaintiff ron wilson for no legitimate purpose capitalization in original.
the complaint alleged a violation of the unruh civil rights act unruh act,et,which prohibits discrimination based on disability with respect to accommodations,advantages,facilities,privileges,or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever,and which incorporates the ada,making ada violations also violations of the unruh act,subds.b,f.the complaint also alleged a violation of california disabled persons act disabled persons act,et the disabled persons act guarantees to persons with disabilities the same right as the general public to the full and free use of the streets,highways,sidewalks,walkways,public buildings,medical facilities,public facilities,and other public places,subd.a.like the unruh act,the disabled persons act incorporates the ada,subd.c.
murillo filed a motion for summary judgment.the gist of murillo motion was that the retaliatory acts alleged by wilson were too trivial to constitute the adverse retaliatory action required to state a prima facie case of retaliation disputing the version of the incident presented by wilson in opposition to the motion for summary judgment,murillo argued that she did have words with wilson,but she did not refuse to serve wilson and she did not eject him.after murillo brief conversation with wilson,wilson remained at the bar for approximately minutes,finished his beer and chips,and then left the r estaurant on his own free will the evidence irrefutably demonstrates that wilson did not suffer any actionable retaliation,and further did not suffer a distinct and palpable injury.underscoring omitted.
the trial court granted summary judgment,finding in a written opinion that i f defendant or any of her employees had forcibly ejected wilson from the premises,made physical threats against him,or called him disparaging names in front of the other patrons,such conduct could be actionable.here,placing this event in context,all that is alleged is a mildly unpleasant incident,not rising to the level of necessary conduct for recovery under either statute.appeal no.followed.
on the basis of the trial court grant of summary judgment in murillo favor,she then filed a motion for attorney fees pursuant to civil code section,which was granted by the trial court.as the prevailing party,murillo was awarded in attorney fees and in costs.appeal no.followed.both appeals were consolidated for purposes of briefing and argument by order of this court on november.
iii.discussion 
standard of review 
a trial court properly grants a motion for summary judgment only if no issues of triable fact appear and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.the moving party bears the burden of showing the court that the plaintiff has not established,and can not reasonably expect to establish,a prima facie case saelzler,supra,cal th at,d.the trial court does not weigh the evidence and inferences,but instead merely determines whether a reasonable trier of fact could find in favor of the party opposing the motion,and must deny the motion when there is some evidence that,if believed,would support judgment in favor of the nonmoving party.alexander codemasters group limited th,d.on appeal from the granting of a motion for summary judgment,we examine the record de novo,liberally construing the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolving doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.wiener southcoast childcare centers,cal th,d.
wilson theories of liability 
in his complaint against murillo,wilson made allegations of retaliation for his actions in enforcing the accessibility provisions of the ada in violation of california unruh act and its disabled persons act.while wilson did not make an explicit claim of retaliation under the ada,as we have previously noted,violations under the ada are expressly incorporated into the unruh act and the disabled persons act,subd.f,subd.c,subd.d.
the ada makes it unlawful to discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this act or because such individual made a charge,testified,assisted,or participated in any manner in an investigation,proceeding,or hearing under this act.a section a.in a separate subdivision,the ada further renders it unlawful to coerce,intimidate,threaten,or interfere with any individual in the exercise or enjoyment of,or on account of his or her having exercised or enjoyed any right granted or protected by this chapter.b section b.in his complaint,wilson asserted that murillo violated both of these subsections on march,by refusing to serve him at the bar,removing his food,demanding that he leave the restaurant,calling law enforcement to remove him from the premises and the taking of photographs of him for no legitimate purchase in retaliation for his activities in enforcing the ada.
there are important distinctions between the rights protected under subdivision a and subdivision b of section.see generally weber,workplace harassment claims under the americans with disabilities act a new interpretation stan.policy.a requisite component for establishing liability under section a is to establish discrimination for opposing an act or practice made unlawful by the ada.by contrast,section b does not mention discrimination nor does it require that the plaintiff has opposed an act or practice that violates the ada.instead,section b directly forbids coercion,intimidation,threats and interference with the exercise of protected rights under the ada.
because section a the provision and section b the provision raise two distinct theories of liability,we proceed to discuss them independently.see lopez superior court th,d ramsey city of lake elsinore d.a defendant moving for summary judgment must disprove all possible causes of action or theories of recovery set out in a plaintiff complaint before it is entitled to summary judgment.
liability for retaliatory adverse action in a public accommodation case 
as noted,in section a,the provision,the ada specifically prohibits discrimination because an individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by the ada.to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ada,wilson must prove that a he was engaged in protected activity b the alleged retaliator knew that he was involved in the protected activity c an adverse decision or course of action was taken against him and d a causal connection exists between the protected activity and the adverse action.weixel board of educ.of city of new york cir,shotz city of plantation,cir,shotz.although wilson burden in proving a prima facie case is light,summary judgment against him is appropriate if he fails to satisfy any one of the elements of a prima facie case.zappa stores,d.
once the plaintiff proves a prima facie case,courts apply the same analysis to retaliation claims as is employed in other discrimination cases.see mcdonnell douglas green,d mcdonnell douglas accord,kiel select artificials,cir,observing that the framework of mcdonnell douglas must be used to determine whether summary judgment is appropriate.after a prima facie case of retaliation is established,the burden is on defendant to establish a legitimate reason for the adverse action,which plaintiff may rebut by producing credible evidence of pretext.mcdonnell douglas,supra,at.
the crucial issue that is determinative of murillo motion for summary judgment motion is whether wilson presented sufficient evidence to satisfy the adverse action requirement for establishing a prima facie case of retaliation.murillo asserted,and the trial court agreed,that the retaliatory conduct upon which wilson based his complaint was,as a matter of law,not sufficiently adverse to state a prima facie case of retaliation.
the vast majority of courts which have examined the question of what conduct constitutes an adverse action have done so in the employment context.as the court recognized in bass board of county com rs cir,in order for conduct to constitute an adverse employment action some threshold level of substantiality must be met.id.at.otherwise,every minor and even trivial employment action that an irritable,employee did not like would form the basis of a discrimination suit.citation.smart ball state university cir,davis town of lake park,cir,davis.
instead,in the employment context,the adverse employment action threshold is met when the employer action impact s the terms,conditions,or privileges of the plaintiff job in a real and demonstrable way.davis,supra,at.in other words,a plaintiff must show that a reasonable person in the circumstances would have viewed it as a serious and material change in the terms,conditions,or privileges of employment.shotz,supra,at.examples include discharge,demotions,refusal to hire,nonrenewal of contracts,and failure to promote.blatter cir.
at the other extreme,courts have found no adverse employment action where the conduct had no effect on the plaintiff employment status.see,davis,supra,at negative job performance is not an adverse employment action where there was no economic injury flannery trans world airlines,cir,shunning is not an adverse employment action where the plaintiff did not allege that the ostracism resulted in a reduced salary,benefits,seniority,or responsibilities.
murillo seeks to import the standards used for determining an adverse retaliatory action in employment cases to public accommodations cases.she argues on appeal that in order to establish a prima facie ada retaliation claim,wilson had to show that the alleged retaliatory actions had a d
