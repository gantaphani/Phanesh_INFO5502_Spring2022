the primary question presented by this appeal is whether a member of a joint venture that is paid a commission to sell,on behalf of the joint venture,produce raised by the joint venture is a commission merchant as defined in food and agricultural code section.all further statutory references are to this code.we hold that the trial court correctly concluded the joint venturer was not a commission merchant because,under the terms of the joint venture agreement,the joint venturer was an owner of the produce he sold.in the nonpublished portion of the opinion,we also conclude plaintiff and appellant fantozzi has not otherwise established reversible error.accordingly,we affirm the judgment entered on a jury verdict in favor of defendant and respondent san joaquin tomato growers.
facts and procedural history 
appellant is a general partnership.for several years prior to,appellant grew acres of mature green tomatoes in a joint venture with respondent appellant and respondent entered into the same written joint venture agreement for the growing season.pursuant to the agreement,respondent was to contribute per acre in cash or materials and supplies.in this instance,it provided and planted the seedlings.appellant was to contribute use of its land,labor,equipment,and supplies to bring the crop to maturity.respondent was to provide labor to harvest the crop and to process and pack the tomatoes for sale.in addition,respondent was to sell the tomatoes and receive a commission of percent for doing so.after deducting the sales commission and reimbursing respondent for the costs of harvesting,transporting,and packing the tomatoes,appellant and respondent were to share equally the net proceeds.
in addition to other covenants and obligations set forth in the joint venture agreement,the agreement provided the following 
title to the tomatoes will pass from the joint venture to respondent at the time of harvesting said crop of tomatoes,subject to the right to division of proceeds as herein set forth.
respondent will be the sole judge of quality and market conditions and shall have the right to discontinue shipping whenever in its opinion the quality or market conditions do not justify shipment.
respondent will attempt to obtain the best market prices and effect quick sales and is authorized to make whatever adjustments or to grant any allowances that in respondent opinion are justifiable or necessary in order that sales be consummated 
respondent began harvesting the crop at the beginning of november.it rained several days and respondent stopped harvesting the field after about of the field had been picked.the five days of harvesting resulted in pounds of packed tomatoes before harvesting resumed,a hard frost destroyed the remaining crop.
appellant sued respondent for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract.the breach of fiduciary duty cause of action was premised upon allegations that respondent failed to timely harvest the tomato crop,failed to sell the tomatoes at the prevailing market price,refused to permit appellant to harvest the field itself after respondent decided not to timely finish the harvest,and engaged in that deprived appellant of legitimate profits.the complaint alleged that the fiduciary relationship arose both from the joint venture contract and from respondent statutory status as a commission merchant whose duties are established in sections through the breach of contract cause of action was premised upon similar allegations concerning the failure to harvest and market the crop,together with an allegation that respondent violated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by artificially agreeing to below market sales in order to preserve respondent business relationships with buyers,at the expense and in direct breach of its contractual duties to appellant.respondent answered and the matter came for jury trial.
respondent moved in limine to exclude,as relevant here,all evidence that respondent was acting as a commission merchant as defined by section or that it breached the duties of a commission merchant set forth in sections through.appellant opposed the in limine motion in an original and a supplemental memorandum of points and authorities.the trial court noted the joint venture agreement indicated both parties to it were owners of the crop.it then deferred ruling on the motion.subsequently,the trial court granted the motion,determining that the joint venture agreement did not make san joaquin tomato growers,a commission merchant as defined in section.accordingly,the court refused to instruct the jury with numerous instructions proposed by appellant that stated various statutory duties of a commission merchant.the refusal to so instruct constitutes the basis for appellant first contention on appeal.
appellant also requested the trial court instruct the jury with caci,concerning the required factual elements for a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.in reliance on the use note for that instruction,the trial court concluded the instruction should only be given when the plaintiff has stated a separate cause of action for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,which was not the case here.this ruling provides the basis for appellant second contention on appeal.
after a jury trial lasting more than a month,the jury,by special verdict,determined that respondent did not breach its fiduciary duty to appellant and that respondent did not breach its joint venture contract with appellant.the trial court denied appellant new trial motion.
discussion 
commission merchant 
section states 
commission merchant means any person,as follows 
a who receives on consignment or solicits any farm product from a licensee or producer of the product.
b who accepts any farm product in trust from a licensee or the producer of the product for purposes of sale.
c who sells any farm product on commission.
d who handles any farm product in any way for the account of or as an agent of the consignor of the product.any person who accepts a farm product from a licensee or the producer of such product for the purpose of sale or resale is a commission merchant,unless the person has bought,or agreed to buy,the farm product by a contract which designates the price to be paid to the seller.
sections through prescribe various duties imposed upon commission merchants.section requires that any person engaged in the business of buying,receiving on consignment,soliciting for sale on commission,or negotiating the sale of farm products from a licensee or producer for resale shall be licensed as provided in this chapter.acting as a commission merchant or other type of licensee without a license is a misdemeanor.
respondent was not licensed as a commission merchant 
appellant contends respondent clearly meets the statutory definition of a commission merchant by selling farm products on commission.the parties disagree whether respondent solicits farm products from a producer,but alternative bases for considering respondent a commission merchant do not affect the result of our analysis.appellant contends the trial court prejudicially erred in refusing instructions that were based upon the statutory duties imposed upon a commission merchant.
respondent does not dispute the obvious fact that a portion of its share of the proceeds under the joint venture agreement was a commission for selling the tomatoes,but contends it was not a commission merchant because,first,as the trial court concluded,the statute is inapplicable to owners of the product that is sold on commission second,that the statute is only applicable when the person to be paid a commission receives the produce from a consignor,as defined by statute and,third,that it is exempt from the requirements of the commission merchant statutes as a processor under sections and,subdivision b.it also contends any error by the trial court in refusing the instructions was not prejudicial.
we do not reach the latter contentions because we agree with the trial court that the definition of commission merchant does not include a member of a joint venture who,pursuant to the joint venture agreemen
