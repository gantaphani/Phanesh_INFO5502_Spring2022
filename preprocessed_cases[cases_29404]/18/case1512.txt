winthrop california investors limited partnership appeals from a judgment declaring it had no basis to terminate its partnership with crow irvine.the parties partnership agreement provides that the partnership is subject to termination if either partner believes in good faith that irreconcilable differences between the partners prevent the partnership from achieving its purposes winthrop contends the trial court erred in concluding that good faith belief must be measured by an objective standard,and in rejecting winthrop claim of such a belief as unreasonable.we agree.
the phrase good faith belief generally requires evaluation of a party subjective state of mind,without regard to its objective reasonableness.while the reasonableness of a claimed belief may be considered in determining whether their claimed belief is honestly held,it is not a prerequisite.and,nothing in the language of this partnership agreement requires a departure from that general rule.because the court used an incorrect standard in evaluating winthrop claim of good faith belief,the judgment must be reversed and the case remanded for a new evaluation of that issue.
additionally,we conclude the court erred in relying on its own interpretation of the partnership agreement and finding that the partnership is achieving its purposes as set forth in section of the partnership agreement.again,the issue was not whether the court itself interpreted the purposes of the partnership as having been achieved,but whether winthrop believed,in good faith,that they had not.there is support in the record for both positions,and that issue too must be reevaluated on remand.
finally,our reversal of the judgment and remand of the case for further proceedings renders moot crow consolidated appeal challenging the court refusal to award it attorney fees as prevailing party.we consequently dismiss that appeal.
winthrop and crow entered into a partnership agreement in may of.the stated purpose of the partnership was to acquire,own,finance,develop,improve,lease,operate and manage the excess land together with such other activities including sale or other disposition of the excess land or any portion thereof as may be necessary,advisable or convenient to the promotion or conduct of the business of the partnership the agreement specifically referenced a master plan for development of the property,including a timeline,and broken up into phases.phase i of the plan called for the completion of six office buildings,two hotels,and retail and entertainment malls by.phase ii included the development of three additional office towers,a building for business,convention and hotel space,and a retail arcade,by.
however,pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement,crow,the general partner,had the power to make changes to the master plan.although it is unclear whether crow affirmatively made such changes,or merely failed to comply with the original plan,it is undisputed that neither phase i nor phase ii has been completed.instead,as of,years into the partnership,it had developed only a retail center including stores and restaurants,a movie theater,a parking structure and a putting green.according to crow,a downturn in economic conditions rendered its initially contemplated development unfeasible.
moreover,during the existence of the partnership,the partners have engaged in extensive litigation with each other.according to winthrop,the parties have sued each other including affiliates no fewer than seven times.indeed,in one such case,winthrop had to sue crow,in delaware,for access to partnership records.the court in that case granted partial summary judgment to winthrop,ordering crow to provide winthrop full access to the partnership books and records.in another lawsuit,crow accused winthrop of breaching its fiduciary duty,and specifically alleged that the legal entanglements caused by winthrop wrongful and fraudulent actions have hindered crow development ability to and multiplied the expense of the continued development of the development parcel.in yet another lawsuit,crow counsel informed the court that t he parties do get along.they are going to get along any time soon.
against this backdrop and no doubt influenced by the fact that after years it had realized a return of only million on its original million investment,winthrop invoked section of the partnership agreement,which gave either partner the right to terminate the partnership based upon its professed good faith belief that irreconcilable differences between the partners prevent the partnership from achieving its purposes 
section also requires the terminating partner to make a written offer to purchase the interest of the other partner which shall set forth a definite price for the other partner interest.the price must be based on a hypothetical sales price for the portion of the excess land and any improvements thereron then owned by the partnership and will equal the amount the offeree partner would receive if such portion of the excess land and any improvements thereon were sold at the hypothetical price for cash subject to existing debt and all allocations and distributions were made as prescribed by article viii.
then,upon receipt of the offer,the offeree partner has the right to either accept the offer,or purchase for cash the interest of the offeror partner by paying an amount equal to the amount which the offeror partner would receive if such portion of the excess land and any improvements thereon were sold at the hypothetical price upon which the offered amount was based 
crow rejected winthrop attempt to terminate the partnership,challenging both its right to do so and the price it had set for the hypothetical sale of the partnership property.that dispute ripened into the declaratory relief action before the trial court.
the trial court determined that winthrop good faith belief that irreconcilable differences were preventing the partnership from achieving its purposes must be measured by an objective standard,whether a hypothetical reasonable partner would have held that belief under these circumstances.the court then reasoned that winthrop could not have had a good faith belief that irreconcilable differences between the partners prevent the achievement of partnership purposes because the partnership is achieving its purposes as set forth in section of the partnership agreement.therefore,such a belief could not be objectively or reasonably held,and winthrop did not invoke section in good faith.italics added.
based upon that reasoning,the court concluded winthrop purported invocation of section of the partnership agreement was,and is,invalid,null,void and of no effect.in light of that conclusion,the court did not reach the issue of whether winthrop proposed valuation of the partnership property was proper.the court subsequently denied crow application for attorney fees as prevailing party.
winthrop challenges the court determination that good faith belief must be measured on an objective,rather than a subjective,basis.in reaching that conclusion,the court specifically relied upon in re marriage of vryonis d,which held that to qualify as a putative spouse for purposes of former civil code section now,a party good faith belief that his or her marriage was valid must be objectively reasonable.the vryonis court supported its holding with the sweeping statement that g ood faith belief is a legal term of art,and in both the civil and criminal law a determination of good faith is tested by an objective standard.in re marriage of vryonis,supra,d at,italics added.unfortunately,the cases cited in vryonis as support for that statement can fairly be described as contradicting it.
vryonis first cites russ.partnership city and county of san francisco cal d,for the proposition that a vested right requires more than a good faith subjective belief that one has it.that proposition,however,addresses only the requirements for creating a vested right,and does nothing to distinguish good faith from a subjective standard.to the contrary,the quote appears to link the two into a single concept a good faith subjective belief.
vryonis next cites lazar hertz d,for the proposition that t he essence of the good faith covenant is objectively reasonable conduct.but of course,the good faith covenant is merely a short title for the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.as explained by our supreme court,the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing has both a subjective and an objective good faith and objective fair dealing.a party violates the covenant if it subjectively lacks belief in the validity of its act or if its conduct is objectively unreasonable.carma developers cal,marathon development california,cal th,d,italics added.t he covenant of good faith can be breached for objectively unreasonable conduct,regardless of the actor motive.id.at,d.all of these cases make it clear that there is a recognized distinction between subjective intentions good faith and objectively reasonable conduct.
vryonis next relies upon theodor superior court cal d,footnote,for the proposition that the subjective good faith of police is insufficient to rehabilitate a defective warrant if subjective good faith alone were the test,the protections of the fourth amendment would evaporate,and the people would be secure in their persons,houses,papers,and effects,only in the discretion of the police citation.good faith is immaterial,and can not serve to rehabilitate an otherwise defective warrant.citation.obviously,this does not impute an objective component to good faith.
vyronis next quotes people ruggles cal d,for the similar proposition that the probable cause determination that will validate a warrantless search of defendant vehicle must be based on objective facts that could justify the issuance of a warrant by a magistrate and not merely the subjective good faith of the police officers.italics added.clearly,ruggles distinguishes between objective facts and subjective good faith.
finally,vryonis notes that w ithout question,the hallmark of the law is reasonableness,and r easonableness of course,is an objective standard,requiring more than good faith.in re arias cal d.in re marriage of vryonis,supra,d at.this is a statement both hard to argue with and hard to reconcile with their idea that good faith requires objective reasonableness.
we can not find support in these cases for vryonis conclusion.virtually every case specifically links the concept of good faith with the qualifier subjective,and does so within the very quotes relied upon by the vryonis court.it seems to us that these cases establish nothing more than that the subjective good faith standard is not the appropriate standard to apply in those situations.to our minds,they do not suggest that good faith must be measured objectively.
we could find only two cases following vryonis,each of which adopted its statement that the good faith belief standard for establishing putative spouse status refers to an objectively reasonable belief.centinela hospital medical center superior court d.welch state of california th,d.but both of those cases simply adopted the holding of vryonis without any independent analysis.as we have shown,it can not withstand such analysis.
crow also relied upon cotran rollins hudig hall,cal th,d,for the proposition that the california supreme court has most recently endorsed an objective standard for evaluating good faith.however,as the supreme court itself explained,the issue it addressed in cotran was the standard juries apply in wrongful termination litigation to evaluate an employer good cause defense based on employee misconduct.id.at,d,italics added.the court was concerned with whether the employer had to prove the factual correctness of the cause,that a terminated employee actually did sexually harass a coworker or only that the employer believed it in good faith.
indeed,the focus of the court concern was that it would be unfair to subject the employee to termination based upon the employer purely subjective and unreasonable belief as to cause,and unfair to subject the employer to liability based upon its reasonable but ultimately incorrect assessment of an employment situation.consequently,the court devised a hybrid standard,pursuant to which the jury would determine whether at the time the decision to terminate his employment was made,defendants,acting in good faith and following an investigation that was appropriate under the circumstances,had reasonable grounds for believing plaintiff had done so.cotran rollins hudig hall,supra,cal th at,d.
perhaps confusingly to crow,the supreme court did refer to its hybrid standard as the objective good faith standard,cotran rollins hudig hall,supra,cal th at,d,but in fact the court never purported to alter the subjective nature of the traditional good faith concept.we can only assume the court was recognizing that the hybrid it was creating was something new objective good faith.in fact,the court specifically acknowledged that good faith is commonly thought of as subjective in essence.cotran,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
and that acknowledgement alone would be a sufficient basis upon which to decide this issue,even if we believed the supreme court had intended cotran to fundamentally alter the nature of the good faith standard.because cotran was not decided until,thirteen years after the parties entered into this partnership agreement,it certainly could not be relied upon to retroactively alter what the parties meant by the phrase good faith in.
shortly before oral argument,crow cited this court to storek storek,citicorp real estate,th,d,and city of oakland workers comp.appeals bd.th,d,as additional support for its contention that good faith requires an objective determination.however,neither case supports the contention.
in city of oakland,plaintiff sought workers compensation benefits for psychiatric injury caused by his employer decision to demote him.the labor code specifically precludes such an award if the employer decision was a lawful,nondiscriminatory,good faith personnel action,subd.h.the court simply adopted,without additional analysis,the hybrid objective good faith standard established by the supreme court in cotran for determining whether an employer had good cause for taking disciplinary action against an employee.as we have already explained,that hybrid standard was derived because the court wished to bridge the gap between the purely subjective good faith standard and the purely factual requirement that the cause be proven as true.indeed,the city of oakland court specifically noted that in creating the objective good faith standard in cotran,the supreme court had coupl ed good faith with objectivity city of oakland workers comp.appeals,supra,th at,d.consequently,city of oakland implicitly acknowledged that those concepts were otherwise distinct.
storek actually undermines crow contention.in storek,citicorp entered into an agreement to provide financing for completion of plaintiff construction project.the agreement included a provision that citicorp could withhold funds if it was not satisfied that the project budget was in balance.ultimately,citicorp made that determination and withheld funds.plaintiff sued,alleging that citicorp determination violated the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.the court of appeal rejected that contention,noting that the covenant of good faith and fair dealing can never be interpreted to prevent a party from doing what the contract expressly allows.
but the court then turned to the issue of whether citicorp contractual right to claim dissatisfaction with the project budget was to be evaluated on a subjective basis or an objective basis.it acknowledged two different lines of cases one line holds that satisfaction is a purely subjective decision which is governed by a good faith standard,and the other holds that the decision must be evaluated in accordance with an objective standard of reasonableness.the court explained the difference between the standards in this context,reasonableness and good faith are distinct concepts.a decision is unreasonable when it is arbitrary,capricious,or lacking in evidentiary support.a lack of good faith,on the other hand,suggests a moral quality,such as dishonesty,deceit,or unfaithfulness to duty.citation.w
