in this consolidated action,the judgment creditor,appeals the district court judgment dissolving and vacating garnishments and liens filed against any property of the republic of congo the congo,the judgment debtor,held by third party chevrontexaco corporation ct corp and domestic chevrontexaco subsidiaries collectively chevrontexaco,and dismissing writ of execution action filed against chevrontexaco,three chevrontexaco foreign subsidiaries,and the congo,a sovereign country.
the congo asserts a sovereign immunity defense against attempted execution of its judgment against the congo property allegedly held by chevrontexaco.the property sought to be garnished includes intangible obligations of chevrontexaco owed to the congo for various bonuses,taxes,and royalties related to the extraction of hydrocarbons,oil,and other of the congo natural resources.because these obligations were not used for a commercial activity in the united states,they are protected from execution or collection under the foreign sovereign immunity act fsia codified at a.we therefore affirm the dismissal of this garnishment action.
background 
this case involves a garnishment action against the congo property in execution of a judgment for a defaulted million loan made to the congo by predecessor,equator bank.
on december,pursuant to a loan agreement the loan agreement,equator bank loaned million to the congo for the construction of a highway.the congo consented to execution against any property whatsoever irrespective of its use or intended use,for satisfaction of any judgment arising out of the loan agreement.the congo also agreed to waive its sovereign immunity from suit,execution,attachment or other legal process.in,the congo defaulted on the loan.in,the connecticut bank of commerce cbc,equator bank assignee,obtained an english judgment against the congo,which it converted into a united states judgment in new york.cbc subsequently registered the judgment in texas and california.the california action was removed to federal district court in the northern district of california,case,where the litigation was stayed pending a final decision in the texas case.
meanwhile,parallel litigation concerning the texas judgment proceeded.in connecticut bank of commerce republic of congo,cir cbc,the fifth circuit addressed the parallel garnishment action filed by cbc against property held by cms,a oil company that owed tax and royalty obligations to the congo.cbc recognized the validity of the judgment,but remanded for a determination of whether the congo used the cms obligations in a commercial activity in the united states.id.at.republic of congo,cir,addressed the appeal from the district court decision after remand,and held that tax and royalty obligations owed to the congo that were used to pay a commercial loan from a united states bank were used for commercial purposes in the united states,thereby rendering them amenable to execution.id.at.
in addition to the pending action in the northern district of california seeking to enforce the registered judgment,filed a creditor suit,case,against the congo and six chevrontexaco corporations ct corp,chevron texaco global energy ctgei,chevrontexaco overseas petroleum ctopi,chevron overseas congo cocl,chevron international congo limited cicl,and cabinda gulf oil cabgoc.
identified the following intangible obligations that it alleged were the property of the congo 
certain obligations used to offset prepayments made by chevrontexaco to the congo,including a million participation bonus payable by cabgoc,a million signature bonus previously transferred by cocl for the development of the oil field located on the border of the congo and angola,and a million operator bonus previously transferred by cocl for the development of the oil field 
ctgei million payment to the congo for the acquisition of society commune de logistique sclog,a congolese joint venture for the distribution of oil within the congo 
cocl and cicl various fees and tax obligations payable to the congo 
cocl contingent obligation for a portion of a million signing bonus if a permit is issued for the moho and bilondo oil fields 
royalties payable by cocl and cicl to the congo and snpc for extractions from the,marine vii and kitina fields and 
million payable by copcl directly to contractors for social programs within the congo,including the construction of a university and a high school.
the district court entertained a motion based solely on the second prong of fsia a whether the congo property,represented by the obligations,was used for a commercial activity in the united states.for purposes of the dispositive motion,the parties stipulated that the offshore chevrontexaco subsidiaries were in the united states the district court had personal jurisdiction over all of the chevrontexaco corporations involved in this action snpc is the alter ego of the congo and all disputed facts would be presumed in favor of.
the district court ruled that none of the chevrontexaco obligations identified by was property used by the congo in a commercial activity in the united states.thus,the obligations were not amenable to execution under the sovereign immunity exception described in a.the district court therefore dissolved and vacated all garnishments and liens.this appeal followed.

iii.discussion 
a.we are not collaterally estopped by the texas judgment from analyzing the scope of the congo waiver of immunity.
as a general proposition,t he doctrine of collateral estoppel or issue preclusion prevents relitigation of issues actually litigated and necessarily decided,after a full and fair opportunity for litigation,in a prior proceeding.kourtis cameron,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.we have applied the doctrine where the issue necessarily decided at the previous proceeding is identical to the one which is sought to be relitigated the first proceeding ended with a final judgment on the merits and the party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted was a party or in privity with a party at the first proceeding.id.citation omitted.although i ssue preclusion generally refers to the effect of a prior judgment in foreclosing successive litigation of an issue of fact or law,new hampshire maine,d emphasis added citations omitted,i ssue preclusion has never been applied to issues of law with the same rigor as to issues of fact,segal am,cir citations omitted.considering whether to grant preclusive effect to a legal determination is constrained in a case like this one where i f the rule of issue preclusion is applied we are foreclosed from an opportunity to reconsider the applicable rule,and thus to perform our function of developing the law.restatement second of judgments cmt.i see also montana united states,d cautioning that the u nreflective invocation of collateral estoppel could freeze doctrine in areas of the law where responsiveness to changing patterns of conduct or social mores is critical coeur tribe of idaho hammond,cir declining to apply nonmutual collateral estoppel where it would substantially thwart the development of important questions of law citations omitted.this consideration is especially pertinent when as is the case here the issue was determined in an appellate court whose jurisdiction is coordinate with that of our court and the issue is of general interest and has not been resolved by the united states supreme court.restatement second of judgments cmt.i.we conclude that deserves a fresh determination of the law regarding the extent of the congo waiver of immunity under the fsia,and whether the congo obligations were used in connection with commercial activity in the united states pursuant to the fsia.see id.accordingly,we will not apply the doctrine of collateral estoppel in deciding this case.
b.the congo waiver of immunity from execution subjects the loan agreement to a provisions.
the loan agreement provides 
to the extent that the borrower may in any jurisdiction claim for itself or its assets immunity from suit,execution,attachment whether in aid of execution,before judgment or otherwise or other legal process and to the extent that in any such jurisdiction there may be attributed to itself or its assets such immunity whether or not claimed the borrower agrees not to claim and waives such immunity to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of that jurisdiction 
argues that the congo agreement not to assert immunity from execution renders a provisions inapplicable to the loan agreement.we disagree.in fact,the opposite is true.under,the property in the united states of a foreign state shall be immune from attachment,arrest and execution except as provided in section.in turn,a,the exception at issue in this case,provides the property in the united states of a foreign state used for a commercial activity in the united states,shall not be immune from attachment in aid of execution,or from execution,upon a judgment entered by a court of the united states or of a state if the foreign state has waived its immunity from attachment in aid of execution,or from execution a emphasis added.contention that the congo waiver renders a inapplicable is because,in the absence of a waiver,the property of the congo would be immune from attachment under.we agree with the fifth circuit that the waiver merely triggers the exception to the immunity from execution that would otherwise be in effect.see atwood turnkey drilling,petroleo brasileiro atwood,cir.rather than end our inquiry,the congo waiver requires that we turn to the second requirement at issue in this case whether the property was used for a commercial activity in the united states.cbc,at citation omitted emphasis removed.
the parties dispute the meaning of used for in a,and the precise meaning of the term is an issue of first impression in this circuit.the congo asks us to adopt the fifth circuit interpretation of the term.according to the fifth circuit to use property for a commercial activity,within the ordinary meaning of use,would be to put the property in the service of the commercial activity,to carry out the activity by means of the property.cbc,at.what matters under the statute is what the property is used for,not how it was generated or produced,id.at,and not whether the property merely has a nexus or connection to a commercial activity in the united states.id.at.in contrast,asks us to expand the fifth circuit definition and determine whether property was used for a commercial activity in the united states by examining the entire underlying activity that generated the property in question.
we agree with the fifth circuit that t he phrase used for in a is not a mere syntactical infelicity that permits courts to look beyond the use of property,and instead try to find any kind of nexus or connection to a commercial activity in the united states.id.we are also mindful that we must construe the waiver provisions in the fsia narrowly.see corporacion mexicana de servicios maritimos,de respect,cir analyzing the waiver exception in a.
in interpreting the fsia,we first look to the plain meaning of the language employed by congress.phaneuf republic of indonesia,cir citation omitted.when determining the plain meaning of language,we may consult dictionary definitions.see san jose christian coll.city of morgan hill,cir.the american heritage college dictionary,ed defines use as to put into service or apply for a purpose employ.this definition is very similar to the way we have defined use in applying a different statute.in konop hawaiian airlines,cir,we stated the statute does not define the word use,so we apply the ordinary definition,which is to put into action or service,avail oneself of,employ.id.at quoting webster ninth new collegiate dictionary,parallel citation omitted.the united states supreme court has similarly defined use as being most sensibly read to mean active employment for commercial purposes,and not merely a passive,passing,or past connection to commerce t he word use,in legislation as in conversation,ordinarily signifies active employment.jones united states,d citations omitted.
the legislative history of a reiterates that t he property in question must be used for a commercial activity in the united states,at,as reprinted in,see also argentine republic amerada hess shipping,d noting that the legislative history of the fsia,as presented in,supported the court conclusion.the structure of the fsia also supports our definition of used for.see ocean advocates army corps of eng rs,cir,as amended,interpreting statutory text in the context of the overall statutory scheme.as the fifth circuit noted 
two subsections of the fsia spell out the exceptions to immunity from execution.a governs the immunity from execution of property belonging to foreign states.b governs the immunity from execution of property belonging to an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state engaged in commercial activity in the united states.subsection a,regarding property belonging directly to a foreign state,permits execution only narrowly,when the property is in the united states and used for a commercial purpose in the united states.subsection b is broader it permits execution of any property in the united states belonging to the agency or instrumentality,regardless of how the agency or instrumentality uses the property 
cbc,at emphasis in the original.
we agree with the fifth circuit analysis a is a narrower exception by operation of the phrase used for,a conclusion well supported in the case law.see,ministry of def.support for armed forces of iran elahi mod,d distinguishing a from b by highlighting the phrase used for a commercial activity in a de letelier republic of chile,cir the fsia distinguishes between execution against property of an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state,which may be executed against regardless of whether the property was used for the activity on which the claim is based under b,and the property of the foreign state itself,which may be executed against only when the property was used for the commercial activity on which the claim is based under a.in making the distinction,congress sharply restricted immunity from execution against agencies and instrumentalities,but was more cautious when lifting immunity from execution against property owned by the state itself.see also working group of the,reforming the foreign sovereign immunities act,colum.transnat l,several factors combine to make execution against foreign states extremely restrictive.first is the threshold requirement in section a that the property against which attachment in aid of execution or execution is sought must be used for a commercial activity in the united states.at the outset,this eliminates large classes of property that might be candidates for execution in satisfaction of a judgment against a foreign sovereign.
in sum,the statutory structure and construction reflect a pivotal purpose of the fsia to limit execution against property directly belonging to a foreign state cbc,at.
as the restatement explains,f or purposes of attachment and execution,the foreign sovereign immunities act draws a sharp distinction between the property of states and the property of state instrumentalities.the property of states may be attached only if it is or was used in commercial activity the property of state instrumentalities may be attached without any such limitation,so long as the instrumentality itself is engaged in commercial activity in the united states.
id.quoting restatement third of the foreign relations law of the united states cmt.b alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.according the phrase used for its ordinary meaning helps preserve this distinction.id.
we also agree with the fifth circuit observation that the fsia separate commercial activity exception to immunity informs our analysis.section a provides a foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts of the united states when the action is based upon an act performed in the united states in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere a.as the fifth circuit noted,used for a commercial activity in a and in connection with a commercial activity in a are very different phrases.used for is more specific and narrower than in connection with,which is akin to the alternative interpretation of used for proposed by the appellant in cbc integral to or related to.cbc,at.accordingly,the fifth circuit reasoned,if it were to interpret used for to mean integral to or related to,it would interpret away the difference in phrasing between a and a.id.at.the fifth circuit observed that if congress had intended to equate used for with integral to or related to,congress likely would have used the phrase in connection with,as it did in.id.we agree.
contends that we should not adopt the fifth circuit definition of used for because c ourts have traditionally applied an interpretation consistent with view and contrary to the fifth circuit in support of this contention,relies on a number of cases,including libra bank banco nacional de costa rica,cir ned chartering trading,republic of pakistan,d itel containers international companhia de navegacao lloyd brasileiro,civ,wl,triton container international itaite,civ,wl,national union fire insurance of pittsburgh,pa people republic of the congo,c confirmed,dist.lexis,red mountain finance,democratic republic of congo,no.cal.june,and lnc investments,democratic republic of congo,no.cal.june.
however,this litany of cases fails to enlighten our discussion because none of them analyze the pivotal phrase at issue in this case used for a commercial activity in the united states.only two of the cited cases appear to support argument.see lloyd underwriters ao gazsnabtranzit,no,wl,at,concluding,without elaboration,that license fees owed by united states companies to the republic of moldova were used by moldova for a commercial activity in the united states see also alejandre republic of cuba,d,holding,without analysis,that because payments by united states companies to a cuban entity are monetary property that this court has determined exist in the united states for jurisdictional purposes,they by definition are used by the cuban entity for commercial activity in the united states,vacated on other grounds sub nom.alejandre telefonica larga distancia de puerto rico,cir the district court held that the amounts owed the cuban entity were both within the united states and used for a commercial activity therein.we express no opinion on the correctness of this holding.citation omitted.
both decisions,from district courts in the eleventh circuit,venus lines agency cvg industria venezolana de aluminio,cir per curiam.in that case,venus lines claim ed that the mexico cargo was used for the commercial activity of facilitating cvg sale of the alabama cargo.id.at.the eleventh circuit concluded if true,the mexico cargo would indeed have been used for a commercial activity in the united states.id.emphasis added.because a question of fact existed,the eleventh circuit was not called upon to fully analyze the used for requirement.however,it does not appear that the eleventh circuit approach differs radically from that of the fifth circuit.
the fifth circuit emphasized that what matters under the statute is how the foreign state uses the property,not how private parties may have used the property in the past cbc,at emphasis in the original citation omitted,reasoning that,i f we were to allow a private party commercial use of the property to count for a,we would erase the use distinction for almost all of a foreign state tangible property.id.we agree that to allow a private party commercial use of the property to waive a foreign sovereign immunity would not only frustrate one of the principal goals of the fsia to restrain,to the extent practicable,judicial interference with the jus imperii,or sovereign acts,of a foreign state,id.at citing,at,as reprinted in at but would also effectively eviscerate the protections of the fsia by essentially placing the power to waive the foreign sovereign immunity in the hands of private parties.
other sections of the fsia,as well as the legislative history,suggest that it is indeed the foreign sovereign use of the property that is determinative.congress findings and declaration of purpose,for example,clarify that foreign states are not immune from the jurisdiction of foreign courts insofar as their commercial activities are concerned,and their commercial property may be levied upon for the satisfaction of judgments rendered against them in connection with their commercial activities.emphasis added.
in sum,we adopt in principle the test articulated by the fifth circuit in cbc to determine whether property was used for a commercial activity in the united states,as that term is used in the fsia.like the fifth circuit,we conclude that property is used for a commercial activity in the united states when the property in question is put into action,put into service,availed or employed for a commercial activity,not in connection with a commercial activity or in relation to a commercial activity.
the fsia does not contemplate a strained analysis of the words used for and commercial activity,and neither do we.see corporacion mexicana,at instructing that the fsia provisions should be narrowly construed.rather,we anticipate that this determination will be made by considering the use of the property in question in a manner,with a proper appreciation of the fact that the further removed the property is from the referenced commercial transaction,the less likely it is that the property was used for that transaction.see id.
we expressly decline,however,to incorporate the fifth circuit articulated reservations about defining property use as commercial in nature solely by reference to past single and or exceptional commercial uses,at.in our view,attempting to quantify the number of commercial uses associated with the property,or to embark upon characterizing property use as exceptional or unexceptional,would unnecessarily complicate the determination to be made under a.
application of a to the obligations results in a conclusion of no use for a commercial activity in the united states.
having defined the meaning of used for a commercial activity,we now turn to the application of a to the property claimed by.
global argument regarding the obligations at issue.
first argues that all the obligations at issue were used for a commercial activity in the united states because the congo and snpc pledged the obligations as security for the loan agreement.however,reliance on the loan agreement is misplaced.that loan agreement was between the congo and a bank located in the bahamas for the financing and construction of a highway in the congo,to be managed by an english contractor.none of the obligations presently at issue and purportedly used for a commercial activity in the united states was in existence in.for these reasons,atwood,is inapposite.in atwood,petrobras,a brazilian entity and foreign sovereign under the fsia,entered into a contract with atwood,a united states company,for atwood to drill oil wells off the coast of brazil.id.at.as security for the money due atwood under the contract,petrobras provided a letter of credit issued by a united states bank.id.at.examining atwood,the cbc court noted that a lthough atwood did not explicitly consider the used for requirement,petrobras plainly used the letter of credit for a commercial purpose within the ordinary meaning of the phrase used for.petrobras used the letter of credit to secure the services of an american corporation to do drilling work petrobas put the letter of credit in service of the commercial activity,it spent the letter of credit on that activity.at.the facts of united states party to the contract,a contract requiring services to be provided by the united states company,services secured by a letter of credit from a united states bank,and a letter of credit in existence at th
