background facts 
resources.is the general partner in crutcher tufts resources.both entities are businesses owned in part by various members of the crutcher family and the tufts family david tufts,iii david tufts indirectly holds an interest in,sits on its board of directors and is its president and assistant secretary.the other board members of.at the relevant time were fred tufts,robert tufts,albert crutcher,mary crutcher and james reiss,albert crutcher.tufts energy is an enterprise that is owned and controlled by david tufts.and tufts energy entered into a management agreement on july.the management agreement was drafted primarily by jeff zlotky,an attorney with thompson knight,at the direction of david tufts.there was minimal,if any,input from either,the to the agreement or the other board members of,who were required to vote on the agreement.testimony at trial showed that the other board members were not given a draft of the management agreement until july,one day before the board had to vote on the agreement.the agreement provided that tufts energy,as manager,would supply general and administrative management services to as defined in section of the management agreement section of the agreement,entitled compensation further provides in consideration of the performance of the general and administrative services pursuant hereto,the partnership shall pay the manager the payment in advance of each month on or before the first day of each month.the agreement was approved by a majority of the board of directors of and albert crutcher was designated as the representative with the authority to execute the agreement 
after entering into the agreement,tufts energy apparently provided management services to for approximately two years,receiving regular payments of per month as set forth in the agreement.the parties do not contend that tufts energy did not perform its management duties,nor do they contend that the failed to pay tufts energy according to the agreement.
section of the agreement provided 
the initial term of this agreement shall extend from the date hereof to the close of business on june,provided that this agreement shall continue thereafter for successive terms ending on the close of business on june of each succeeding year unless either the partnership or the manager shall elect to terminate this agreement upon at least days written notice to the other party prior to june of any such succeeding year 
on march,the board of directors of.met and voted not to renew the agreement,and thus the agreement was to expire on june.on march,david tufts called a board meeting that resulted in a resolution that removed fred tufts and james reiss from the board and replaced them with david tufts wife and mother.this new board then voted to reinstate the management agreement.litigation concerning the validity of this action was pursued by the parties in a state court proceeding entitled albert crutcher,et david tufts,iii,et,division n,civil district court,orleans parish.the proceeding was a quo warranto action as to the validity of the board meeting and the resolution changing the board composition.on february,the louisiana fourth circuit court of appeal issued an opinion and entered a final judgment that the resolution attempting to remove the members of the.board was invalid this meant that the march,vote by the old board not to renew the agreement was valid,and the management agreement expired on june.
the bone of contention in this adversary proceeding is none of the above but instead section of the agreement,which reads 
right to earn partnership interest in the partnership.the manager shall have the right to earn twenty five percent of the equity of the partnership upon the achievement by the partnership of mutually acceptable performance criteria to be agreed upon by the board of directors of the general partner of the partnership and the manager and as acceptable to the lenders under the senior credit agreement and the subordinated credit agreement,and in conjunction with a mutually acceptable independent third party consultant giving due consideration to the amount of the payment as compared to the manager actual costs of rendering services pursuant to this agreement.the parties strenuously disagree as to the effect of section.the responsible party argues that section is simply an agreement to agree and as such is not an enforceable provision of the contract.tufts energy argues that section of the agreement is a valid suspensive condition,the fulfillment of which was frustrated by.tufts energy further argues that under louisiana civil code article,the result of this frustration is that the condition is deemed fulfilled,and it is entitled to a interest in.
prior to beginning the trial on the complaint of the responsible party,the court limited the issues to be presented at trial to whether section of the management agreement constitutes a purely potestative or simply potestative condition and,whether,if the provisions of section of the management agreement are determined to be a simply potestative condition,performance of the condition was frustrated solely by the acts of resources,and resources,
ii.legal analysis 
purely or simply potestative 
according to the court order of may,the first of two issues to be decided is whether section of the management agreement constitutes a purely potestative or simply potestative condition under the governing law contained in the louisiana civil code.the court order was in response to the parties motion to limit the issues to be tried and the accompanying briefs upon analyzing the relevant civil code articles,however,the court finds that the concept of simply and purely potestative conditions no longer exists under louisiana law.thus,the court analyzes the following articles of the louisiana civil code instead.
louisiana civil code articles and 
the revisions to the louisiana civil code specifically address conditional obligations in articles to article defines suspensive and resolutory conditions although the definition of suspensive and resolutory conditions did not substantively change with the revisions,their treatment in certain circumstances did.
under the pre articles of the civil code,a suspensive or resolutory condition could be either casual,potestative or mixed the potestative condition was defined as that which makes the execution of the agreement depend on an event which it is in the power of the one or the other of the contracting parties to bring about or to hinder.article of the pre civil code then stated every obligation is null,that has been contracted,on a potestative condition,on the part of him who binds himself.the next article distinguished between purely and simply potestative conditions,holding that not all potestative conditions were null.
the current version of the civil code,in article,eliminates the term potestative,and instead focuses on the concepts of whim and will.comment e to article states that the purpose of the article is to recast the concepts surrounding simply and purely potestative conditions in the pre civil code in terms of an implicit dichotomy between the obligor whim,that is,his exercise of mere unbridled discretion or arbitrariness and his judgment,or exercise of a considered and reasonable discretion.the comments further explain that the potestative concept was replaced in the civil code by the revisions because of the confusion it engendered and the difficulties the concept caused in louisiana jurisprudence with respect to the treatment of conditions 
in keeping with the changes to the civil code,the court will not determine whether section is a purely or simply potestative condition but instead will address section of the agreement in terms of the civil code articles.the court finds that section contains a suspensive condition.the uncertain event is the achievement by the partnership of mutually acceptable performance criteria.upon the occurrence of that event,the obligation,the manager right to earn of the equity of the partnership,may be enforced,but the suspensive obligation may only be enforced when the uncertain event occurs.in the instant case,no party argues that the uncertain event has occurred.no mutually acceptable performance criteria were ever established by whereby tufts energy could earn of the equity of.
the court then turns to article,which states a suspensive condition that depends solely on the whim of the obligor makes the obligation null.the responsible party and various other interested parties in this proceeding argue that section depends solely on the whim of,and is therefore null.tufts energy argues that section does not depend solely on the whim of,and is not null.the court finds the latter argument is the better position.the language of section reads that the right to earn the equity interest depends upon the achievement by the partnership of mutually acceptable performance criteria to be agreed upon by the board of directors of the general partner of the partnership and the manager and as acceptable to the lenders under the senior credit agreement and the subordinated credit agreement,and in conjunction with a mutually acceptable third party consultant.
the court finds that the terms of section do not depend on the whim of as whim is used in article.comment d to article states 
an event which is left to the obligor whim is one whose occurrence depends entirely on his will,such as his wishing or not wishing something.an event is not left to the obligor whim when it is one that he may or may not bring about after a considered weighing of interest,such as his entering into a contract with a third party.
section does not state and can not be read fairly to mean that the manager has the right to earn a equity interest only if wishes it.rather,the manager shall have the right to earn the equity interest,and this right is conditioned upon the agreement of criteria to be determined by two parties the partnership and the manager,with the input of a third a mutually acceptable independent third party consultant,and the veto rights of a fourth party the lenders.does not retain unbridled discretion to put forth any criteria it wishes.the criteria must be agreed to by the manager and approved by the lenders under the senior and subordinated credit agreements.ostensibly the performance criteria should relate to the performance of some act by the manager that has value to the partnership,and in return for such act,the partnership would grant the manager a equity interest.this would place the development of the performance criteria in the category of a condition that may or may not bring about after a considered weighing of interest.for example,can not unilaterally decide that the manager equity is to be earned by requiring david tufts to scale mount everest,because neither tufts energy nor the lenders would agree to that as a mutually acceptable performance criteria,and thus,that criteria would be unenforceable.the respective abilities of tufts energy to have input and the lenders to have veto power in the achievement of the performance criteria leads the court to the conclusion that the suspensive condition does not solely depend on the whim of the obligor,and as such,it is not null under the provisions of article.
additionally,the performance criteria giving rise to the right to earn the equity interest is to be determined in part by giving due consideration to the amount of the payment as compared to the manager actual costs of rendering the services pursuant to th e agreement.the amount of the payment compared to the actual costs of rendering services is a factor that must be considered by the partnership when determining the performance criteria.if is required to take concrete factors such as this into account when determining the performance criteria,it can not be said that the decision is entirely dependent on the whim of.
frustration under louisiana civil code article 
holding that section of the agreement is a valid suspensive condition necessitates an analysis of tufts energy second argument that is grounded on article,which reads a condition is regarded as fulfilled when it is not fulfilled because of the fault of a party with an interest contrary to the fulfillment.tufts energy argues that the fulfillment of section of the agreement was frustrated by through the actions of albert crutcher in his capacity as the designated officer of 
the responsible party,arguing on behalf of.and,contends that did not frustrate the fulfillment of section.rather,the argument put forth in defense of is that initially it was never asked to develop performance criteria,and that even had it wanted to develop criteria,it was prevented from doing so by david tufts refusal to provide certain data related to the expenses incurred by tufts energy in the course of performing its duties under the management agreement.the responsible party argues that this data was critical to the ability of to assess tufts energy performance and develop appropriate performance criteria under section.the language in section as to the actual cost of the expense was added at the request of albert crutcher because he thought the annual figure was too high for the payment and wanted to analyze the payment before agreeing to additional compensation for tufts energy.
david tufts and robert tufts both testified that they raised the issue of the development of performance criteria at the ctr board meeting on may,as well as at other times.fred tufts,albert crutcher and james reiss testified that the issue was never discussed at any ctr board meeting.they also denied that david tufts had approached them even outside board meetings to discuss performance criteria.david tufts testified that he could not point to any minutes of board meetings that would support his testimony,and indeed the minutes of the.board meetings do not reflect that the development of performance criteria was ever discussed.nor could david tufts point to any documents supporting his testimony even though numerous documents were produced for purposes of this trial.as president of the board of,david tufts was responsible for setting the agenda of the board meetings
