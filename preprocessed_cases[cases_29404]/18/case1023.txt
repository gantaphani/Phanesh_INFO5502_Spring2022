dismissal of the knowing endangerment object 
background 
in the original indictment,filed february,the government charged defendants with participating in a conspiracy.according to count i of the indictment,which details the scope of the conspiracy,defendants conspired to knowingly release asbestos,a hazardous air pollutant,and thus knowingly to endanger both epa employees and members of the libby community in violation of c a knowing endangerment object and to defraud the united states by impairing,impeding,and frustrating government agency investigations and operations in violation of defrauding object.on march,defendants moved to dismiss the knowing endangerment object of the conspiracy,arguing that the government had failed to allege an overt act in furtherance of the alleged conspiracy within the statute of limitations period.united states grace,d.
defendants argument relied primarily on yates united states,d holding that the statute of limitations must be satisfied as to each object of the conspiracy when the government charges a conspiracy,overruled on other grounds by burks united states,d.because the government supposedly had failed to allege a requisite overt act before the statute of limitations ran on november,defendants asserted that the knowing endangerment object was.
the government disputed defendants characterization of the indictment,claiming that certain overt acts alleged in the indictment could support both the fraud object and the knowing endangerment object of count i conspiracy charge.towards this end,the government directed the district court attention to paragraphs,and of the indictment.grace,d at.the paragraphs cited by the government alleged that defendants had failed to remove material from sites in the libby community,had misled various individuals regarding current asbestos contamination,and had failed to disclose the existence of numerous sites.what the paragraphs purportedly failed to allege was that defendants released,or conspired to release,asbestos during the relevant time period.
analyzing both the text of the specified paragraphs and the structure of the indictment,in which the cited paragraphs were listed under the obstruction of epa superfund,the district court concluded that the indictment more plausibly suggests a completed operation than a conspiracy still at work.id.at.to the extent that overt acts were alleged,the district court found that they were acts of obstruction,not acts of wrongful endangerment.id.thus,the district court dismissed as the knowing endangerment object of the count i conspiracy.id.at.
two weeks after the district court first order,dismissing a portion of the indictment,the government obtained a superseding indictment.the new indictment was substantially similar to the original indictment,amending only paragraphs,which had been the focus of the district court previous order.in the superseding indictment,the government changed the section heading under which the disputed paragraphs had been listed from obstruction of superfund to knowing endangerment of epa employees and the libby community and obstruction of the epa superfund.it also changed paragraphs,and,by adding at the end of each original paragraph the phrase,thereby concealing the true hazardous nature of the asbestos contamination,delaying epa investigation and causing releases of asbestos into the air in the libby community.
defendants then moved to dismiss the knowing endangerment object of the superseding indictment,arguing that the government had failed to fix the original indictment because the new indictment alleged no new overt acts,was barred by the previous dismissal with prejudice,and was because the statute of limitations had run.the district court rejected the first two arguments,but agreed with defendants that the new indictment was.under the district court reading,the superseding indictment was not protected by the savings clause of.order at,united states grace,d order dismissing indictment docket.the government now appeals that determination.
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court decision to dismiss part of an indictment,united states,cir,as we review,also de novo,the district court interpretation of.united states gorman,cir.
if a district court dismisses an indictment or portion thereof,the savings clause of permits the government to return a new indictment after the statute of limitations has expired,as long as it is done within six months of the dismissal.the statute reads as follows 
whenever an indictment or information charging a felony is dismissed for any reason after the period prescribed by the applicable statute of limitations has expired,a new indictment may be returned in the appropriate jurisdiction within six calendar months of the date of the dismissal of the indictment or information,which new indictment shall not be barred by any statute of limitations.this section does not permit the filing of a new indictment or information where the reason for the dismissal was the failure to file the indictment or information within the period prescribed by the applicable statute of limitations,or some other reason that would bar a new prosecution.
the dispute in the instant case stems from the parties divergent interpretations of the final sentence of.this sentence explains that the savings clause does not extend to indictments initially filed outside of the statute of limitations.the government takes the position that this does not bar the return of the new indictment because the original indictment was obtained before the statute of limitations expired.thus,the government argues,permits amendment by a superseding indictment.defendants disagree,arguing that the government failed to allege an overt act for the knowing endangerment object of the conspiracy before the statute of limitations expired.the district court agreed with defendants and dismissed the knowing endangerment object as.
defendants argument is premised on a conflation of the terms and not timely filed.the last sentence of refers to indictments that were not timely filed,indictments that were not filed within the statute of limitations.here,there is no dispute that the government filed its indictment within the statute of limitations period.the district court dismissed the knowing endangerment object in the original indictment as because it failed to allege an overt act within the statute of limitations,not because the indictment was untimely filed.the district court erred.if the indictment is filed within six months of the dismissal order,does not bar the government from filing a superseding indictment the savings clause of permits amendment when the original was structurally flawed but timely filed.united states clawson,cir.
in clawson,the defendant was indicted for mail fraud on june.id.at.defendant immediately moved to dismiss the indictment for failure to allege an overt act within the statute of limitations.id.the indictment alleged overt acts that occurred before the limitation period began on june,or after defendant withdrawal from the conspiracy on july.id.the district court granted defendant motion to dismiss the indictment and the government responded by obtaining a first superseding indictment,which alleged overt acts occurring in the window between june,and july.id.defendant then moved to dismiss the new indictment,arguing that the statute had run before the government obtained the first superseding indictment and that did not extend to indictments dismissed for failure to comply with the statute of limitations.id.the district court denied his motion and we affirmed.id.at.
clawson noted that when r ead in its entirety,th e last sentence of cuts off the grace period only where the it a limitations problem or some other not capable of being cured.id.at.in the instant case,the district court held and defendants now argue that the defect in the original indictment obtained by the government is not capable of being cured because the original indictment did not allege an overt act for the knowing endangerment object before the statute of limitations expired.this position,however,is precluded by clawson.
in clawson we distinguished between a timely filed,but flawed,indictment,to which the savings clause of does apply,and an untimely filed indictment,to which it does not.
i f the original indictment was brought after the limitations period ran on all the alleged criminal conduct,allowing reindictment under section would obliterate the statute of limitations a defendant could be indicted two years after the statute had run and,when the court dismissed,the prosecution could simply reindict within six months,free from the limitations bar.id.
for obvious reasons,reindictment is prohibited by in such circumstances.id.
the matter is much different where the original indictment is brought within the limitations period,but is dismissed for failure to allege the exact elements of the crime,or some other technical reason.in the latter circumstance,a valid indictment could have been brought in a timely fashion the grace period merely allows the government to do what it had a right to do in the first place.id.
the latter circumstance describes the facts of both clawson and the instant case.in both cases,the government timely indicted defendants for a particular crime,but originally failed to allege a valid overt act.the government then obtained superseding indictments charging defendants with the exact same crimes,but adding the necessary overt act allegations.thus,each defendant was charged with the exact crime for which he could have been prosecuted had there not been a defect in the indictment.section was designed to apply in this situation.see also united states charnay,cir the underlying concept of is that if the defendant was indicted within time,then approximately the same facts may be used for the basis of any new indictment obtained after the statute has run,if the earlier indictment runs into legal pitfalls.
when discussing timeliness,both clawson and charnay refer to the time of the original filing of the indictment.they do not consider whether the original indictment included all of the relevant acts or elements necessary to charge defendants with the crime.as long as the original indictment is filed within the statute of limitations and charges the same crime,based upon approximately the same facts charged in the superseding indictment,allows the government to file a superseding indictment within six months.see clawson,at charnay,at.here,the parties do not dispute that the original indictment was timely filed.the district court holding that the indictment was referred only to its failure to allege the necessary overt acts in the original flaw that can be cured through reindictment under.
the district court attempted to distinguish clawson,stating that in clawson the government alleged overt acts in the original indictment,which was filed within the limitations period.this distinction is irrelevant.while the government did allege overt acts before the limitations period expired in clawson,it failed to allege an overt act sufficient to support the conspiracy charge since the only overt acts alleged occurred outside the statute of limitations or subsequent to clawson withdrawal from the conspiracy.thus,the government originally failed to allege any relevant overt acts in clawson,just as in the instant case.
moreover,clawson did not turn on the distinction advanced by the district court as we have explained,applies when an indictment though defective is brought within the limitations period,and the superseding indictment charges defendant with the same exact crime with which he was initially charged,based on approximately the same facts.the only addition in the new indictment considered in clawson was the inclusion of new overt acts that the government could have used in the original indictment.the fact that the government had timely alleged inapplicable overt acts was wholly extraneous to the clawson court decision.
the district court misapprehension of both clawson and is also clear from its statement that t o allow the government a grace period in this case would extend the statute of limitations for the improper purpose of affording the prosecution a second opportunity to do what it failed to do in the beginning.order dismissing indictment at.yet this is exactly what does.it extends the statute of limitations by six months to allow the prosecution a second opportunity to do what it failed to do in the beginning namely,file an indictment free of legal defects.
this reading of does not,as the district court suggests,require a defendant to remain subject to an indefinite threat of prosecution,held open beyond the statute of limitations period,while he and the court wait for the government to finish tinkering with the indictment.id.what does is twofold first,it eliminates the incentive for criminal defendants to move for dismissal of an indictment at the end of the statute of limitations,thereby winning dismissal at a time when the government can not.and second,it subjects defendants to the threat of prosecution for six months after the dismissal of the original an indefinite threat of prosecution as the district court only if the government has timely filed an indictment charging the exact same crimes based on approximately the same facts.
for the reasons articulated herein,we reverse the district court dismissal of the knowing endangerment object of count i in the superseding indictment and reinstate that portion of the count.
ii.definition of asbestos 
background 
we now turn to the question of whether congress use of the term asbestos to identify a hazardous air pollutant created ambiguity as to what substance was meant by that term.
the parties filed cross motions in limine to exclude evidence that fell outside their respective interpretations of the term.govt.mot.in limine re definition of asbestos docket defs mot.in limine re definition of asbestos docket.the district court held that the term asbestos has no inherent meaning and therefore its use in the criminal provisions of the clean air act violated the rule of lenity and the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.it interpreted asbestos for purposes of the clean air act knowing endangerment provision to mean the six minerals covered by epa civil regulatory scheme.order at,united states grace,d order defining asbestos docket.that regulation defines the civilly regulated species of asbestos as the asbestiform varieties of serpentinite chrysotile,riebeckite crocidolite,anthophyllite,and.definitions for national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants neshaps.
the district court imported the civil regulatory definition of asbestos into the criminal provisions of the clean air act,and then ruled that evidence of asbestos releases offered at trial would be limited to those relevant to proving releases of the six minerals included in the regulatory definition evidence of releases of other asbestiform minerals would be excluded.order defining asbestos at.this ruling eliminated from trial evidence of releases of of the contaminants in the libby are asbestiform minerals but fall outside of the six minerals in the civil regulatory well as excluding government data that did not differentiate between the six regulated minerals and unregulated asbestiform minerals.the government appeals,asserting that the definition contained in the criminal portion of the statute is the applicable definition.
standards of review 
we review de novo the district court construction of the clean air act,as we do rulings on the admissibility of evidence in which issues of law predominate.see united states,cir.
the clean air act knowing endangerment provision prohibits the knowing and dangerous release into the ambient air of any hazardous air pollutant listed pursuant to.c a section b lists asbestos,also identified by its chemical abstracts service cas registry number,as a hazardous air pollutant.b.thus,b identifies asbestos by name and defines it through reference to cas registry.
the government contends that a statute may have two definitions for one term,one definition civil and one criminal.further,it argues that the definition of asbestos applicable to the clean air act criminal knowing endangerment provision covers the minerals involved in this case.we agree on both points.
the district court found b definition to be unsatisfactory as a matter of law.however,congress need not define every word in a criminal statute for the statute to pass constitutional muster.when congress does not define a term in a statute,we construe that term according to its ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.united states cabaccang,cir en banc internal quotation marks omitted.it is well known that asbestos has a common meaning it is a fibrous,compound that can be composed of several substances,typically including magnesium.or,as defined by the cas registry,and incorporated by reference into b,it is a grayish material that consists primarily of impure magnesium silicates.cas registry number,available at.gov srs srs proc qry.navigate p sub id.this definition has been established for decades,as was elucidated in the motions in limine.see defs mot.in limine re definition of asbestos expert witness disclosure of gregory meeker,appendix a may,noting that asbestos was first defined in.
in addition,defendants had actual notice in this case of the risks from the fibrous content of the asbestiform minerals in their products.defendants are an industrial chemical company and seven of its top executives.they are all familiar with asbestos.since at least,defendants have known of the health risks posed by the asbestiform minerals in their products.it is clear that defendants knew or should have known that their mining,milling,and distribution activities risked the release of asbestos into the ambient air.in light of the clear statutory language,including b incorporation by reference of the cas registry asbestos definition,and defendants knowledge of the industrial chemicals field,the district court erred in misdefining asbestos as used in the criminal statute and in invoking the rule of lenity.see muscarello united states,d the rule of lenity applies only if,after seizing everything from which aid can be derived,we can make no more than a guess as to what congress intended.alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted united states lanier,d the rule of lenity ensures fair warning by so resolving ambiguity in a criminal statute as to apply the statute only to conduct clearly covered.
the district court conclusion that ambiguity exists simply because of the existence of two oversight civil regulatory structure and a criminal enforcement use different definitions of the term asbestos is erroneous.as we determined in united states hagberg,cir,congress validly may create multiple enforcement mechanisms that each draw on different definitions for the same term or phrase.
in hagberg,defendant was indicted for allegedly dumping sewage along a public road in violation of the clean water act,c,e.hagberg at.moving to dismiss the indictment,hagberg argued that his actions did not fit within the statutory definition of the crime because the material he dumped was not sewage sludge as defined by the regulations for permitting waste disposal.id.at.accepting hagberg argument,the district court dismissed the indictment.the government appealed.id.we reversed because the district court improperly had conflated the regulatory and direct enforcement provisions of the clean water act,and the relevant by the direct enforcement the material dumped by defendant.id.at.we explained that some terms found in the direct enforcement provision are defined differently when used in the context of the civil permitting regulations.id.at.
like the clean water act provisions at issue in hagberg,the clean air act creates multiple enforcement mechanisms a civil regulatory structure and a direct enforcement mechanism.in the instant case,as in hagberg,defendants are charged with violating the directly enforceable provision of the statute that pulls its definitions from a separate provision than does the regulatory provision.the civil regulatory system draws its definition of asbestos from,the knowing endangerment provision from b.see a c a.the civil regulatory system regulates major sources of hazardous air pollutants,c g,and therefore understandably focuses on a subset of asbestifom minerals deemed to have commercial potential market forces preclude commercially species of asbestos from becoming major sources of pollution from asbestos mills and mines and other covered sources.the direct enforcement mechanism created in focuses on risks to health.therefore it provides oversight of release of hazardous pollutants whether or not they come from major sources of pollution.we defer to congress decision to create two enforcement structures and hold the district court conflation of the two to be error.
in sum,the district court improperly limited the term asbestos to the six minerals covered by the civil regulations.asbestos is adequately defined as a term and need not include classifications to provide notice of its hazardous nature,particularly to these knowledgeable defendants.accordingly,we reverse the order limiting evidence to that fitting within the civil regulations.
iii.mandamus 
background 
the knowing endangerment provision of the clean air act establishes an affirmative defense for hazardous air pollutants released in accordance with an applicable national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants neshap.see c a.in the proceedings before the district court,the government argued that defendants could not avail themselves of this affirmative defense because no neshap applied to grace operations in libby thus,compliance with an applicable neshap was impossible.the district court rejected this argument,finding that the regulations created an emissions standard of no visible emissions for asbestos.accordingly,the district court ruled that it would allow defendants to introduce evidence at trial to try to prove their affirmative defense.because the district court did not exclude any of the government emissions evidence as a result of this ruling,the government can not appeal the district court decision.instead,it now seeks a writ of mandamus to overturn the decision.
standard of review 
the writ of mandamus is codified at a the supreme court and all courts established by act of congress may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.this court has developed a test for determining whether a writ may issue.we must consider whether 
the party seeking the writ has no other adequate means,such as direct appeal,to attain the relief he or she desires.
the petitioner will be damaged or prejudiced in a way not correctable on appeal.
the district court order is clearly erroneous as a matter of law.
the district court order is an error,or manifests a persistent disregard of the federal rules.
the district court order raises new and important problems,or issues of law of first impression.
clemens dist,cir quoting bauman united states dist,cir.not every factor must be present to warrant mandamus relief,see id.at,and in this case the only disputed issue is whether the district court made a clear error as a matter of law.
where,as here,the district court order involves issues of statutory interpretation,the order is clearly erroneous as a matter of law if the reviewing court is left with a definite and firm conviction that the district court interpretation of the statute was incorrect.degeorge united states dist.court,cir citing in re cement antitrust,cir see also united states ye,cir.here,the plain language of the statute makes clear that the affirmative defense is not applicable to defendants actions.
in relevant part,c a states,f or any air pollutant for which the administrator has set an emissions standard,a release of such pollutant in accordance with that standard shall not constitute a violation of this paragraph.the first clause of the affirmative defense makes it inapplicable to grace alleged asbestos releases.quite simply,asbestos is not an air pollutant for which the administrator has set an emissions standard.c a emphasis added.rather,the administrator has set several emissions standards,each of which is source dependent.some asbestos emissions standards make no reference at all to visible emissions.see.others include additional procedural requirements,above and beyond the no visible emissions requirement.see.in short,there is simply no emissions standard for asbestos neither is there an emissions standard for asbestos releases from mining operations therefore,it is inconceivable that the alleged grace releases were in accordance with that standard.c a.the plain language of the statute makes clear that the affirmative defense simply does apply in this case.the district court order to the contrary leaves us with a a definite and firm conviction that it got the law wrong.degeorge,at.consequently,we grant the government petition for writ of mandamus,and hold that grace can not avail itself at trial of the affirmative defense articulated in c a.
iv.evidentiary rulings

as stated above,counts of the superseding indictment allege violations of c a,the clean air act knowing endangerment provision,which creates criminal penalties for a person who knowingly releases into the ambient air any hazardous air pollutant listed pursuant to section of this title and who knows at the time that he thereby places another person in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury.defendants filed motions in limine seeking to exclude evidence related to,or testimony based on,certain indoor air studies indoor air studies,grace historic testing of its vermiculite products historic testing,a report of the agency for toxic substances and disease registry based on a medical screening study of residents of libby,montana atsdr report,and the results of the screening study published as an article in a journal peipins publication.ruling that these studies were unreliable,irrelevant,or unduly prejudicial,the district court barred government experts from relying on them in forming opinions regarding the knowing endangerment charges,and,as to the indoor air studies,the atsdr report,and the peipins publication,excluding the studies,report,and publication themselves for most or all purposes.order,united states grace,d indoor air order order,united states grace,d historical testing order order,united states grace,d atsdr and peipins order.the government appeals.

relevant rules 
federal rule of evidence defines relevant evidence as that which has any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.rule provides that relevant evidence is admissible,except as limited by the constitution,statutes,or other rules of evidence.rule provides a balancing test for the exclusion of relevant evidence on the grounds of prejudice relevant evidence may be excluded if probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,confusion of the issues,or misleading the jury 
several rules apply specifically to testimony by experts.under rule,an expert witness may provide opinion testimony if the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data and is the product of reliable principles and methods,which have been applied reliably to the facts of the case.the rule affirms the court role as gatekeeper and provides some general standards that the trial court must use to assess the reliability and helpfulness of proffered expert testimony.advisory comm.notes,rule.
under rule,the facts or data upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by or made known to the expert at or before the hearing.if of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject,the facts or data need not be admissible in evidence in order for the opinion or inference to be admitted.however,if the expert relies on facts or data that are otherwise inadmissible,then those facts shall not be disclosed to the jury by the proponent of the opinion or inference unless the court determines that their probative value in assisting the jury to evaluate the expert opinion substantially outweighs their prejudicial effect.
indoor air releasesi.background 
on may,defendants filed a motion in limine to exclude evidence of or derived from indoor asbestos releases.defendants sought to exclude documents and studies,including epa phase ii air sampling charts,as well as expert testimony that relied upon these studies.see defs mot.in limine re indoor air releases at docket.
on august,the district court granted defendants motion with respect to evidence of or derived from indoor releases offered for the purpose of proving an ambient air release in violation of c a.indoor air order at.the district court held that i ndoor sampling performed by epa in the course of its cercla activities,and testimony based upon this sampling,is not relevant under.to whether defendants committed a release in violation of the clean air act,and is not admissible for the purpose of proving such a release.id.at.the court stated that,under federal rules of evidence,e vidence derived from epa testing and sample collection performed as part of its cercla analysis has the potential to be highly confusing and prejudicial,id.at,and barred the evidence for most purposes related to the clean air act counts.however,the court held that the evidence had probative value with respect to defendants knowledge of the dangerousness of the asbestos contaminated vermiculite,id.at,relevant to the government argument that defendants knowingly place d another person in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury,c a,by releasing vermiculite into the community.in addition,the district court held the evidence relevant to the defrauding object of count i conspiracy charge and to the four counts of obstruction of justice in the superseding indictment.the district court thus denied the motion with respect to establishing knowledge of risk for the clean air act charges and with respect to proving the obstruction and conspiracy counts.the government appeals the exclusion of the indoor air studies and expert testimony based upon them with regard to the knowing endangerment counts.
ii.analysis 
the government argues that epa phase ii tests show the propensity of the libby asbestos to release fibers whenever it was disturbed and regardless of the form the vermiculite took and therefore should be admitted to form the basis of expert testimony.the government also makes an argument that the indoor air studies should themselves be admitted as relevant.however,although the government makes a valid argument about the friability of libby asbestos being the same whether indoors or outdoors,the probative value of the epa studies is possibly outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.first,the studies overall probative value is low because they largely concern the asbestos releases at various indoor locations in grace libby mining and milling operation.there is some information in the studies regarding the friable character of libby asbestos,but not much.there is a risk of unfair prejudice because the indoor releases may not reflect the level of releases into the ambient air,and there is some language in the studies regarding diseases in libby that may mislead or confuse the jury into believing that releases into indoor air proves releases into ambient air.finally,even if this court disagreed with the district court rule balancing,a n appellate court will not reengage in a balancing of the probative value and prejudicial effect.rogers raymark industries,cir.the district court decision to bar the use of documents and studies derived from indoor air releases for the purpose of proving a release into the ambient air was within its discretion.
it is a separate question,however,whether the district court abused its discretion in excluding expert testimony based on documents and studies derived from indoor air releases.the district court did not conduct an inquiry under rule or in its august order.rule provides,if of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject,the facts or data need not be admissible in evidence in order for the opinion or inference to be admitted.emphasis added.the government persuasively argues that the proper remedy for the problems associated with the indoor air studies is to prevent an expert from disclosing the prejudicial facts instead of preventing the expert from relying on them altogether.allowing expert testimony based on the epa studies will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue under rule because the studies may show the propensity of the vermiculite to release asbestos fibers into the ambient air.while the specific asbestos concentration levels discussed in the studies are not relevant because the studies largely measured indoor air releases and gathered data under conditions different from the ambient air releases relevant to the statute,the government experts should be permitted to opine generally about the friability of libby asbestos based in part on the data in the studies.the data from the indoor sampling is relevant to the propensity of libby asbestos to release fibers upon disturbance.based on these data,an expert could testify about friability and whether a release of asbestos would occur if vermiculite were exposed or disturbed.because the district court did not inquire into whether the data provided by the indoor air tests is of the type reasonably relied upon by experts in the field,see,or whether the data fits under rule,we remand so that the district court can conduct these inquiries in the first instance.
grace historic product testing 
background 
on may,defendants filed a motion in limine to exclude expert opinions regarding grace historical,air product and commercial testing.defendants sought to exclude the testimony of richard lemen vernon rose paul peronard aubrey miller chris weis and other government witnesses who might attempt to draw unsupportable correlations between grace historical product and commercial tests and expected ambient air exposures from disturbances of vermiculite materials found in the town of libby.defs mot.in limine re historic testing at docket.on august,the district court granted defendants motion to exclude expert testimony based on historic testing offered to prove a release in violation of c a.historic testing order at.the district court denied defendants motion with respect to expert testimony based on historic testing offered for the purpose of showing defendants knowledge of the dangerousness of the asbestos contaminated vermiculite.id.
ii.analysis 
rule authorizes expert testimony that will assist the trier of fact when the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data,the testimony is produced through reliable principles and methods,and the expert witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.generally,an inquiry under rule examines the expert testimony as a whole.the inquiry typically does not examine the reliability or relevance of particular data sets that underlie the expert testimony,although this approach does no harm where the expert testifies on only one study or where no combination or addition of data could make the data in question a proper,reliable basis for making a given claim.in contrast to rule holistic focus on an expert testimony,rule governs the inquiry into the reliability of particular data underlying expert testimony.see also claar burlington northern,cir.
here,the district court excluded the historic testing data under rule.this approach creates the problem that one can not know fully whether or in what ways other information sources are meant to,in combination with the challenged data sources,form the premise for the expert testimony.each document must be dispositive under the district court approach,a requirement we do not impose under rule.on remand,the district court shall conduct the rule analysis in light of the expert reasoning and methodology as a whole.
faced with this new analysis,defendants presumably will argue,as they do on appeal,that the historic testing evidence fails the fit test under daubert merrell dow,d in response,the government argues that its experts do not plan to rely on the historic testing data to estimate the fiber concentrations from the charged releases,but only to opine generally on the hazardous characteristics of libby asbestos contaminated vermiculite.this limited use of the study to inform experts opinions is permissible,because the propensity of libby asbestos to release fibers fits the release element of the knowing endangerment provision.the district court did not consider this inquiry,thus abusing its discretion by excluding this evidence under.
defendants make two additional,ultimately unsupportable arguments.first,they argue that the testimony exclusion under rule was proper because the government experts do not need the evidence on historic air releases to testify about the friability of libby asbestos.this argument misconceives rule inquiry,which focuses on fitness,relevance,and reliability,not on whether an expert potentially has other evidence on which to base an opinion.second,defendants argue that the district court properly excluded the testimony under rule in addition to rule.contrary to defendants assertion,however,the district court did not rely on rule in its historic testing order but discussed the admissibility of expert testimony only under rule.moreover,an expert reasonably may rely on inadmissible evidence in forming an opinion or delivering testimony.see.
the question remains whether data concerning indoor air quality are of the type reasonably relied on by other experts in the field.see.although it appears that the district court never conducted this inquiry,the second step of the rule the study was the product of reliable principles and methods presumably answers this question in the affirmative.see rule see also claar,at rule merely relaxes,for experts,the requirement that witnesses have personal knowledge of the matter to which they testify,not whether the requirements of are properly met.although not stated explicitly,the order implicitly fo
