background 
in december rockwell international rockwell merged with a subsidiary of the boeing company and changed its name to boeing north american.before the merger,rockwell was a large defense and aerospace contractor.among the many contracts rockwell had with the federal government was contract no.contract,awarded by the united states air force to rockwell on march,for inertial measurement units for use in missiles.contract included both firm and line items,and had a total value of over million.
the allowability of costs generally,and of selected costs in particular,is covered by subpart of the federal acquisition regulations far contract explicitly incorporated by reference numerous far provisions,including far.that provision provided,inter alia,for reimbursement of costs determined to be allowable by the contracting officer in accordance with subpart of the federal acquisition regulation s rockwell sought reimbursement of its legal defense costs incurred in the defense of a shareholder derivative action and of the plaintiffs legal costs that rockwell paid.the government urged that the costs were not allowable.the background of the dispute is as follows.
in june four rockwell shareholders filed a shareholder derivative complaint in los angeles county superior court.citron beall,no,filed june,citron.the suit was brought against fourteen directors of the corporation some of whom were also officers and unidentified john does who were officers,directors and other members of management and employees,who were involved in the wrongdoing complained of.the gravamen of the complaint was that the defendants knowingly,recklessly,or culpably breached their fiduciary duties to the c orporation by failing to establish internal controls sufficient to insure that the c orporation business was carried on in a lawful manner on this appeal,the parties agree that the five instances of underlying misconduct alleged in the citron suit were as follows.
first,the government brought a civil suit under the false claims act,alleging that rockwell fraudulently mischarged the government for work performed on a space shuttle contract in.in,rockwell entered a consent decree to settle the suit,under which it agreed to pay a fine and to take corrective action to ensure that rockwell would not make false claims or conspire to defraud the government in the future.second,the government brought criminal charges against rockwell for making false statements under in connection with work performed under a government contract in.rockwell pled guilty to this charge and was fined million.third,the government alleged that rockwell had engaged in defective pricing related to a global positioning system subcontract.a grand jury indicted rockwell and two rockwell employees,charging them with fraud,mail fraud,and willfully making false statements.rockwell pled guilty to two counts of the indictment under a plea agreement and was fined million.fourth,a civil qui tam lawsuit was filed against rockwell on behalf of the government under the false claims act,charging the company with permitting employees to use government assets for personal gain in.in addition to the qui tam suit,the government convened a grand jury but decided not to prosecute rockwell.the civil suit apparently was also dismissed.fifth,rockwell was the subject of a department of justice investigation of alleged illegal hazardous waste dumping and other environmental law violations between and.in march,after settlement of the citron lawsuit,rockwell pled guilty to four felony violations of the resource conservation and recovery act,one felony and five misdemeanor violations of the clean water act,and agreed to pay a criminal fine of million.
rockwell responded to the citron complaint by retaining counsel to represent the corporation in the suit and by hiring separate counsel to represent the director defendants named in the complaint,as required by rockwell.rockwell also formed a special litigation committee slc composed of three members of rockwell board of directors who were not named as defendants in the complaint to investigate and report on the citron allegations.the slc also hired separate legal counsel to assist in the investigation and provide independent legal advice.in july the slc prepared a report summarizing its conclusion that the citron lawsuit was not reasonably likely to succeed and would be disruptive to rockwell ongoing businesses and that prosecution of the suit was not in the best interest of rockwell or its shareholders.the slc report recommended that rockwell counsel take steps to obtain a dismissal in favor of all defendants.
defendants moved for summary judgment and submitted the slc report in support of their motion.the court denied the summary judgment motion on july,because it was not satisfied that there is no triable issue as to any material fact,as to the good faith,the independence and the quality and character of the investigation of the special litigation committee order at.in denying defendant motion,the court stated it would appear that,were this a trial,defendants would prevail on the present state of the record though plaintiffs counsel will quickly note that the proceeding s so far have hamstrung their discovery efforts.id.at.
subsequently,on october,rockwell and the citron plaintiffs entered into a settlement agreement.in that agreement,the rockwell defendants vigorously den ied all liability with respect to any and all of the purported facts or claims alleged in the complaint settlement agreement at.pursuant to the agreement,rockwell agreed to maintain an audit committee that would,for at least three years,meet at least annually with rockwell vice president of contracts,pricing subcontracts to review policies and procedures and training programs designed to effect compliance with the laws and regulations applicable to federal government contracts.id.at.also pursuant to the agreement,rockwell agreed to pay plaintiffs attorneys fees of up to million.on october,the court dismissed the citron action with prejudice based on the settlement between the parties.the dismissal order,drafted by the parties and approved by the court,dismissed the complaint on the merits,released the defendants from liability for all claims that were,or might have been,asserted in the lawsuit,and awarded plaintiffs million in legal fees and costs.the dismissal order additionally required rockwell to indemnify the defendant directors against any expenses and legal fees incurred in connection with the lawsuit to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable delaware law under delaware law,a corporation has the power to indemnify a if the director acted in good faith and in a manner the director reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation.a b.
in total,between and,rockwell incurred approximately of legal fees and costs associated with the citron action,including costs incurred for representing rockwell,for representing the director defendants,for legal counsel to the slc,and for reimbursement of the plaintiffs legal fees and costs.rockwell included these costs as general and administrative g a costs in its home office overhead for fiscal years,and,and it claimed reimbursement for a portion of the costs under its various contracts with the government.rockwell allocated of these costs to its and government work and of the costs to its commercial and work.rockwell subsequently submitted a certified claim for to the contracting officer based upon the share of the citron costs included in the g a expenses allocated to contract.the parties agreed to treat this as a test case and stipulated that the board decision regarding the allowability of these costs to contract would govern the allowability for all relevant contracts.
on may,the contracting officer issued a final decision disallowing the costs rockwell claimed.final decision.the contracting officer concluded that the costs were unreasonable under far and therefore unallowable,because rockwell violated its responsibilities to the government and the public at large.final decision at quoting far b.the contracting officer additionally disallowed the costs,pursuant to far c,which provides that allowability of costs not specifically addressed by the far is to be based on the principles of the far and the treatment of similar or related items that are specifically addressed under the far.the contracting officer found rockwell legal costs to be similar or related to the costs incurred in connection with or related to mischarging of costs on government contracts,which are expressly unallowable under far,and similar or related to costs for the unsuccessful defense of fraud charges,which are expressly unallowable under far.final decision at.
rockwell appealed the contracting officer final decision to the armed services board of contract appeals.the parties elected to submit the appeal on the record without a hearing.in its appeal to the board,boeing,as rockwell,argued that rockwell costs were allowable because i the costs were ordinary,necessary,and allowable professional services costs under far b ii the costs were reasonable in relation to the services rendered,pursuant to far and b iii the costs were allocable to the contract because they conferred benefit to the contract,in accordance with far and iv the costs were not limited or disallowed by any far cost principles.boeing north american,slip op.at.
while the appeal was pending,this court decided caldera northrop worldwide aircraft services,and the board required supplemental briefing concerning the impact of that case.in northrop,we addressed the question whether certain legal costs were allowable costs,at,when the costs related to the defense of an action charging that the contractor wrongfully terminated several employees because the employees refused to participate in fraud against the united states.in that action,a state court found that the employees had been wrongfully terminated because they refused to commit fraud against the government.id.at.the majority of our opinion was directed to the question whether the state court had determined that northrop committed fraud and,if so,whether that determination should be given collateral estoppel effect in northrop suit to recover its legal defense costs.in a brief portion of our opinion,we concluded that recovery of the contractor legal costs was not allowable because those costs were not allocable.id.at.they were not allocable under far because the government did not benefit from the contractor defense of the state court lawsuit id.at.
the board denied boeing appeal in this case based on northrop because there could be no benefit to the government in a contractor defense of a third party lawsuit in which the contractor prior violations of federal laws and regulations were an integral element of the third party allegations.boeing north american,slip op.at.the board reasoned that but for rockwell wrongdoing the citron suit would not have been brought,and the costs would not have been incurred.
this timely appeal followed.we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to a.
discussion 
board findings of fact will be set aside if arbitrary,or capricious,or so grossly erroneous as to necessarily imply bad faith,or if not supported by substantial evidence.b.legal determinations of the board are reviewed without deference.id.
at the outset it is necessary to distinguish,as we have in other contexts between the concepts of cost allocability and cost allowability under the far.the issue here is one of allowability.
allocability is an accounting concept involving the relationship between incurred costs and the activities or cost objectives,contracts to which those costs are charged.proper allocation of costs by a contractor is important because it may be necessary for the contractor to allocate costs among several government contracts or between government and activities.
the concept of cost allowability concerns whether a particular cost can be recovered from the government in whole or in part.cost allocability here is to be determined under the cost accounting standards cas,parts,allowability of a cost is governed by the far regulations,the cost principles expressed in part of the far and pertinent agency supplements.
although a cost may be allocable to a contract,the cost is not necessarily allowable.we have agreed with the general proposition that costs may be assignable and allocable under cas,but not allowable under far.united states boeing,and the far makes clear that w hile the total cost of a contract includes all costs properly allocable to the contract,the allowable costs to the government are limited to those allocable costs which are allowable pursuant to far part and applicable agency supplements.far b.
to be sure,the far sometimes seems to blur the distinction between allowability and allocability and to suggest that allowability depends upon allocability.for example,when determining cost allowability under far subpart,the allocability of the cost is a factor to consider,along with reasonableness of the cost,relevant standards promulgated by the cas board,terms in the contract at issue,and any limitations set forth in far subpart.far a but this provision merely codifies the general principle that a cost is not allowable if the cost can not be allocated to a government contract.for example,a contractor cost of certain materials,nuts and bolts may be allowable when the materials are used to perform a government contract and the costs therefore can be allocated to the contract,but not when the materials are used to perform a contract with a private party.thus,cost allowability may turn on whether the cost is allocable.on the other hand,even when a cost is allocable,it is not necessarily allowable.for example,a contractor cost of materials,nuts and bolts used to perform a government contract may be allocable to the contract,but the cost may be unallowable if it is unreasonable,if the contractor overcharges the government for the materials.see far.
in summary,the concept of allocability is addressed to the question whether a sufficient nexus exists between the cost and a government contract.lockheed aircraft united states.the concept of allowability is addressed to the question whether a particular item of cost should be recoverable as a matter of public policy.rice,at.
boeing argues that the decision below confused the concepts of allocability and allowability,and that,when these concepts are properly distinguished,rockwell legal defense costs must be both allocable and allowable.the costs are argued to be allocable because they are part of g boeing urges that under the far no benefit to the government need be shown for a cost to be allocable,even if a nexus to a particular contract is necessary for a cost to be allocable.when properly viewed under allowability principles,boeing argues,rockwell costs are also allowable under far,because that regulation generally provides that costs for professional services are allowable,with certain specific exceptions contained in subsection c according to boeing,none of the exceptions of far c is relevant here,so the costs must be allowable.
this panel is,of course,bound by our decision in northrop,see mahurkar,and we reaffirm here our holding in northrop that a contractor legal costs are unallowable when incurred in the unsuccessful defense of a lawsuit that involved a judicial determination that the contractor sought to induce its employees to commit fraud against the government by the contractor.the question is whether we are also bound by the court conclusion that the costs were not allocable because they did not benefit the government.in northrop,we reasoned that 
the army argues that the cost is allocable only if there is some benefit to the government for incurring the cost.it is established that the contractor must show a benefit to government work from an expenditure of a cost that it claims is necessary to the overall operation of the contractor business.see fmc united states,lockheed aircraft united states.the board erred in failing to make a determination of whether or not northrop defense of the oklahoma lawsuit benefited the government.we can discern no benefit to the government in a contractor defense of a wrongful termination lawsuit in which the contractor is found to have retaliated against the employees for the employees refusal to defraud the government.
in northrop,the government urged in its brief to this court that w here the costs arise from the defense of wrongful conduct involving fraud upon the government,there is no reasonable benefit to the government,and the legal costs are not allocable to the contract.appellant br.at,northrop,at.however,the allocability issue was not contested in northrop.the contractor did not address the issue of allocability and simply argued that the state court judgment was not collateral estoppel,and that the costs were allowable because it was reasonable for northrop to defend the suit based on the available evidence.appellee br.at,northrop,at.most significantly,neither party in northrop addressed the provisions of the cas promulgated by the cas board,which by statute has exclusive authority to make,promulgate,amend,and rescind cost accounting standards governing allocation of costs to contracts with the united states.f.nor was cas discussed in our opinion.under our established precedent we are not bound by northrop on the issue of allocability under the cas standards since the cas issue was neither argued nor discussed in our opinion.see,united states county of cook,illinois,cable television ass n,am.cinema editors,see also brecht abrahamson,d reaffirming longstanding rule that if a decision does not squarely address an issue,a court remains free to address the issue on the merits in a subsequent case agro,dekalb genetics,en banc holding that our earlier decision in heidelberg harris,loebach,was not binding on the panel because of unique circumstances in that case,and the parties not having contested the issue.we must accordingly decide whether the cas renders these legal expenses allocable.we conclude that it does.
the cas grew out of criticism of accounting and pricing practices of the defense industry in the,which led to an extension to the defense production act of that called for the general accounting office gao to determine the feasibility of applying uniform cost accounting standards to be used in all negotiated prime contract and subcontract defense procurements of or more,stat.after the gao determined that it would be feasible to establish and apply such uniform cost accounting standards,the cas board was established by congress in,stat.in,congress decided not to continue to fund the board,and it was dissolved.however,in,the office of federal procurement policy act amendments of,stat,established an office of federal procurement policy and established a new permanent and independent cas board within the office of federal procurement policy.to achieve uniformity in government contracting costs,the new board was given exclusive authority to make,promulgate,amend,and rescind cost accounting standards.f.
the cost accounting standards promulgated by the cas board are designed to achieve uniformity and consistency in allocating costs to government contracts.rice,at.boeing urges,and the government does not dispute,that cas parts and require g a expenses,such as those at issue here,to be allocated to all of the contractor final cost objectives.the cas board adopted this full costing allocation standard when it promulgated cas part,and the board explained the concept of full costing in the preamble to the section 
the standard being promulgated today is based on the concept of of final cost objectives.for government contracting purposes,both direct and indirect costs,including g a expenses are allocable the board has concluded that there is a beneficial or causal relationship between g a expenses and all of the final cost objectives of a cost accounting period.therefore,these costs are allocable to such final cost objectives.
cas part,preamble a,at.
even where costs are unallowable,cas part prescribes standards governing the identification and accounting treatment of such unallowable costs.the cas part standards are predicated on the proposition that costs incurred in carrying on the activities of an of the allowability of such costs under government allocable to the cost objectives with which they are identified on the basis of their beneficial or causal relationships.cas a.in its prefatory comments to cas part,the cas board stated that 
recognition of the costs accounting concept that all costs incurred in carrying on the activities of an enterprise are allocable to the cost objectives of the enterprise is essential to the maintenance of sound and consistent contract cost accounting.
we have specifically held that,if there is any conflict between the cas and the far as to an issue of allocability,the cas governs.united states boeing,rice,at.here the cas clearly renders rockwell legal defense costs allocable as part of g a expenses.
our earlier decisions in lockheed,at,and fmc united states,relied on by the government as authority for the benefit to the government theory,do not supply any support for a rule that would base the allocability of a cost on the cost benefit to the government as opposed to its nexus to government work.in lockheed,the contractor sought to allocate a portion of its personal property taxes that were assessed with respect to commercial productive material used for government contracts.our predecessor court held that the costs were allocable to the government contracts because payment of the taxes was necessary to the overall operation of the contractor business.lockheed,at.our predecessor court described the nexus required to show allocability,stating 
the criterion in the aspr now the far for allocating indirect costs is benefit.this is explicit in paragraph b of far,and implicit in paragraph c.it is a kind of common sense approach to allocation.no one would quarrel with the general proposition that it is fair to allocate to government contracts the costs of services which facilitate performance of the particular contracts or are essential to the existence and continuance of the business entity.but the burden will be on the contractor to show the benefit and a reasonable allocation among different government contracts and between government and commercial work generally.
in fmc,the contractor had sued another government contractor,alleging breach of a contract to provide parts for a system for use in the government trident submarines.the parties settled the dispute after their work on the trident submarines was completed.fmc sought to allocate its legal costs incurred in connection with the dispute to other government contracts,as part of g a costs,unrelated to its trident submarine contract because the trident contract had already been completed.we affirmed the board holding that these costs could not be allocated to the trident contracts.we found that the alleged financial benefit to other government contracts from the trident settlement was too remote and insubstantial to justify allocation to other contracts of the trident legal fees as a g a expense.fmc,at.despite fmc use of the phrase benefit to the government,id.at,it is clear that fmc interpreted the pertinent far allocability regulation to require that a contractor show a benefit from the expenditure to government work,id.at.thus,fmc made clear that benefit was a concept requiring a contractor to show a nexus between the contractor cost and the contractor government work in order to allocate the cost to a government contract.see also dynalectron united states,holding,in a case decided before the adoption of the cas,that a contractor legal defense costs incurred in an action charging breach of a commercial contract were not allocable to government contracts because the contractor failed to show that the legal fees had any relationship whatever to the government contracts or their performance.neither lockheed nor fmc considered whether,as a matter of policy,the costs were allocable.
thus,we agree with boeing that allocability is an accounting concept and that cas does not require that a cost directly benefit the government interests for the cost to be allocable.the word benefit is used in the allocability provisions to describe the nexus required for accounting purposes between the cost and the contract to which it is allocated.the requirement of a benefit to a government contract is not designed to permit contracting officers,the board,or this court to embark on an amorphous inquiry into whether a particular cost sufficiently benefits the government so that the cost should be recoverable from the government.the question whether a cost should be recoverable as a matter of policy is to be undertaken by applying the specific allowability regulations,which embody the government view,as a matter of policy,as to whether the contractor may permissibly charge particular costs to the government if they are otherwise allocable.
our view that the question here is one of allowability is confirmed by the government brief in this very case that ultimately treats the issue as one of allowability and by the government efforts which we discuss below to amend the far to specifically deal with the allowability of costs such as those involved here.
we turn then to the question whether these legal expenses are allowable.boeing conclusion that the costs are allowable rests on a fundamentally flawed the only professional service costs that are not allowable under far are those costs that are specifically disallowed under another far provision.
subpart of the far pertains to cost principles and procedures governing contracts with commercial organizations.far outlines the general principles of the subpart.far explains that 
t he factors to consider in determining whether a cost is allowable include the following reasonableness allocability standards promulgated by the cas board,if applicable otherwise generally accepted accounting principles and practices appropriate to the particular circumstances terms of the contract and any limitations set forth in this subpart.
far c explains how to apply the principles and procedures,and far contains over fifty subsections,each of which covers,in detail,the allowability of particular selected costs.
although the far subsections covering selected costs are extensive,far makes clear that s ection does not cover every element of cost.failure to include any item of cost does not imply that it is either allowable or unallowable.in such situations,far c instructs us the determination of allowability shall be based on the principles and standards in this subpart and the treatment of similar or related selected items.far c emphasis added.although neither boeing,its amicus,nor the government cites far c in its briefs,the contracting officer relied on that provision here in disallowing the costs.
this court has not previously interpreted far c,but the board has applied this regulation,or its predecessor in the defense acquisition regulations or the armed services procurement regulations on several occasions in the past.in stanford university,asbca,bca,wl,stanford sought to recover costs,including the cost of legal counsel,related to the issuance of a state bond,proceeds of which were used to finance the expansion of stanford computer facilities.the parties did not dispute the benefit of the expanded computer facilities to the government contract,but contested the allowability of the costs related to the bond issuance.the board concluded that bond issuance costs were not specifically mentioned in the allowability regulations.the board,however,noted that under the regulations in effect at the time,failure to mention a particular item of cost in the standards is not intended to imply that it is either allowable or unallowable rather,determination as to allowability in each case should be based on the treatment or standards provided for similar or related items of cost.id.the board held that the costs were unallowable because they were similar or related to i nterest on borrowed capital,which was a cost specifically disallowed under the regulations,because both bond issuance costs and interest are incurred to secure borrowed capital.id.other decisions of the board have also applied far c or one of its predecessors and found that costs were allowable because the costs were similar to costs allowed under other provisions.see dynamics,asbca,bca,wl,although the regulations did not explicitly cover allowability of costs associated with launching and rollout flights of a new aircraft,analyzing the allowability of those costs by considering whether they were similar to costs of advertising and sales promotion covered under dar or similar to costs of entertainment or lobbying covered under dar grumman aerospace,asbca,bca,wl,holding that dividends paid to a contractor employees on restricted stock were allowable,even though not explicitly covered by the regulations,because those costs were more similar or related to allowable cash compensation or stock bonuses than to unallowable distributions of profit,vacated on other grounds,boeing,asbca bca,wl,holding the cost of stock appreciation rights sar were allowable because sars were more similar or related to allowable cash or stock bonuses,than to unallowable stock options.
the principle announced in far c supports the allowability holding of northrop.as discussed above,in northrop we addressed the question whether legal defense costs in an action charging that the contractor wrongfully terminated several employees because the employees refused to participate in fraud against the united states were allowable costs.despite the existence of detailed regulations providing that professional service costs were allowable and that certain categories of legal expenses were not allowable,the regulations did not explicitly govern the allowability of the costs in the northrop situation.the far,however,dealt with closely comparable categories of selected costs.statutes and the far regulations broadly disallowed legal defense costs in suits brought by the federal and state governments involv ing an allegation of fraud or similar misconduct by the contractor.see far b and b the regulations also disallowed costs of unsuccessfully defending suits brought under certain federal laws by a private party.for example,far f disallowed legal costs for the d efense of suits brought by employees or of the contractor under section of the major fraud act of where the contractor was found liable and far c disallowed costs incurred when defending any proceeding brought by a third party under the false claims act in which the united states did not intervene,if the contractor was found liable.
properly understood,northrop and far taken together establish a simple the costs of unsuccessfully defending a private suit charging contractor wrongdoing are not allowable if the similar costs would be disallowed under the regulations.the present case is,however,distinguishable from the situation involved in northrop.here the costs of defending the citron lawsuit would not be,as in northrop,similar to disallowed costs.the regulations disallowing particular items of cost do not address costs similar to the costs of defending a contractor directors from charges that they tolerated inadequate controls concerning possible fraud or similar misconduct.however,we must also consider whether those costs are related to a category of disallowed costs,that is,costs of defending against government charges of contractor wrongdoing 
we think it unlikely that the related test under far c was designed to make a particular cost item unallowable sim
