through a series of agreements,plaintiff henkel corporation henkel acquired the metallic chemical product line of amchem products,amchem and assumed all related liabilities.the question here is whether henkel also acquired the benefits of the insurance policies issued by defendants to amchem to cover lawsuits based on injuries sustained during the policy period.
finding no specific language in the agreements assigning policies or policy benefits to henkel or its predecessor,and no document in which defendant insurers consented to any assignment,the trial court entered summary judgment for defendants.the court of appeal reversed.it reasoned that in the absence of explicit language disclaiming any assignment,the right to insurance benefits passed to henkel as a matter of law without need for consent from the insurers.
we conclude that under the circumstances of this case any assignment of benefits does require the consent of the insurers,and therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeal.
summary of the corporate transactions 
amchem,a pennsylvania corporation,had two distinct product lines agricultural chemicals and metallic chemicals.the metallic chemicals,which help paint adhere to metal,were sold to car and airplane manufacturers,including lockheed.defendants insured both of amchem product lines.
in,union carbide corporation acquired amchem by stock purchase and merger.in,amchem,now a union carbide subsidiary,created a new corporation,also known as amchem products,but a delaware corporation amchem.by resolution of its board of directors,amchem transferred all of its right,title and interest in and to its domestic assets utilized in its metalworking business to amchem no the board of directors of newly created amchem accepted the transfer from amchem of the assets,liabilities and goodwill utilized in its metalworking chemical activities.this transaction was a contract the resolution of amchem board of directors was an offer see dow river farms d,hoge lava cap gold mining d,and the resolution of amchem board of directors explicitly accepted that offer.although the contract referred to assets and liabilities,it did not specify what assets were transferred to amchem,or what liabilities were assumed.
after the contract,amchem agricultural products and amchem metallic chemicals were separate subsidiaries of union carbide.in,however,union carbide sold all of the stock of amchem to plaintiff henkel.by acquiring the stock of amchem,henkel acquired all of its assets and liabilities.after henkel purchased amchem,these two corporations merged.in,union carbide sold amchem to rhone poulenc,these two companies merged in.thus,it is undisputed that henkel has succeeded to all of the rights and obligations of amchem,and rhone poulenc now known as aventis cropscience usa,has succeeded to all of the rights and obligations of amchem.
ii.background of this litigation 
in,current and former lockheed employees filed suit against henkel and amchem products,without distinguishing between amchem in a rhone poulenc subsidiary and amchem which by had merged into henkel.the suit alleged injuries arising from exposure to metallic chemicals during the period between and.henkel tendered its defense to defendant insurers,whose policies had insured amchem during portions of this period,and to henkel own insurers.all refused coverage.
in,the lockheed plaintiffs served their complaint on rhone poulenc,named as amchem products,rhone poulenc moved to quash service.the lockheed plaintiffs stipulated to the trial court granting rhone poulenc motion to quash.the stipulation states that the lockheed plaintiffs have been presented with documents establishing that henkel corporation is answerable for the liabilities of amchem products,alleged in the lockheed consolidated cases.accordingly,plaintiffs have no interest in asserting their claims against rhone poulenc.
in,henkel settled its suit with the lockheed plaintiffs for million.defendants refused to contribute to the settlement.henkel then filed this action for declaratory relief against defendants and henkel own insurers.defendants had rhone poulenc added as a necessary party.
in,plaintiff henkel,defendants,and rhone poulenc each filed motions for summary judgment.because defendants had issued their insurance policies to amchem no longer existed as an independent trial court first concern was to decide which party represented amchem.the trial court ruled that rhone poulenc,not henkel,was the corporate successor of amchem and was therefore the entity entitled to the protection of the liability policies defendant insurers had issued to amchem.
amchem had assumed all the liabilities of amchem relating to the metallic chemical product line.plaintiff henkel then purchased all the stock of amchem,which made henkel responsible for all amchem liabilities,including those inherited from amchem.henkel therefore argued in the trial court that even though it was not the corporate successor to amchem,because it was responsible for amchem liabilities relating to metallic chemicals as a matter of law,it should be entitled to the benefits of amchem liability insurance.
the trial court rejected henkel argument.it found henkel responsible for amchem torts,not as a matter of law,but because henkel had voluntarily assumed that liability.the trial court also rejected henkel contention that the contract,under which amchem acquired the assets and liabilities of amchem metallic chemical business,assigned to amchem the benefits of insurance coverage for those liabilities.moreover,the court ruled that any such assignment would be void without defendant insurers consent.the trial court therefore entered summary judgment against henkel.
the court of appeal reversed.quoting northern ins.of new york allied mut.ins.cir,northern insurance,it held the right to indemnity followed the liability rather than the policy itself.as a result,even though the parties did not assign the predecessor insurance policy in the agreement,the right to indemnity under the policy transferred to the successor corporation by operation of law.italics omitted.we granted petitions for review by rhone poulenc and defendants.
iii.henkel liability for injuries caused by amchem arises from contract and was not imposed by operation of law 
plaintiff henkel here renews the argument made in the trial court that when it bought the metallic chemical product business amchem from union carbide in it incurred liability as a matter of law for injuries caused by those products when they were being manufactured and distributed by amchem.because liability was imposed upon it as a matter of law,henkel argues it should receive the benefits of amchem liability polices as a matter of law.see northern insurance,supra,at.defendant insurers contend that the ninth circuit court of appeals decision in northern insurance was wrong,and that later california cases show that under california law product line tort liability does not include any right to the insurance coverage for the tort.see general accident ins.superior court th,d general accident quemetco pacific automobile ins.th,d quemetco.we need not resolve this conflict,because the record shows that henkel liability was not imposed involuntarily by law but assumed voluntarily by contract.
henkel argument why it should be entitled to amchem insurance protection as a matter of law depends on a showing that henkel tort liability was imposed upon it by law.henkel has failed to make that showing.as we explain,there are three situations in which a buyer of corporate assets may be liable for the torts of its predecessor,notwithstanding the purchaser failure to assume liability by contract,but henkel does not show that this case falls within any of these categories.
first,the buyer of corporate assets may be liable as a corporate successor if the transaction amounts to a consolidation or merger of the two corporations,the purchasing corporation is a mere continuation of the seller,or the transfer of assets to the purchaser is for the fraudulent purpose of escaping liability for the seller debts.ray alad cal d,beatrice state bd.of equalization cal th,d.none of these circumstances is present here amchem did not acquire amchem metallic chemical business by consolidation or merger.amchem was not a mere continuation of amchem,because that doctrine does not apply when recourse to the debtor corporation is available and the two corporations have separate identities.beatrice state bd.of equalization,supra,cal th at,d.and there is no evidence that amchem sold its metallic chemical business to amchem to defraud its creditors.
second,a company that acquires another company product line may be liable for injuries caused by its predecessor defective products,if certain conditions are met.one condition is the virtual destruction of the plaintiff remedies against the original manufacturer caused by the successor acquisition of the business.ray alad,supra,cal d at.that condition is not met here,because amchem continued to exist after its sale of the metallic chemical business to amchem.rhone poulenc,as the corporate successor of amchem,can respond in damages to any product defects suit based on toxic exposure occurring before the creation of amchem.moreover,even if amchem had dissolved after it transferred its metallic chemical operation to amchem,it could still be sued to permit a plaintiff to assert a claim against amchem liability policies.penasquitos,superior court cal d.and there are no grounds for claiming that amchem was destroyed by the sale of its metallic chemical business to amchem.see chaknova th,d.
third,some statutes,notably the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act et cercla,impose liability upon successor corporations without regard to contract.smithkline beecham rohm and haas cir.no such statute applies to this case.
thus,henkel,the buyer of amchem,is not liable by operation of law for injuries caused by defective products marketed by amchem.amchem,however,assumed by contract the liabilities of amchem relating to the metallic chemical business.when henkel later bought all the stock of amchem,that transaction did not change the status of amchem as a legal entity,so amchem continued to be responsible for those liabilities.the later merger of henkel and amchem left henkel,as the surviving corporation,responsible for the liabilities of amchem,and through it those of amchem relating to the metallic chemical product line.
amchem also acquired the assets of amchem relating to the metallic chemical business,and it continued to own those assets after henkel acquired all of amchem stock.see national american ins.jamison agency,cir.henkel later acquired the assets of amchem by merger.henkel rights to any insurance policy benefits,therefore,are those of amchem,and depend on the terms of the contract by which amchem acquired the assets of amchem.
three court of appeal decisions,although distinguishable from the case here on other grounds,confirm that the rights of a successor corporation in a case such as this depend upon contract.oliver machinery united states fid.guar.d.oliver involved the reverse situation in which the distributor for a predecessor sought to take advantage of its successor insurance policy.the court of appeal in that case rejected the argument that the insurance policy should be construed to make coverage coextensive with liability under ray alad,supra,cal d,applying established principles for construing insurance policies,it concluded that the policy did not cover the distributor claim.quemetco,supra,th,d,which involved liability under cercla,relied on oliver to hold that the right of a successor company to the benefits of its predecessor policy likewise turned on the interpretation of the contract.similarly,general accident,supra,th at page,d,which involved product line liability under ray alad,supra,cal d,agreed that the successor right to its predecessor insurance policy depended on contract.
plaintiff henkel questions here whether the court of appeal decisions in quemetco and general accident were correct insofar as they refused to allow a successor to claim rights under its predecessor liability policies even though liability had been imposed on the successor not through contract,but by operation of law.we perceive no conflict,however,in authority or principle over the rule that when liability is assumed by contract,the successor rights are defined and limited by that contract.
iv.any assignment of the benefits at issue is ineffective because the insurers did not consent 
whether or not amchem assigned any benefits under the liability policies to amchem,any such assignment would be invalid because it lacked the insurer consent.analysis of this issue must begin with the language of the policies themselves,and in this case there is no dispute that each of the policies contained clauses providing that there could be no a ssignment of interest under this policy without the insurer consent endorsed on the policy.such clauses are generally valid and enforceable.see bergson builders ins.cal,greco oregon mut.fire ins.d.
plaintiff henkel does not claim that any insurer has executed a consent to assignment,but argues on two grounds that under the circumstances here an assignment does not require insurer consent.the first ground,that coverage should follow liability when the liability is transferred by operation of law,fails because,as we explained earlier,henkel did not acquire the liabilities of amchem by operation of law,but assumed those liabilities by contract.henkel second ground for arguing that insurer consent is not required is that under an liability policy see montrose chemical admiral ins.cal th,d,policy benefits can be assigned without consent once the event giving rise to liability has occurred.
it is established that a provision in a contract or a rule of law against assignment does not preclude the assignment of money due or to become due under the contract citations or of money damages for the breach of the contract.trubowitch riverbank canning cal d.cases and commentators have applied this principle to the assignment of benefits under an insurance policy.see westoil terminals harbor ins.th,d quemetco,supra,th at,d greco oregon mut.fire ins,supra,d at.croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group.but even if we apply the principle to liability policies,it does not bar defendants from enforcing their restrictions on assignment in the case here.
in,when amchem assumed the liabilities of amchem,the duty of defendant insurers to defend and indemnify amchem from the claims of the lockheed plaintiffs had not become an assignable chose in action.those claims had not been reduced to a sum of money due or to become due under the policy.defendants had not breached any duty to defend or indemnify amchem,so amchem could not assign any cause of action for breach of such duty.comunale traders general ins.cal d,which upholds an assignment for wrongful failure to settle a claim.consequently,amchem could not assign the right to defense and indemnity against such claims without the insurers consent.
nonetheless,henkel contends we should permit assignment of claims such as those brought by the lockheed plaintiffs without insurer consent,because the assignment would not place an additional risk or burden on the insurer that it did not bargain to assume.according to henkel,in this case there is no additional risk because the injury occurred before the assignment and the assignment does not affect either liability or policy limits.northern insurance,supra,at.even assuming enforcement of the no consent clause requires a showing of additional burden or risk on the insurer,henkel can not prevail.an additional burden may arise whenever the predecessor corporation still exists or can be revived see penasquitos,superior court,supra,cal d,because of the ubiquitous potential for disputes over the existence and scope of the assignment.if both assignor and assignee were to claim the right to defense,the insurer might effectively be forced to undertake the burden of defending both parties.in view of the potential for such increased burdens,it is reasonable to uphold the insurer contractual right to accept or reject an assignment.
recognizing this problem,henkel argues that under the peculiar facts of this case the insurers face no such dual burden.henkel points out that when the lockheed plaintiffs lawsuit against rhone poulenc was dismissed,henkel,the buyer of amchem,was the only remaining entity facing potential liability for toxic injuries to lockheed employees caused by the metallic chemical products of amchem.
nevertheless,if the lockheed plaintiffs had refused to dismiss their suit against rhone poulenc,defendants would have faced the dilemma whether to defend rhone poulenc,henkel,or both.the lockheed plaintiffs decision to proceed only against henkel,the buyer of amchem,and not against both henkel and rhone poulenc,should not affect henkel right,if any,to the coverage benefits of amchem liability insurance policies.those rights arise from and were fixed by contract by which amchem acquired the metallic chemical business from amchem,the contract in which henkel acquired the metallic chemical business by purchasing amchem,and the insurance policies,including their no assignment those rights do not rise or fall on the tactical decisions of tort plaintiffs.
in sum,henkel does not demonstrate entitlement to the benefits of the liability policies at issue.this case is not analogous to those circumstances under which an assignment without the insurer consent has been upheld when at the time of the assignment the benefit has been reduced to a claim for money due or to become due,or when at the time of the assignment the insurer has breached a duty to the insured,and the assignment is of a cause of action to recover damages for that breach.the assignment in this case does not fall within either category.
henkel has not shown that it is entitled to reimbursement because it defended and settled a claim against amchem no.i 
plaintiff henkel argues that even if it did not acquire the insurance benefits at issue here by assignment,it is nevertheless entitled to reimbursement of defense and settlement costs connected to the lockheed litigation.henkel claims that having defended and settled the lockheed case on behalf of amchem products,it is entitled to the protection of the amchem products insurance coverage retained by union carbide.henkel argument confuses amchem and amchem.as the corporate successor of amchem,henkel could defend and settle on behalf of that entity,but such action would entitle it only to the policy benefits acquired by amchem.henkel is not the corporate successor to amchem,and therefore had no right to settle or defend a suit against amchem without the latter consent.
disposition 
the judgment of the court of appeal is reversed.
i dissent.the majority decision is contrary to law and provides an unfair windfall to insurers.the majority holding allows an insurer to avoid its obligations on hosts of existing claims by refusing to consent to an assignment of policy benefits if the insured business has been sold.that is not the law.instead,the rule is that the right to recover under a policy after a loss has occurred is an asset assignable separate from the policy itself.after a loss,the policy benefits can be assigned without insurer consent,the clause notwithstanding.greco oregon mut.fire ins.d.greco.
while the general rule regards liability and indemnity policies as personal contracts,assignment is valid following occurrence of the loss insured against and is then regarded as chose in action rather than transfer of actual policy.couch on insurance ed.this rule has been long recognized by courts of this state.over years ago,the court of appeal in greco stated that it is settled that the right to recover after loss has occurred is assignable without insurance company consent.greco,supra,d at,citing comunale traders general ins.cal d,it is well settled that a clause does not preclude the transfer of a cause of action for damages for breach of a contract.the holding in greco was reaffirmed more recently by the court of appeal in westoil terminals harbor ins.th,d westoil,which stated that greco allows for an exception to that rule that an insurer must consent to assignment where a loss has already occurred.see also university of judaism transamerica ins.d.
in addition,courts of other states have agreed that an insured can assign the right to recover for pretransfer injuries without the insurer consent,notwithstanding a clause.see,imperial enterprises,fireman fund ins.cir,the clause should not be applied ritualistically and mechanically to forfeit coverage in these circumstances ocean accident guar.southwestern.cir,diversified american motorists ins,even with an clause in an insurance policy,washington law recognizes an assignment of coverage for an event or activities preceding assignment gopher oil american hardware,when events giving rise to an insurer liability have already occurred,the insurer risk is not increased by a change in the insured identity.
the majority narrows this rule permitting assignment after the occurrence of a loss by stating that assignment is only valid when a claim against the policy has been reduced to a sum of money due or to become due under the policy,ante,d at,at.the majority concludes that the policy benefits at issue here had not become an assignable chose in action at the time of the transfer of the metallic chemicals business from amchem to amchem,and therefore the right to recover under the policy could not be assigned without the consent of the insurers.ibid.
it is unclear from what source the majority novel conclusion is derived.the majority cites the court of appeal decisions in westoil,supra,th at page,d,and greco,supra,d at page,for the proposition that benefits under an insurance policy can be assigned notwithstanding a contractual provision barring the assignment of such benefits.yet the majority ignores the actual rule articulated in these cases,that an insured can assign policy benefits once the loss insured against has occurred.
the majority abandonment of the general rule that assignment is valid following occurrence of the loss insured against and is then regarded as chose in action rather than transfer of actual policy seems predicated on a misconception of when a party has a chose in action.couch on insurance,supra.the majority equates a chose in action with a claim that has been reduced to a sum of money due or to become due.under the majority view,it seems that a party must file a claim,and this claim must result in a legal finding of liability,for a chose in action to lie.
a chose in action,however,is not necessarily a claim that has been reduced to a sum of money it is much broader.in california,a chose in action,also known as a thing in action,is statutorily defined as a right to recover money or other personal property by a judicial proceeding.see black law dict.ed defining chose in action as t he right to bring an action to recover a debt,money,or thing.a claim need not have been filed,or a judicial determination made,for there to be a chose in action.instead,only a right to recover need exist.see,krusi amoroso construction,th,d equating a chose in action with a right to bring a lawsuit.
as explained below,under the policies at issue in this case,a chose in action is established on the date of the injury,which is when the loss occurs.therefore,the policy benefits become assignable without the consent of the insurer on the date of the injury,not,as the majority contends,when a claim for this injury has been reduced to a sum of money due or to become due.
the insurance contracts at issue in this case are contracts.in montrose chemical admiral ins.cal th,d,montrose,we held that for insurance contracts,coverage is triggered by damage or injury occurring during the policy period.id.at,d.after coverage is triggered,the insurer owes a duty of defense and indemnification under the policy upon the assertion of such claims.it does not matter whether or not the claims are actually asserted during the policy period.so long as the event has occurred during the policy period,coverage is triggered,and a loss has occurred.
in continuous injury cases,such as here,the insured actions result in claims of continuing or progressively dete
