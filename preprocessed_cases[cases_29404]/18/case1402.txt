minority shareholders of orange county nursery,the moving parties,filed a complaint for involuntary dissolution of the corporation,subd.b.the corporation the purchasing party,through its president,robert veyna,elected to buy out the moving parties in order to avoid dissolution.after reviewing the independent appraisal report,the trial court entered a decree on november,fixing the fair value of the moving party shares and ordering,that unless the purchasing party made payment for the shares in cash by december,judgment would be entered winding up and dissolving the corporation.
without making the required payment,or first seeking relief in the trial court,the purchasing party filed a notice of appeal december,three days later it filed the instant petition for writ of supersedeas in which it asks this court to stay the trial court decree pending resolution of the appeal.it argues that once an appeal is perfected the decree requirement that payment be made for the shares,in this case by december,is automatically stayed until the reviewing court,at the end of the appeal,fixes the fair value of the shares and specifies when payment must be made.it also argues that if the payment requirement is not automatically stayed then this court should exercise its discretion to issue a stay here because it would be unfair to force the purchasing party to purchase the shares now in order to maintain the appeal when it can not know the fair value of the shares until after the appeal is decided.robert veyna assures us,moreover,in a declaration in support of the supersedeas petition that i f the result of the appeal is favorable,it is the company present intention to elect to purchase the minority shares and the company is confident it will have financial resources to do so.
this court requested and received opposition,issued a temporary stay,and heard oral argument.cal.rules of court,rule d.having considered the arguments of the parties and the equities of the matter,we will deny the petition for writ of supersedeas and dissolve the temporary stay previously issued.we hold the trial court alternate specifically its requirement that the purchasing party make payment for the moving parties shares by december or see dissolution of the not automatically stayed simply by perfecting the appeal.our holding is based on supreme court precedent which holds that judgments in special proceedings and orders are not automatically stayed by the filing of a notice of appeal.we also decline to exercise our discretionary authority to issue supersedeas on the ground that any such request must be made in the first instance in the trial court,which has not yet been done.
orange county nursery,is a closely held corporation founded in as the orange county nursery and land company.margarito veyna purchased the nursery as an concern some time in the.the company was incorporated in and has been continuously run by the veyna family.today,it operates as a wholesale tree nursery selling bare root and containerized trees with numerous growing grounds in california and texas.
locked in a dispute over money and control over the operations of the business,veyna descendants have split into three camps.the shareholders in control of the corporation today,including president robert veyna,own percent of the total common stock of the corporation.the moving parties,who controlled the business for two years beginning in,own percent of the stock.the remaining shares,the record suggests,are held by a separate branch of the family who are apparently just watching from the sidelines.not surprisingly,the two disputing camps blame each other for mismanaging and running down the business the moving parties complain that robert veyna side of the family is driving the business inevitably towards bankruptcy,while veyna and the majority shareholders say they are making sacrifices in an attempt to preserve the company after the moving parties and their side of the family all but sent it into bankruptcy.
on august,the matter came to a head.the moving parties filed a complaint for involuntary dissolution of the corporation alleging the business has been run for the sole benefit and advantage of the majority shareholders to the detriment of the minority shareholders.on july,about one month before trial,the parties filed a stipulation wherein the corporation agreed to follow the procedures set forth in corporations code section.the stipulation provided 
the purchasing party has elected to purchase the shares owned by the moving parties pursuant to corporations code.
the purchasing party and the moving parties are unable to agree upon the fair value of such shares.
the purchasing party will give a bond with sufficient security to pay the estimated reasonable expenses including attorneys fees of the moving parties if such expenses are recoverable under corporations code c,in an amount set by the court.
this stipulation and order shall be deemed an application to the court by the purchasing party,pursuant to corporations code b,for the court to issue orders to stay the winding up and dissolution proceeding and to set any other procedures under any subsection of corporations code,as the court,in its discretion,sees fit and proper.
on august,and pursuant to the stipulation,the court entered an order staying the winding up and dissolution of the corporation.the order set a valuation date of august,and required the purchasing party to post a bond of to pay the estimated reasonable expenses including attorneys fees of the moving parties in the event that the purchasing parties do not make a cash payment for the shares held by the moving parties in the amount fixed and within the time specified.the bond,we infer,was posted.
the order then specified that a fter the court has entered its order fixing the fair value of the shares,the purchasing party shall make a cash payment for the shares,within thirty days,in the amount determined by the court.if such payment is timely made,the minority shall transfer its shares and resign from the board of directors concurrently with such payment.the payment date was not absolute,however.the order further provided that if the purchasing party fails to make payment for the shares within the time specified,or such later time as may hereafter be ordered by the court upon good cause shown by written application,judgment shall be entered liquidating and dissolving the corporation.
three independent appraisers were appointed.it is apparent from the record we have that the parties attempted to play a very vigorous role in the appraisal process.the three appraisers were,as the trial court observed,inundated with information supplied by counsel as well as for information made by counsel.someone must have complained because on august,the court issued a minute order wherein it detailed the problems the independent appraisers were having finishing the report and concluded in short,at this juncture it is truly up to the appraisers to decide how they will do their work,what methodology is to be employed,and what economic factors will be considered in rendering their opinions.given the lengthy history of this process to this date,the court believes it is time for the parties and their counsel to step back and to allow the appraisals to be refined and presented to the court.
on october,the appraisers submitted a unanimous appraisal report.they determined the net worth of the corporation as of august,was million and that its discounted fair value,for purposes of corporations code section,was million.the report contained the following caveat it should be noted that our opinion of value excludes any adjustment for hypothetical deferred taxes and transaction costs that would be associated with the actual liquidation of the company assets.the appraisers explained in the concluding paragraph that these issues involve issues of both fact and law,and are reserved to the discretion of the court.
the moving parties moved to confirm the appraisal report even though they thought it substantially undervalued the fair value of the corporation and the moving parties shares.the purchasing party opposed the motion on the ground the appraisal report overvalued the fair value of the corporation and the moving parties shares because it failed to adjust for liquidation costs and consider fire sale conditions following a hearing at which there was substantial discussion about how the three appraisers determined the fair value of the corporation stock,the trial court issued the following order 
the appraisal report submitted by the appraisers in this matter on or about october,which concludes that the fair value of of the common stock of orange county nursery,and subsidiaries at august,is,is hereby confirmed in its entirety,subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein 
pursuant to corporations code,the fair value of the of orange county nursery common stock owned by parties the shares is share value 
the court awards one year of interest on the share value,at the legal rate of seven percent per year,in the amount of,for a total award of 
the purchasing party shall pay plaintiffs the sum of,by cashier check or wire transfer,payable to bartko zankel tarrant miller trust account,to be received by plaintiffs counsel on or before december,at 
upon receipt of payment in full,plaintiffs shall transfer the shares to the purchasing party.
the corporation is hereby ordered liquidated,wound up and dissolved if payment in the full is not timely received by plaintiffs counsel.in such event,judgment shall be entered against the corporation and its sureties for all expenses and attorneys fees incurred by plaintiffs in connection with the purchasing party election on june,to purchase the shares pursuant to corporations code,according to proof and the parties shall attend a case management conference before this court on december,at,to discuss issues related to liquidation,including the possible appointment of a receiver to assume control of the corporation and supervise the liquidation process.
the purchasing party filed a timely notice of appeal.according to the supersedeas petition,the appeal will raise substantial questions concerning the issues the appraisers left to the trial court to resolve and the trial court award of in prejudgment interest.the purchasing party asserts that if its appeal is successful the fair value of the moving parties shares would be approximately million,a reduction of more than million from the shares fair value as determined by the trial court in the decree.
the purchasing party filed a petition for writ of supersedeas because a dispute has arisen between the purchasing party and the moving parties over the effect of the notice of appeal on the trial court decree.it claims the filing of a notice of appeal automatically stays the decree and,more specifically,any requirement that it tender the funds to purchase the shares by december.supersedeas is appropriate,it insists,because the moving parties and the trial court threaten not to honor the stay.the moving parties counter that the alternate decree is not automatically stayed and demand that the purchasing party post an undertaking in an amount equal to percent of the fair value of the shares,an amount it would be required to post to stay enforcement of a civil money judgment.both are incorrect.
the parties acknowledge that the statutory procedure set out in corporations code section is a special proceeding.trahan trahan th,d abrams associates,d.this is important because the rules governing the application of stays and undertakings on appeal in a civil action code civ,do not apply in a special proceeding code civ.agricultural labor relations bd.land management,cal d.in an action,the rules are delimited in part of the code of civil procedure,beginning with code of civil procedure section.but part of the code of civil procedure extends generally only to civil actions,and not to special proceedings.unless the statutes establishing a special proceeding expressly incorporate the provisions of part,they are inapplicable,and a final order in the special proceeding is not automatically stayed pending appeal.citation.ibid.nothing in corporations code section expressly incorporates part of the code of civil procedure,a point the purchasing party concedes.thus,the trial court decree is not automatically stayed.similarly,the purchasing party can not be required to post an undertaking under the provisions of part as though it were securing a civil judgment.
the purchasing party directs our attention,however,to corporations code section,subdivision d.that subdivision provides in pertinent part if the purchasing parties desire to prevent the winding up and dissolution,they shall pay to the moving parties the value of their shares ascertained and decreed within the time specified pursuant to this section,or,in case of an appeal,as fixed on appeal.on receiving such payment or the tender thereof,the moving parties shall transfer their shares to the purchasing parties.the purchasing party asserts that the phrase or,in case of an appeal,as fixed on appeal shows a legislative intent that the date by which a purchasing party may tender the money to buy out the minority shares is extended by law until the reviewing court issues a judgment determining the fair value of the shares and when payment must be made.
it is unclear how subdivision d purports to address the narrow question of whether an automatic stay comes into effect upon the perfecting of an appeal.if the argument is that this subdivision impliedly incorporates part of the code of civil procedure,we are not persuaded.the rule is clear there is no automatic stay unless the statute establishing the special proceeding expressly incorporates part.agricultural labor relations bd.land management,supra,cal d at.the legislature knows how to draft language to incorporate one statute into another.see carpenter pacific mut.ins.cal d,the legislature has seen fit to make the provisions of part ii of the code expressly applicable to many special proceedings.its failure to do so in reference to proceedings under the insurance code must be held to have been intentional.no reading of subdivision d could reasonably conclude it incorporates part of the code of civil procedure,expressly or impliedly,into this statutory procedure.
if the purchasing party is arguing that subdivision d of section of the corporations code writes an automatic stay provision into the statutory framework of the proceedings,we are less persuaded.the argument fails to explain,for example,why the legislature did not expressly incorporate part of the code of civil procedure into corporations code section if that were its intent.the legislature is not limited to one way of drafting legislation.it may,as it deems appropriate,use other language and approaches to achieve similar purposes.that said,supreme court authority teaches there is no automatic stay in a special proceeding unless the statute expressly incorporates the provisions of part of the code of civil procedure.because part is not incorporated in corporations code section,it would seem irregular to hold that subdivision d of that section,which does not even mention a stay,writes in an automatic stay in every case.
there is another reason why there is no automatic stay here.the parties acknowledge the decree is it orders that if the purchasing party does not purchase the shares by the date described in the alternate decree the corporation is,without further action by the superior court,ordered wound up and dissolved.the rule has always been that i f the judgment is and requires no process for enforcement,there is no statutory stay,and,as a general rule,supersedeas is equally inappropriate.citations.witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.although a writ of supersedeas may issue when the purchasing party tenders the purchase price in accordance with the terms of the alternate decree see esparza kadam,d,supersedeas issued where purchasing party deposited full price with court under former,the predecessor to,nothing in subdivision d of corporations code section can override the basic rule that there is no automatic stay of a order.indeed,subdivision d simply acknowledges the reviewing court has the power to fix the fair value of the shares and,wh
