forbes media filed a complaint in intervention against mtm,tccg,and rose.
mtm counsel discovered that multiple corporations with similar names were qualified to do business in california and investigated tcgg corporate status.on january,mtm filed a motion to strike the complaint and activities of tcgg on the ground that it had not been a corporation in good standing in nevada since may,had not filed a notice of name change with california secretary of state,had not filed a notice of conversion under section,and had not provided a name change or substituted parties to the trial court or opposing counsel in the pending action.mtm also filed a motion requesting leave to amend the to add cgg and capital gold group holdings,a delaware corporation,as.mtm attached a proposed amended.
on january,tcgg opposed the motion to strike on the ground that it was a corporation in good standing authorized to transact business in california.in support of the opposition,tcgg submitted a certification from the secretary of state of delaware that cgg was in good standing and had a legal existence.
a hearing was held on january.the trial court noted that tcgg had done nothing to inform the court or opposing counsel of the change in the state of incorporation and the successor status of cgg.tcgg had not complied with section.tcgg had not informed california secretary of state that it changed its state of incorporation and changed its name,but that the delaware corporation was the legal successor burdened with the rights and responsibilities of the former nevada corporation and with a slightly different name.instead,the newly named entity filed with california secretary of state to qualify to do business as a new company,not a successor.as a result,the court found tcgg had lost its status to litigate before the court on may,and not yet taken steps to restore itself,even in the face of the pending motion.
the trial court granted mtm motion for leave to amend its and deemed the amended served and filed as of january.the court dismissed the complaint without prejudice nunc pro tunc back to may.the court struck all pleadings filed by tcgg after may,based on the court conclusion that the entity lacked legal capacity to litigate.sanctions awards in favor of tcgg made after may,were voided and ordered to be reimbursed to the paying parties.the court issued an order to show cause regarding entry of default of tcgg set for hearing on march.

forbes filed a response stating that it did not object to allowing the name correction,but requested an award of costs that forbes had incurred as a result of tcgg failure to inform its creditors of the conversion.

capacity to maintain pending action 
tcgg contends that at all times,it has been a foreign corporation in good standing duly qualified to transact intrastate business in california,and therefore,the trial court abused its discretion by striking its pleadings.we agree.
corporate status under nevada and delaware laws 
t he continuing legal existence of a corporation depends on the law of the state of incorporation.cm record mca records,d.a corporation that lacks the capacity to sue in its home state based on a lack of corporate status,also lacks capacity to sue in california,because it has no greater capacity to sue in california than in its home state.id.at.
under nevada law,a nevada corporation may convert to a foreign business entity under an approved conversion plan.the entity to be converted is considered the constituent entity.and the entity that results from the conversion is called the resulting entity.if the resulting entity is a foreign entity,the constituent entity delivers articles of conversion to nevada secretary of state setting forth the name and jurisdiction of organization of the constituent entity and the resulting entity,that the conversion plan was adopted by the constituent entity in compliance with nevada law,and the address of the resulting entity for service of process.
when a conversion takes effect under nevada law,t he constituent entity is converted into the resulting entity and governed by the law of the jurisdiction of the resulting entity,subd.a.the conversion is a continuation of the existence of the constituent entity,subd.b.the resulting entity has all the liabilities of the constituent entity,subd.d.the domestic constituent entity is not required to wind up its affairs,pay its liabilities,distribute its assets or dissolve,and the conversion is not deemed a dissolution of the domestic constituent entity,subd.g.significantly,a proceeding pending against the constituent entity may be continued as if the conversion had not occurred or the resulting entity may be substituted in the proceeding for the constituent entity,subd.e.
delaware law allows a foreign corporation to convert to a delaware corporation,tit.the certificate of conversion must state the jurisdiction where,and the date on which,the other entity was incorporated,the name of the other entity immediately prior to the conversion,and the name of the delaware corporation in the certificate of incorporation,tit,subd.c.
when the conversion of a foreign corporation to a delaware corporation takes effect under delaware law,the corporation existence is deemed to have commenced on the date that the foreign corporation commenced its existence in the jurisdiction where it was incorporated,tit,subd.d.the conversion of a foreign corporation to a delaware corporation does not affect obligations or liabilities of the other entity incurred prior to its conversion to a delaware corporation or the personal liability of any person incurred prior to such conversion,tit,subd.e.
when a foreign corporation converts to a delaware corporation pursuant to delaware law,the resulting delaware corporation is deemed to be the same entity as the converting foreign corporation,tit,subd.f.when the conversion takes effect under delaware law,the foreign corporation rights,privileges,powers,property interests and causes of action remain vested in the delaware corporation to which the foreign corporation has converted and are not considered to have been transferred to the delaware corporation,tit,subd.f.the converting foreign corporation is not required to wind up its affairs or pay its liabilities and distribute its assets,and the conversion is not deemed to constitute a dissolution of the foreign corporation,tit,subd.g.
under the laws of nevada and delaware,the nevada corporation tcgg was authorized to convert to the delaware corporation cgg.the corporation was never suspended,revoked,or dissolved.the corporation action and the against the corporation could have been continued in the name of tcgg,because under delaware law,tcgg is deemed to be the same entity as cgg,deemed to have come into existence on the date the nevada corporation was incorporated,and has all of the same rights,powers,property interests,causes of action,debts,liabilities,and duties.it is clear that under the laws of nevada and delaware,tcgg had the capacity to pursue the action against mtm after the conversion 
corporation code section 
tcgg contends that it was not required to satisfy the conversion requirements set forth in section,because section does not apply to a foreign corporation conversion to another foreign corporation.this is correct.
section refers to a business entity other than a corporation as an other business entity.section provides that another business entity or a foreign other business entity or a foreign corporation may be converted into a corporation pursuant to the requirements of chapter it is clear from the statutory language that under section,a corporation is a domestic corporation organized under the laws of california and does not include a foreign corporation.when the legislature intended to include foreign business entities or foreign corporations in section,it expressly used the terms foreign business entity and foreign corporation.if the term other business entity encompassed both domestic and foreign business entities,the following reference to foreign other business entities would be unnecessary and redundant.by implication,where the statute simply refers to another business entity or a corporation,it refers only to domestic entities.
in addition,the statutory scheme makes it clear that section applies solely to conversions to domestic corporations.a foreign corporation that files for conversion under section automatically surrenders its right to transact intrastate business.this provision makes sense if the foreign corporation is converting to a domestic corporation.however,if a foreign corporation had to meet the requirements of section to convert into another foreign corporation,then the statute would need to provide for a new certificate of qualification to issue to the converted corporation.we find that the requirements of section do not apply to a foreign corporation conversion to another foreign corporation.
capacity under california law 
in the trial court,mtm argued that tcgg had not properly notified the court or california secretary of state of its corporate changes.tcgg contends that it was in full compliance with california law.we agree with tcgg.
a foreign corporation must obtain a certificate of qualification from california secretary of state in order to transact intrastate business,subd.a.to obtain the certificate,the corporation must file a statement providing its name,state of incorporation,address of its principal executive office,address of its principal office in california,agent for service of process in california and consent to service of process.ibid.it must attach a certificate from the state of incorporation stating that the corporation is an existing corporation in good
