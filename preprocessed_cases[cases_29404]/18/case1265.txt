during the period of its dissolution,the appellant entered into an agreement with leon hayduchok,whereby it alleges it obtained exclusive rights to the patent in suit,patent the patent.under the agreement,hayduchok,who was one of the named inventors listed in the patent,granted to the appellant the exclusive,unlimited,irrevocable,right and license to the patent,effective october.at.the appellant also relies on two letters,dated april,and may,in which hayduchok and the other named inventor listed in the patent,leopold strauss,are alleged to have resolved litigation between each other regarding ownership of the patent,and consented to continued enforcement and licensing of the patent by the appellant.like the licensing agreement,these letters were written during the period of the appellant administrative dissolution.
the appellant initiated this action by filing a complaint for patent infringement against the appellee in the united states district court for the southern district of florida on september,during the period that the appellant was administratively dissolved.
on june,the appellee filed a motion for summary judgment,alleging that because the appellant had been administratively dissolved since august,it did not have capacity to sue under florida law or standing to invoke the district court jurisdiction under article iii of the united states constitution.the appellee argued that the appellant lacked capacity under florida corporation statutes chapter,which provides,a ny corporation failing to file an annual report shall not be permitted to maintain or defend any action in any court of this state.the appellee further argued that because florida law prohibits dissolved corporations from conducting business except that necessary to wind up and liquidate their business and affairs,the agreements the appellant entered into while administratively dissolved did not transfer enforceable patent rights to the appellant during the period of dissolution.therefore,the appellee argued,the appellant did not have sufficient interest in the patent at suit to establish standing.
as noted above,on june,the appellant obtained reinstatement as a corporation from the florida department of state.
