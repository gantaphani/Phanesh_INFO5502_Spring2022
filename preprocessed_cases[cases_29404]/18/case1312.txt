factual and procedural background 
a.the evolution of corporations sole 
the civil law has long provided for the protection and preservation of the property of religious organizations by means of the entity known as a corporation sole.the corporation sole is a venerable creation of the common law of england and is well established under common law in california.citations.citation.b erry society of saint pius x th,berry.one principal purpose of the corporation sole is to insure the continuation of ownership of property dedicated to the benefit of a religious organization which may be held in the name of its titular head.citation.i at.
california by statute has legitimized this tradition and regulates the formalities attendant upon the creation and continued existence of the corporation sole.citation.b erry,supra,th at see also.a corporation sole may be formed by the bishop,chief priest,presiding elder,or other presiding officer of any religious denomination,society,or church,for the purpose of administering and managing the affairs,property,and temporalities thereof.the articles of incorporation must include the name of the corporation that the officer forming the corporation is authorized by the rules,regulations,or discipline of the religious denomination,society,or church to take such action the county where the principal office for the transaction of the business of the corporation is located and the manner in which any vacancy occurring in the office of the bishop,chief priest,presiding elder,or other presiding officer is required to be filled by the rules,regulations,or constitution of the denomination,society,or church.in addition to these mandatory provisions,the articles may state any desired provision for the regulation of the affairs of the corporation in a manner not in conflict with law,italics added.the articles shall be signed and verified by the bishop,chief priest,presiding elder,or other presiding officer forming the corporation and shall be submitted to the secretary of state for filing in his office.if they conform to law he shall file them and endorse the date of filing thereon,italics added.a corporation sole may be dissolved and its affairs wound up voluntarily by filing with the secretary of state a declaration of dissolution executed,signed,and verified by the chief officer of the corporation.after the debts and obligations of the corporation are paid or adequately provided for,any assets remaining shall be transferred to the religious organization governed by the corporation sole,or to trustees in its behalf,or disposed of as may be decreed by the superior court of the county in which the dissolved corporation had its principal office upon petition therefor by the attorney general or any person connected with the organization,italics added.
articles of incorporation of pastor of santee catholic mission,a corporation sole 
the roman catholic bishop of san jose,a corporation sole,is the civil legal entity through which the diocese of san jose owns and administers temporal goods of the faithful in that community.reverend monsignor francis cilia is the vicar general of the diocese of san jose and acting parochial administrator pro tempore of santee catholic mission parish.
in,the diocese of san jose sought to form a new catholic parish in san jose,santee catholic mission parish,and the roman catholic bishop of san jose authorized cilia to incorporate as a corporation sole.
on july,cilia submitted articles of incorporation for pastor of the santee catholic mission,a corporation sole,to the secretary.in addition to the four mandatory provisions,the articles contained a number of optional provisions,including article xi,a dissolution provision.it reads in pertinent part in the event of dissolution or final liquidation,santee catholic mission shall,after paying or making provision for the payment of all the lawful debts and liabilities of this corporation sole,distribute all the assets of the corporation sole to i the roman catholic bishop of san jose to be used exclusively for religious purposes or to ii a trustee,or trustees,of a trust or trusts,the beneficiary or beneficiaries of which is or are one or more roman catholic parishes or corporations sole organized and operated exclusively for religious purposes within the diocese of san jose or,iii in the event the roman catholic bishop of san jose or a trust,or trusts,as described above is or are unable or unwilling to accept such assets,such assets shall be disposed of as may be decreed by the superior court of the county of santa clara upon petition therefor by the attorney general or any person connected with the corporation.
the following day,july,the articles were returned to plaintiffs,along with a written response from carleen wood,staff counsel in the secretary business programs division.wood explained that the articles were being returned because article xi was in conflict with section.according to wood,article xi can not distribute assets in any manner other than as provided in section.
over the next few weeks,there were a series of communications between plaintiffs counsel and members of the secretary staff during which plaintiffs counsel attempted to educate the secretary staff on the ecclesial and canonical structures of roman catholic dioceses and roman catholic parishes.plaintiffs counsel asserted that article xi could not be amended to provide that the assets upon dissolution be distributed to the roman catholic bishop of san jose in trust for santee catholic mission or some provision similar thereto as suggested by members of the secretary staff because,unlike other local churches,a parish is not congregationally autonomous and.rather,it is part of the larger catholic community that is governed both by a pastor and,with regard to certain extraordinary administrative acts,the diocesan bishop.because,according to plaintiffs counsel,it is the diocesan bishop that forms parishes,provides them initially with the property and resources necessary to engage in parochial ministry,and participates canonically in their governance,the bishop is entitled to recover such property for the purpose of administering it according to the norms of canon law plaintiffs counsel further asserted that when a parish is suppressed by the diocesan bishop,it ceases to exist.thus,if santee catholic mission were suppressed at some point in the future there would be no ecclesial entity that could function as a beneficiary to a trust,as there would be no santee catholic mission.
edward maxwell,general counsel with the business programs division,responded by reiterating the secretary position that the submitted provision contained in article xi to have the assets upon dissolution go to the corporation sole named the roman catholic bishop of san jose,is in direct conflict with text of corporations code section,which in this instance requires the assets to be distributed to the santee catholic mission,or be distributed in trust for the santee catholic mission.maxwell additionally observed that the dissolution provision contained in the proposed articles of incorporation was consistent with that permitted by corporations code section a b for a nonprofit religious corporation and advised plaintiffs counsel that plaintiffs might want to consider forming that type of corporation instead of a corporation sole.
plaintiffs counsel responded that the santee catholic mission assets can not be distributed to the santee catholic mission if it ceases to exist.he also asserted that during the past year,the secretary had filed more than articles of incorporation containing dissolution provisions identical to that contained in the submitted articles and requested the legal authority regarding the secretary authority to engage in such interpretation to undertake such adjudications regarding the substantive content of articles filed under corporations code et sequitur.
in response to plaintiffs counsel request,maxwell indicated that sections and provide that the contents of the articles of incorporation can not conflict with the law,and that section additionally provides that the secretary must review articles of incorporation for compliance with applicable law prior to filing.he further explained that the secretary reviews submitted articles on a basis,and the fact that other articles of incorporation containing identical dissolution provisions had been filed is not a factor in the review process.in addition,he advised plaintiffs counsel that s hould the santee catholic mission be eliminated as hypothesized in your correspondence,sections through provide for the required filings with our office 
events preceding the submission of the articles of incorporation for pastor of santee catholic mission,a corporation sole 
in october and november,prior to submitting the articles of incorporation for pastor of santee catholic mission,a corporation sole,plaintiffs counsel submitted articles of incorporation on behalf of the roman catholic bishop of san diego for new parish corporations sole.the first articles submitted,which were substantively identical to those submitted for the santee catholic mission,were filed without incident.the next articles submitted like the first bore an abbreviated reference to the corporate name in the title of the document,followed by a formal recital of the corporate name in the official text of the articles.the secretary advised plaintiffs counsel that the text in both the title and article i of the submitted articles had to be identical,or the articles would be rejected.the trivial and changes,as characterized by plaintiffs,were made,and all submitted articles were filed.thereafter,an additional eight articles were submitted on behalf of the roman catholic bishop of san diego.each included the change that had been requested with respect to the articles previously submitted and were filed without incident.
on july,the roman catholic bishop of sacramento submitted articles of incorporation for a new parish corporation sole,which included the change in the title noted above.in all other respects,the articles were substantively identical to the articles mentioned above.the secretary requested,for the first time,that the phrase t o the fullest extent permitted by law be added to one sentence of the articles.the change was made and the articles were filed.
each of the articles of incorporation filed contained a dissolution provision identical to that contained in the articles submitted for pastor of santee catholic mission,a corporation sole.
petition for writ of mandate 
on august,plaintiffs filed a verified petition for writ of mandate and complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief challenging what plaintiffs described as the secretary failure to perform the,ministerial duty of filing articles of incorporation for the pastor of santee catholic mission,a corporation sole,unlawful and unauthorized exercise of substantive,review of submitted articles of incorporation,and capricious application of arbitrary and inconsistent standards known only to the secretary and her staff.code civ.plaintiffs argued that the secretary possesses only ministerial authority over the approval and endorsement of submitted articles of incorporation,such authority is limited to a review of submitted articles to ensure that the requisite components for forming a corporation sole are present,and the secretary exceeded her ministerial authority by demanding substantial redrafting of portions of the articles of incorporation submitted by plaintiffs,and by ultimately rejecting them.plaintiffs further asserted that even if the secretary had any discretionary authority to require redrafting of submitted articles of incorporation,the exercise of that authority relative to the articles of incorporation for santee catholic mission was arbitrary and capricious and should be enjoined.
the trial court denied the petition.it found that the plain language of sections and unambiguously confers discretionary authority upon the secretary to determine whether articles of incorporation submitted to her comply with the law.in addition to including the requisite four items enumerated by section in its articles of incorporation,section allows plaintiffs to include in its articles any other discretionary provision related to the regulation of plaintiffs affairs not in conflict with law section only requires the secretary to file plaintiffs articles of incorporation i f they conform to law the court further found that plaintiffs failed to establish the secretary acted arbitrarily and capriciously in refusing to file the submitted articles of incorporation,explaining that section requires that assets be distributed to the religious organization governed by the corporation sole,and plaintiffs do not dispute that the roman catholic bishop of san jose is not governed by the corporat ion sole,and its articles of incorporation clearly demonstrate the reverse that the roman catholic bishop of san jose governs the corporation sole.the trial court also stated that to the extent that plaintiffs conten tion that the secretary acted arbitrarily and capriciously in rejecting plaintiffs articles of incorporation is predicated on the other trivial and ridiculous changes requested by the secretary,plaintiffs contention is rejected.these other changes are not presently at issue.the record demonstrates that the secretary final refusal to file plaintiffs articles of incorporation is based on the allegedly improper dissolution provision.
judgment was entered in the secretary favor.
plaintiffs appeal.
discussion 
plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in denying their petition because there is no clear statutory delegation of authority to the secretary to scrutinize or extract editorial concessions on articles of incorporation as a condition for filing,and e ven if the secretary had more than ministerial authority concerning review of articles of incorporation for corporations sole,that discretion has been repeatedly abused.as we shall explain,the secretary has a ministerial duty to file submitted articles of incorporation i f they conform to law.the dissolution provision at issue here does not conform to law and is in conflict with section because it directs that any remaining assets be distributed to the roman catholic bishop of san jose,a religious organization that is not governed by the corporation sole.accordingly,the secretary properly refused to file the submitted articles of inc
