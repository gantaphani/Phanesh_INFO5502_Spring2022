introduction 
petitioners water users in the santa clarita valley area,appeal from the judgment of the trial court denying their petition for writ of mandate.petitioners sought to compel respondent castaic lake water agency the agency to divest itself of its ownership of all of the stock of respondent santa clarita water company the water company,and to comply with its own enabling statute,which limits the agency to the wholesale distribution of water.
at issue in this appeal is the interpretation and application of water code section.that section allows a wholesale water agency to sell water at retail only pursuant to written contract with a water corporation subject to regulation by the public utilities commission the agency contends that the retail sales contract it executed in connection with its purchase of the water company complies with section.petitioners contend,as the result of the agency purchase of the water company,that the latter has become the alter ego of the agency.thus,they argue,the contract does not satisfy the requirements of the statute and so the agency remains limited to selling water at wholesale.
we hold,as a matter of law,that the contract contemplated in section is one between the agency and a separate entity,for the agency use of that entity facilities.we further conclude that the entity must remain both separate and subject to regulation by the public utilities commission during the life of the contract.in denying the writ petition here,the trial court failed to determine whether,at the close of the stock purchase transaction,the water company remained separate from the agency so that the section contract could endure.accordingly,we reverse the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
the parties.
the agency was created by the legislature in the castaic lake water agency law.west ann,et,hereinafter,the agency act.section of the agency act describes the agency purpose to acquire water and water rights and provide,sell,and deliver that water at wholesale only through a transmission system to be acquired or constructed by the agency.agency act,italics added.operating in the santa clarita valley area of los angeles county id,the agency provides water to four local water utilities,the largest of which was the water company.
until the transaction here at issue,the water company was a california corporation and a public utility subject to regulation by the public utilities commission the puc.as a water purveyor its purpose was to distribute and sell water to its domestic,industrial,and commercial accounts within the agency boundaries.in addition to its purchases of water from the agency,the water company owned water wells and had access to two aquifers in the eastern groundwater basin of the santa clara river with the ability to extract of water yearly.
petitioners are property owners,residents,and taxpayers in the area covered by the agency who claim to be beneficially interested in the issuance of a writ because,if the agency suffers adverse financial consequences from its purchase of the water company,petitioners water rates will increase and if water must be rationed,they will suffer greater adverse consequences than they would if the water company remained a separate purveyor.
the challenged transaction.
the challenged transaction between the agency and the water company involved two inextricably connected parts.in the contract portion,the water company and agency executed an agreement to permit the agency to sell water directly to consumers hereinafter,the retail service agreement.in the condemnation proceeding,the agency concurrently took by eminent domain all of the outstanding stock of the water company in order to give the agency complete control of the water company.
specifically,on august,the agency approved the retail service agreement.that agreement recites that it was made on august,and that a s a part of a possible settlement of the agency condemnation action,the water company agreed to contract with the agency to grant to the agency the right to sell water directly to consumers within the area in which the water company operates.italics added.the agreement further recites that the agency and water company intend that this grant to the agency shall satisfy the requirements of section and shall be liberally construed to effect the purposes of section 
simultaneously,the agency directors passed resolution to effectuate the condemnation portion of the transaction.resolution authorized the condemnation of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the water company.agency act,subd.g.the resolution declared that public interest and necessity require the acquisition of the water company capital stock to advance the business and statutory purposes of the agency,including,but not limited to,providing,delivering and selling wholesale water within the agency jurisdiction as well as providing retail service pursuant to water code section italics added.
the agency planned to finance this transaction by issuing up to million in retail system revenue certificates of participation through an installment purchase agreement with its own financing corporation.
on august,the agency filed its complaint to condemn and acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the water company castaic lake water agency santa clarita water,case number bc.
the writ petition.
on august,after the above resolutions were passed and the retail sales agreement was signed,but before the final judgment was issued in the condemnation action and before the transaction was closed,petitioners filed their petition for peremptory writ of mandate or prohibition.code civ.the amended petition alleged that the agency condemnation of the water company stock and retail sale of water violates the agency act.agency act.petitioners also challenged as ultra vires the terms and conditions of the financing arrangement.petitioners requested that the trial court issue a writ of mandate or prohibition to require the agency and the water company to cease violating the language of the agency act,which limits the agency to selling water at wholesale only,and to cease its attempt to acquire the water company 
the challenged transaction closes.
a week after the petition was filed,on september,the agency executed a new stock purchase agreement to purchase the water company stock for million in cash,averting the financing arrangement challenged in the petition.
the next day,on september,a stipulation for judgment for million was entered in the eminent domain action.the judgment stated that the agency was authorized by the provisions of section to enter,and did enter,into written contracts with retail water purveyors to sell water to any ultimate water consumer within the agency jurisdiction.the judgment also recited that the agency was empowered by article,section of the california constitution to acquire shares of a water company for the purpose of furnishing water for public purposes.
on september,the consideration of million in cash was transmitted to the shareholders of the water company,the retail service agreement was delivered,and the court executed a final order condemning in favor of the agency all rights,title,and interest in the water company outstanding shares.
thereafter,in connection with the stock purchase,the water company issued a number of resolutions designed to wind up the water company business,dissolve the corporation,distribute its remaining assets to the agency,and accept the resignation of three of the water company directors and its secretary 
the ruling on the petition.
at the hearing,originally scheduled to consider petitioners motion for a stay of the transaction,petitioners cited the legislative history of section to argue that the effect of the transaction was to merge the water company with the agency so that the two organizations would be operated as a unified entity,one becoming the alter ego of the other.additionally,petitioners argued,whatever company existed after the merger would no longer be regulated by the puc.the net result of the transaction,petitioners claimed,is that the retail sales agreement does not comply with section,and the agency may not sell water at retail.
in its defense,the agency argued that the language of the statute is clear,precluding resort to its legislative history,and that the retail sales agreement is a contract that complies with the letter of section.the agency never addressed the effect of the transaction on the water company,after the transaction closed,what form the water company took and whether the water company even continues to exist as an ongoing concern,separate from the agency.although the agency asserted that t he water company is subject to puc regulations italics added,it flatly disagreed that section requires the water company to remain subject to puc control during the life of the contract in order for the retail sales agreement to comply with the statute.counsel for the agency argued,you do see any continuing obligation to be regulated by the puc in 
the court admitted into evidence the legislative history of section,and ruled it does appear that is sufficiently clear and is applicable here,and it does override section of the agency act limiting the agency to wholesale water distribution.agency act.the court denied the writ petition and petitioners appeal ensued.
discussion 
writ of mandamus and standard of review.
a traditional writ of mandate under code of civil procedure section is a method for compelling a public entity to perform a legal and usually ministerial duty.kreeft city of oakland th,d.the trial court reviews an administrative action pursuant to code of civil procedure section to determine whether the agency action was arbitrary,capricious,or entirely lacking in evidentiary support,contrary to established public policy,unlawful,procedurally unfair,or whether the agency failed to follow the procedure and give the notices the law requires.kreeft,supra,at,d lewin joseph hospital of orange d.although mandate will not lie to control a public agency discretion,that is to say,force the exercise of discretion in a particular manner,it will lie to correct abuses of discretion.citation.in determining whether an agency has abused its discretion,the court may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency,and if reasonable minds may disagree as to the wisdom of the agency action,its determination must be upheld.citation.helena west contra costa unified school dist.th,d.
in reviewing a trial court judgment on a petition for writ of ordinary mandate,we apply the substantial evidence test to the trial court factual findings.kreeft city of oakland,supra,th at,d.thus,foundational matters of fact are conclusive on appeal if supported by substantial evidence.clark city of hermosa beach th,d.however,we exercise our independent judgment about legal questions.kreeft,supra,at,d saathoff city of san diego th,d.with these rules in mind,we turn to the question of the meaning of section.
section contemplates the agency will contract with an entity that will remain separate from the agency for the duration of the contract period.
section states in relevant part notwithstanding any other provisions of law,any public agency which has executed a contract with the state for a water supply may sell any water available to that agency directly to any ultimate water consumer within the agency.if the principal act of the public agency restricts the agency to the wholesale distribution of water,the right to sell water directly to consumers may be exercised by the agency only pursuant to written contract with a water corporation,if any exists,subject to regulation by the public utilities commission and serving water at retail within the area in which the consumer is located.italics added.
here,the agency act restricts the agency to the wholesale distribution of water.agency act.therefore,to sell water at retail,the agency must comply with the second sentence of section.at issue is the meaning of the word contract in that second sentence.this is a legal question over which we exercise our independent judgment.kreeft city of oakland,supra,th at,d.
petitioners contend that the contract contemplated by the legislature in section is similar to a lease for use of the retail purveyor facilities to sell water directly to retail consumers.based on the challenged transaction here,under which the agency took the water company by eminent domain,petitioners argue that the retail service agreement does not satisfy the statute contract requirement.by contrast,the agency takes the position that it complied with every condition of section.the agency asserts it had a retail service agreement with a water company that was subject to puc regulation at the time the agreement was entered into.the agency,however,omits to discuss the nature of the entire challenged transaction.that is,the agency offered no analysis about whether the transaction is actually a merger or,as a result of the deal,whether the water company has become the alter ego of the agency,and what effect that transformation might have on the retail service agreement.
a.the rules of statutory interpretation.
in determining the nature of the contract required by section,we apply the usual rules of statutory interpretation.the fundamental rule of statutory construction is to ascertain the intent of the legislature in order to effectuate the purpose of the law.in doing so,we first look to the words of the statute and try to give effect to the usual,ordinary import of the language,at the same time not rendering any language mere surplusage.the words must be construed in context and in light of the nature and obvious purpose of the statute where they appear the statute must be given a reasonable and commonsense interpretation consistent with the apparent purpose and intention of the legislature,practical rather than technical in nature,and which,when applied,will result in wise policy rather than mischief or absurdity.kotler alma lodge th,d,citations omitted.the language of a statute should not be given a literal meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences which the legislature did not intend.citations.people pieters cal d.if the language of a statute is clear,we should not add to or alter it to accomplish a purpose which does not appear on the face of the statute or from its legislative history.kotler alma lodge,supra,at,d,citations omitted.thus,t he intent prevails over the letter,and the letter will,if possible,be so read as to conform to the spirit of the act.citation.people pieters,supra,at.
section plainly contemplates an arm length contract for use.
the language of the statute is clear on its face.section grants the agency the right to sell water at retail only pursuant to written contract with another entity,italics added.it is so elementary that it hardly need be stated that t here must be at least two parties to a contract witkin,summary of california law ed.contracts.an interpretation which allows the agency here to enter into a contract with itself would render the contract a nullity luis orcutt town water d,defeat the plain meaning of the word with,and would be neither a reasonable nor a commonsense interpretation of the requirement that the agency have a contract to sell water at retail.
it is further manifest that the two parties to the contract must maintain their separate existences during the life of the contract,or at any time that the agency seeks to sell water at retail.otherwise,the italicized language that the right to sell at retail is made only pursuant to written contract with would be rendered superfluous.stated differently,the legislature could have granted the wholesaler agency the absolute right to sell water at retail without requiring a contract,and so its inclusion of the second sentence in section clearly manifests the legislature intent there be a contract,which a fortiori,must be between two separate parties,each time the agency sells water at retail.
therefore,to comply with section,whenever a wholesaler agency sells water directly to the consumer,it must be doing so pursuant to a contract with a water company that exists as an entity,be it a wholly owned subsidiary or otherwise,independent from the wholesaler agency.
