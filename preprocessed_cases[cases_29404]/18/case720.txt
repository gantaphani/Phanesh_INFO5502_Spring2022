until his sudden death in,anthony suskovich worked as a computer programmer for wellpoint,a health insurance company,and trasys,an information technology it company.in exactly what capacity he worked for those two companies is the subject of this present case.suskovich estate claims that he was a regular employee,and worse,one that was not paid overtime or enrolled in benefits programs for which he was eligible,and who owes state and federal tax agencies various taxes that wellpoint and trasys should have withheld.wellpoint and trasys claim that suskovich was an independent contractor,and thus ineligible for benefits or overtime,and that he owes back taxes because of his own failure to file proper tax returns or pay his withholding taxes.after the district court granted summary judgment to wellpoint and trasys,the estate brought this appeal.
for the following reasons,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment.
background 
suskovich was a computer analyst and programmer who worked,at various points over ten years,with one of the defendants in this case.wellpoint is a related group of companies that provide health care coverage to clients throughout the united states.in,suskovich formed his own indiana corporation,indy imaging,which he listed on his resume as indy imaging,anthony suskovich.wellpoint retained suskovich and other it professionals to work on the company it team in.while no record exists of any contractual agreement between suskovich and wellpoint,suskovich stated on a form he used to access wellpoint computer system that he was a contractor,and he billed wellpoint for his time on an invoice form that he had created,stating that he was a salesperson who sold computer consulting to wellpoint.he was paid at an hourly rate of,resulting in an annualized salary of about,and received no benefits.for tax purposes,his salary was reported on a form rather than a.
suskovich was retained for limited durations,usually about six months,although these limited engagements were often rolled over into new engagements.wellpoint stopped retaining suskovich in,but because of his expertise with various it issues,sought to bring him back in.due to the company new vendor consolidation program,suskovich could only be retained if his services were offered through a preferred vendor.at this point,suskovich began his relationship with the other defendant in the present case,trasys,which agreed to bring suskovich on as part of their team of it professionals working with wellpoint.he was compensated for his time by submitting invoices to wellpoint,which would then approve them and return them to trasys,which in turn paid suskovich.again,for tax purposes,trasys issued suskovich a form rather than a.the forms that wellpoint and trasys issued suskovich listed his income as nonemployee income or other income.
in february,suskovich signed an independent contractor agreement with trasys this was apparently the first time that suskovich and trasys had put suskovich relationship to the company in contractual form.trasys labeled the writing as an independent contractor agreement,but the form contained terms that could refer to both an employment relationship and an independent contractor relationship for instance,it referred to wages and consideration for employment,but was also an agreement that only extended for a temporary period of time,and that began with the words trasys offers to contract you as before,suskovich would have to submit his hours to wellpoint and have them approved before he could receive any compensation from trasys.suskovich was paid an hour under the agreement,and received no other benefits.
throughout his time with wellpoint and trasys,suskovich worked on a variety of projects,and occasionally worked on different projects for different divisions of wellpoint at the same time.for instance,in suskovich was working on mainframe issues for wellpoint federal employee program while simultaneously working on a project for a different division.in,suskovich entered into an agreement with anthem health plans of virginia to work on a medicaid subrogation project suskovich did not go through trasys when arranging this work,but rather drafted and submitted an agreement for consulting services with wellpoint virginia in which he described himself as an independent contractor and that nothing in the contract should be construed as creating an relationship.under the terms of the agreement,suskovich was responsible for all income tax,unemployment insurance,and withholding.anthem health plans of virginia issued suskovich a form rather than a,and the other divisions of wellpoint and trasys were apparently unaware of this additional work.
during his time with wellpoint,suskovich worked in a cubicle at wellpoint,with a computer supplied to him by the company.he apparently did not have a direct supervisor and worked under the wellpoint employee who was supervising whatever project he was working on.he occasionally worked offsite,but was expected to work at wellpoint offices and to answer to the supervisors on his projects.
sometime in august,wellpoint informed suskovich that they would not be keeping him on past the end of the year in,they declined to renew his contract through trasys.wellpoint was attempting to train one of their programmers in the work that suskovich was doing for them,but when getting her an outside training program proved to be too difficult,wellpoint asked suskovich to train her.suskovich began looking for additional work at this time,and wellpoint was disappointed with his efforts in training the employee and attending his project meetings.wellpoint told trasys that they would replace suskovich with someone from another vendor if he did not improve his performance,and trasys then told wellpoint that suskovich performance would improve.
suskovich continued to look for other work,and approached tom eberhard,who had previously an independent contractor with wellpoint but who had accepted an offer of employment from the company and had risen to a managerial role over some of the projects suskovich worked on.eberhard,along with another former it contractor,bruce jeschke,who had also become a employee of wellpoint,had made various attempts over the years to coax suskovich into working for the company directly.in late,suskovich asked eberhard if he had any work for him.eberhard told him that he had no need for any contract work but did discuss the possibility of employment with wellpoint.suskovich initial salary demand was apparently too high,however.before eberhard had a chance to negotiate,suskovich contracted pneumonia and passed away suddenly.
before his death on january,the irs was investigating suskovich because of his failure to file tax returns for several years.in response suskovich filed delinquent tax returns for,and tax returns for the and tax years.on those returns,he listed himself as a computer consultant,and claimed that he derived his income from his computer consulting business.he also claimed substantial business deductions,again related to his computer consulting business.after the investigation,suskovich agreed to a monthly levy on his income from the irs,although at the time of his death he had not paid the full amount of his back taxes,including in tax debt to the irs and approximately in tax debt to the state of indiana.
suskovich wife sought relief from this outstanding debt as an innocent spouse,but the irs denied her request.in march,kathy suskovich,as the personal representative of suskovich estate,filed the present lawsuit.the estate initially sought declaratory relief in the form of a judgment that suskovich was an employee of wellpoint and then a joint employee of trasys and wellpoint.on the basis of that determination,the suit also sought a monetary award for compensation that suskovich was supposedly denied under the fair labor standards act and other benefits that suskovich was denied under the employee retirement income security act,as well as indemnification for suskovich tax liabilities.the estate moved for summary judgment on april,and wellpoint and trasys likewise moved for summary judgment on all counts.in december,the district court denied the estate motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment to wellpoint and trasys,finding that suskovich was an independent contractor rather than an employee.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
the estate appeal raises three issues.first,the estate claims that the district court mistakenly found that the deciding factor with respect to suskovich employment status was the contractual relationship between the parties second,that the district court wrongly found that the factors in the control test overwhelmingly favored the appellees third,that the district court considered hearsay testimony that should have been barred by the dead man statute.wellpoint and trasys raise an additional issue,arguing that they can prevail on alternative grounds for the erisa,flsa and indemnification claims even if this court decides the employment question against them.

whether the district court incorrectly found the employment contracts between the parties as determinative of suskovich employment status.
the estate first argues that the district court improperly found the employment contracts between suskovich and trasys and wellpoint virginia to be determinative of his employment status.the estate argues that the district court afforded improper weight to this factor,ignored contradictory evidence in the employment contracts,and ignored the other factual considerations in the control test.more specifically,the estate argues that the district court misapplied this circuit decision in stone pinkerton farms,which gives parties to a contract the freedom to define their relationship as one of principal and independent contractor only if other factors do not support a finding of an relationship.id.at an relationship may be found even though the parties define their relationship as one of contractor if enough of the indicia of a relationship are present where,as here,the parties define their relationship as that of an independent,and the facts of their relationship support that conclusion,courts will not interfere with the intent of the parties.
trasys responds that this argument either misreads or misinterprets the district court opinion,which found the contractual definition of the relationship to be a primary factor in the analysis,but still examined whether the traditional control test provided sufficient indicia of an employment relationship.this indeed seems to be what the district court did.the district court stated that it placed primary emphasis on the intent of the parties when determining the nature of the relationship,but then conducted an analysis of the control test from the restatement second of agency,and adopted by the indiana supreme court in moberly day.the district court acknowledged that it attached particular importance to the ninth factor of the control test,the belief of the parties concerning a relationship.that approach fits with the logic of stone,however,since the district court was attempting to follow the intent of the parties as expressed in the contractual agreements unless enough facts indicated the existence of a traditional employment relationship.in part,this approach recognizes that the restatement test was not designed solely as a test of employment status it is also frequently used in tort cases to determine whether an employer is liable for an injury to a third party.see restatement second of agency.since the restatement test is a balancing test,courts applying the test in an employment suit,cognizant of the freedom given to parties to create their relationship through contract,may choose to emphasize evidence that is especially probative of the parties beliefs about the nature of the relationship.such probative evidence would include evidence of an explicit contractual definition of that relationship or evidence of the tax status of the relationship.
the estate also argues that the district court overlooked contradictory evidence,since the independent contractor agreement between trasys and suskovich contained references to both an independent contractor relationship and an relationship.and because trasys drafted the contract,the estate argues that contract law requires that any ambiguity be construed against the drafter.united thermal,asbestos training employment,cir.however,united thermal also holds that extrinsic evidence of the intent of the parties can be admitted where the terms of the contract are unclear or ambiguous,and indiana cases holding that ambiguities should be construed against the drafter also hold that extrinsic evidence of the parties intent is admissible in order to resolve ambiguities.see const,mut.ins.in determining the intent of the parties,the district court considered evidence from inside and outside of the contract.the district court first found that the contracts terms were inconsistent with an relationship despite the use of phrases like employee and wages because the contract made any employment subject to the approval of wellpoint,which is an odd term indeed for an employment contract.second,the district court credited the evidence that the purpose of the contract with trasys was to allow suskovich to continue working on wellpoint projects after the company had established its preferred vendor system.outside of the citation to united thermal,the estate does not challenge the district court summary judgment findings resolving the ambiguity in the contract,and we accordingly find that the district court was correct in considering the contract in its summary judgment ruling.
whether the district court improperly determined that suskovich was an independent contractor based on the control test.
the estate next argues that the district court improperly determined the control test from the restatement second of agency in favor of wellpoint and trasys despite several factors that the estate argues are ambiguous or tilt in favor of finding a traditional relationship.the issue of the control test raises the preliminary question of exactly what standard this court should apply when determining whether or not suskovich was an employee or an independent contractor,given that the estate makes common law,flsa,and erisa claims,and there are slightly different tests for each of those claims.erisa cases use a common law standard to determine if a party to a lawsuit was an employee under the act.the supreme court has held that this standard is similar to the restatement test.nationwide mut.ins.darden,d.flsa cases,meanwhile,are decided utilizing a broader definition of employee than the common law,and determine whether an arrangement is an employment or independent contractor relationship with a test to determine the economic reality of the situation.secretary of labor,of labor lauritzen,cir.the district court followed the restatement test,an approach that we will follow as well given that the majority of the claims in this case revolve around the bare question of employment status and the restatement test is generally equivalent to the common law test from darden,that test provides the best means of resolving the main employment question before us.
under the restatement test,a court examines the extent of control which,by the agreement,the master may exercise over the details of the work whether or not the one employed is engaged in a distinct occupation or business the kind of occupation,with reference to whether,in the locality,the work is usually done under the direction of the employer or by a specialist without supervision the skill required in the particular occupation whether the employer or the workman supplies the instrumentalities,tools,and the place of work for the person doing the work the length of time for which the person is employed the method of payment,whether by the time or by the job whether or not the work is a part of the regular business of the employer whether or not the parties believe they are creating the relation of master and servant whether the principal is or is not in business.moberly,at see also restatement second of agency.
extent of control 
the district court summary judgment opinion found that the control factor supported wellpoint and trasys claim that suskovich was an independent contractor rather than an employee.the estate challenges this finding on appeal,citing wellpoint and trasys control over important aspects of suskovich work.specifically,the estate cites the fact that wellpoint and trasys mandated that he work from at least to,controlled the number of hours he could bill in a given day,required that he attend project meetings,monitored his progress on projects and asked him to train a replacement.the estate also argues that wellpoint and trasys disciplined suskovich for tardiness and receiving personal telephone calls presumably,the estate is referring to wellpoint conversations about finding someone else for suskovich projects if his tardiness did not improve.
none of the facts that the estate sets forth are sufficient to establish wellpoint and trasys control over the details of suskovich work.merely setting a work schedule is not sufficient to support a finding that a given person is an employee rather than an independent contractor.ost,at.nor is the fact that a person is required to be at a given place at a given time or assigned project work sufficient to support an relationship.alexander rush north shore medical center,cir finding that setting on call hours and assigning patients was not sufficient to create an employment relationship between a doctor and a hospital.rather,the question is whether the details of the work were in the control of suskovich or wellpoint and trasys.see ost,at.the record here seems to indicate that suskovich controlled the details of his work,and that he was accountable to trasys and wellpoint only for the results of his work.indeed,as the district court pointed out,neither trasys nor wellpoint had employees who could adequately supervise the computer programming work that suskovich did,which was the reason the companies retained him in the first place.
the record bears this observation out as well for instance,aaron longdon,a project leader in wellpoint federal employees program,averred that,suskovich programming expertise and skill in computer programming languages such as mercator were beyond fep level of technical knowledge.fep exerted no control over the details by which suskovich conducted his work.as a rebuttal to this argument,the estate points to commentary in the restatement that even skilled artisans can be considered employees.that is beside the point.obviously,a company can control the work of even a very advanced computer programmer if there is evidence that the company controls how the programmer goes about the job and does not just examine the final result.the record in this case indicates that suskovich was answerable only for his final performance on projects,and accordingly this factor favors the district court summary judgment finding that suskovich was an independent contractor.
instrumentalities 
the estate next argues that suskovich was an employee rather than an independent contractor because wellpoint and trasys supplied the instrumentalities of his work.suskovich was required to do his work on site,and was given a desk,computer,filing cabinet,and other supplies.the estate argues that because these were instrumentalities of substantial value the district court should have drawn an inference of employment.wellpoint and trasys respond that,since suskovich was a computer programmer,it is hardly surprising that he would work on equipment provided by the company.
courts that have been presented with this claim in the past seem to have decided that this factor is relatively unimportant.the second circuit,evaluating a similar employee versus independent contractor question,found that this factor favors an employment relationship should not weigh heavily in the analysis,since computer programming work will always be done on a company computers.aymes bonelli,cir see also bigalke neenah foundry,wl,at.june,finding that while this factor weighed in favor of the plaintiff,the various trappings of employment she cites seem more superficial than substantive indicia of employment status.
the district court made a similar determination when holding that this factor should not have much significance in the overall analysis.the estate objects to this part of the opinion,claiming that the district court is making a custom argument that is not supported by the record.that is incorrect,however,and ignores what other courts that have evaluated the same issue have previously held.an independent contractor working on a company computer system will be using computer equipment supplied by that is the logical result of hiring the consultant to do programming work on that system in the first place.one need not have any familiarity with the customs of it work to draw this inference.so while we note that wellpoint and trasys did indeed supply suskovich with the instrumentalities of his work,we also recognize that such is the nature of it work,and that this is not a factor that bears much weight in the overall analysis.
length of employment 
the estate next argues that the district court erroneously found that the length of suskovich employment supported independent contractor status.the district court concluded that this factor favored wellpoint and trasys because suskovich was only employed for the length of short term contracts,because his employment was not guaranteed,and because he worked for different divisions of the company and other companies during the time he worked for wellpoint.the estate now argues that the short term of the contracts is irrelevant,as is suskovich side work,citing lauritzen,which held that persons retained for seasonal work could still be employees for purposes of the flsa.
trasys and wellpoint argue that suskovich was only engaged for limited periods of time and that he went through occasional periods where his projects with ended and he performed no work for the company.thus,they conclude,the district court correctly found that this factor favored a finding that suskovich was an independent contractor.this court has previously held that where a person is engaged to work for a company for a limited period of time with no expectation of contract renewal,that fact favors independent contractor status.eeoc north knox school,cir.suskovich worked with wellpoint on and off for about ten years,five of those years through trasys.while this is a substantial period of time,suskovich was only engaged for short projects,usually lasting six to twelve months.the record shows that he never enjoyed any guarantees that his work would extend beyond this limited duration,and accordingly,as this court has held before,this factor favors independent contractor status.
finally,the citation to lauritzen is little help in this case.lauritzen was decided under the flsa which,as previously discussed,takes a broader view of relationships than the common law or erisa tests.it thus provides little support for the position that a person who was engaged for limited periods of time without an expectation of permanent employment can claim to be an employee under a traditional analysis.
method of payment 
the estate next argues that because suskovich was paid by the hour,he was an employee rather than an independent contractor.it cites moberly,and various commentary to the restatement emphasizing that when a person is paid by the hour rather than by the job,such payment is evidence of a traditional employment relationship.trasys and wellpoint,on the other hand,point out a number of cases from this court holding that tax forms and tax returns are essential when
