in granting dvi writ petitions,we address the circumstances under which a parent holding company is subject to personal jurisdiction in california based upon the contacts of its wholly owned subsidiary.dvi is a holding company and is the parent of defendant dvi business credit,dvibc.dvi itself does no business and owns no property in california.dvibc does business in california and does not contest personal jurisdiction here.
we agree with the analysis of sonora diamond superior court th,d sonora and hold a parent company ownership or control of a subsidiary corporation does not,without more,subject the parent corporation to the jurisdiction of the state where the subsidiary does business.a parent holding company may be subject to general jurisdiction only under limited circumstances.those circumstances permitting the exercise of general jurisdiction include an alter ego relationship or the parent exercise of such a degree of control of the subsidiary as to reflect the parent purposeful disregard of the subsidiary independent corporate existence.id.at,d see also virtualmagic asia,th,d.
real parties in interest medcap and papworth failed to meet their burden of establishing general jurisdiction over dvi in california.we also conclude specific jurisdiction does not exist over dvi and therefore grant dvi petitions for writ of mandamus.
we conclude neither general nor specific jurisdiction exists over matthew colasanti,a new york resident,and therefore grant his petition for writ of mandamus.

discussion 
writ petitionsa.general jurisdiction over dvi 
dvi writ petitions assert medcap and papworth failed to establish general jurisdiction over dvi in california.in analyzing general jurisdiction,we examine whether dvi has substantial,continuous,and systematic contacts with california.vons,supra,cal th at,d.we conclude dvi does not.
evidence regarding dvi contacts in california 
as to california exercise of personal jurisdiction over dvi,the trial court had before it two pieces of evidence the declaration of melvin breaux,dvi secretary,general counsel,and submitted by dvi in support of its motions to quash and dvi consolidated form for the fiscal year ended june,submitted by medcap in opposition to dvi motion to quash service on its third amended complaint 
according to breaux,dvi principal activity is as a holding company.dvi owns the stock of six subsidiaries,including dvibc.although the subsidiaries regularly conduct business in california and advertise under the dvi name,dvi itself does not engage in the subsidiaries business activities.dvi is registered to do business in california as delaware dvi,but engages in no business with california residents or businesses.
breaux declared dvi has no employees dvi has eight domestic officers,two of whom reside in california dvi does not maintain a retirement,pension,medical,health,or dental plan dvi,unlike its subsidiaries,does not finance equipment leases or provide lines of credit dvi has no customers at in california or elsewhere dvi sells no products or services in california dvi does not pay income taxes in california dvi maintains no bank accounts or deposit accounts in california and dvi owns no real or personal property in california.
dvi form confirms dvi is incorporated in delaware and has its principal place of business in pennsylvania.the form is a consolidated statement for dvi and all of its subsidiaries,including dvibc.the form states,dvi conducts its business principally through two operating subsidiaries,dvi financial services,referred to as dvi financial services and dvi business credit corporation,referred to as dvi business credit.
exercise of general jurisdiction over a parent corporation based upon the subsidiary sonora case 
in analyzing the evidence of contacts,w e start with the firm proposition that neither ownership nor control of a subsidiary corporation by a foreign parent corporation,without more,subjects the parent to the jurisdiction of the state where the subsidiary does business.sonora,supra,th at,d,italics added see also cannon cudahy packing.
the more necessary for jurisdiction over the parent can be contacts creating specific jurisdiction.in empire steel superior court cal d,the california supreme court held a foreign corporation could be subject to jurisdiction in california where the claims asserted arise out of a parent manipulation of the subsidiary.the court concluded a foreign parent was subject to jurisdiction in california because it knowingly caused its california subsidiary to make the contracts in suit and therefore engaged in activities creating substantial contacts within california in relation to the claim asserted.id.at.such contacts give rise to what is today called specific jurisdiction.the empire steel court did not address the circumstances under which the parent would be subject to general jurisdiction in california based upon its subsidiaries contacts.
in sonora,supra,th,d,the court discussed at length those more needed to subject a parent corporation to general jurisdiction based upon the contacts of the subsidiary.there were two defendants in sonora.the first was sonora mining,a nevada corporation.id.at,d.it did extensive business in california and did not contest jurisdiction.the second was sonora diamond,a canadian corporation.id.at,d.sonora diamond primary business was ownership of sonora mining stock.sonora diamond prepared consolidated financial reports for itself and its subsidiaries,including sonora mining,guaranteed sonora mining obligations,and made significant unsecured and not repaid loans to it.id.at,d.the trial court denied sonora diamond motion to quash.id.at,d.the court of appeal concluded sonora diamond lacked sufficient minimum contacts with california and issued a writ of mandate.id.at,d.
the sonora court identified three circumstances in which general jurisdiction may exist over the parent corporation based upon its subsidiaries contacts with the forum.first,general jurisdiction may exist when evidence establishes the parent and the subsidiary are alter egos.sonora,supra,th at,d.the party asserting alter ego liability must establish such a unity of interest and ownership between the corporation and its equitable owner that the separate personalities of the corporation and the shareholder do not in reality exist and an inequitable result if the acts in question are treated as those of the corporation alone.ibid.the court concluded the plaintiff failed to establish wrongdoing or an unfair result.id.at,d.
second,the sonora court explained the representative services doctrine a species of agency supports the exercise of jurisdiction when the local subsidiary performs a function that is compatible with,and assists the parent in the pursuit of,the parent own business.sonora,supra,th at,d.but the court concluded the representative services theory is inapplicable to a holding company because t o find the holding company subject to jurisdiction simply because the holding company chose to invest rather than operate would swallow the distinction,made in the case law between holding companies and operating companies id.at,d.
third,the sonora court recognized a gency may confer general jurisdiction in the forum state over a foreign corporation,but only where the nature and extent of the control exercised over the subsidiary by the parent is so pervasive and continual that the subsidiary may be considered nothing more than an agent or instrumentality of the parent,notwithstanding the maintenance of separate corporate formalities sonora,supra,th at,d.the nature of the parent control over the subsidiary must be over and above that to be expected as an incident of the parent ownership of the subsidiary,but must reflect the parent purposeful disregard of the subsidiary independent corporate existence.id.at,d.accordingly,if a parent corporation exercises such a degree of control over its subsidiary corporation that the subsidiary can legitimately be described as only a means through which the parent acts,or nothing more than an incorporated department of the parent,the subsidiary will be deemed to be the agent of the parent in the forum state and jurisdiction will extend to the parent.id.at,d see also virtualmagic asia,supra,th at,d.
application of general jurisdiction over dvi 
we agree with sonora and adopt its reasoning and holding.we conclude medcap and papworth have failed to establish any of the elements creating general jurisdiction over dvi,the parent corporation of dvibc.
first,medcap and papworth have not shown alter ego,and their allegations of alter ego alone are insufficient to create jurisdiction over dvi.sonora,supra,th at,d.
second,the representative services doctrine does not support jurisdiction because there is no evidence dvibc performed a function that is compatible with,and assists dvi in the pursuit of,dvi business.
third,medcap and papworth failed to prove an agency relationship necessary to establish jurisdiction over a holding company.they failed to produce evidence establishing dvi exercises such a degree of control over dvibc that dvibc can legitimately be described as only a means through which dvi acts,or nothing more than an incorporated department of the parent sonora,supra,th at,d.
dvi relationship with dvibc was not as close as the relationship between sonora mining and sonora diamond.sonora mining was formed to operate sonora diamond operations in california,sonora diamond sole source of income was derived from sonora mining california operations,sonora diamond guaranteed key obligations of sonora mining and loaned it significant sums,the two companies had interlocking officers and directors,sonora diamond prepared consolidated financial reports,and sonora diamond was extensively involved in sonora mining winding up.sonora,supra,th at,d.the court nonetheless rejected the plaintiff argument that sonora mining was sonora diamond agent.medcap and papworth presented no evidence dvibc was formed to operate dvi operations in california,dvi sole source of income was dvibc california operations,or dvi guaranteed dvibc obligations or loaned dvibc money.dvi has no employees in has no employees at all 
the consolidated financial statement does not meet medcap and papworth burdens.the form shows dvi has at least one subsidiary other than dvibc,which tends to disprove an assertion that dvi sole source of income was dvibc california operations.the fact dvi and its subsidiaries produce consolidated financial statements does not establish they are a single entity for,as the sonora court stated,t he cases are unanimous that consolidated reporting is standard business practice and will not support jurisdiction in the absence of evidence establishing an agency relationship.sonora,supra,th at,d.the consolidated report use of the words we or the company to refer to dvi and its subsidiaries does not prove they are a single entity in practice.id.at,d.
medcap and papworth argue dvi is subject to jurisdiction in california because it registered to do business,maintains an agent for service of process,and has two officers residing in the state.in gray line tours reynolds electrical engineering d,the court held that designation of an agent for service of process and qualification to do business in california alone are insufficient to permit general jurisdiction except for lawsuits arising out of the foreign corporation business conducted in the state.here,dvi conducts no business in california dvi business is to own the stock of dvibc.dvibc does business in california,but dvibc contacts with california are not in issue.moreover,as explained below,the claims in papworth against dvi do not arise out of any business conducted in california.
medcap asserts two of dvi officers reside in california.the acts of corporate agents within the forum may establish jurisdiction over the corporation magnecomp athene,supra,d at.however,medcap has not shown how the ownership of a personal residence is part of an officer activities in the capacity of a corporate agent.
medcap and papworth assert jurisdiction over dvi based upon breaux statement that subsidiaries owned by dvi regularly do business in california and advertise under the dvi name.however,the nature of the subsidiaries advertising in this case does not create jurisdiction over dvi.in hesse best western,th,d,cited by medcap,the defendant corporation advertised collectively for its affiliate members.here,dvi subsidiaries engage in their own advertising under the dvi moniker.it is natural they do so because dvi is common to all the subsidiaries names.
circus circus hotels,superior court d,cited by dvi,is instructive on whether advertising in california by dvi subsidiaries creates jurisdiction over dvi.in circus circus,the court held a nevada casino substantial advertising in the los angeles times,which led to the plaintiff contact with the casino,did not create general jurisdiction over the casino in california.id.at.although,as medcap points out,the casino was not registered to do business in california and the tortious conduct occurred in nevada,the basis for the circus circus decision was that the casino was not subject to general jurisdiction in california by virtue of its advertising in the state.dvi is one step removed from the casino in circus circus in that dvi subsidiaries,not dvi,are advertising in california 
medcap and papworth argue dvi and dvibc have not adhered to corporate formalities,and in support rely upon a passage from the deposition transcript of anthony turek,an officer of dvi.turek testified the same people serve as the directors of dvi and dvibc,and w e do really concern ourselves too much with the legal subsidiary lines.turek was not deposed,however,until after the trial court denied the motions to quash,and we may not consider evidence that was not before the trial court.mihlon superior court,supra,d at.
medcap and papworth asserted at oral argument we have discretion to consider the turek deposition.see mccarthy superior court d,fn.in writ proceeding,reviewing court may in its discretion consider evidence not presented to trial court.a persuasive line of authority holds that in writ of mandamus proceedings the court should decline to consider evidence not presented to the trial court.see people superior court lavi cal th,d,declining to consider evidence not presented to trial court stevens superior court th,d,fn.we agree that where an exhibit was not before the trial court,we should not consider it stevens superior court th,d,fn.because these declarations were not before the trial court,we can not consider them in this proceeding fall river joint unified school dist.superior court d.since none of these contentions was presented in the trial court,and the declarations and other exhibits filed in support of them were not before the superior court,we can not consider them in this proceeding.if medcap and papworth needed to garner evidence in support of jurisdiction,they could have asked for continuances of the motions to quash service of summons to conduct discovery.goehring superior court th,d.
but even if considered,turek deposition testimony failed to meet medcap and papworth burdens of establishing jurisdiction.turek testimony did not establish alter ego or that dvi exercised such a degree of control over dvibc that dvibc can legitimately be described as only a means through which dvi acts.indeed,the sonora court recognized the relationship of parent and subsidiary contemplates a close financial connection between parent and subsidiary and a certain degree of direction and management exercised by the former over the latter.sonora,supra,th at,d.the sonora court noted such things as interlocking corporate officers and directors are normal attributes of a relationship.id.at,d.
in sum,medcap and papworth failed to meet their burdens of submitting evidence establishing dvi contacts with california were substantial,continuous,and systematic.medcap and papworth established only that dvi owns its subsidiary,dvibc,which does business in california.without more,which medcap
