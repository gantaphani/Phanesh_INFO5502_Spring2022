general dwight eisenhower fascinating written account of world war ii is the subject of a more mundane,present day battle over the copyright to that now famous book,crusade in europe.dastar corporation dastar appeals the district court judgment in favor of twentieth century fox film corporation fox,sfm entertainment llc,and new line home video,collectively,twentieth century fox parties,finding that dastar infringed protected copyrights to crusade in europe,and the court subsequent award of attorneys fees and costs to twentieth century fox parties.we affirm.
the district court entered judgment following a bench trial,and we set forth the pertinent facts in the light most favorable to the prevailing parties.
general eisenhower served as supreme commander of the allied expeditionary forces during world war ii,following his service as commander of the troops in europe.upon the surrender of the german military forces in,numerous publishers approached general eisenhower,offering him the opportunity to publish his memoirs about the war.general eisenhower,however,spurned all such offers until doubleday president douglas black and the new york herald tribune tribune william robinson convinced him otherwise.general eisenhower explained 
m any months before i left the army,i was approached by representatives of various publishing houses,each with a different reason for wanting to publish my memoirs of the war.to all these proposals i turned a deaf ear.
but finally two men,douglas black of doubleday and william robinson,of the new york herald tribune,came to me with a different kind of argument.roughly it went like this 
historians,they said,are often inclined to use contemporary accounts as source materials they showed me,or reminded me of,a number of books which had been written hurriedly,so as not to miss the market.certain of these books on the african and european campaigns were riddled with inaccuracies.they contained conclusions that had slight basis in fact and were the hasty conceptions or misconceptions of authors who had a flair for writing rapidly and fluently.black and robinson,who were functioning partners for the proposal,pointed out errors in these publications and said that since these were written during my lifetime and were not denied or corrected by me,the historians of the future might give them a high degree of credibility.
this reasoning impressed me.after i thought it over for a time,they came back and i said,i ready to undertake this task but on one condition only it seems to me that every time the subject is brought up,people talk about all the various kinds of publishing rights and so on and i do want to be bothered with such things.now if you people can come up with a single package to cover the whole affair so that i do have to argue with too many people,i will probably undertake something.
dwight eisenhower,at ease doubleday company.
the evidence showed that despite general eisenhower initial reluctance,the thought of penning a personal account of his war experiences had previously crossed his mind.according to general eisenhower,he had tried to draft a bit of narrative just to satisfy him self that he had something to say that was worth hearing.but ultimately,general eisenhower explained that he had not convinced him self of this at all,and any work was merely an experiment more as a protection to him self in the event he ever did want to write.he did not definitively decide to write and publish his memoirs,however,until approached by black and robinson.
after hearing their initial pitch,general eisenhower and his attorney met with representatives from tribune and doubleday in washington,on december.doubleday made general eisenhower an attractive offer to publish his memoirs and he accepted the terms with a handshake.general eisenhower wrote the next day that all is settled on a gentleman agreement basis,further explaining that the matter had reached a definite conclusion.
prior to the december,meeting,doubleday suggested to general eisenhower that he could potentially avoid having the publishing deal taxed as ordinary income,and instead obtain more favorable capital gains treatment.general eisenhower contacted the internal revenue service irs and explained his situation.he asked the irs for an opinion as to how the sale of the book and publication would be treated for tax purposes.the irs explained that under since repealed it could treat him as a nonprofessional,writer,and if he adhered to a specific set of restrictions,the proceeds could be taxed as capital gains,instead of as salary.specifically,the irs explained that if general eisenhower sold all his right,title and interest in the book after having held the completed manuscript for a period of six months,the proceeds of his deal would qualify for capital gains treatment.
general eisenhower explained to doubleday that he would have to structure the transaction as his advisors directed,including specifically the need to account for the irs opinion that any written agreement could only be in the form of an option to purchase the manuscript in six months,in order to obtain the favorable tax treatment.just after reaching the handshake agreement,general eisenhower wrote to a friend that his lawyer wa s collaborating with the treasury department and with the doubleday people to see how a tentative instrument could be drawn up that can in no wise be interpreted either as a bona fide sale or as a contract for services.he later explained to doubleday that although they could not have a formal contract in place,at any time subsequent to six months,after my completion of the manuscript,i shall be prepared to enter into a contract with doubleday without regard to what any other publishing house might propose in the interim.thus,the district court determined as a matter of fact that doubleday understood that general eisenhower could not have put their agreement into writing until six months after the completion of his first draft without jeopardizing favorable capital gains treatment.
the district court further found that general eisenhower began writing the book manuscript after he reached the agreement with doubleday on december.the writing process took on almost mythic proportions.general eisenhower typically worked approximately sixteen hours a day,dictating text in the morning and revising and editing drafts in the afternoon.doubleday,for its part,not only supplied secretarial staff,researchers,and stenographers,but also supervised much of the work,and paid for the creation of maps and photos for inclusion in the book.additionally,the doubleday editorial board met with general eisenhower in person on numerous occasions,and provided extensive comments and notes on the work in progress.
general eisenhower completed the first draft of the manuscript on march.just over six months later,as required by the irs for favorable tax treatment,general eisenhower memorialized the december handshake agreement in an october,written contract.the document signed by general eisenhower stated that 
in consideration of the sum of redacted to me in hand paid,the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged,i do hereby sell,assign,transfer and set over unto doubleday company,for its own use,absolutely and forever,the manuscript of my war memoir entitled crusade in europe,and all rights of every nature pertaining thereto.
after execution of the written agreement,doubleday sold to fox exclusive television rights to the book,agreeing to register the copyright and granting it the right to use portions of the text as part of the narration in any film version of the book.thereafter,in,doubleday obtained certificates of registration for the copyrights to the book.fox subsequently produced just such a film,also titled crusade in europe crusade in europe video,in.fox later sublicensed the right to distribute the crusade in europe video to sfm entertainment,which in turn sublicensed manufacture and distribution rights over home videocassettes to new line home video.
in,dastar created its own video documentary named campaigns in europe.the twentieth century fox parties sued dastar,alleging that campaigns in europe infringed on crusade in europe by using large sections of the book text as part of the video narration without permission.dastar subsequently asserted several counterclaims against twentieth century fox parties,which later amended their complaint to include a claim that dastar had violated a of the lanham act,a,and california unfair competition law.
twentieth century fox parties and dastar raised for summary judgment.the district court granted twentieth century fox parties motion on both the lanham act claim and the copyright claim,and denied dastar motion in full.after issuing its summary judgment ruling the district court granted twentieth century fox parties motion for attorneys fees under of the copyright act.the district court determined that twentieth century fox parties were wholly successful in their suit,that dastar copyright defense was objectively unreasonable,that dastar litigation tactics were motivated by bad faith,and that an award of attorneys fees and costs was necessary to deter dastar from further infringement.
dastar brought an earlier appeal challenging the district court summary judgment ruling.in an unpublished memorandum decision,we affirmed the district court judgment on the lanham act claims,but reversed and remanded the copyright claims,holding that there were genuine issues of material fact as to general eisenhower and doubleday intent on the issue.dastar successfully petitioned for writ of certiorari on the lanham act claims,and the supreme court reversed and remanded the case back to us.dastar twentieth century fox film,d.we then remanded the case back to the district court with instructions to dismiss the lanham act claim with prejudice.
in its summary judgment appeal,dastar had also appealed the fee award,arguing that the fee request was not adequately documented and that the fee rates and hours billed were excessive.we rejected both arguments,but in light of our reversal of the district court summary judgment in favor of twentieth century fox parties on the copyright claim,we vacated the fee award and remanded to the district court to recalculate the fees once the copyright claim had been resolved.
subsequently,the district court granted dastar motion for summary judgment and dismissed twentieth century fox parties unfair competition claim.with only the copyright claim remaining,the parties then submitted to a bench trial,during which the district court admitted hundreds of exhibits,including general eisenhower correspondence,notes,and recorded recollections.dastar did not call any witnesses at trial,relying solely on the documentary evidence submitted and its of twentieth century fox parties only witness,samuel vaughn,a doubleday editor who worked closely with general eisenhower.after entering lengthy findings of fact and conclusions of law,the district court determined that general eisenhower book was created as a within the definition of the statute,and that dastar video infringed the copyright to the book.
upon conclusion of the bench trial,the court again considered the issue of attorneys fees,and granted twentieth century fox parties motion.in its opinion,the district court incorporated by reference its earlier opinion awarding fees.in its new order,the district court held that for the same reasons it had stated previously,twentieth century fox parties were still entitled to a fee award because they had prevailed.the district court recalculated the lodestar fees from its december award based on expenses incurred in defending the summary judgment appeal and reduced the fees based on the subsequently dismissed lanham act claim.
dastar appeals both the district court adverse judgment on twentieth century fox parties copyright infringement claim and the district court subsequent of attorneys fees.we affirm.
we first consider twentieth century fox parties infringement claims under the now repealed copyright act of,stat.repealed act,because crusade in europe was published before the january,effective date of the copyright act act.dolman agee,cir.to demonstrate copyright infringement,the plaintiff must prove ownership of a valid copyright and copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.walker university books,cir.dastar defense hinges on its attempt to demonstrate that doubleday did not own a valid copyright in crusade in europe in because doubleday purported attempt to renew the copyright in was ineffective.
section of the act provides that the initial copyright shall last for years.act.the proprietor of any work copyrighted by an employer for whom such work is made for hire is entitled to a renewal and extension of the copyright for an additional term of years if the employer makes the appropriate application for renewal within one year prior to the expiration of the copyright original term.id.
in the case of art not created as a,however,only the author may renew the copyright in the final year of the initial year period.id.if the author is not alive during the renewal period,then such right of renewal passes to the surviving spouse,or children of the author,then to the executors of the author estate,or in the absence of a will naming executors,to the next of kin.id.if no such renewal is made by the appropriate family member or executor,the copyright expires years from publication id.
dastar argues that,as a matter of law,crusade in europe can not be a because where as here,general eisenhower authored the book as an independent contractor,doubleday was not his employer.we disagree.the act does not provide any definition of work made for hire or employer.estate of burne hogarth edgar rice burroughs,cir.it provides only in that i n the interpretation and construction of this title the word author shall include an employer in the case of works made for hire.act.because the act did not define employer or works made for hire,the task of shaping these terms fell to the courts.comm.for creative reid,d ccnv.resolution of the issue thus becomes a mixed question of law and fact.
until the sic,federal courts applied the doctrine only to cases in which a traditional relationship existed between the hiring party and the creator of the work.playboy,dumas,cir.however,i n the last decade that the act was effective,courts expanded the concept to include less traditional relationships,as long as the hiring party had the right to control or supervise the artist work.fellowship church ananda church of,cir citation omitted.
forty years ago,we explained the law of this circuit with respect to 
w hen one person engages another,whether as employee or as an independent contractor,to produce a work of an artistic nature,that in the absence of an express contractual reservation of the copyright in the artist,the presumption arises that the mutual intent of the parties is that the title to the copyright shall be in the person at whose instance and expense the work is done.
builders hardware gertler,cir see may,cir dolman,at.accordingly,we have consistently evaluated claims that a work was made for hire by asking whether it was created at the instance and expense of the engaging party.see,dolman,at stating that a party asserting affirmative defense was required to present some credible evidence that the author work was done at the instance and expense of the commissioning party may,at what is necessary is that the artist produce the work at the instance and expense of the employer or commissioning party.
dastar argument that independent contractors can not create as a matter of law essentially seeks to overturn forty years of established case law within this circuit,something we as a panel can not and will not do.palmer sanderson,cir as a general rule,a panel not sitting en banc may not overturn circuit precedent.it has been well established within this circuit that works by independent contractors may qualify as so long as they were created at the instance and expense of the commissioning party.see dolman,at fellowship church,at.nor are we alone in applying the doctrine to a case in which an employer commissioned a work by an independent contractor.see estate of burne hogarth,at there is no distinction in the case law under the act between employees and independent contractors playboy,at see also murray gelderman,cir observing that the doctrine is applicable when the parties are an employer and an independent contractor forward thorogood,cir noting that,although previously confined to the traditional relationship,the doctrine has been expanded to include commissioned works created by an independent contractor.
to the extent that dastar argues that the supreme court decision in ccnv undermines our existing precedent,we are unpersuaded.first,as a preliminary matter,we considered two cases,both of which reaffirmed our law that works created by independent contractors at the instance and expense of a commissioning party are presumed to be.see fellowship church,at dolman,at.
second,the ccnv court considered the meaning of only under the copyright act.at.in recounting the history of the doctrine,the supreme court noted that under the act,the courts generally presumed that the commissioned party had impliedly agreed to convey the copyright,along with the work itself,to the hiring party.id.at.emphasis added.dastar argues,based on this statement,that if the commissioning party acquires the copyrights from the independent contractor through an implied agreement to convey,then the work was not made for hire because,with,the commissioning party automatically owns the copyright upon creation in the first is no need to convey any rights.see act,repealed author shall include the employer in the case of works made for hire.
we join the second circuit in rejecting that argument.see estate of burne hogarth,at.the ccnv court was clear that it was considering the meaning of the provision of the copyright act.at.no part of its decision rests on the meaning of the provision in the act,rendering its commentary dicta.see estate of burne hogarth,at w e conclude that the historical review in ccnv,if dictum at all,is dictum of a weak variety see also cetacean cmty.bush,cir a statement is dictum when it is made during the course of delivering a judicial opinion,but is unnecessary to the decision of the case and is therefore not precedential.internal citation,alterations,and quotation marks omitted to the extent necessary,we reaffirm the law of this circuit an independent contractor creates a when it was made at the instance and expense of the commissioning party,at.
having concluded that independent contractors may as a matter of law create,we consider whether in this case,as determined by the district judge in her capacity as the trier of fact,general eisenhower wrote crusade in europe at the instance and expense of doubleday.may,at.we review the district court conclusions of law following a bench trial de novo.friends of yosemite valley norton,cir.factual conclusions,however,are reviewed for clear error.id.
to the extent that dastar challenges the district court findings of fact,we find no clear error and affirm them.see id.at.the determinations of the district court must be upheld unless on review of all the evidence we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.easley cromartie,d.i t is for the district court to resolve the factual disputes and to draw inferences from that proof.husain olympic airways,cir.though our colleague in dissent would reach different factual conclusions from the evidence adduced at trial,we may not disturb the district court factual findings where we would have drawn different inferences or determined the facts differently.easley,at.thus,although we may agree with the dissent that the evidence presented could have permitted different inferences than the district court ultimately drew,we find no clear error in the district court findings of fact and adopt them in full for the purposes of our analysis.
we recently described the instance test as an inquiry into whether the motivating factor in producing the work was the employer who induced the creation.fellowship church,at quoting playboy,at.the instance test is shaped in part by the degree to which the hiring party had the right to control or supervise the artist work.fellowship church,at citing melville nimmer and david nimmer,nimmer on copyright,b a i.
general eisenhower case presents the prototypical situation where the motivating factor for producing the work was the employer inducement.general eisenhower spurned all book offers until approached by representatives from doubleday and tribune who convinced him to pen his personal account of the war.moreover,he did not begin the actual writing until after december.siegel periodical publ ns,cir.
where,as here,a reluctant author who historically had refused to engage in the creative process begins to write voraciously after being persuaded by a publisher,the evidence is sufficient to support the factual conclusion that the work was at the publisher instance.see playboy,at author work was created at the instance of the publisher where the author would not have created those particular works if he had not been given the assignments by the publisher.
this case stands in stark contrast to our decision in fellowship church.in that instance,we held that works created by a monk who had taken a vow of poverty,assigned all his possessions to the church he founded,and renounced any claim he may have for compensation,were not under the act.at.we concluded that because the works were motivated by the monk own desire for they were not.id.at see also forward,at holding that demo tapes prepared by the artist for the purposes of enticing a record company to produce and distribute them were not created at the instance of the employer siegel,at holding that the superman comic strip was not created at the employer instance where the superman character had been spawned by the author four years before the relationship between the authors and the employer picture music,bourne,cir holding a work is deemed for hire where the employer took the initiative in engaging the author to create the work.
dastar argues that the book could not have been created at doubleday instance because general eisenhower had been drafting notes and small portions of what he thought might ultimately coalesce into a full book prior to any agreement with doubleday to publish.the district court rejected that assertion as a matter of fact,finding that what general eisenhower himself described as attempts to draft a bit of narrative just to satisfy myself that i had something to say that was worth hearing,were nothing more than an experiment done more as a protection to him self in the event he ever did want to write.moreover,although general eisenhower used notes made throughout the war to jog and reinforce his memory,he otherwise wrote from scratch.critically,dastar did not introduce any evidence suggesting that general eisenhower had begun drafting the book before he reached his agreement with doubleday in december in sum,we think the factual record is more than sufficient to conclude that general eisenhower creation of crusade in europe was induced by doubleday.
additionally,we are satisfied by the evidence that doubleday had sufficient supervisory powers over general eisenhower authorship,a point which dastar does not contest.we note that complete control over the author work is not necessary.see picture music,at holding that supervision existed where the commissioning party had the power to accept,reject,or modify the work.instead,the issue is one of degree where the greater the degree of supervisory power and control a commissioning party has over an independent contractor,the more likely it is that the work was created at the commissioning party instance.
doubleday had a significant degree of supervision over general eisenhower writing.specifically,the district court determined that doubleday typical process for most books involved waiting for the manuscript to be completed,and then discussing possible improvements with the author.with crusade in europe,however,the degree of supervision was much greater than usual,including regular meetings between general eisenhower and doubleday during the writing process where its editorial board provided him with extensive notes and comments.doubleday also hired a fact checker who offered suggestions for modifications and additions where the original draft did not conform with historical facts.the district court did not clearly err in deciding that this evidence supported a conclusion that general eisenhower would not have written the work without the urging of doubleday and tribune.
moreover,there is little doubt that the book was authored at doubleday expense.doubleday took on all the financial risk of the book success,agreeing to pay general eisenhower a lump sum for writing the book,instead of negotiating a royalty deal.in addition,doubleday shouldered the expense for the entire staff who assisted general eisenhower in drafting the manuscript,including three secretaries,a fact checker,and the services of the editorial board at doubleday.finally,doubleday took responsibility for all the costs necessary to produce the maps and photographs that were included in the book.there was no evidence that general eisenhower paid for a single expense associated with writing and publishing the book.
we thus uphold the district court conclusion that,because general eisenhower would not have authored or published crusade in europe without doubleday convincing,and because there is no question that doubleday carried the financial load of preparing the book,it was in fact created at the instance and expense of the commissioning party.
where we determine that a work was produced at the instance and expense of another party,we indulge the legal presumption that it is a the copyright lies ab initio with the commissioning party.see dolman,at fellowship church,at.the work for hire presumption can be overcome by evidence of an agreement by which the employee or independent contractor retained the copyright in his work.dolman,at.
dastar argues that the october,contract purporting to assign all rights in crusade in europe to doubleday is inimical with the doctrine.had doubleday acquired the copyrights under the doctrine,there would be no need for a later assignment of those very rights.thus,according to dastar,the conveyance proves that the parties never intended the presumption to apply.
the presumption may be rebutted only by evidence that the parties did not intend to create a.see id.at,at holding that the evidence was insufficient to rebut the presumption because there was no evidence as to the circumstances or intendment of the parties.and thus,the contract alone,however,is insufficient to rebut the presumption,at.in,we faced a similar situation where just before the commencement of the lawsuit,the independent contractor author executed an assignment to the commissioning party of the copyrights in allegedly infringed drawings.at.we rejected the district court determination that the assignment demonstrated prior lack of title in the commissioning party because without any evidence as to the circumstances or intendment of its execution the agreement was insufficient to rebut the presumption.id.emphasis added.
the only rebuttal evidence of intent to which dastar points is the irs tax treatment of the book.we are,however,unconvinced that the tax treatment of a publishing deal bears on whether doubleday and general eisenhower intended the work to be a.doubleday and general eisenhower agreement to publish the book evidenced their intent to create a.as general eisenhower stated 
i ready to undertake this task but on one condition only it seems to me that every time the subject is brought up,people talk about all the various kinds of publishing rights and so on and i do want to be bothered with such things.now if you people can come up with a single package to cover the whole affair so that i do have to argue with too many people,i will probably undertake something.
thus,the record supports the district court conclusion that general eisenhower and doubleday contemplated a scenario where general eisenhower need never be concerned with the rights to the book.as the district court determined,the only reason that the parties did not execute a formal agreement purporting to create a in was to comply with the formalistic tax requirements set out by the irs.doubleday,in particular,was sensitive about not creating any formal written instrument that could potentially jeopardize capital gains treatment of the eisenhower strange concern had it been worried that delay in reducing the agreement to writing could have had a negative impact on its ownership of the copyright.
moreover,there is no evidence in the record that either general eisenhower or doubleday thought that doubleday did not own the copyright.nor is there evidence that general eisenhower thought that he had to legally transfer such title for doubleday to acquire title to the copyright.finally,doubleday acted in a manner consistent with its status as the copyright owner.when it renewed the copyright in,doubleday listed itself as the proprietor of the copyright as a.we agree with the district court that there is insufficient evidence to rebut the presumption that crusade in europe was a work created for hire 
dastar next argues that doubleday did not hire general eisenhower until february,and doubleday can only claim rights in material created after that date.we again disagree.the district court properly determined as a matter of fact that doubleday and general eisenhower entered into an agreement on december.we uphold its legal conclusion that the entire published contents of crusade in europe were properly copyrighted.
moreover,the district court determined that dastar admitted to copying without authorization substantial portions of crusade in europe to create campaigns in europe.dastar has presented no arguments that give us cause to reverse the district court judgment.we affirm the district court judgment of infringement.
dastar also claims on appeal that the district court erred by restricting the scope of the trial on remand.we disagree.we vacated the district court initial grant of summary judgment on twentieth century fox parties copyright infringement claim because the evidence raise d doubt as to eisenhower intent with respect to crusade in europe.twentieth century fox film entm t,cir unpublished.there is nothing in our prior decision that indicates that we issued an open remand.rather,in remanding to the district court,our opinion contemplates a trial to resolve the only remaining genuine issue of material fact general eisenhower intent to create a.see also dastar twentieth century fox film,d stating that the ninth circuit held that the tax treatment general eisenhower sought for his manuscript of the book created a triable issue as to whether he intended the book to be a work for hire.the district court properly conducted the trial we ordered.
we now consider the district court award of attorneys fees under under,the district court has discretion to award reasonable attorney s fee s to the prevailing party.a n award of attorney s fees to a prevailing party that furthers the underlying purposes of the copyright act is reposed in the sound discretion of the district courts fantasy,fogerty,cir.in awarding fees,the district court may consider the following factors frivolousness motivation objective unreasonableness both in the factual and legal components of the case and the need in particular circumstances to advance the dual goals of compensation and deterrence.fogerty fantasy,at.
a district court fee award does not constitute an abuse of discretion unless it is based on an inaccurate view of the law or a clearly erroneous finding of fact.fantasy,at quoting schwarz sec y of health human,cir.generally,a district court order on attorney s fees may be set aside if the court fails to state reasons for its decision mattel,walking mountain,cir.remand is required only where the record does not support the district court fee award.id.
nothing in the record,and none of dastar arguments,convince us that the district court abused its discretion in awarding fees based on the copyright claims.the mere fact that it relied on its earlier findings to support its fee award does not equate with a failure to articulate reasons for an award.quite the contrary,as all the parties agree,the district court incorporated its earlier findings into its december fee award,thereby providing us with a sufficient basis to determine that it considered the factors listed in fantasy,fogerty see magnuson video yesteryear,at.
similarly,we reject dastar claim that the district court improperly granted fees to twentieth century fox parties for defending against dastar unfair competition and slander claims.fee awards may include costs and fees associated with defending against counterclaims if the counterclaims involve a common core of facts or are based on related legal theories.webb sloan,cir emphasis omitted.dastar counterclaims are predicated on its assertion that doubleday did not own the copyright to crusade in europe,and are thus sufficiently related.
finally,dastar argues that the district court improperly awarded fees generated by twentieth century fox parties in defending against dastar prior appeal of the district court summary judgment award.relying heavily on circuit rules and,dastar contends that the district court was without jurisdiction to award appeal fees,primarily because twentieth century fox parties did not first file an application with us to recover fees and expenses.
in cabrales los angeles,cir,we held that a party requesting fees under,a fee and cost provision similar in form to,see,was improperly denied fees for an intermediate appellate stage of its litigation where it was unsuccessful,although it was ultimately successful on the merits of its claims.in that case,the plaintiff secured a judgment from the district court that was affirmed on appeal.id.at.the supreme court vacated our decision,however,and remanded for reconsideration.id.we affirmed our prior holding and reinstated the district court judgment.id.after the supreme court denied the defendant second petition for certiorari,the plaintiff moved in the supreme court for its attorneys fees.id.the supreme court then remanded to the district court which awarded her attorneys fees for work done on the second petition,but not the first.id.we reversed,holding that plaintiffs are to be compensated for attorney s fees incurred for services that contribute to the ultimate victory in the lawsuit.id.at see also naacp richmond,cir remanding to the district court to award attorneys fees for services at the trial and appellate level to the appellant,who ultimately prevailed.
we think the same rationale is applicable here.rare,indeed,is the litigant who does lose some skirmishes on the way to winning the war.lawsuits usually involve many reasonable disputed issues and a lawyer who takes on only those battles he is certain of winning is probably not serving his client vigorously enough cabrales,at.we see no abuse of discretion in the district court decision to award twentieth century fox parties its fees for the prior summary judgment appeal.
dastar further argues that the district court erred in awarding costs under because only costs specified as taxable costs in can be included in an attorneys fee award.on this final point we again disagree with dastar.section provides that the court in its discretion may allow the recovery of full costs by or against any party.section,however,limits the costs taxable against the losing party,enumerating five categories of costs that may be awarded.
in crawford fitting gibbons,d,the supreme court considered the power of the federal courts to require a losing party to pay the compensation of the winning party expert witness.holding that costs taxable under.d are limited to those set forth in and,the supreme court explained that a ny argument that a federal court is empowered to exceed the limitations explicitly set out in and without plain evidence of congressional intent to supersede those sections ignores our longstanding practice of construing statutes in pari materia.crawford fitting,at.
while we have not considered the question,our brethren who have addressed the issue are split.in pinkham camex,cir,for example,the eighth circuit concluded that did not clearly evidence congressional intent that it exceeded the scope of costs authorized by.id.at see also artisan contractors ass n,of,frontier ins,cir.on the other hand,the seventh circuit has suggested that costs,outside the gambit of those available under,may be awarded under.susan wakeen doll ashton drake galleries,cir a ny award of fees and costs must come through,and not through the general cost provisions of.see also invessys,cir holding that costs of electronic legal research,costs not enumerated as taxable under,are nevertheless reimbursable under coles wonder,cir affirming award of costs under without discussion.
crawford fitting instructs us to carefully inspect for clear evidence of congressional intent that costs should be available.we respectfully disagree with those circuits who have concluded differently,but we think that there can be no other import to the phrase full costs within.construing as limiting the costs that may be awarded to any particular subset of taxable costs effectively reads the word full out of the statute.we must give every word in a statute meaning.to do otherwise would be to violate the long standing principle of statute interpretation that statutes should not be construed to make surplusage of any provision.northwest forest res.council glickman,cir internal alteration omitted.thus,we hold that district courts may award otherwise costs,including those that lie outside the scope of,under.
i respectfully dissent from the opinion of my colleagues.i do not agree that eisenhower and doubleday intended crusade in europe to be a under the copyright act.given the state of copyright law at the time that eisenhower and doubleday entered their agreement,i do not believe the parties intended that the work be for hire as that term was then understood.furthermore,the contract between eisenhower and doubleday,the tax treatment that eisenhower received for the manuscript,and the evidence in the record that several publishers were offered the opportunity to compete for the right to publish eisenhower manuscript point to one conclusion only that eisenhower sold doubleday a product,not his services.thus,i conclude that crusade in europe was not written as a work for hire,and accordingly would reverse the district court judgment in favor of doubleday.
as the majority explains,the copyright act does not contain a definition for the term.the majority describes how courts have developed the doctrine establishing the meaning of the term,and how that doctrine has evolved to encompass a broader range of employment relationships.as the majority acknowledges,this doctrine initially held that only works created by traditional employees fell under the work for hire doctrine.see also cmty for creative reid,d ccnv,fellowship church ananda church of,cir.it was not until the that this circuit for the first time included work created by independent contractors in the scope of the work for hire doctrine.ccnv,at.builders hardware gertler,cir.the presumption that a given work is for hire is simply presumption,based on the presumed mutual intent of the parties.may,cir.i conclude that as the law stood in,it is unlikely that either party to the transaction viewed the sale of crusade in europe to doubleday as the creation of a work for hire.no one has suggested that in,when eisenhower entered his deal with doubleday,he was in a traditional employment relationship with doubleday.yet the law governing work for hire in extended only to such relationships.thus,i fail to see how the majority can conclude that the parties intended the work to be for hire when that doctrine was understood to encompass only works created by employees.
furthermore,in making its factual findings,the district court relied heavily on documents and testimony addressing eisenhower and doubleday hindsight reconstruction of the events,to the exclusion of other evidence in the record that cast the events in a different light.for instance,the record contains evidence that eisenhower had been seeking a publisher prior to his meeting with doubleday,such as note
