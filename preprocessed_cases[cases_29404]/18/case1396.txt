in this action for breach of contract and related causes of action,commercial tenants alleged that their landlord,pacific rim park,llc prp,had been unfairly charging them the cost of its llc taxes and fees.plaintiffs further alleged that prp had failed to provide reasonably detailed annual statements of the expenses they were required to pay under their leases.in a prp alleged that one of the tenants,tin tin corporation tin tin,had breached its lease by failing to remodel the premises it occupied.after a court trial,neither party recovered,and both appeal.we find merit in plaintiffs first argument and reverse on that ground alone.
background 
in november steven caserza formed prp,a limited liability company,expressly to acquire and operate the pacific rim park shopping center.the center was occupied by a number of business tenants anchored by tin tin corporation,a grocery store.each business rented the premises under a lease that differed in some respects from others,but they all included one term,the lessee share of common area operating expenses.these cam expenses or cams were defined in four of the leases as all costs incurred by lessor relating to the ownership and operation of the project.the other form of lease used for most tenancies was similar,although it referred to the shopping center rather than the project.in each case the definition of common area operating expenses was followed by a list of examples,such as maintenance and improvement costs,utilities,property management and other property services,real property taxes,and insurance premiums.each tenant share of these cam expenses was based on the proportion of space the tenant occupied relative to the entire premises.
in,of the tenants in the shopping center sued prp for breach of contract,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and fraud.the plaintiffs alleged that prp had inflated the amounts it had incurred for the cams and had failed to provide a reasonably detailed statement showing each tenant actual share of the cam charges for the prior year.the parties settled that action,with the tenants to pay a lower amount in accordance with a newer method of calculating the management,accounting,and administrative fees.
on december,tenants commenced the instant action against prp,asserting breach of contract,fraud,unfair business practices,and related causes of action.plaintiffs again alleged that the cam charges were excessive this time they specifically sought restitution for the llc fees collected by the franchise tax board for through,totaling.plaintiffs further alleged that prp had failed to provide a reasonably detailed statement showing each tenant actual share of the cams for the preceding year.plaintiffs requested damages,an accounting,injunctive relief,and a judicial declaration of each party rights and duties under the leases.
prp for breach of the lease,declaratory relief,and related claims.prp alleged that tin tin corporation had failed to remodel its premises as required by its lease,and that another tenant,all luck enterprises,llc all luck had breached its lease by failing to maintain insurance policies for prp benefit.because plaintiffs new complaint contained the same claims as in the prior action,prp further alleged that nine of the plaintiffs had breached the settlement agreement.
the matter was tried by the court in may.plaintiffs sought to prove that prp had improperly included as a cam expense its llc fees and taxes.they further argued that the annual statement of cams did not provide details of the actual expenses incurred,and that prp had not adequately complied with their requests for more information.
the court granted nonsuit on plaintiffs causes of action for fraud,breach of fiduciary duty,and accounting.on october,after hearing testimony and considering the parties briefs,the court found in prp favor on plaintiffs complaint.the court specifically found that plaintiffs were properly charged the challenged llc fees and taxes because those were costs relating to the ownership and operation of the shopping center within the definition of common area operating expenses.in the court view,llc fees and expenses fell into the category of real property taxes,a term defined in the leases and included on the list of cam expenses that could be passed on to the tenants.as to the second claim,the court ruled that plaintiffs had waived their right to a more detailed annual statement.they had received an annual letter in the same format for several years without complaining or asking for more detail instead,they had only asked for more information.prp had then provided a detailed accounting of the cam charges,and when plaintiffs requested invoices to support the accounting,they received those as well.thus,the court found,prp had substantially complied with the contract requirement and plaintiffs had demonstrated their willingness to overlook any lack of detail in the annual letter in favor of access to the source material.
addressing the,the court found in prp favor on the cause of action for declaratory relief,but against prp on its claims against tin tin and all luck for breach of contract.the court ruled that prp allegation that tin tin had breached its promise to remodel its premises before march,was barred by the statute of limitations,and the court rejected prp assertions of equitable tolling and estoppel.the court further ruled against prp on its claim that all luck had failed to maintain insurance,as prp had suffered no damages as a result of that lapse.
both sides have appealed.plaintiffs contend that the leases did not permit the lessor to pass through its llc fees to its tenants,and they renew their claim that prp had failed to provide a reasonably detailed statement of the cam charges as required by the leases.prp challenges the court ruling that its was barred by the statute of limitations.
discussion 
llc fees and taxes as common area maintenance expenses 
on appeal,plaintiffs contend that the court misinterpreted the cam provisions to allow prp to charge them with its llc fees and taxes.these expenses,plaintiffs argue,are voluntary costs of doing business solely for the personal benefit and protection of the to shield himself from liability and unlike common area operational expenses which are related solely to the repair,maintenance and operation of the land and improvements.
the parties disagree on the standard this court must apply in reviewing plaintiffs challenge on appeal.prp insists that to the extent the issues are even cognizable review for substantial evidence is the correct standard because conflicting extrinsic evidence was presented on the meaning of the lease term common area operating expenses.plaintiffs maintain that there is no factual dispute on this issue and that we must decide de novo whether llc fees are cam expenses.although plaintiffs advocate independent review in vague terms without citation of relevant authority,their position is the more accurate in the procedural circumstances presented here.the key issue before us is whether the lease term common area operating expenses encompasses llc fees.the trial court appears to have answered this question primarily,if not exclusively,by resort to the contract language itself.when the meaning of the contract language may be determined without the aid of extrinsic evidence,we generally apply a de novo standard of review to the construction of the instrument.under statutory rules of contract interpretation,the mutual intention of the parties at the time the contract is formed governs interpretation.such intent is to be inferred,if possible,solely from the written provisions of the contract.asp properties group fard,th,d,citing the civil code.it is therefore solely a judicial function to interpret a written instrument unless the interpretation turns upon the credibility of extrinsic evidence.accordingly,an appellate court is not bound by a construction of the contract based solely upon the terms of the written instrument without the aid of evidence citations,where there is no conflict in the evidence citations or a determination has been made upon incompetent evidence citation.parsons bristol development cal d,see also city of hope nat.medical center genentech,cal th,d,contract interpretation is solely a judicial function when based on the words of the instrument alone,when there is no conflict in the extrinsic evidence,or a determination was made based on incompetent evidence.to the extent that the testimony adduced by the parties revealed a meaning of which the contract was reasonably susceptible,we defer to the court determination of those witnesses credibility and apply the substantial evidence rule to that determination.see benach county of los angeles th,d morey vannucci th,d.nevertheless,we believe,as the trial court apparently did,that the question of whether the leases permitted the lessor to pass through these costs to the tenants can be resolved by examining the particular language used by the parties.
in its statement of decision the court stated that the leases at issue were absolute leases,allowing the landlord to pass on all costs relating to operation and ownership of the shopping center to the tenants.the trial court finding that these were absolute leases appears to be based on the opinion of defense expert randol mackley,who drew a distinction between and absolute leases.having examined the lease form currently utilized in the shopping center,he testified that this lease was an absolute lease,which goes beyond a lease and requires the tenants to absorb responsibility for the cost and ownership of the shopping center,including,for example,the roof and structure of the buildings.absolute leases,according to mackley,were far less common in shopping centers than their counterparts.
notwithstanding the witness characterization,however,the titles or labels themselves have no legal significance and are not decisive of the extent to which the parties intended to shift the expense burdens of various operating,repair and maintenance obligations from landlord to tenant.rather,the allocation of cost responsibilities is dictated by the substance of the lease.cal.practice guide real property transactions.we will defer to the court implicit finding that mackley was credible as to his description and labeling of these leases but we will independently determine the meaning of the specific terms they contain.
the appellate record contains leases from only four of the plaintiffs,but the trial court found there were essentially two versions among the forms.according to prp brief,four leases followed the version used for tin tin tenancy,while eight used language similar to the lease of nationwide real estate investments,nationwide in the nationwide version,the lessor had the right to charge the tenants with all costs relating to the ownership and operation of the shopping center.the four leases like those of tin tin and all luck defined cam charges as those relating to the ownership and operation of the project.the project was specifically defined as t he premises,the building,the common areas,the land upon which they are located,and all other buildings and improvements thereon.
as noted earlier,each lease goes on to list examples of common area operating expenses chargeable to the tenants.all of them relate to the condition of the common areas and improvements they include utilities,pest control and trash services,and maintenance of the facilities and walkways.the charges also include premiums for rental loss insurance,property insurance covering loss or damage to the premises,and liability insurance based upon or arising out of the ownership,use,occupancy or maintenance of the premises and all areas appurtenant thereto.thus,all of the enumerated elements of common area operating expenses pertain directly to the physical existence of the shopping center.
the court pointed out that prp was a entity,created for the sole purpose of owning and operating the shopping center.accordingly,all of the llc taxes and fees were based solely on income received from the operation of the center.the court finding that prp was created for the purpose of owning and operating the center is unassailable.however,the fees and taxes prp paid as an llc were not dependent on the nature of its function as a property owner,but on the fact that it chose to do business in this state and received revenue from that business.an llc tax is imposed on an llc for the privilege of doing business in this state,subd.a.the annual llc fee,as currently defined,is based on the amount of total income received from all sources derived from or attributable to this state.the former version of the fee statute,the one under consideration here,more generally made the fee applicable to income from all sources reportable to this state for the taxable year.former,subd.a.
two divisions of the first district recently held that the llc fee in former section was in essence a tax,notwithstanding its name.northwest energetic services,llc california franchise tax bd.th,d accord,ventas finance i,llc california franchise tax bd.th,d.plaintiffs expert testified that the fee paid by llcs was tantamount,really,to an income tax on the gross receipts of the llc.prp expert,dennis young,testified that an llc fee is not an income tax because it a gross receipts fee,but he agreed that gross receipts is another way of saying gross income.young also described it as a holding fee paid to the state of california for the privilege of operating in california under that entity sic.italics added.the parties agree that the llc fee,which is collected by the franchise tax board,is in the nature of a tax.
we believe the llc fees and taxes are in essence a cost of conducting business in a particular legal form.as prp expert witness acknowledged,an individual owner would not be subjected to the llc fee had the entity business been any other occupation with the same income,it would have been subject to the same assessments.those assessments were the costs of functioning as an llc,regardless of the type of business that generated the income.that the llc was created for the sole purpose of owning and operating the shopping center does not change the nature of the fee and tax as a cost of maintaining a business entity,nor does it alter the terms of the lease to include such business costs based solely on the entity choice to engage in this particular business activity.we conclude,therefore,that llc fees and taxes did not qualify as costs relating to the ownership and operation of the project within the meaning of the contract term common area operating expenses.stony brook corporation boston,tax on the income of a lessor corporation is not a tax on its property,and cases discussed therein.
prp maintains,however,that one of the listed examples of cam charges,real property taxes,was phrased broadly enough to encompass llc fees and taxes.we disagree.though ineptly drafted,both the heading and the definition of real property taxes in each lease appear to refer to assessments based on the nature of the property and the owner property interest.
the definitions of this element are slightly different between the two versions.the tin tin and all luck leases,for example,provided as used herein,the term real property taxes shall include any form of assessment,real estate,general,special,ordinary or extraordinary,or rental levy or tax other than inheritance,personal income or estate taxes improvement bond license fee imposed upon or levied against any legal or equitable interest of lessor in the project,lessor right to other income therefrom,lessor business of leasing,by any authority having the direct or indirect power to tax and where the funds are generated with reference to the project address and where the proceeds so generated are to be applied by the city,county or other local taxing authority of a jurisdiction within which the project is located.the term real property taxes shall also include any tax,fee,levy,assessment or charge imposed by reason of events occurring during the term of this lease,including but not limited to,a change in the ownership of the project or any portion thereof or a change in the improvements thereon.
this provision is indeed broad,as the trial court observed,but it refers to assessments against real property interests,not the privilege of doing business or the income generated by the conduct of the business.contrary to prp reading,each of the forms of assessment or levy listed in the definition of real property taxes does not stan d complete by itself but is modified by the ending phrase imposed upon or levied against any legal or equitable interest of lessor in the project,lessor right to other income therefrom,lessor business of leasing,by any authority having the direct or indirect power to tax and where the funds are generated with reference to the project address and where the proceeds so generated are to be applied by the city,county or other local taxing authority of a jurisdiction within which the project is located.thus,it is not just any tax or assessment that meets the definition,as prp argues.read as a whole,the definition of real property taxes appears to refer to payments directly applicable to the property itself,not to the form in which the lessor has chosen to operate its business 
prp further reads the provision to encompass llc fees and taxes because they are generated with reference to the project address that is,they are dependent upon and calculated based on the income derived from the shopping center,which is located in california.in our view,the source of the income is relevant only in determining whether the llc is subject to the section fee and how much is owed each year.like the section tax,the fee is imposed because the taxpayer is an llc,not because it owns real property.
the leases of nationwide and cheng were representative of those using a slightly different definition of real property taxes real property tax definition.as used herein,the term real property taxes shall include any form of real estate tax or assessment,general,special,ordinary or extraordinary,and any license fee,commercial rental tax,improvement bond or bonds,levy or tax other than inheritance,personal income or estate taxes imposed upon the industrial center by any authority having the direct or indirect power to tax,including any city,state or federal government,or any school,agricultural,sanitary,fire,street,drainage,or other improvement district thereof,levied against any legal or equitable interest of lessor in the industrial center or any portion thereof,lessor right to rent or other income therefrom,lessor business of leasing the premises.the term real property taxes shall also include any tax,fee,levy,assessment or charge,or any increase therein,imposed by reason of events occurring during the term of this lease 
again prp rests its position on an incomplete reading of the provision.the contract does not define the term simply as any form of levy or tax without qualification it must be a a real estate tax or assessment or b a license fee,tax,or other either case,one that is imposed upon the industrial center,and subject to other qualifying conditions the language beginning with levied against any legal or equitable interest of lessor in the industrial center does not have a clear antecedent.the most reasonable reading of this disjointed clause inserts no words,thus referring back to both the real estate tax or assessment and the license fee and other taxes.thus,all of the assessments covered by the provision must be those that are levied against any legal or equitable interest of lessor in the industrial center or any portion thereof,lessor right to rent or other income therefrom,lessor business of leasing the premises.if the unattached clause was intended instead to refer to a fee,levy,or tax that is imposed upon the industrial center,it lacks a conjunction that would make the sentence complete and coherent in any interpretation of the ambiguous sentence,however,the contemplated assessments are those directly connected to the lessor property interest.that an llc incidentally is involved in the business of leasing property does not make the fees and taxes it pays real estate taxes.
we thus conclude that the leases in the record before us contemplate a more direct connection to the property than is represented by the form of the business entity that owns the property.while we agree with the trial court statement that plaintiffs agreed to bear the costs of ownership of the property,llc taxes and fees are not the costs of owning property but the costs of operating a business in a form that limits the personal liability of its principal.
reasonably detailed statement 
each lease required the lessor to provide a reasonably detailed statement of the tenant share of cam expenses incurred during the preceding year.in the first cause of action of their complaint,plaintiffs alleged that prp had breached that contractual obligation for through,by providing only a letter summarizing the expenses without sufficient information to enable the tenants to reconcile the charges with their payments.the trial court found that plaintiffs had waived their right to a more detailed statement by accepting the letter for several years without asking for a more comprehensive statement.instead,the tenants had asked prp for more information about the expenses.prp had then provided a detailed accounting of the charges and,when requested,invoices to support the accounting.thus,the court found,prp had substantially complied with the contract requirement.given the tenants willingness to overlook any lack of detail in the annual letter in favor of access to the source material,plaintiffs can not now complain that the notices they received were inadequate.
on appeal,plaintiffs contend that the court abused its discretion in making this ruling,because they had in fact objected that the letter contained insufficient detail,through their repeated requests for documentation to remedy the deficiency.as prp points out,this issue involved questions of fact that we review for substantial evidence engalla permanente medical group,cal th,d,long beach unified sch.dist.state of california d.
plaintiffs have pointed to testimony at trial regarding the tenants uncertainty over the actual cam amounts spent and their requests for further information.the respondent appendix also contains correspondence in which requests were made for this information.however,even if this evidence did not support the court finding of waiver,we note that the court second finding is unchallenged.plaintiffs do not contest the court determination that the additional information provided on each occasion through the accounting and its supporting invoices was sufficient to address the tenants concerns and thus comply with the contract requirement.plaintiffs failure to object to the additional information suggests that prp adequately complied with their request and thus either satisfied the contract term or cured any initial deficiency in compliance.as we are not offered any argument to the contrary,the lower court finding is upheld.
prp tin tin promise to remodel 
the july lease between tin tin and the original lessor required tin tin to remodel its premises beginning no later than september,and complete the work no later than march.failure to adhere to these dates would constitute a default unless a the delay has been approved by lessor in writing,or b the delay was for causes beyond the reasonable control of lessee provided lessee has given lessor written notice of such delay s within ten days of the occurrence of the event causing such delay s.
as of march,however,the work was not yet underway.on september,steven caserza,manager of prp,sent a letter reminding tin tin of the contract provision and asserting that tin tin continue d to be in breach of the lease for failing to complete the improvements by the contract deadline.referring to michael lim,the store manager,caserza added,michael has indicated to me that you plan to do the improvements in.therefore,please provide us with the following,as required by your lease caserza then requested nine documents pertinent to the contemplated work,including preliminary plans,permits and permit applications,and construction contracts.for any information that was not yet available,caserza demanded copies of current drafts an
