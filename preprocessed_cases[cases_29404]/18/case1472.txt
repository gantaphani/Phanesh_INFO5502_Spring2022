in addition,the jury found that ajaxo was the owner or licensee of a trade secret.the jury found that e trade disclosed that trade secret to everypathwithout ajaxo consent,and that e trade knew or had reason to know that e trade knowledge of the trade secret was acquired under circumstances giving rise to a duty to maintain its secrecy or limit its use.the jury determined that ajaxo proved by clear and convincing evidence that e trade acted willfully and maliciously in misappropriating ajaxo trade secret.
as to everypath,the jury found that ajaxo proved that everypath acquired and used ajaxo trade secret without ajaxo express or implied consent.furthermore,the jury found that ajaxo proved that everypath knew or had reason to know that everypath knowledge of the trade secret derived from or through a person who owed a duty to ajaxo to maintain its secrecy.moreover,the jury found that ajaxo proved by clear and convincing evidence that everypath acted willfully and maliciously in misappropriating ajaxo trade secret.
issues on appeal 
e trade issues on appeal 
e trade raises three issues on appeal.first,e trade contends that some of the court evidentiary rulings deprived e trade of its right to a fair trial.second,the court erred in denying e trade motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.finally,the court abused its discretion in finding that ajaxo was the prevailing party under civil code section.
ajaxo issues on appeal 
ajaxo raises five issues on appeal.first,ajaxo contends that the court erred in granting e trade and everypath motion for nonsuit on damages for e trade and everypath misappropriation of ajaxo trade secret.second,the court erred in granting e trade and everypath motion for nonsuit on ajaxo claim for a reasonable royalty.third,the court erroneous grant of nonsuit on damages deprived ajaxo of an award of exemplary damages.fourth,the trial court erred in denying ajaxo injunctive relief.finally,the court erred in failing to award attorney fees for work.
everypath issues on appeal 
assuming that this court finds merit in any of ajaxo contentions on appeal,everypath raises the following issues.first,everypath contends that the court erred in denying its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict jnov on the jury findings that everypath had willfully and maliciously misappropriated ajaxo trade secret and that everypath authorized or ratified the willful and malicious misappropriation of ajaxo trade secret.second,everypath contends that the court evidentiary rulings denied everypath its right to a fair trial 
we find merit in ajaxo first issue on appeal.accordingly,we reverse and remand this case to the lower court for a new trial on damages for e trade and everypath misappropriation of ajaxo trade secret.
we set forth in detail the evidence adduced in the trial.
facts and trial testimony 
ajaxo and e trade 
the name ajaxo stands for advanced java architecture for extensible objects.sing koo formed ajaxo to market a sophisticated stock trading technology called wirelessproxy xo,the development of which was completed by april.ultimately,among other things,koo wirelessproxy xo technology allowed its users to buy and sell stock over the internet using wireless devices,including the new wireless phones.
in,ajaxo was a small company headed by its sole shareholder and investor,koo.koo wife,connie chun,was ajaxo director of marketing.as such,she managed the marketing side of the business.
in early september,chun sent a marketing email to e trade.she received a reply from dan baca,a senior engineer at e trade,on september.jerry gramaglia,chief marketing officer at e trade,had asked baca to find a wireless system to allow e trade to participate in the sprint internet phone launch.baca testified that e trade wanted to be competitive in the wireless space and provide wireless access and trading.baca emphasized to ajaxo that e trade needed to beta test wireless stock trading on sprint phones using device markup language hdml by october.
on the same day as baca contacted chun,e trade provided ajaxo a mutual agreement nda.under the terms of the nda,ajaxo and e trade promised to take all precautions to protect the other proprietary information and hold it confidential.the nda defined proprietary information as including,without limitation,trade secrets,patents,patent applications,copyrights,processes,ideas,inventions whether patentable or not,formulas,computer programs,databases,technical drawings,designs,algorithms,technology,circuits,layouts,designs,interfaces,materials,schematics,names and expertise of employees and consultants,any other technical,business,financial,customer and product development plans,supplier information,forecasts,strategies and other confidential information 
the nda described the penalties for breach of the agreement.in addition,it required immediate notification if one party believed the other might have released proprietary information.chun signed the nda on september,and faxed it to e trade the same day thereafter,baca sent two pages of functional specifications to chun detailing e trade wireless trading requirements.chun reviewed the specifications and called baca.baca wanted to know if ajaxo could meet the october deadline for beta testing.chun told baca that she thought they could,but would let him know after she had spoken to the technical side.
in response to baca request for a technical paper,chun sent e trade a white paper overview of the wirelessproxy xo technology.over the weekend of september,koo built a prototype application specifically for e trade using the wirelessproxy xo technology to deliver a look and feel according to e trade functional specification.on sunday,september,chun informed baca by email that they were ready to demonstrate their technology.
the next day,koo and chun met with baca and others at e trade.koo was told that a few people wanted to view the demonstration.accordingly,rather than using a wireless phone,koo used a phone emulator on a notebook computer to show the operation of his technology.koo explained that this was because the screen is bigger than a phone screen.
koo had a personal e trade account.thus,he used his own e trade user identification number and his personal e trade password to access e trade web site in the demonstration.then,koo entered a personal identification number pin code to access the ajaxo computer through which the wirelessproxy xo technology works.koo utilized the pin code to protect the ajaxo system from unauthorized access.
after koo and chun demonstrated that they could complete a stock trade,they logged off and allowed some of the e trade personnel to enter their own e trade accounts.when it came to entering the ajaxo pin code,the e trade personnel were not allowed to enter it.koo entered the code after koo entered the ajaxo pin code,e trade personnel entered the e trade web site wirelessly through ajaxo technology.chun described the e trade personnel as excited at seeing the ajaxo demonstration.
the e trade engineers asked numerous questions.koo explained to the e trade group that his special type of wireless proxy server operates between the e trade web site and the wireless gateway the server for the wireless device.using drawings and diagrams,koo explained how the technology worked and answered many questions from the e trade engineers.koo testified that a proxy server is nothing new,but his proxy is a superproxy.koo used an analogy to describe in general terms the function served by his superproxy.he analogized it to comparison shopping where one sees a product and wants three price quotes.using one device,his system can go to three web sites,obtain three price quotes,extract data from complicated screens with pictures and graphics,and deliver three quotes to the small mobile device.thus,koo explained that his wirelessproxy xo established sessions with servers and delivered select bits of information to small screens.
as koo explained his technology,he answered e trade more probing questions about such things as buffering the cookie and how to sustain the session.he explained initialization and destruction of a session.the e trade engineers asked about koo operating platform,the use of different languages,load balancing,number of transactions and other matters.koo explained the software and its architecture.
during the meeting,pamela kramer complained that the procedure was cumbersome and asked koo to develop a system using four digits.kramer asked koo to change the e trade application to allow users with multiple accounts to switch accounts.
on september,koo made the changes that e trade had requested.the next day chun called baca to offer a second demonstration.koo and chun arrived at e trade that day for another interactive meeting armed with various wireless devices.koo demonstrated the login feature.he had tied a pin code to a database that included his personal e trade user name and password in order to access his proxy server 
baca asked koo how he had created the login system.koo explained to baca the automatic filing of a form by use of the pin code.baca said that he was not familiar with this automatic process and asked koo for the pin.koo refused to give baca the pin code,because it was tied to koo personal e trade account.koo entered the code,however,and then held up a phone showing four asterisks.
subsequently,koo and chun had another meeting with baca during which there were other technical discussions.at another meeting,e trade inquired whether ajaxo was looking for a venture partner.ajaxo responded that it was not,but proposed terms for e trade use of ajaxo technology.ajaxo total price for use of its wirelessproxy xo was.
on september,chun received an email from baca with some revised functional specifications.baca continued to pose technical questions,which ajaxo answered.
the product manager for e trade wireless application on the business side,joe raymond,telephoned chun on october.he stated that e trade was considering putting their customers on the ajaxo platform,but e trade needed to have some more technical conversation so as to ascertain if it would be fair and befitting to put e trade customers on their platform.at this time,raymond knew ajaxo had successfully demonstrated its capabilities and no other vendor had demonstrated trading capability on a wireless phone.raymond testified that e trade needed even more information because if the system ever failed,e trade engineers would have to troubleshoot.chun told raymond that ajaxo preferred to have an agreement in place before there were more technical discussions.raymond told chun that he was working with his attorneys to prepare a in response to ajaxo initial proposal.
during the phone call to chun,raymond set an october meeting date for e trade to obtain more information.raymond indicated to chun and koo that he would be present at the october meeting.believing that a contract was soon to be forthcoming,koo prepared for what he thought was a technology transfer meeting because of the very tight timetable.koo printed out from his server a hard copy of the e trade prototype programming information.in addition,he used a java doc utility to generate a java document containing all the interfaces that were used in the prototype program.koo created two binders.one binder contained biographical information about koo,including his background and his experience.the other binder contained technical information,plus diagrams illustrating the workings of ajaxo technology.
at the october meeting,koo and chun expected raymond to appear with a contract or a counter proposal.instead,baca showed up with dan miley and guy albanese baca wanted more information about user interfaces and how ajaxo built an application program.in addition,baca wanted to know about data transfers from a large page to the small screen.among other things,baca posed questions about device output,the cache,and commentator.koo and the e trade personnel engaged in a deeper level discussion of the wirelessproxy model.koo explained to baca how the wirelessproxy xo could overcome problems with the phone memory.according to koo,at no time did baca express dissatisfaction with the answers that koo provided.baca asked for a copy of koo technical binder.koo explained,however,that he had prepared only one copy,which he could not give up.
on october,raymond told chun that baca needed the technical binder and that a contract was in the work s.the same day,koo and chun drove to e trade and gave the technical binder to baca.baca made a copy of the technical binder and returned the original to koo.
by october,koo had had five meetings with e trade in which he had explained his technology.as a result,according to koo,e trade had sufficient information to implement koo wirelessproxy xo technology.
in october,koo performed some maintenance on the security system for the ajaxo server.he noticed that there had been unauthorized entries into ajaxo computer.all of these unauthorized entries used the pin code koo had created for the e trade demonstration.all the intrusions into the ajaxo computer occurred between september and september.subsequently,koo reported the unauthorized access to the fbi squad and the security exchange commission.
in march,koo learned that baca had the pin code and had provided it to other members of the e trade technical team baca admitted that he had used and given other members of the technical team the pin code.in addition,he admitted that he used a phone emulator to access ajaxo system 
on october,e trade gave ajaxo a letter of intent stating that it would pay xxxx for the wirelessproxy xo technology.raymond said that the xxxx would be specified in a forthcoming formal agreement.e trade issued a new document on october entitled memorandum of terms.e trade proposed to pay ajaxo upon signing the letter of intent and on december,at the end of the development phase.finally,there was an option to pay per device platform.koo and chun agreed to e trade terms and wanted to sign the agreement.raymond told them that the document needed to be printed on e trade letterhead and that it would be ready for signing the next morning.
when koo returned to e trade the next day,he met with pamela kramer.kramer told him that she did not have enough in her budget to meet the terms of the contract and needed to discuss it with her boss.she told koo and chun she would visit ajaxo on november.
when kramer and raymond visited ajaxo on november,kramer told koo and chun that e trade had decided not to do business with ajaxo.according to koo,kramer told him that ajaxo was too small to be an e trade partner and that since she had learned about the ajaxo technology she was ready to go out and find somebody in a different league to implement it.according to chun,kramer said that with the technology e trade had learned from ajaxo,e trade could have another vendor in a different league do the wireless application.
pursuant to the terms of the nda,chun wrote to the chief executive officer ceo of e trade about what had occurred and ajaxo concerns about the threatened misappropriation of ajaxo technology.
during and part of,everypath focus was on accessing the internet with regular voice telephones.the everypath voice enabling system aimed to transmit text from a web site,which was then translated into a voice on a telephone.around may,everypath was in contact with e trade about developing a demonstration for e trade of everypath voice application.
in the fall of,everypath learned from guy albanese at e trade that everypath chances of getting funded by e trade would be better if everypath moved from a voice product to a data product.moreover,albanese told everypath that e trade was leaning more towards data access than voice access of the internet.
in all of,everypath had no customers for its voice product.thus,in the fall of everypath shifted in orientation toward data access and left behind the voice product.however,before the switch from voice to data,in the timeframe,everypath did not have a product did have the business did have a team.
the day after baca met with koo and chun for ajaxo second demonstration of its technology,where technical discussions took place about such things as cookies,baca met with everypath personnel.guy albanese referred everypath to baca.on the same day,an everypath employee by the name of prasad krothapalli sent an email message to piyush goel,one of everypath founders,in which he outlined assignments for his group members.one of the assignments for an employee by the name of roopak was support for session specific cookies with httpclient,one week.assignments for roopak included support for user name and password,persistent cookies,bug fixing and infrastructure for data cleansing support.
baca left e trade in december and started work at everypath on december.
e trade selected everypath as its wireless vendor.on december,e trade sent everypath a letter of intent and memorandum of terms for a development agreement.by early,everypath had a team and had venture capital funding.everypath worked with e trade to implement a complete wireless solution that met e trade specification.in march,everypath and e trade entered into an application development and service provider agreement.e trade paid everypath for its product.
before october,e trade had an investment arm called e trade ventures.arrowpath,a limited liability corporation,came into existence in october.
tom bevilacqua,the managing partner of arrowpath,testified that e trade was one of arrowpath investors.arrowpath venture fund was the general partner in a limited partnership called the ecommerce fund.e trade was a percent contributor to the ecommerce fund,which arrowpath managed.arrowpath would receive percent of the ecommerce funds net profits.in turn,e trade would receive percent of arrowpath profits from the ecommerce fund.
before october,bevilacqua worked at e trade as general counsel.in addition,he took on responsibility for mergers and acquisitions.in october,bevilacqua left e trade as an employee and took the role of managing partner of arrowpath.however,bevilacqua retained the title of chief strategic investment officer at e trade.jerry gramaglia,an e trade employee,worked for arrowpath as the entrepreneur in residence.from the fall of until april,gramaglia was e trade chief marketing officer.significantly,gramaglia business card showed that arrowpath venture capital was an e trade group,associated venture fund.
according to e trade filing with the securities and exchange commission,e trade group was listed as a member of arrowpath.in october,arrowpath had an advisory committee.one of the members of the advisory committee was e trade ceo.
arrowpath sought to invest in companies and use e trade resources to improve the value of those companies.arrowpath provided million in investment capital to everypath in early.in addition,arrowpath mentioned its investment in everypath to other investors.
trial testimony 
at trial,ajaxo expert witness earl rennison testified that after examining ajaxo technology and everypath technology,he concluded that everypath technology was almost identical to the processes of ajaxo.furthermore,after examining the state of everypath software as it existed at different times,he concluded that ajaxo and everypath software was basically the same,the same technology.
rennison reviewed and investigated everypath patent applications and determined that there was one for automatic form filling,which included baca as an author.he opined,t he information that was expressed in this patent was the same information which was communicated in meetings between ajaxo and e trade to dan baca of e trade.
rennison opined that ajaxo technology had independent economic value derived from the fact that ajaxo technology was not generally known.rennison told the jury that in september there was no other technology that could accomplish what the ajaxo wirelessproxy technology could accomplish.rennison described in detail to the jury what he opined was the ajaxo trade secret.moreover,he opined that ajaxo had fully communicated the specifics of its trade secret to e trade in sufficient detail to permit implementation.
rennison pointed out to the jury that e trade had five hours of meetings with ajaxo to do a technology and got very specific detail on the technology.and so there was clearly ample time for them to understand very clearly about how the technology worked and how to go out and effectively implement that technology.
during his review of the everypath source code library,rennison told the jury that he was able to conclude that as of october,everypath had not come up with the solution for breaking the cache.however,four days later it had developed a solution that was identical to the one that ajaxo used.based on his experience,rennison expressed the opinion that four days was an insufficient time for everypath to develop the solution for breaking the cache,without external clues to that information.ultimately,rennison concluded that it would have been very difficult for everypath to develop independently the wirelessproxy technology in two months.
joe raymond testified that he began work on e trade wireless project in august.around that time,sprint had just released some early models of its telephones.at that time,he understood that sprint was intending to release a telephone in january.raymond analyzed the marketplace to find out what devices were out in the marketplace at that time and what prospective devices might come into the marketplace in the future.he gave his reports to debra chrapaty,e trade chief media officer in the digital financial media division,and pamela kramer,e trade of digital financial media.
pamela kramer testified that e trade concluded that they needed to deliver stock trading capability on a wireless platform.e trade realized that it did not have the expertise to develop the technology for the wireless phone trading in house.accordingly,in july or august,e trade actively looked for a partner to provide the technology.
e trade first met with everypath when it was still known as webonphone.kramer recalled that there were e trade people talking to everypath before september.raymond admitted that he introduced everypath to arrowpath as a possible investment opportunity,but discovered that arrowpath was already aware of everypath.raymond understood that arrowpath knew about everypath from tom bevilacqua.raymond acknowledged that he had mentioned ajaxo to the venture group,but discovered from koo that he was not interested in venture capital funding.
jerry gramaglia admitted that he had received an email from everypath in april.attached to that email was an executive summary of the company everypath.he forwarded the email to guy albanese along with the executive summary asking him what he thought about everypath as a company.
pamela kramer admitted that she spoke with grace yang,one of the founding members at arrowpath,to consider taking a look at everypath.
during trial,ajaxo introduced into evidence print copies of many emails sent between various e trade personnel,and between e trade personnel and everypath personnel.in addition,ajaxo introduced other documents that e trade personnel had produced.suffice it to say that during the period that e trade was evaluating ajaxo and learning about ajaxo technology,e trade was in contact with everypath.some of the more significant emails included the following.
on september,raymond sent an email to kramer concerning ajaxo.raymond told kramer that e trade should leverage any expertise they could get their hands on.in reply,kramer suggested that they should use a company called spyglass to evaluate other vendors.
on september,dennis lundien emailed raymond.he confirmed that they had agreed to participate in developing investment opportunities with outside companies.raymond was to be the point person by arranging meetings.
on september,lundien emailed raymond requesting that raymond speak to kramer about having venture participation at the digital financial media staff meetings.raymond admitted that the new venture participation that lundien described in the email was the investment arm of e trade looking at new early stage companies.
a series of emails dated october,confirmed that raymond intended to meet with ajaxo on october albanese,who was doing some of the technical evaluation,sent raymond an email asking him if he wanted to discuss the plan of attack before the meeting with ajaxo.
baca emailed raymond and albanese saying that despite raymond not being able to make the meeting they should go anyway and drill down on the technical questions and issues.
on october,raymond learned that ameritrade and sprint had forged an agreement that would let their customers trade on line over sprint wireless network.raymond emailed kramer that they should get sprint pcs back in here to get our arrangements in line with the competition.raymond admitted that it was about this time that he told ajaxo that a letter of intent was being prepared.at the same time,he wanted baca to drill down on the ajaxo technology.
raymond did not recollect baca telling him about the technical binder following the october meeting.he recalled a conversation he had with chun on october,however,in which he told chun that e trade was trying to learn more about ajaxo product,but felt they did not have all the answers they needed.raymond recalled that ajaxo general feeling was that until they had a contract,ajaxo was reluctant to give more technical information.raymond denied that he told ajaxo that e trade did not do business with people who were not team players.
raymond recalled that as result of this phone conversation,there was an opening up,a desire to talk further on the part of ajaxo to bring more information to bear.
raymond recollected that when baca returned from the october meeting with ajaxo,baca expressed the view that he did not feel fully comfortable with the ajaxo solution in a general sense due to lack of thorough information.
raymond admitted that as of september,of the vendors that they had talked to,only ajaxo could accomplish a wireless trade.
in response to an email raymond received from baca on september,he translated baca comments as alpha launch a week from friday,beta launch november,full product release january.raymond explained that this meant that e trade needed to keep up with the competition.the next sentence of raymond email indicated that he thought that e trade was ready for such a cycle between the contacts e trade ha d at ajaxo and everypath.again,raymond admitted that he knew at this time that ajaxo was the only vendor to demonstrate stock trading capability on a wireless phone.the next sentence of the email said,let the games begin.
raymond identified a matrix document he had made in which he assigned certain values to the vendors e trade was evaluating.as of november,four days after kramer told ajaxo that it was not the right partner for e trade,raymond rated ajaxo higher than everypath.
a detailed analysis showed that three vendors were still in the running in late november.ajaxo was still on the list.raymond testified,however,ajaxo was not giving us what we needed in order to fully evaluate them.in the analysis raymond wrote,what else is there to say regarding ajaxo whereas other companies are and willing to do the project at cost,ajaxo holds their cards close and asks for major bucks to deliver.still ajaxo is the only company that has an solution that with tweaks,porting of servers,and some documents could be employed today.again,raymond admitted that as of this time only ajaxo had demonstrated wireless trading capability.
raymond recalled that around november,he had gone to everypath to review requirements and to talk about the possibility of purchasing into a relationship with everypath.
an email from mike scolari at everypath to raymond dated november,indicated that everypath appreciated raymond and baca reviewing e trade specifications with everypath.in addition,scolari told raymond that everypath had been diligently at work on a proposal.scolari asked if he could come by and drop off the proposal on wednesday.
raymond admitted that he reviewed everypath proposal before it was submitted to e trade.an email from raymond to baca and albanese showed that raymond was in the middle of reading the proposal and it appear ed that they had answered all questions thoroughly and they were hitting the sweet spots with many elements.raymond only concern was everypath ability to deliver.baca emailed raymond the next day saying that he thought they could as long as they did not hit any snags,but said he would have a better feel after the engineering visit.
on december,raymond prepared an analysis of the three remaining vendors for debra chrapaty.raymond concluded that ajaxo was too small and aether was not acceptable for various reasons.this left everypath as the only possible partner.an agreement went out to everypath the next day.
initially,emails between baca and raymond showed only two vendors under consideration,ajaxo and wolfe technology.after the september meeting between e trade and ajaxo,everypath name showed up in emails albanese sent to raymond and baca.on september,raymond,baca and albanese met with everypath.raymond recalled that scolari and prakash iyer were present for everypath.everypath gave a powerpoint presentation as opposed to a live trading demonstration.
in an email dated september,baca asked raymond if he was getting close to talking about a contract with ajaxo.raymond could not recall if he discussed the issue with baca.on september,raymond received an email from baca suggesting that everypath be considered as a vendor raymond suggested to baca that he set up a meeting with ajaxo to discuss the nature and terms of an trade relationship.raymond wrote,simply indicate that we would like to have them in to discuss the business side of our relationship.
lisa chui,everypath senior application engineer,testified that when she started work at everypath in october she was working on a voice application.that voice application for e trade was never commercially deployed.she remembered that she was told to prepare a voice application demonstration for the red herring conference the demonstration was to include only stock quotes and the news.there was no trading functionality.her notes reflected that she was to use static pages instead of live pages,which indicated that this was to be a static demonstration rather than a live demonstration.chui began work on the e trade wireless data application in december and stopped work on the voice application.when chui started working on the data application for e trade it did not have trading functionality.
chui was introduced to baca when she started work on the e trade application.a series of emails between baca and chui indicate that baca reviewed the e trade application chui was working on,and made recommendations to improve it.
jennifer gill roberts,a partner in the sevin rosen investment fund confirmed that at a partners meeting on september,the partners decided to make an investment in everypath.the investment closed in november.
roberts admitted that she spoke with guy albanese in september.she was given his name and phone number by everypath ceo.she recollected that albanese viewed everypath product as a voice and data platform.
after the telephone conversation with albanese,roberts prepared a memorandum outlining her rationale for recommending an investment in everypath.
procedural history 
ajaxo filed suit against e trade and everypath on october.ajaxo operative complaint alleged that e trade had breached the nda and that both e trade and everypath had misappropriated ajaxo trade secrets.ajaxo sought damages,exemplary damages,and equitable relief.specifically,with respect to damages,ajaxo prayed for c ompensatory damages for lost profits in the sum of thousand dollars per month for so long as the misappropriation continues,together with interest as permitted by law.unjust enrichment damages pursuant to civil code section according to proof at trial.reasonable royalties pursuant to civil code section according to proof at trial.regarding the breach of the nda,ajaxo sought damages in an amount to be proven at trial and appropriate equitable relief.
the jury trial began on march.the court heard all the parties in limine motions.thereafter,a jury trial included extensive testimony from witnesses called by ajaxo,two witnesses called by e trade,and one witness called by everypath.at the end of the plaintiff case,e trade and everypath moved for nonsuit on ajaxo misappropriation claim.the trial court granted a partial nonsuit on the issue of damages for the misappropriation,but allowed the issue of liability to go to the jury.
as noted,the jury returned a special verdict in ajaxo favor on the breach of the nda and the misappropriation of ajaxo trade secret by e trade and everypath.
following the jury trial on the issue of liability and damages for e trade breach of the nda ajaxo asked the court to award a reasonable royalty and punitive damages against e trade and everypath in connection with the misappropriation claim.ajaxo counsel made an opening statement to the court.both e trade and everypath moved for nonsuit.the court granted the motion for nonsuit.
subsequently,the court heard testimony on ajaxo request for a permanent injunction against e trade and everypath continuing use of ajaxo trade secret.as to e trade,ajaxo sought the injunction under the provisions of the uniform trade secrets act,and under the agreement.in a detailed statement of decision,the court denied ajaxo claim for injunctive relief.
thereafter,ajaxo moved for a new trial on damages,which e trade and everypath opposed.e trade moved for a new trial and for jnov,which ajaxo opposed.similarly,everypath moved for jnov regarding the jury finding that everypath had willfully and maliciously misappropriated ajaxo trade secret.ajaxo opposed the motion.
the court denied all the motions.subsequently,the court determined that ajaxo was the prevailing party for purposes of recovering attorney fees on the contract.the court awarded ajaxo in attorney fees.
as noted,all parties have appealed.
discussion 
e trade issues on appeal 
e trade contends that the court evidentiary rulings deprived e trade of its right to a fair trial.
background 
among others,e trade filed two in limine motions to exclude evidence.one was to exclude evidence of million in venture capital funding that everypath had received beginning in march the investment evidence.the second was to exclude evidence of ajaxo communication with the fbi.
the investment evidence 
below,e trade asserted that a company called arrowpath venture capital,which it conceded was an e trade affiliate,through its venture capital fund called e trade fund,made the investment in everypath months after the alleged misappropriation was purported to have occurred.thus,e trade argued,permitting ajaxo to introduce e trade indirect investment in everypath as evidence of e trade liability would be prejudicial and misleading.
during the hearing on e trade motion,ajaxo counsel argued that the investment evidence was central to the proof in this case of the misappropriation and the motivation therefor.
the court agreed with e trade that the investment evidence would be irrelevant and highly prejudicial unless ajaxo could establish a direct link between e trade alleged misappropriation and arrowpath investment.the court explained one of the things the plaintiff has to do in order to show that however the money may have gone from e trade to arrowpath to everypath,however that was accomplished,you going to have to connect the dots,meaning that it the suggestion is being made that there was a misappropriation of trade secrets owned by ajaxo and that the subsequent monies from the venture capital firm of arrowpath into everypath which e trade has some kind of interest in,without going into really the relationship,one of the things the plaintiff is going to have to do is show that there was a connection between the misappropriation and the investment,because otherwise it irrelevant.and it been my understanding that the position of ajaxo up to this point has been that baca was the one who misappropriated the trade secrets of ajaxo while he was an e trade employee and then he became an everypath employee.but the mere fact that he an employee of e trade at the time he allegedly misappropriates the trade secrets,you got to show some connection that that event,if in fact it happened,that the investment strategy of e trade arrowpath and everypath,that that was somehow connected,otherwise these can be two totally separate events.
ajaxo counsel represented through a detailed offer of proof that senior e trade personnel were involved both in the decision to misappropriate ajaxo trade secret and in arrowpath investment in everypath.ajaxo counsel represented to the court that he had and would present evidence at trial establishing the following e trade has a business plan looking for emerging high tech companies to invest in b efore they ever run into ajaxo they come across a company called everypath and discuss investing in everypath if everypath can deliver the technology it badly needs in the wireless marketplace everypath is not successful in developing that technology and the time is running out a company does come that has the technology t hat company that has the technology is not willing to be purchased by e trade as a portfolio company as everypath was willing to be so purchased there is a discussion among the that if the technology of ajaxo can be delivered to everypath,we can then invest in everypath,take care of our technological needs,maintain our marketshare and have a very profitable portfolio company all in one fell swoop.all we have to do then is to get the technology from ajaxo,transfer it to everypath and get ajaxo out of our hair an employee,employee at e trade that its marketing executive goes over to arrowpath,the investment arm,and the managing partner of the investment arm happens to be an executive officer of e trade.and e trade then proceeds to invest in this new company now called everypath.inquiry is it relevant to this case of misappropriation to show that investment 
faced with this offer of proof,the court denied e trade motion and allowed the evidence concerning arrowpath investment in everypath to be presented to the jury.
subsequently,e trade filed notice of its intention to move for a new trial.in support of its motion for a new trial,e trade contended that ajaxo counsel had made a false offer of proof concerning the investment evidence when he represented that ajaxo would prove a direct link between the investment and e trade alleged misappropriation.in its opposition to e trade motion,ajaxo argued that even if there was some theoretical prejudice stemming from the admission of this evidence,it was fully rebutted through e trade this investment theory is out the window closing argument.the court denied e trade motion 
ajaxo communications with the fbi 
according to koo,in september,an individual accessed ajaxo demonstration program without authorization.at the time koo discovered that the program had been accessed,he did not know who had accessed the program.koo stated that he reported this unauthorized access to the fbi.subsequently,in april,six months after ajaxo filed this lawsuit,koo received an email from a third party suggesting that someone may have planted a worm on ajaxo server.koo forwarded this message to the fbi.according to koo,the fbi advised him that he should reformat the server hard drive.in so doing,koo destroyed all the electronic files and data that resided on the server pertaining to the e trade application of ajaxo technology as it existed in the fall of.
e trade filed an in limine motion to exclude this evidence.e trade argued that permitting testimony concerning fbi investigations had significant potential for misleading or confusing the jury.e trade based its motion to exclude the fbi evidence on the fact that ajaxo had successfully blocked e trade discovery efforts concerning these communications.contending that the communications with the fbi were irrelevant,ajaxo former counsel would not allow koo or chun to provide complete deposition testimony concerning the issue.furthermore,ajaxo had not provided a complete production of documents relating to the communication with the fbi 
after a lengthy hearing,the court denied e trade in limine motion.the court ruled,the call to the fbi in will be admitted,because it corroborates and supports koo contention that there had been an unauthorized entry into his computer systems.regarding the testimony concerning koo contact with the fbi in,the court ruled that the testimony could come in because it explained koo destruction of the electronic source code.
e trade argues that the court erred in admitting highly prejudicial evidence concerning the arrowpath investment in everypath and ajaxo communications with the fbi.in so doing,e trade was deprived of a fair trial.e trade argues that the court abused its discretion in admitting this evidence.consequently,e trade contends that this court should vacate the judgment and remand the case for a new trial.
evidence code section provides a all questions of law including but not limited to questions concerning the admissibility of evidence are to be decided by the court.
broadly speaking,an appellate court reviews any ruling by a trial court as to the admissibility of evidence for abuse of discretion.citation.people ex rel.lockyer sun pacific farming th,d.
in reviewing the trial court exercise of its discretion under evidence code section,we do not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court.citation.we may grant relief only when the asserted abuse constitutes a miscarriage of justice,citation that is,when in the absence of the improperly admitted evidence a result more favorable to the complaining party would likely have occurred.citation.wanland los gatos lodge,d.
as we have said before,w hile the concept abuse of discretion is not easily susceptible of precise definition,the appropriate test has been enunciated in terms of whether or not the trial court exceeded the bounds of reason,all of the circumstances before it being considered citations.citation.a decision will not be reversed merely because reasonable people might disagree.an appellate tribunal is neither authorized nor warranted in substituting its judgment for the judgment of the trial judge.citations.in the absence of a clear showing that its decision was arbitrary or irrational,a trial court should be presumed to have acted to achieve legitimate objectives and,accordingly,its discretionary determinations ought not to be set aside on review.citation.schall lockheed missiles space th,fn,d.
e trade argues that the investment evidence was particularly prejudicial because it allowed ajaxo to conjure up the appearance of a circumstantial case against e trade.e trade contends that ajaxo had no witnesses to or other direct evidence of any misappropriation and could prove only a series of communications between the parties,all of which,e trade argues,were consistent with its position that it acted properly and was simply evaluating different wireless vendors.thus,e trade argues,ajaxo used the investment evidence to supply the essential theory of motive.as a result,e trade asserts,t he prejudice was palpable because it allowed ajaxo to present a motive theory to add the false appearance of weight to its entirely circumstantial case.
fundamentally,e trade misunderstands the test for when evidence is more prejudicial than probative.exclusion of evidence under evidence code section is reserved for those cases where the proffered evidence has little evidentiary value and creates an emotional bias against the defendant.bihun v.at t information systems,th,d,overruled on other grounds in lakin watkins associated industries cal th,d.
thus,regarding the court admission of the investment evidence,based on counsel offer of proof,we agree with the trial court that the investment evidence was relevant.implicitly,the court weighed the probative value of the evidence against the prejudice to e trade and concluded that it was more probative than prejudicial.even though arrowpath investment in everypath came after the misappropriation,the evidence was relevant and probative to show that e trade and arrowpath were deeply entangled.that is,the people who made the decision at arrowpath to invest in everypath were the same people who were at e trade during the time e trade had an investment strategy to invest in early stage companies and was looking to find a partner to provide wireless trading technology.
e trade fails to explain how this evidence was more prejudicial than is,how it created an emotional bias against e trade.the investment evidence was just one of many relevant facts from which the jury could have concluded that e trade had a motive to misappropriate ajaxo trade secret.
accordingly,we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the investment evidence.
alternatively,e trade seems to be arguing that the trial court abused its discretion in denying e trade new trial motion 
below,e trade argued that the evidence presented at trial established that ajaxo offer of proof was false.e trade asserted that it was entitled to a new trial because its right to a fair trial was jeopardized by the erroneous admission of the prejudicial evidence.as noted,the trial court denied e trade motion for a new trial.
in effect,a motion for a new trial is a new and independent proceeding,in which the trial court can reweigh the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses.the trial court is authorized to disbelieve witnesses and draw inferences from the evidence contrary to the inferences drawn by the jury.eltolad music,april music,d.
the grounds upon which a new trial may be granted are statutory.bank of america cal d.code of civil procedure section lists seven such grounds.included within that list is i rregularity in the proceedings of the court,jury or adverse party,or any order of the court,or abuse of discretion by which either party was prevented from having a fair trial.
on review,some courts have applied the same standard of review to orders denying new trial as to orders granting new trial,that is,the abuse of discretion test.see,jacoby feldman d.on the other hand,the california supreme court has stated that appellate courts in reviewing such an order denying a new trial,as distinguished from an order granting a new trial,must fulfill our obligation of reviewing the entire record,including the evidence,so as to make an independent determination as to whether the error was prejudicial.citations.city of los angeles decker cal d.accordingly,we apply this test to the denial of the new trial motion here.
at the outset,we note,however,that we have concluded that the admission of the investment evidence was not prejudicial as that term is understood for evidence code section purposes.furthermore,after reviewing the entire record,we conclude that ajaxo did not fail in its offer of proof.specifically,ajaxo proved that some of the people that made the decision to invest in everypath were the same people that worked at e trade while e trade was engaged in its quest for a partner to provide wireless trading technology.ajaxo may not have proved by direct evidence that there was a discussion among the,but ajaxo presented enough other evidence from which the jury could make a reasonable inference that such a discussion had taken place.for instance,the evidence showed that jerry gramaglia,e trade chief marketing officer,had asked baca to find a wireless system to allow e trade to participate in the sprint launch.once arrowpath formed,gramaglia worked for arrowpath as the entrepreneur in residence.before october,tom bevilacqua worked at e trade as general counsel.in addition,he took on responsibility for mergers and acquisitions.bevilacqua left e trade in october to become managing partner at arrowpath.however,he retained the title at e trade of chief strategic investment officer.arrowpath sought to invest in companies and use e trade resources to improve the value of those companies.
as early as may,everypath expressed a desire to become a partner with e trade.around this time,guy albanese met with everypath.a series of emails between albanese and gramaglia showed that everypath was a private company that hoped to go public after its technology was ready and adopted by front runners like e trade.furthermore,albanese told everypath that e trade did ipo and that there was a possibility that e trade could invest in everypath and its patents albanese was the person who told everypath that it needed to change direction from voice to data.
far from failing to provide the evidence that e trade and arrowpath were inextricably entwined,as noted earlier,ajaxo presented evidence that some of the people who made the decision to invest in everypath were the same people who worked at e trade while e trade was actively searching for a vendor to provide wireless trading technology.
adding this evidence to the following evidence,the jury could reasonably have concluded that e trade misappropriation of ajaxo trade secrets was willful and malicious.e trade was actively looking for a partner to provide wireless trading technology.at a time when ameritrade and sprint had forged an agreement,only ajaxo had demonstrated wireless trading.however,ajaxo was not interested in e trade investment,but e trade needed the wireless trading to stay competitive.e trade wanted to invest in new early stage companies.
accordingly,we reject e trade assertion that the trial court erred in denying e trade motion for a new trial.
as regards ajaxo communications with the fbi,again we find no abuse of discretion.the trial court engaged in a long and detailed evaluation of the relevance of the evidence,including reviewing koo deposition testimony and balanced its probative value against the prejudice to e trade.the court noted that the probative value of all of this is highly relevant to corroborate koo position that he believed the system was entered without authorization a nd i do think it prejudicial to the defense,at least it probative value is not substantially outweighed by any prejudice to the defense,because the mere fact that somebody reports something to law enforcement is a logical thing for one to do.and somehow that if we invoke the fbi,that that going to prejudice the defense no,i just do think it does when you balance it,as i must on a objection,and weigh it against koo and ajaxo right to put their case on.
we reiterate that e trade misunderstands the test for when evidence is more prejudicial than probative.we note,again,that exclusion of evidence under evidence code section is reserved for those cases where the proffered evidence has little evidentiary value and creates an emotional bias against the defendant.bihun v.at t information systems,supra,th at,d,overruled on other grounds in lakin watkins associated industries,supra,cal th,d.
here,the fbi evidence was relevant to explain why koo destroyed the source code.however,notwithstanding e trade comment that the admission of this evidence helped ajaxo create the illusion of circumstantial evidence in support of its claims,again e trade fails to explain how this evidence was more prejudicial than probative,such that it would have created an emotional bias against e trade 
accordingly,we reject e trade contention that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting evidence of koo communications with the fbi.
e trade asserts that the trial court erred in denying e trade motion for jnov.
e trade argues that in order to prevail on its claim for misappropriation of trade secrets and breach of the nda,ajaxo was required to establish that e trade disclosed protected information to everypath.unable to do so by direct evidence,ajaxo attempted to prove e trade disclosure through inferences based on circumstantial evidence.however,e trade argues,all these inferences were refuted by voluminous,unequivocal,and uncontradicted evidence that no such disclosure occurred.thus,e trade argues,under these circumstances,ajaxo inferences do not constitute substantial evidence and are legally insufficient to support the verdict 
standards govern judgments notwithstanding the verdict when presented with a motion for jnov,the trial court can not weigh the evidence citation,or judge the credibility of witnesses.citation.if the evidence is conflicting or if several reasonable inferences may be drawn,the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict should be denied.citations.a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict of a jury may properly be granted only if it appears from the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the party securing the verdict,that there is no substantial evidence to support the verdict.if there is any substantial evidence,or reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom in support of the verdict,the motion should be denied.citation.citation.the same standard of review applies to the appellate court in reviewing the trial court granting or denying of the motion.citations.accordingly,the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the jury verdict,resolving all conflicts and drawing all inferences in favor of that verdict.citation.osborn irwin memorial blood bank th,d.

in a case such as this,where there are volumes of trial transcript and volumes of appendix and supplemental appendix,we find e trade recitation of the facts lacking in fairness and completeness.e trade slanted presentation of the facts reads more like argument.accordingly,we deem that e trade has waived this issue on appeal because of its failure to carry its burden of providing this court with a fair and complete summary of the evidence.
we will address the merits of e trade contention,however,to clarify that circumstantial evidence is not trumped by direct evidence,when the direct evidence consists of denials by e trade personnel and everypath personnel that anyone from e trade disclosed any protected ajaxo information to everypath.
a party may rely upon reasonable inferences from the evidence to support a verdict.hauter zogarts cal d.an inference is a deduction of fact that may logically and reasonably be drawn from another fact or group of facts found or otherwise established.
when an inference needs to be drawn from the evidence to prove a fact,we call this circumstantial evidence as opposed to direct evidence.thus,direct evidence is evidence that directly proves a fact,without an inference or presumption,and which in itself,if true,conclusively establishes that fact.formerly,circumstantial evidence was defined as indirect evidence in code of civil procedure section.circumstantial evidence,when relevant,is as admissible as direct evidence.cal.law com.comment to repeal of code civ,west ann.code civ.proc.ed.following.in people goldstein d,the second district court of appeal summarized the difference between direct and circumstantial evidence.direct evidence is that which is applied to the fact to be proved,immediately and directly,and without the aid of any intervening fact or process as where,on a trial for murder,a witness positively testifies he saw the accused inflict the mortal wound,or administer the poison.circumstantial evidence is that which is applied to the principal fact,indirectly,or through the medium of other facts,from which the principal fact is inferred.the characteristics of circumstantial evidence as distinguished from that which is direct,are,first,the existence and presentation of one or more evidentiary facts and,second,a process of inference,by which these facts are so connected with the fact sought,as to tend to produce a persuasion of its truth it has been said that circumstantial evidence,as distinguished from direct evidence,is testimony not based on actual personal knowledge or observation of the facts in controversy,but of other facts from which deductions are drawn,showing indirectly the facts sought to be proved.citation.
hence,t he term circumstantial evidence emphasizes the effect of the necessity of drawing inferences from it.witkin,cal.evidence ed.circumstantial evidence.
relying on hicks reis cal d,hicks and teich general mills d,teich,e trade asserts that a party may not rely upon an inference to establish a fact where the inference is refuted by clear evidence establishing the nonexistence of that fact.
in teich,the plaintiff developed a kit to allow children to make sun pictures.teich,supra,d at.he presented the kit to the defendant,a cereal manufacturer,demonstrated its use,and left some samples with the defendant.id.at.subsequently,the defendant decided to include a similar product from a different source in its trix cereal line.id.at.the plaintiff contended that the defendant had copied the idea and that the defendant owed him money for the reasonable value of his product.id.at.
the defendant denied that it had copied the plaintiff product,contending that a advertising agency had independently developed a similar product and submitted it to defendant.at trial,the defendant called as witnesses its employees and those of the advertising agency.they all testified that the advertising agency had independently developed and submitted the product to the defendant.the defendant introduced documentary evidence,including correspondence with the advertising agency,to demonstrate that the advertising agency had submitted its own product to the defendant.id.at.
after the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff,the trial court granted defendant motion for jnov.the court of appeal affirmed.the court observed that the plaintiff testimony concerning the presentation of his product to the defendant,as well as the similarities between the two products,had raised an inference that the defendant had copied the plaintiff product.the court explained,however,that this inference had been dispelled by direct evidence to the contrary and was therefore insufficient to support the verdict.id.at.
e trade contends that the inferences relied upon by ajaxo in this case were dispelled by clear,positive and uncontradicted evidence that e trade did not disclose any protected information to everypath.as such,e trade asserts,the judgment fails the substantial evidence test.
we find e trade reliance on teich misplaced.the inference that the teich court talked about was,in fact,a presumption.as witkin explains it,f ormer statutes defined a presumption as a deduction that the law expressly directs to be made from particular facts,and an inference as a deduction that the jury may make from the facts.because the law then meant statutes,an unfortunate distinction arose between statutory presumptions and nonstatutory presumptions the latter had to be classified as inferences.witkin,cal.evidence,supra,burden of proof and presumptions.
former statutes classified presumptions as a form of indirect evidence,and stated that,unless a presumption was controverted,the jury had to find according to the presumption.under these statutes,the rule became established that presumptions constituted independent evidence,to be somehow weighed against other evidence,and that a verdict or finding could rest upon a presumption even though all of the other evidence was opposed to it.witkin,cal.evidence,supra,burden of proof and presumptions.
a number of cases addressing the presumptions or inferences required the trier of fact to come to a certain conclusion unless the defendant presented some quantum of contrary evidence.these cases came to apply the rule that the inference was dispelled as a matter of law,where the contrary evidence was clear,positive,uncontradicted,and of such a nature that it can not rationally be disbelieved.see blank coffin cal d,leonard watsonville community hospital cal d,teich,supra,d at.witkin emphasizes that these cases apply to the prior law where juries were required to give credit to presumptions or inferences unless dispelled.witkin,cal.evidence,supra,burden of proof and presumptions.
both hicks and teich apply to the type of that must be overcome,rather than the process a jury uses to connect facts to conclusions.neither hicks nor teich stands for the proposition that circumstantial evidence fails when there is contradictory direct evidence.we agree with ajaxo when it points out that e trade position fails the common sense test.if the law were as e trade suggests,then a purely circumstantial evidence case against a criminal defendant would fail if the criminal defendant were to testify,i did do it.
as noted ante,our review of the record discloses that there was substantial evidence to support the jury verdict that e trade willfully and maliciously misappropriated ajaxo trade secrets.during,only ajaxo could demonstrate stock trading on a wireless phone.e trade learned from ajaxo how it dealt with the difficult problem of the cache and within weeks,too short a time for independent development,everypath implemented the same solution.when ajaxo demonstrated its wireless trading capability to e trade,e trade asked for and was refused the code to access ajaxo server.subsequently,although ajaxo refused to give its access code for its server,e trade personnel used that access code to access ajaxo server on at least occasions in the fall of.within four months after dan baca accessed ajaxo server without authorization,he went to work for everypath.while at everypath,baca was involved in testing of everypath trading solution,which an expert testified was identical to that of ajaxo.
as paragraph five of the nda acknowledges,keeping an economic advantage was very important to e trade the fact that arrowpath,a company staffed by some of the same people that were involved in e trade search for a wireless partner,made an investment in everypath,was strong circumstantial evidence from which the jury could have inferred that e trade had an economic motive to misappropriate ajaxo trade secret.arrowpath sought to invest in companies and use e trade resources to improve the value of those companies.arrowpath entrepreneur in residence was an officer at e trade during the time that e trade was searching for a wireless partner.this same person,gramaglia,asked baca to find a wireless system to allow e trade to participate in the sprint internet phone launch.guy albanese,the person who introduced everypath to baca,reported to gramaglia.
furthermore,the day after baca met with koo and chun for ajaxo second demonstration of its technology,where technical discussions took place about such things as buffering the cookie and how to sustain the session,baca met with everypath personnel.at this time in everypath development of their product,everypath had only just shifted in orientation toward data access and in the timeframe,everypath did not have a product did have the business did have a team.yet on the same day as baca met with everypath,an everypath employee by the name of prasad krothapalli sent an email message to piyush goel,one of everypath founders,in which he outlined assignments for his group members.one of the assignments for an employee by the name of roopak was support for session specific cookies with httpclient,one week.assignments for roopak included support for user name and password,persistent cookies,bug fixing and infrastructure for data cleansing support all things that baca had learned from koo.
at a time when e trade was actively looking for a partner to provide wireless trading technology,ameritrade and sprint had forged an agreement.at this time,only ajaxo had demonstrated wireless trading,but ajaxo was not interested in e trade investment.however,e trade needed the wireless trading to stay competitive,and e trade wanted to invest in new early stage companies.
finally,even though everypath had not demonstrated wireless trading capability as of december,e trade selected everypath as its wireless trading vendor partner.
in short,e trade needed ajaxo technology to stay competitive in the market.everypath,a company willing to have an e trade investment,did not have a similar technology,but it developed the same technology in too short a time for independent development.e trade chose everypath as its wireless trading partner at a time when it had not even demonstrated its product could accomplish a wireless trade,and e trade through arrowpath made a substantial investment in everypath.
accordingly,we conclude that there was substantial evidence to support the jury verdict that e trade willfully and maliciously misappropriated ajaxo trade secrets.consequently,as to liability,the trial court did not err in denying e trade motion for jnov.
with respect to the contract nda,in a second line of attack on the trial court denial of e trade motion for jnov,e trade contends that ajaxo did not present substantial evidence of legally recoverable contractual damages.e trade argues that because damages are a separate,essential element of a cause of action for breach of contract,where the plaintiff fails to introduce evidence of damages,the cause of action fails.
background 
ajaxo introduced testimony through koo that ajaxo licensed its complete technology platform to infocast,an overseas company,for.infocast had the right to sublicense to other companies with a payment of per customer.ajaxo argued in closing that the figure should serve as the basis for a damages award of million.this sum represented the loss of two licenses,one to e trade and one to everypath.
further,koo testified that his development costs were approximately.moreover,he had offered to license the ajaxo technology to e trade for.
e trade offered ajaxo upon signing a letter of intent,plus at the end of the development phase plus per device,in addition to an figure 
ultimately,as noted,the jury awarded ajaxo million in damages for breach of the nda.
again,we review the evidence in the light most favorable to ajaxo to determine whether substantial evidence supports the jury verdict of million in damages.flanagan flanagan,supra,cal th at,d.
first,however,we note that ajaxo theory of recovery on the contract was that e trade was unjustly enriched because of its breach of the nda 
we begin with two familiar maxims of jurisprudence he who takes the benefit must bear the burden,and f or every wrong there is a remedy.
one who commits a breach of contract must make compensation therefor to the injured party.in determining the amount of compensation as the damages to be awarded,the aim in view is to put the injured party in as good a position as he would have had if performance had been rendered as promised.corbin on contracts interim edition.
thus,a jury must determine what additions to the injured party wealth expected gains have been prevented by the breach and what subtractions from his wealth losses have been caused by it.corbin on contracts,supra.
in this case,we must draw the distinction between damages and restitution.when the remedy given for breach of contract is money damages,the amount awarded is determined with the purpose of putting the injured party in as good a position as he would have occupied had the contract been performed.in granting restitution as a remedy for the breach,however,the purpose to be attained may be no more than the restoration of the injured party to as good a position as that occupied by him before the contract was made.corbin on contracts,supra.
sometimes,unjust enrichment is used as a synonym for restitution.its primary use,however,should be to state an ultimate fact because x here e trade was unjustly enriched when it failed to uphold the contract,x e trade must make restitution.corbin on contracts revised edition.
the remedy of restitution differs from the remedy in damages in that in awarding damages the purpose is to put the injured party in as good a position as he would have occupied,had the contract been fully performed,while in enforcing restitution,the purpose is to require the wrongdoer to restore what he has received and thus tend to put the injured party in as good a position as that occupied by him before the contract was made.ordinarily,restitution requires that the defendant shall give something back to the plaintiff and it may be supposed that the defendant can not do this unless he has received something of value at the plaintiff hands.corbin on contracts interim edition.
with these principles in mind we conclude that restitution requires the return to ajaxo of value or benefit that e trade received.
here,assuming that e trade had performed on the nda,had kept ajaxo trade secrets and proprietary information confidential,ajaxo would have been in exactly the same position before it entered into the nda as it would have been after negotiations broke down,except it would have kept its trade secrets and proprietary information away from everypath.ajaxo conferred a benefit on e trade by giving e trade ajaxo trade secrets and proprietary information because,ultimately,e trade received technology from everypath that helped to keep it competitive.thus,e trade was benefited by breaching the nda.accordingly,ajaxo must be compensated for e trade breach of the nda,by e trade disgorging its unjust enrichment 
here the evidence presented was that ajaxo development costs for the wirelessproxy xo were.there was some discrepancy between ajaxo value of the technology and e trade counteroffer for one device,not including the user earn out provision.further,e trade paid everypath for the technology everypath developed.although we can not know for certain how the jury arrived at million in unjust enrichment to e trade,it seems that the jury took koo development costs,took the price e trade was prepared to pay for koo technology,added them together and threw in a little extra for the provision.
by breaching the nda,e trade gave to everypath information that,in due course,saved e trade a lot of money.e trade needed the technology that ajaxo had developed to stay competitive in the stock trading market.by giving everypath information about ajaxo technology,e trade saved development costs and the cost it proposed to give ajaxo for its technology.
accordingly,we find that there was substantial evidence in the record to support an award of million in restitution.
finally,e trade contends that the trial court abused its discretion in finding that ajaxo was the prevailing party under civil code section.
background 
following the trial court denial of the parties various motions,ajaxo sought to recover more than million in attorney fees under the prevailing party clause in the nda.eventually,the trial court awarded ajaxo in attorney fees.
in the nda,attorney fees are covered in paragraph five,which states in relevant part the receiving party acknowledges and agrees that due to the unique nature of the disclosing party proprietary information,there can be no adequate remedy at law for any breach of its obligations hereunder,that any such breach or any unauthorized use or release of any proprietary information will allow receiving party or third parties to unfairly compete with the disclosing party resulting in irreparable harm to the disclosing party and therefore,that upon any such breach or any threat thereof,the disclosing party shall be entitled to appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever remedies it might have at law and to be indemnified by the receiving party from any loss or harm,including,without limitation,attorney fees,in connection with any breach or enforcement of the receiving party obligations hereunder or the unauthorized use or release of any such proprietary information.italics added.
civil code section provides in any action on a contract,where the contract specifically provides that attorney fees and costs,which are incurred to enforce that contract,shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party,then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract,whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or not,shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees in addition to other costs.
t he trial court is to compare the relief awarded on the contract claim or claims with the parties demands on those same claims and their litigation objectives as disclosed by the pleadings,trial briefs,opening statements,and similar sources.hsu abbara cal th,d,scott of california blount,cal th,d.the trial court makes that determination only upon final resolution of the contract claims and only by a comparison of the extent to which each party ha s succeeded and failed to succeed in its contentions.hsu abbara,supra,cal th at,d.
a trial court is given wide discretion in determining which party has prevailed on a contract.we will not disturb such a determination on appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion,nasser superior court d.
e trade argues that ajaxo did not achieve sufficient success to qualify as the prevailing party under the nda because,in addition to e trade defeating four of ajaxo theories of liability under the nda,ajaxo sought and was denied a permanent injunction under its terms furthermore,ajaxo recovered only a fraction of the damages it sought on its contract claim 
we disagree that ajaxo did not achieve sufficient success to qualify as the prevailing party on the breach of contract nda action.simply put,the jury found that e trade had breached the nda,and it awarded ajaxo million in damages.while this may have been far short of the damages ajaxo initially sought,ajaxo won a simple,unqualified verdict on the breach of contract claim and established monetary damages in excess of million.ergo,it was the party prevailing on the contract that is,the party who recovered greater relief in the action on the contract.hsu abbara,supra,cal th at,d.
accordingly,we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that ajaxo was the prevailing party for purposes of awarding attorney fees.
ajaxo issues on appeal 
ajaxo contends that the trial court erred in granting nonsuit on damages for e trade and everypath misappropriation of its trade secrets.we proceed with due regard for ajaxo right to have the jury decide contested fact issues.
background 
originally,ajaxo sought to recover damages for actual loss in connection with its misappropriation of the trade secret cause of action.specifically,ajaxo sought lost profits at the rate of per month for so long as the misappropriation continues.
before trial,ajaxo designated a damages expert,nicholas dewar,who opined that ajaxo had sustained lost profits totaling.
when trial commenced,however,ajaxo stated that its damages theory of recovery for the misappropriation was unjust enrichment.ajaxo counsel represented to the court that he would like to tell the jury that the measure of those damages will be unjust enrichment that the unjust enrichment was the result of all the benefits that everypath and e trade received as a result of the misappropriation.
during opening statement,ajaxo counsel explained to the jury that the damages calculation would not be terribly sophisticated.the damage calculation has to do with what the law calls unjust enrichment we claim that there has been unjust enrichment to both e trade and everypath by reason of this misappropriation and breach of the nondisclosure agreement.
at the close of ajaxo case,e trade moved for nonsuit on the ground that ajaxo had failed to prove unjust enrichment.the trial court granted e trade motion for nonsuit as to ajaxo claim for unjust enrichment on the misappropriation claim 
a motion for nonsuit is a procedural device which allows a defendant to challenge the sufficiency of plaintiff evidence to submit the case to the jury.citation.because a grant of the motion serves to take a case from the jury consideration,courts traditionally have taken a very restrictive view of the circumstances under which nonsuit is proper.the rule is that a trial court may not grant a defendant motion for nonsuit if plaintiff evidence would support a jury verdict in plaintiff favor.campbell general motors cal d.
in determining whether plaintiff evidence is sufficient,the court may not weigh the evidence or consider the credibility of witnesses.instead,the evidence most favorable to plaintiff must be accepted as true and conflicting evidence must be disregarded.campbell general motors,supra,cal d at.a nonsuit in a jury case or a directed verdict may be granted only when disregarding conflicting evidence,giving to the plaintiffs evidence all the value to which it is legally entitled,and indulging every legitimate inference which may be drawn from the evidence in plaintiffs favor,it can be said that there is no evidence to support a jury verdict in their favor.elmore american motors cal d.
in reviewing the grant of nonsuit,we are guided by the same rule requiring evaluation of the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.carson facilities development cal d.thus,as a reviewing court we are required to resolve all presumptions,inferences and doubts favorably to the plaintiff.nally grace community church cal d.
california uniform trade secrets act,et hereinafter utsa provides that upon proof of misappropriation,a plaintiff in a trade secret action may recover for the unjust enrichment caused by misappropriation that is not taken into account in computing damages for actual loss,subd.a.
ajaxo asserts that the calculation of damages in a trade secret case is far from an exact science.then,ajaxo cites a plethora of cases that it asserts show damages for misappropriation based upon a wide variety of measures,and that do not have to be shown with precision.finally,ajaxo concedes that in a case like this,where this court is faced with the task of deciding whether there is any substantial evidence in the massive record on which the jury could have based an award of damages for actual loss and unjust enrichment,none of the plethora of cases it has cited assists this court in deciding the propriety of nonsuit on damages.
remedies under the utsa for the misappropriation of trade secrets include injunctive relief,damages,royalties,punitive damages,and attorney fees.section provides several measures of damages upon proof of misappropriation of trade secrets.under subdivision a,a complainant may recover damages for the actual loss caused by misappropriation,as well as for any unjust enrichment not taken into account in computing actual loss damages.subdivision b provides for an alternative remedy of the payment of royalties from future profits where neither damages nor unjust enrichment caused by misappropriation is provable.see generally robert cloud associates,mikesell th,d unilogic,burroughs th,d.
initially,we note four things.first,ajaxo allegation that e trade breached the nda was the basis for the misappropriation claim.in closing argument ajaxo counsel described for the jury the evidence that showed that e trade had breached the nda.turning to the question of misappropriation of ajaxo trade secret,counsel told the jury that all those points that h e discussed earlier eloquently make the point that there was communication of the trade secrets from e trade to everypath,all that communication described earlier in which this information found its way into the hands of everypath.
second,as to the breach of the nda contract,the court instructed the jury that the measure of damages is the amount which will compensate the injured party for all the detriment and loss caused by the breach or which in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom.the injured party should receive those damages naturally arising from the breach or those damages which might have been reasonably contemplated or foreseen by both parties at the time of the breach.as nearly as possible,the injured party should receive the equivalent of the benefit of the performance.damages must be reasonable.
third,as noted,as to damages ajaxo proceeded under theory that e trade was unjustly enriched because of the breach of the nda and misappropriation of ajaxo trade secrets.the selection of which measure of damages to apply is left to the sound discretion of the trier of fact.carlson industries murphy trucking d.here,however,the only measure of damages that was presented to the jury was unjust enrichment.
fourth,after judgment was rendered,e trade moved for jnov.e trade argued,in connection with the misappropriation of trade secrets,that there was no substantial evidence presented at trial that e trade had disclosed any ajaxo trade secret to everypath or willfully and maliciously misappropriated ajaxo trade secret or proprietary information.in connection with the breach of the nda,e trade argued that there was no substantial evidence presented at trial to support an award of damages to ajaxo.the trial court denied e trade motion for jnov.
this state of affairs puzzles us.we fail to see how the trial court could grant e trade nonsuit motion on damages for misappropriation and then deny e trade motion for jnov on damages for breach of the nda when the two were so inextricably linked 
the evidence presented by ajaxo on the breach of the nda directly addressed the degree to which e trade was unjustly enriched by its action of disclosing ajaxo trade secrets and proprietary information the same evidence would have been sufficient to directly establish the degree to which e trade was unjustly enriched because of its misappropriation of ajaxo trade secrets.
accordingly,we must conclude that the court erred in denying ajaxo the right to have the jury determine the damages for the misappropriation of its trade secret by e trade.
we may not reverse a judgment if the plaintiff evidence raises nothing more than speculation,suspicion,or conjecture.carson facilities development,supra,cal d at.on the other hand,reversal is warranted if there is some substance to plaintiff evidence upon which reasonable minds could differ citations.ibid.
we have concluded that there was substantial evidence from which the jury could have concluded that e trade was unjustly enriched to the tune of million for breach of the nda since the evidence of damages for the misappropriation of ajaxo trade secrets was the same damages evidence for the breach of contract action,it seems illogical to conclude that ajaxo presented insufficient evidence of damages for misappropriation.
accordingly,we conclude that we must reverse and remand to the trial court for a new trial on damages for e trade misappropriation of ajaxo trade secret 
as to everypath,however,the situation is slightly different because there was no jury award of damages in a contract action.nevertheless,ajaxo presented evidence that everypath sold its technology to approximately customers.moreover,everypath attracted millions of dollars in venture capital funding and was paid by e trade for its technology.
the jury could have come up with a figure representing unjust enrichment to everypath using any combination of this information.mindful that fundamental to the preservation of our free market economic system is the concomitant right to have the ingenuity and industry one invests in the success of the business or occupation protected from the gratuitous use of that by others morlife,perry th,d,we conclude that ajaxo presented enough evidence of unjust enrichment from which a jury could have made an award to overcome a motion for nonsuit.accordingly,because the court denied ajaxo the right to have the jury determine the damages for the misappropriation of its trade secret by everypath,we must reverse the nonsuit and remand for a retrial on damages for everypath misappropriation of ajaxo trade secret.
since we have concluded that this case needs to be sent back to the trial court for further proceedings,we need not address ajaxo other issues except the issue of attorney fees 
ajaxo contends that its entitlement to reasonable attorney fees as prevailing party on the nda extends to attorney fees incurred prior to trial.
background 
in ruling on ajaxo attorney fees motion,the court found that the evidence was insufficient to award ajaxo prior counsel attorney fees.the court noted that the declarations of current counsel made it clear that those attorneys did not do a very good job of preparing this case for trial.further,the court noted that it had not seen any declarations from former counsel indicating what they had done on the case,no billing records,nothing to support why the court should award in excess of to these attorneys,one of which is being sued apparently for malpractice because of the fact that he probably did not set up the case correctly.
ajaxo had the burden of introducing evidence to prove that the fees it sought for its prior counsel work were reasonable.martino denevi d.
here the only evidence presented of the amount of prior counsel fees was a declaration from koo that identified how many hours each attorney allegedly worked,each attorney billing rate and the resulting fees.thus,ajaxo failed to submit any evidence detailing the services each of these attorneys provided,or their qualifications and experience to support the requested billing rates.accordingly,ajaxo made no showing to establish the reasonableness of its prior counsel fees.
as a result,we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to award attorney fees for ajaxo prior counsel.
everypath issues on appeal 
everypath contends that if this court were to agree with any of ajaxo arguments on appeal,we must then consider the issues in everypath protective appeal.since we have agreed with ajaxo that the trial court erred in granting nonsuit as to the damages for the misappropriation,we proceed to address everypath issues on appeal.
everypath contends that ajaxo offered no substantial evidence that everypath willfully and maliciously misappropriated any trade secrets or that everypath authorized or ratified any willful or malicious conduct we disagree.
background 
as noted,the jury found that ajaxo proved that everypath acquired and used ajaxo trade secret without ajaxo express or implied consent.furthermore,the jury found that ajaxo proved that everypath knew or had reason to know that everypath knowledge of the trade secret derived from or through a person who owed a duty to ajaxo to maintain its secrecy.moreover,the jury found that ajaxo proved by clear and convincing evidence that everypath acted willfully and maliciously in misappropriating ajaxo trade secret.
a trade secret is misappropriated if a person acquires a trade secret knowing or having reason to know that the trade secret has been acquired by improper means,discloses or uses a trade secret the person has acquired by improper means or in violation of a nondisclosure obligation,discloses or uses a trade secret the person knew or should have known was derived from another who had acquired it by improper means or who had a nondisclosure obligation or discloses or uses a trade secret after learning that it is a trade secret but before a material change of position,subd.b.
under the utsa,two different wrongdoers may be liable for misappropriation of a trade secret one,a person who actually discloses a trade secret and two,a person who acquires a trade secret from the discloser.an acquirer is not liable under the utsa unless he knew or had reason to know that the trade secret was improperly disclosed,subd.b.furthermore,punitive damages are permitted if willful and malicious misappropriation exists,subd.c.
in this case,the jury special verdicts encompassed express findings that everypath acquired ajaxo trade secrets everypath knew of the wrong committed by e trade in that acquisition everypath acted willfully and maliciously in appropriating the trade secret and everypath authorized or ratified this willful and malicious conduct.
the court instructed the jury that willful means a purpose or willingness to commit the act or engage in the conduct in question,and the conduct was not reasonable under the circumstances then present and was not undertaken in good faith.further,the court instructed the jury that malice means conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant wit
