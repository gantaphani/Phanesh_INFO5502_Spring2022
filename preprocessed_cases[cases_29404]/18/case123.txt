in this diversity case arising out of a contract dispute,continental polymers,continental appeals the district court order granting summary judgment in favor of bacou dalloz usa bacou on continental breach of contract and good faith and fair dealing counterclaims.continental also appeals the district court determination after trial that continental failed to prove bacou made fraudulent misrepresentations to induce continental owners to sell part of their company to bacou at a reduced price.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we reverse and remand.
howard leight formerly was the sole stockholder and president of howard leight associates,howard leight industries hli.hli manufactured hearing protection products,including foam earplugs.in december,bacou,an hli customer,sought to purchase hli.after several days of negotiations,leight declined to sell the company.shortly after negotiations fell through,bacou walter stepan and counsel philip barr called leight and hli ceo john dean and requested they come to rhode island.stepan and barr requested leight and dean visit to explain to bacou chairman,philippe bacou,why leight did not want to sell hli.leight and dean agreed to the trip in part because bacou was one of hli biggest customers.
leight and dean flew to rhode island and had dinner with bacou,stepan,and barr on saturday,january.during this conversation,leight informed bacou he would not sell because the december offer was million too low.the parties began discussing terms for the sale of hli,but decided that serious negotiations would be reserved for the next day.
the parties met again on sunday,january.to bridge the million gap,stepan proposed a million consulting contract for leight,as well as royalty payments,which would cut the gap in half.the parties then discussed a proposal under which bacou would purchase all its requirements for polyurethane prepolymer,the main raw material for hli foam earplugs,from howard leight enterprises for five years.howard leight enterprises,now continental,was a newly formed corporation owned by top hli executives,including leight and dean.it was created in october for the express purpose of manufacturing polyurethane prepolymer.based on the market price for prepolymer and hli volume of prepolymer,this contract would bridge the remaining million price gap.the parties agreed to this arrangement and had a champagne toast.
on january,stepan and barr presented to leight and dean a letter drafted by barr and bacou outside counsel.the first paragraph of the letter references an asset purchase agreement between bacou and hli.paragraphs three and four discuss bacou agreement to make leight a bacou director,as well as various stock options for leight.the fourth paragraph provides 
finally,we understand that you recently formed a new company named howard leight enterprises,hle,which will manufacture polyurethane prepolymer,the raw material used in the production of foam ear plugs by howard leight associates,hli and currently purchased from hampshire chemicals.this will confirm that bacou usa safety,will enter into a supply agreement with hle pursuant to which bacou usa safety,agrees to purchase its requirements for polyurethane prepolymer from hle for a period of five years provided that the quality and price of such raw material are equivalent to that which is then used by hli and available from suppliers.
stepan,barr,and leight signed the letter.
in february,the parties met to sign the closing documents.continental alleges that at the closing,dean asked stepan to incorporate the january letter agreement in the asset purchase contract.stepan allegedly responded that this was unnecessary because the january letter would stand on its own and if it did not,then bacou would not be completing the deal that day.the parties subsequently signed the asset purchase agreement without any further memorialization of a supply agreement.
following the sale,continental purchased property in mexico on which it built a manufacturing plant and machinery needed to manufacture prepolymer.in january,continental informed bacou it had completed construction and was prepared to begin shipment to bacou.continental and bacou commenced negotiations for a supply agreement in february.thomas klein,president of bacou hli division,represented bacou.john dean represented continental.the negotiations centered around the four principle issues of price,quality,volume,and confidentiality.
according to continental,the price of prepolymer remained relatively stable,around per pound both at the time of the january letter and up until february.in october,bacou requested a price reduction on prepolymer from its supplier,dow formerly hampshire chemicals.dow was aware of the january letter between bacou and continental.within days of dean informing bacou that continental was prepared to ship prepolymer,dow agreed to reduce its prepolymer price to per pound.according to continental,dow did not offer this price to other customers.
as a result of dow offer,bacou took the position in negotiations with continental that was the price then available to bacou under the january letter.continental disputed the price.according to continental,bacou artificially reduced the price by telling dow that if it could lower the price enough,continental would not be able to match dow offer and dow would remain bacou principal supplier.
the parties also had difficulty agreeing on the quality term.bacou requested production of specifications and samples of continental prepolymer for testing to assure adequate quality.continental refused,arguing bacou was attempting to impose onerous testing and sampling requirements that bacou did not require from other vendors.the volume of prepolymer which bacou would purchase from continental also became a disputed issue between the parties.bacou wanted to purchase a small percentage of prepolymer from a second source to maintain a backup supplier.continental insisted bacou purchase one hundred percent of its requirements from continental.finally,bacou insisted continental enter into confidentiality agreements.continental refused.
based on a breakdown in negotiations between klein and dean,bacou barr replaced klein in negotiations.barr submitted to continental an initial purchase order for pounds of prepolymer at per pound.the order informed continental that a portion of this lot would be used for testing and upon qualification the balance would be used in production.the purchase order proposed that after developing a working relationship,executives from both companies could meet to work out a long term supply agreement.continental did not ship prepolymer to bacou in response to this purchase order.
the parties thereafter went through a series of negotiations on the price,volume,quality,and confidentiality terms.bacou sent continental several draft supply agreements,all of which continental rejected.as of may,however,bacou apparently believed the only sticking point was the confidentiality agreements.barr sent another purchase order to continental for pounds at per pound.the order mentioned that the parties were still working out a confidentiality agreement,but that they would not share confidential information until that was completed.continental declined to ship any product to bacou pursuant to this purchase order.bacou offered continental one last supply agreement in august,but continental again refused.
based on this series of events,bacou filed suit in rhode island state court seeking a declaratory judgment that bacou had no obligations under the january letter.continental removed to federal court based on diversity jurisdiction.continental counterclaimed that bacou breached the january agreement breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing under the january agreement and falsely misrepresented its intention to enter into a supply agreement with continental to induce leight to sell hli at a reduced price.
bacou moved for summary judgment.the district court granted bacou motion as to the contract claim,holding that under rhode island law,the january letter was an unenforceable agreement to agree.the court also found the january letter was not a binding contract because it did not set out all material terms,and no reasonable criteria existed for supplying the missing terms of quality and price.the district court also concluded that because no enforceable contract existed,bacou owed no duty of good faith and fair dealing.the district court denied summary judgment as to continental fraudulent misrepresentation counterclaim,however,concluding continental presented sufficient evidence of fraud to proceed to trial.
the district court subsequently held a bench trial on the fraudulent misrepresentation counterclaim.during trial,continental sought to introduce testimony from employee rex lowery concerning statements made by senior bacou management that they never intended to enter into a supply agreement with continental.upon bacou objection,the district court struck the testimony as hearsay.
at the conclusion of trial,the district court entered judgment in bacou favor.the district court found bacou negotiated in good faith,and the only reason the parties did not enter into a supply agreement was because continental dean thwarted negotiations.continental now appeals,arguing the january letter was an enforceable contract the court erroneously struck lowery evidence as hearsay and the district court erroneously concluded bacou counsel barr did not violate rhode island rules of professional conduct.
continental first argues the district court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of bacou on continental breach of contract and good faith and fair dealing counterclaims.in granting summary judgment,the district court made two holdings.first,the court concluded that,under rhode island law,an agreement to agree is unenforceable.second,the court concluded the january letter also was unenforceable because it omitted two material terms,price and quality.
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.gonzalez el dia,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,affidavits,admissions,answers to interrogatories,and other materials,viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,reveal no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.where,as here,federal jurisdiction is based on diversity,the court applies the substantive law of the forum state.crellin,equipmentlease,cir.the parties agree rhode island law controls.
the district court concluded the parties did not manifest a present intent to be bound to a supply agreement in the january letter.rather,the district court held the january letter was an agreement to agree to enter into a supply agreement in the future.the district court relied on centerville builders,wynne,to conclude such agreements are unenforceable under rhode island law.
in centerville builders,a prospective buyer entered into an agreement with the seller for the sale of a tract of land.in a document captioned offer to purchase,the buyer deposited towards the purchase of the property with a total deposit of five percent of the sale price due upon signing the purchase and sales agreement.the seller signed the offer to purchase after deleting the ninth condition,which would have prohibited the seller from negotiating with any other parties for the sale of the property.the agreement sixth provision provided subject to satisfactory purchase sales agreement between seller and buyer.
subsequently,the seller sent the buyer an unsigned agreement form.the buyer signed the agreement and returned it to the seller.the seller later notified the buyer that the seller wanted to get more money for the property and would therefore put the property back on the market.the buyer filed an action for breach of contract.the rhode island supreme court held no enforceable contract existed because there was no mutuality of obligation.in reaching this conclusion,the rhode island supreme court stated that 
w hen the promises of the parties depend on the occurrence of some future event within the unilateral control of the promisors,the promises are illusory and the agreement is nonbinding in the instant case,their promises were illusory since each party reserved the unfettered discretion to thwart the purchase and sale by unilaterally invoking condition of the agreement and rejecting any agreement as unsatisfactory.
although it is true that the seller displayed an intent to be bound by the agreement when he signed the document and agreed to sell the property subject to the conditions specified,the inclusion of condition made this an illusory promise because its occurrence depended solely on the subjective will of either party the seller deletion with the buyer consent of the ninth condition further evidenced the lack of mutuality of obligation.because the seller was allowed to negotiate with other prospective buyers,the offer to purchase amounted to little more than an agreement to see if the parties could agree on a agreement at some point in the future.as such,it was not an enforceable bilateral contract.
we believe the district court read centerville builders too broadly in ruling that all agreements to agree are unenforceable in rhode island.the rhode island supreme court comment that the offer to purchase was nothing more than agreement to agree and as such was unenforceable must be viewed in the context in which it was made.the court main concern was that the parties made illusory promises resulting in a lack of mutuality of obligation.
the january letter contains no such infirmities.the letter does not condition the parties obligations on the illusory promise that the future supply agreement be satisfactory to either party.the letter set forth reciprocal promises in the form of the supply agreement material terms.such promises are sufficient to establish mutuality of obligation.id.at noting that a bilateral contract requires mutuality of obligation which is achieved through the making of reciprocal promises.the actual supply agreement could and likely would contain payment terms,delivery terms,and other similar provisions not contained in the letter.but the fact that the parties were to negotiate these details at a future date does not render illusory the obligation incurred under the january letter.the parties clearly agreed to enter into a supply agreement consistent with the terms outlined in the january letter as discussed below,those terms were not so indefinite as to preclude enforcement of the letter.
the district court alternatively held the january letter was unenforceable because it lacked sufficiently definite material terms of price and quality.the letter describes the price and quality as follows the quality and price of such raw material are equivalent to that which is then used by hli and available from suppliers.the district court found this terminology too vague to provide a reasonably certain basis for giving an appropriate remedy.see restatement second of contracts endorsing the view that where the parties have intended to make a contract and there is a reasonably certain basis for granting a remedy,the court should grant that remedy.the court contended bacou unilaterally could control the raw material hli was using at any particular time,thus making its promise illusory.
we disagree with the district court that the price term was too vague to form an enforceable contract.the letter describes the price term as the price then available from suppliers.the price term thus is readily discernible by obtaining quotes from other vendors or other evidence of the prevailing market price.indeed,bacou position in negotiations with continental was not that the price term in the january letter was too vague,but that the price was per pound,dow last price quote to bacou.whether this price was artificially deflated as continental argues is a matter for the trier of fact.simply because the parties disagree on the factual issue of what the price actually was does not mean that the price term in the january letter was vague as a matter of law.a term specifying market price or the currently available price provides a sufficiently definite basis to provide a remedy.see the edward quirk,national labor relations
