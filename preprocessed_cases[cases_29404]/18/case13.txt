petitioners hereinafter defendants executives of hollinger international,hollinger,a publicly held company were indicted for mail fraud,and other federal crimes.at trial,the government pursued alternative theories,charging that defendants stole millions from hollinger by fraudulently paying themselves bogus noncompetition fees and by failing to disclose those fees,defendants deprived hollinger of their honest services.before jury deliberations began,the government proposed forms that would reveal,in the event that the jury voted to convict on a count,the particular theory or theories accounting for the verdict.defendants resisted,preferring an unelaborated general verdict.the government ultimately acquiesced.the district court instructed the jury on each of the alternative theories.as to fraud,the court informed the jury,over defendants timely objection,that a person commits that offense if he misuses his position for private gain for himself a and knowingly and intentionally breaches his duty of loyalty.the jury returned general verdicts of guilty on the counts,found that one defendant was also guilty of obstruction of justice,and acquitted defendants on all other charges.
on appeal,defendants urged the invalidity of the jury instructions.seeking reversal of their convictions,defendants relied on yates united states,which held that a general verdict may be set aside where the verdict is supportable on one ground,but not on another,and it is impossible to tell which ground the jury selected.the seventh circuit found no infirmity in the instructions,but further determined that even if those instructions were wrong,defendants could not prevail.by opposing the forms,the court of appeals declared,defendants had forfeited their objection to the instructions.their challenge would have become moot,the court observed,had the jury received forms separating the alternative fraud theories,and reported on the forms that defendants were not guilty of fraud.defendants,the court of appeals therefore reasoned,bore responsibility for the obscurity of the jury verdict.
in skilling united states,decided today,ante,this court vacated a conviction on the ground that the component of the federal statute,criminalizes only schemes to defraud that involve bribes or kickbacks.that holding renders the instructions given in this case incorrect.
by properly objecting to the jury instructions at trial,defendants secured their right to challenge those instructions on appeal.they did not forfeit that right by declining to acquiesce in the forms.the federal rules of criminal procedure do not provide for submission of special questions to the jury.in contrast,federal rule of civil procedure provides for jury interrogatories of two kinds special verdicts,rule a and general verdicts with answers to written questions,rule b.while the criminal rules are silent on special verdicts,they are informative on objections to instructions.criminal rule d provides that a party who objects to any portion of the instructions or to a failure to give a requested instruction must inform the court of the specific objection and the grounds for the objection before the jury retires to deliberate.defendants here,it is undisputed,complied with that requirement.the seventh circuit,in essence,added a further requirement for preservation of a meaningful objection to jury instructions.it devised a forfeiture sanction unmoored to any federal statute or criminal rule.and it placed in the prosecutor hands authority to trigger the sanction simply by requesting a special verdict.to boot,the appeals court applied the sanction to defendants,although they lacked any notice that forfeiture would attend their resistance to the government request.criminal rule b is designed to ward off such judicial invention.it provides no sanction may be imposed for noncompliance with any requirement not in federal law or federal rules unless the alleged violator was furnished with actual notice of the requirement before the noncompliance.
as in skilling,the court expresses no opinion on whether the instructional error was ultimately harmless,but leaves that matter for consideration on remand.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit 
justice ginsburg delivered the opinion of the court.
in skilling united states,decided today,ante,we vacated a conviction because the indictment rested,in part,on an improper construction of the honest services component of the federal ban on mail fraud.a similar infirmity is present in this case.here,too,the government and trial court advanced an interpretation of rejected by the court opinion in skilling.nevertheless,the government urges,the convictions of the defendants below,petitioners here,should be affirmed for an independent reason.at trial,the government pursued alternative theories fraud and fraud.to pinpoint whether the jury based its verdict on fraud,or fraud,or both,the government proposed special interrogatories to accompany the verdict.the defendants resisted,preferring an unelaborated general verdict,and the government ultimately acquiesced in that standard form of submission.
the court of appeals held that the defendants,by opposing the special interrogatories,forfeited their objection to the instructions given to the jury.we reverse that ruling.a criminal defendant,we hold,need not request special interrogatories,nor need he acquiesce in the government request for discrete findings by the jury,in order to preserve in full a timely raised objection to jury instructions on an alternative theory of guilt.
petitioners conrad black,john boultbee,and mark kipnis,as well as peter atkinson collectively,defendants were leading executives of hollinger international,hollinger,a publicly held company that,through subsidiaries,owned newspapers here and abroad.in,the government indicted defendants on multiple counts,of prime concern here,three counts of mail fraud in violation of and two theories were pursued by the government on each count.the government charged that defendants stole millions from hollinger by fraudulently paying themselves bogus noncompetition fees and that by failing to disclose their receipt of those fees,defendants deprived hollinger of their honest services as managers of the company.app.to pet.for cert.

before jury deliberations began,the government asked the district court to employ a form,which would reveal,in the event that the jury voted to convict on a count,the theory or theories accounting for the verdict fraud,fraud,or both.see app.defendants opposed the special interrogatories and urged,instead,standard forms,at.comprehending,however,that in the event of a guilty verdict,the jury specification of the mail fraud theory might aid appellate review,defendants proposed an accommodation upon return of a guilty verdict on any count,jurors could be asked to specify the theory on which they relied,at.
the government objected to special interrogatories presented to the jury postverdict,app.to pet.for cert,and the district court declined to adopt that procedure,at when the court rejected postverdict interrogatories,the government represented that it would not object to submission of the counts for jury decision by general verdict,at.the jury returned general verdicts of guilty on the three counts it also found defendant black guilty of obstruction of justice
