ii.discussion 
fannie mae charter 
the clause in fannie mae charter authorizes fannie mae to sue and be sued,and to complain and to defend,in any court of competent jurisdiction,state or federal.a.we hold that this language confers federal question jurisdiction over claims brought by or against fannie mae.in so holding,we do not write on a clean slate.in red cross,the supreme court gave us a clear rule for construing clauses for federally chartered corporations.the court held that a congressional charter sue and be sued provision may be read to confer federal court jurisdiction if,but only if,it specifically mentions the federal courts.at.
the question in red cross was whether the american national red cross federal charter conferred federal question jurisdiction over suits brought by or against the red cross.the clause in the red cross charter authorized the red cross to sue and be sued in courts of law and equity,state or federal,within the jurisdiction of the united states.id.at.the court held that the clause conferred federal question jurisdiction.id.at.justice scalia dissented for himself and three others.he and his fellow dissenters would have held that the clause conferred only corporate capacity to sue and be sued,and that subject matter jurisdiction had to be conferred by some other provision of federal law.id.at scalia,dissenting.
the court based its holding on a line of cases,stretching back to osborn bank of the united states,wheat,that made clear that a clause for a federally chartered corporation confers federal question jurisdiction if it specifically mentions federal courts.red cross,at.the court in osborn held,in an opinion by chief justice marshall,that a clause authorizing the second bank of the united states to sue and be sued in all state courts having competent jurisdiction and in any circuit court of the united states conferred federal question jurisdiction.wheat.at.chief justice marshall distinguished osborn from bank of the united states deveaux,cranch,in which the court had held that the charter of the first bank of the united states did not confer federal subject matter jurisdiction because that bank charter authorized the bank to sue and be sued in courts of record,without specifying the federal courts.osborn,wheat.at deveaux,cranch at.chief justice marshall wrote that,in contrast to the first bank charter,the second bank charter could not have been more direct and appropriate in conferring federal question jurisdiction.osborn,wheat.at.
almost a century later,the court held in bankers trust texas pacific railway,that a federal corporate charter did not confer federal question jurisdiction when it authorized a railroad to sue and be sued in all courts of law and equity within the united states.id.at.that language had the same generality and natural import as the language in deveaux because it did not specifically mention the federal courts.id.at see red cross,at.then,in,duhme fdic,the court upheld federal question jurisdiction based on a federal charter authorizing the federal deposit insurance corporation to sue or be sued in any court of law or equity,state or federal.id.at.
the court wrote in red cross that these cases established a rule that would have been known to congress at least as far back as,when was decided.red cross,at.when federal charters,like those of the red cross and of fannie mae,expressly authoriz e the organization to sue and be sued in federal courts the provision extends beyond a mere grant of general corporate capacity to sue,and suffices to confer federal jurisdiction.id.at.as the court of appeals for the circuit has already held,that rule resolves this case.see pirelli armstrong tire.retiree med.benefits trust ex rel.fed.mortg.ass raines,holding,based on fannie mae charter,that federal question jurisdiction exists over suits brought by or against fannie mae.
despite the specific reference to federal courts in fannie mae clause,our dissenting colleague contends that the clause does not confer federal question jurisdiction.like justice scalia and his fellow dissenters in red cross,the dissent argues that the clause confers only corporate capacity to sue and be sued,and that subject matter jurisdiction must come from some other provision of federal law.dissent at.the dissent relies on the phrase court of competent jurisdiction in the clause.before,fannie mae,like the red cross,had the statutory authority to sue and be sued complain and defend,in any court of law or equity,state or federal,at emphasis added.in,as one of many changes to fannie mae charter,congress amended fannie mae clause to authorize it to sue and to be sued,and to complain and to defend,in any court of competent jurisdiction,state or federal.housing act of,stat,codified as amended at a emphasis added.
the dissent acknowledges that fannie mae pre charter conferred federal question jurisdiction,but argues that congress eliminated that jurisdiction by replacing the phrase court of law or equity with court of competent jurisdiction.dissent at.we disagree.eliminating the charter grant of federal question jurisdiction would have imposed a severe new restraint on fannie mae ability to litigate in federal court.under the general federal question jurisdiction statute,fannie mae would have been restricted by the complaint rule.see,franchise tax bd.constr.laborers vacation trust for,louisville nashville mottley.given that fannie mae is often sued under causes of action,would have conferred jurisdiction in a relatively small number of cases.diversity jurisdiction under,if it existed at all,would have been unavailable in many,perhaps most,cases because fannie mae suits typically involve mortgage transactions to which there are multiple parties,often resulting in a lack of complete diversity.see caterpillar lewis.
there is no indication that congress intended to eliminate federal question jurisdiction in by replacing the phrase court of law or equity with the phrase court of competent jurisdiction.neither the house nor the senate report on fannie mae amendments so much as mentions the court of competent jurisdiction language.see,at,at.given the important practical effect of eliminating federal question jurisdiction under fannie mae clause,we should expect the house or the senate to have said something if they intended a change of that sort.instead,there was silence.
in our view,the most likely explanation for replacing the phrase court of law or equity with court of competent jurisdiction is that congress was simply modernizing fannie mae charter.at our founding and for many years thereafter,the federal court system and most state court systems had separate law and equity courts.by the middle of the century,however,the federal courts and almost every state had abandoned the division.see leonard emmerglick,a century of the new equity.the federal rules of civil procedure merged law and equity in the federal courts in.id.by,only five states continued to have separate law and equity courts.id.at the time of the amendment,fannie mae charter reference to court s of law or equity had become an antiquarian relic with little relevance to the american legal system.
the change in fannie mae clause is best explained as getting rid of this anachronism,as congress had recently done in other statutes.in,in response to the federal rules of civil procedure elimination of the distinction,congress removed a number of references to law or equity in the statutes defining federal district court jurisdiction.see act of june,stat,at.in,as we discuss in more detail below,congress exchanged court of law or equity for court of competent jurisdiction not just in fannie mae charter,but also in the charters of the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic and the home loan bank board.
if congress wanted to eliminate the grant of federal question jurisdiction from fannie mae charter,it is highly unlikely that it would have done so in the way the dissent suggests.in,congress had no reason to think that replacing the phrase court of law or equity with the phrase court of competent jurisdiction would eliminate federal question jurisdiction under fannie mae clause.supreme court cases from deveaux to had put congress on notice that a specific reference to the federal courts was necessary and sufficient to confer jurisdiction.red cross,at emphasis added.the amendments,while using the new phrase court of competent jurisdiction in fannie mae clause,retained the specific reference to the federal courts.congress would not have sought to eliminate federal question jurisdiction under fannie mae clause by retaining the very words the court had recently held sufficient to confer such jurisdiction in.see pirelli,at if congress in did not want to continue to confer federal jurisdiction in fannie mae cases,it logically would have omitted the word federal from the statute,not attempted a bank shot by adding the words of competent jurisdiction.
congress contemporaneous treatment of the fslic shows that it knew a foolproof method to eliminate federal question jurisdiction from a clause.that method was to follow deveaux and simply to omit the reference to federal courts.in,the same year congress amended fannie mae charter,congress eliminated federal question jurisdiction for the fslic by deleting language in its charter that had authorized suit in any court of law or equity,state or federal.congress replaced it with language authorizing suit in any court of competent jurisdiction in the united states.see,at,at.since eliminating the reference to federal courts in the fslic amendment eliminated federal question jurisdiction over fslic suits brought under its clause,congress had no reason also to insert the phrase court of competent jurisdiction to accomplish the same thing.see corley united states,a statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions,so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous internal quotation marks omitted.
the dissent argues that our holding renders superfluous the phrase court of competent jurisdiction.dissent at.we disagree.as we explained above,the phrase served the purpose of eliminating an anachronistic reference to courts of law and equity.but if we need an additional purpose for the phrase,it is not hard to find one.in osborn,the purpose of the phrase in all state courts having competent jurisdiction was to emphasize that the clause did not authorize or require the exercise of subject matter jurisdiction by a state court with narrow,specialized jurisdiction.see wheat.at.fannie mae clause can easily be read to have the same purpose.there was a general concern in the about the extent of federal authority to require state courts to hear cases brought pursuant to federal statutes.in testa katt,the world war federal emergency price control act required state courts to entertain civil suits for treble damages against merchants who charged a retail price exceeding the maximum set by federal law.the act specified that federal and state courts had concurrent jurisdiction.like fannie mae charter,the act authorized suit in any court of competent jurisdiction.id.at.rhode island district and superior courts refused to hear a suit brought under the act,contending that they were not obliged to hear a suit under a federal statute authorizing treble damages.id.at.after determining that the state district and superior courts were courts of competent jurisdiction with jurisdiction adequate and appropriate under established local law to grant treble damages,the court held in testa that such courts were required to hear suits under the act.id.at.
it was in this historical setting that congress added the phrase court of competent jurisdiction to fannie mae charter.consistent with testa,the phrase requires state courts of general or otherwise competent jurisdiction to hear claims brought by and against fannie mae.the phrase makes clear that state courts of specialized jurisdiction such as family courts and courts need not entertain suits that do not satisfy those courts jurisdictional requirements.similarly,the phrase also makes clear that the clause does not require federal courts of specialized jurisdiction such as bankruptcy courts to hear suits falling outside those courts jurisdiction.accord pirelli,at.
finally,the dissent points to several circuit court cases decided after that interpret the phrase court of competent jurisdiction the same way the dissent does.dissent at citing sanders bhap hous.dev.fund,cir lomas nettleton pierce,cir bor son.heller,cir lindy lynn,cir.but all of these cases predate red cross.the only cross cases cited by the dissent are district court decisions.dissent at.
legislative history 
our dissenting colleague makes two arguments based on legislative history that deserve a focused response.first,the dissent points to the history of the amendments.the house bill,which used the phrase court of competent jurisdiction,was designed to effectuate a transformation of fannie mae from a corporation to a privately owned,but still federally chartered,corporation.the senate bill,which retained the old phrase in any court of law or equity,would not have changed the ownership of fannie mae.the house bill prevailed.the dissent concludes that the addition of the phrase court of competent jurisdiction in the amendments,taken from the house bill,was designed to help effectuate the privatizing purpose of the bill.
second,the dissent points to a amendment to fannie mae charter.the amendment allowed fannie mae to change its principal place of business from the district of columbia to the virginia or maryland suburbs,but specified that fannie mae would nonetheless remain a district of columbia corporation for purposes of jurisdiction.housing and community development act of,b,stat,codified as amended at a.the dissent argues that if the clause confers federal question jurisdiction,there would have been no need to confer district of columbia corporate status on fannie mae in,and thereby to confer diversity jurisdiction over suits to which fannie mae is a party.
the amendments 
the dissent relies heavily on the fact that the amendments were part of a broad reform reducing the federal government role in fannie mae.the change to fannie mae clause,the dissent argues,must have furthered this overriding purpose.dissent at.operational role in fannie mae.but the amendments did not completely privatize fannie mae,which remained,even after,a federally chartered corporation with specific statutory requirements for its corporate governance.not every part of the amendment served congress overriding purpose of privatization,and there is no reason that the phrase court of competent jurisdiction must be understood as serving this purpose,and there is no evidence showing that the change to fannie mae clause was part of the move toward privatization.whether federal courts have federal question jurisdiction over fannie mae cases has nothing to do with s ubstituting private sources of funds for government expenditures,the primary means by which the house sought to privatize fannie mae,at see id.at.the house report went into great detail explaining the provisions of the amendments designed to privatize fannie mae.it never once mentioned the change to fannie mae clause.
even more telling is congress simultaneous use of the identical phrase,court of competent jurisdiction,in contexts that had nothing to do with either fannie mae or privatization.in the same act that amended fannie mae charter,congress amended the fslic charter by replacing the phrase court of law and equity with the phrase court of competent jurisdiction.housing act of.also in the same act,congress added the phrase court of competent jurisdiction to the statute governing the home loan bank board hlbb.housing act of.the change to the fslic clause was one of very few changes to the fslic charter.see,at,at.as we discussed above,congress did eliminate federal question jurisdiction for the fslic,but it did so by eliminating any mention of federal courts.the change to the hlbb clause was unrelated to privatization.indeed,with respect to jurisdiction,congress made clear that it wanted to increase the hlbb access to federal courts.both the house and senate explained that they were providing the hlbb the means to enforce the laws and regulations under which federal savings and loan associations operate,at,at.the senate report specifically stated that hlbb proceedings could be in the federal judicial district in which the association is located,at see also,at.
as a postscript to the amendments,in congress split fannie mae into two corporations,fannie mae and the government national mortgage association ginnie mae.housing and urban development act of,stat,codified as amended at.both fannie mae and ginnie mae remained federally chartered,but fannie mae became entirely privately owned and ginnie mae became entirely federally owned.see id.yet fannie mae and ginnie mae kept precisely the same clause,authorizing them both to sue and be sued,and to complain and to defend,in any court of competent jurisdiction,state or federal.if the phrase court of competent jurisdiction had been used in as part of an overall plan to privatize fannie mae and to limit its access to federal courts,congress would not have used that same phrase in ginnie mae charter.
the amendment 
the amendment to the housing act changed the sentence fannie mae shall maintain its principal office in the district of columbia and shall be deemed,for purposes of venue in civil actions,to be a resident thereof to read,fannie mae shall maintain its principal office in the district of columbia or the metropolitan area thereof and shall be deemed,for purposes of jurisdiction and venue in civil actions,to be a district of columbia corporation.housing and community development act of b emphasis added.
the dissent argues that this change shows that congress,in light of the elimination of federal question jurisdiction effectuated by the amendment to fannie mae clause,sought to authorize diversity jurisdiction under over suits in which fannie mae was a party.if it were clear that the amendment was intended to confer diversity jurisdiction over fannie mae cases,this could suggest that congress belatedly realized that it had eliminated federal question jurisdiction by its amendment to fannie mae clause,and now sought,twenty years later,to provide some basis for federal subject matter jurisdiction.see dissent at.but we do not believe that this was the purpose of the amendment.
the jurisdiction to which the amendment refers is almost certainly not subject matter jurisdiction.the reference is almost certainly to personal jurisdiction.the purpose of the amendment was almost certainly to allow fannie mae to move its principal place of business out of the district of columbia to the virginia or maryland suburbs,and at the same time to make clear that fannie mae would be subject to general personal jurisdiction only in the district even if it moved its principal place of business into the suburbs.
a corporation,like an individual,is subject to specific jurisdiction in a forum when its activities in that forum have given rise to the suit.see goodyear dunlop tires operations,brown.a corporation is subject to general jurisdiction only where it is essentially at home.id.at see daimler ag bauman.the two places where a corporation is essentially at home and therefore subject to general jurisdiction are its place of incorporation and its principal place of business.daimler.at.in the amendment,congress specified that fannie mae would be deemed a district of columbia corporation for purposes of jurisdiction and thus subject to general jurisdiction only in the district,despite the possibility that it might move its principal place of business to the suburbs.see a b.
the legislative history of the amendment is consistent with this reading.the house subcommittee summarized the amendment as provid ing that the principal office of fnma be located in the district of columbia metropolitan area,as well as in the district of columbia,though for jurisdiction and venue purposes fnma would be considered a district corporation.subcomm.on hous.of the comm.on banking and currency,compilation of the housing and community development act of,at comm.print see also id.at summarizing the amendment as permit ing the principal office of fnma to be located in the district of columbia metropolitan area,as well as in the district of columbia,though for jurisdiction and venue purposes fnma is to be considered a district resident.the legislative history contains no mention of the possibility that the amendment was intended to authorize diversity jurisdiction based on newly conferred district of columbia citizenship for fannie mae.rather,the legislative history strongly suggests that the amendment was intended to allow fannie mae to move its principal place of business to the suburbs without effecting any change to the place where it would be subject to general jurisdiction.that is,fannie mae could move to the suburbs,though for jurisdiction and venue purposes it would be considered a district corporation.id.at.
the dissent cites two other statutes as examples of congress creating diversity jurisdiction for federally chartered corporations.dissent at.but both statutes support reading the fannie mae amendment as referring to personal rather than subject matter jurisdiction.both statutes expressly refer to the corporation a citizen of the relevant forum.see c the telephone bank shall,for the purposes of jurisdiction and venue,be deemed a citizen and resident of the district of columbia.emphasis added all national banking associations shall,for the purposes of all other actions by or against them,be deemed citizens of the states in which they are respectively located.emphasis added.federal law defines diversity jurisdiction in terms of citizenship,a,so when congress sought to authorize diversity jurisdiction in these two statutes,it used the word citizen.unlike these two statutes,fannie mae amendment does not use the word citizen.rather,it provides only that fannie mae is a district of columbia corporation.a b.
conclusion 
we hold that the clause in fannie mae federal charter confers federal question jurisdiction over suits in which fannie mae is a party.accordingly,we hold that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs claims.we affirm the district court dismissal of plaintiffs claims for the reasons stated in our previous unpublished disposition.lightfoot,app x at.
fannie mae charter gives the company the power to sue and to be sued,and to complain and to defend,in any court of competent jurisdiction,state or federal.a.unlike the corporate charter at issue in american national red cross s,fannie mae clause contains a proviso the phrase of competent jurisdiction.the majority offers a few potential readings of this phrase,but each of these constructions effectively renders the proviso superfluous.but the phrase of competent jurisdiction is not a potted plant it must mean something.with the proviso included,fannie mae clause does not confer automatic federal subject matter jurisdiction over any action to which fannie mae is a party jurisdiction must arise from some other source.i therefore respectfully dissent.
i.the red cross default rule 
congress has used the clauses of federal corporations to achieve multiple goals.most obviously,these clauses make clear that the federal entity as opposed to,for example,its administrator has the ability to engage in litigation.see fed.hous.admin.burr.congress also uses these clauses to confirm that a federally created entity can not invoke sovereign immunity.see id.at.and congress may also draft a clause to confer federal jurisdiction upon any suit to which the federal corporation is a party.
a hoary line of supreme court precedent sets forth how congress may achieve this final goal.the court first considered this question in bank of the united states deveaux,cranch,with chief justice marshall writing.the corporation in that case was the first bank of the united states,and its charter empowered the bank to sue and be sued,plead and be impleaded,answer and be answered,defend and be defended,in courts of record,or any other place whatsoever.id.at.the court concluded that this section merely granted the bank the capacity to sue.it did not enlarge the jurisdiction of any particular court.id.
two lines of reasoning supported this holding.first,the court concluded that automatic access to the federal courts did not necessarily follow from a generic authorization to sue and be sued.see id.at.second,a different section of the bank charter explicitly provided for federal jurisdiction in certain suits against the president and directors of the bank.see id.at.this,the chief justice announced,evinces the opinion of congress,that the right to sue does not imply a right to sue in the courts of the union,unless it be expressed.id.
congress seemingly responded to the court ruling when it chartered the second bank of the united states.the relevant section of the second bank charter gave it the right to sue and be sued,plead and be impleaded,answer and be answered,defend and be defended,in all state courts having competent jurisdiction,and in any circuit court of the united states.osborn bank of the united states,wheat.the osborn court,once again through chief justice marshall,determined that unlike the language at issue in deveaux,the second bank charter unambiguously conferred federal subject matter jurisdiction.id.at.
deveaux and osborn together established a default rule for determining whether a federal corporation clause confers federal subject matter jurisdiction.as the supreme court summarized in american national red cross,a congressional charter sue and be sued provision may be read to confer federal court jurisdiction if,but only if,it specifically mentions the federal courts.id.at.
the clause at issue in that case gave the red cross the power to sue and be sued in courts of law and equity,state or federal,within the jurisdiction of the united states.id.at.this language went beyond the general authorization of deveaux.see id.at.in addition,the red cross clause was in all relevant respects identical to a charter provision that the court held to confer jurisdiction in,duhme federal deposit insurance.see red cross,at.importantly,congress amended the relevant provision of the red cross charter just five years after was decided.see id.at.the plain language and statutory history together compelled the conclusion that the red cross charter gave federal courts subject matter jurisdiction over suits to which the company was a party.
red cross provides the supreme court most recent pronouncement on the jurisdictional implications of federal clauses.however,red cross did not announce any new rule of law.see id.at.rather,the court simply restated the rule established in the court twin decisions of osborn and deveaux.id.at.red cross thus did not announce a test that ends all inquiry the moment we come across the word federal it restated a default rule to assist congress and the courts in writing and interpreting clauses.
recognizing that the rule in red cross is a default has an important implication it means that congress can draft exceptions to the rule.when congress creates corporations,it has full authority to make such restrictions on the sue and be sued clause as seem to it appropriate or necessary.fed.hous.admin.burr,fed.sav.loan ins.ticktin,congress can write provisos that limit broad grant s of federal jurisdiction.counsel for fannie mae nicely summarized this point at oral argument if congress says you can sue or be sued in federal court,that is at least a profoundly strong default rule and you have to find something else in the statute that says even though we want you to sue in federal court,we do really mean it.oral arg.rec.at.
red cross did not tie congress hands,preventing it from crafting clauses as it deems fit.we can not ignore the of competent jurisdiction proviso we must determine what it means.the red cross default rule gives us the starting point for our analysis of fannie mae clause.the supreme court application of the default rule over the past two centuries defines the interpretive tools for our analysis.using this approach,fannie mae clause allows for only one reading a court must have an independent basis of jurisdiction to hear a suit involving that company.
ii.the plain language of fannie mae sue and be sued clause 
as noted,fannie mae charter grants the company the power to sue and to be sued,and to complain and to defend,in any court of competent jurisdiction,state or federal.a.absent the of competent jurisdiction proviso,this clause would clearly confer jurisdiction on the federal courts.see,at.the true question before this court,then,is what the proviso means.on its face,the phrase of competent jurisdiction look s to outside sources of jurisdictional authority.califano sanders.when of competent jurisdiction modifies state courts,the proviso instructs us to look for a jurisdictional hook in that state law.see osborn,wheat.at.the proviso performs the same function when it modifies federal courts.no court state or federal is competent to hear a suit involving fannie mae unless it has subject matter jurisdiction by some means other than fannie mae clause.
congress has utilized substantively identical language in other clauses,and the courts of appeals have overwhelmingly agreed that an of competent jurisdiction proviso requires an alternative basis of jurisdiction.fannie mae has directed our attention in particular to the provision that authorizes the administrator of the federal housing administration to sue and be sued in any court of competent jurisdiction,state or federal.a long line of cases has held that this statute does not confer federal jurisdiction.see sanders bhap hous.dev.fund,cir lomas nettleton pierce,cir bor son.heller,cir lindy lynn,cir.this very circuit has followed the interpretation of the statute,albeit in dicta.see munoz small business,cir.the majority criticizes my reliance on these cases because they were handed down prior to red cross,which,as set forth above,announced no new rule of law.but if the majority seeks cross cases that agree with this dissent that an independent basis is needed to support federal subject matter jurisdiction for fannie mae,we need only look to the numerous district court opinions in this circuit that the majority overrules with its decision.as district judge dean pregerson recently summarized,courts in this circuit appear to have uniformly reached the conclusion that fannie mae charter does not confer federal subject matter jurisdiction.fed.mortgage ass moreno,cv,wl,at.may,collecting cases.judge pregerson concurred with that significant consensus see id.
in sum,when congress has included of competent jurisdiction provisos in clauses,courts have honored congress intent and ruled these clauses to not confer subject matter jurisdiction.fannie mae clause should be no different.
the majority offers two alternative readings for the of competent jurisdiction proviso.neither is persuasive.first,the majority suggests that the proviso was part of congress drive to modernize the in the mid century.during this period,law and equity were merged in the federal courts and in a majority of the states.see.the merger largely rendered references to courts of law and equity into historical curiosities.as the majority correctly points out,when congress amended title of the,it cleaned up these references in the sections that confer jurisdiction on the district courts.congress went about its task expeditiously it simply deleted references to courts of law or equity congress did not replace these phrases with new references to courts of competent jurisdiction for a singularly valid reason.as explained above,the phrase of competent jurisdiction signals that the section containing that phrase will not also harbor a grant of jurisdiction.it would make no sense to include this proviso in a section designed to confer jurisdiction.
next,the majority offers that the of competent jurisdiction proviso could be read to emphasize that state and federal courts of specialized jurisdiction need not hear cases involving fannie mae purely on the basis of its clause.there are two flies in the ointment of this reading.
first,the majority relies on the osborn court interpretation of the second bank charter,which authorized the bank to sue in all state courts having competent jurisdiction.osborn,wheat.at.according to the majority,this phrase ensured that a state court with narrow,specialized jurisdiction was not required to hear any case involving the bank.majority op.at.this is an unduly narrow reading of the clause.in fact,the second bank charter made clear that no state court was required to hear a suit involving the bank,unless that court had a basis for jurisdiction.this reading accords with the understood relationship between congress and the state courts around the time the second bank was chartered i hold it to be perfectly clear,that congress can not confer jurisdiction upon any courts,but such as exist under the constitution and laws of the united states,although the state courts may exercise jurisdiction on cases authorized by the laws of the state,and not prohibited by the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts.houston moore,wheat,emphasis added.the of competent jurisdiction proviso serves precisely the same purpose in fannie mae charter the only difference is that the proviso applies to the courts of the states and the federal government.
second,red cross forecloses the majority construction of the of competent jurisdiction proviso.the red cross charter gave that organization the power to sue and be sued in courts of law and equity,state or federal,within the jurisdiction of the united states.red cross,at.in his dissenting opinion,justice scalia argued that if this clause must confer federal jurisdiction,it must confer jurisdiction on all the federal courts,including those of specialized jurisdiction.see id.at scalia,dissenting.the court rejected this approach and held that the red cross charter confers automatic jurisdiction only in the district courts today,the sole federal courts of broad original jurisdiction.see id.at majority opinion.red cross therefore demonstrates that congress does not need an of competent jurisdiction proviso to ensure that fannie mae will not foist itself upon federal courts of specialized jurisdiction.the majority reading of the proviso would render it entirely superfluous.
the majority claims that testa katt,provides an historical backdrop for its interpretation of the clause.this is an interesting hypothetical,but one without relevance to the issue presented in this case.testa restated the uncontroversial proposition that state courts can not refuse to hear federal causes of action when those courts entertain similar state law causes of action.see id.at see also,haywood drown.but congress did not give fannie mae a proprietary cause of action when it amended the company charter in.when fannie mae sues or is sued,the cause of action must derive from a separate realm of federal law or,more likely,from state law.see,welch burton,fannie mae joined as defendant in quiet title action malcolm macdowell assocs.ecorse lincoln park bank,fannie mae sued for breach of a contract.testa does not evidence a midcentury climate of fear that federal entities would be denied access to state courts,especially in cases touching on state property and mortgage law.
the red cross default rule does not allow us to ignore the of competent jurisdiction proviso it must mean something.the only natural reading of this phrase instructs us to look for a source of jurisdiction outside of fannie mae clause.
iii.the legislative context of fannie mae sue and be sued clause 
looking beyond the plain language of fannie mae clause,the history of congress amendments to this statute reinforces the conclusion that the clause does not confer federal subject matter jurisdiction.
a.the amendment 
prior to,fannie mae clause gave it the power t o sue and be sued,complain and defend,in any court of law or equity,state or federal.housing act,ch,c,stat.this clause inarguably gave fannie mae access to the federal courts.see,at.but knowing this,congress in struck the language in any court of law or equity,and replaced it with in any court of competent jurisdiction.it is a basic tenet of statutory interpretation that w hen congress acts to amend a statute,courts presume it intends its amendment to have real and substantial effect.stone.indeed,the supreme court in red cross reinforced the importance of this canon in the context of clauses.see red cross,at.congress thus emphasized the implications of the of competent jurisdiction proviso by adding it to a previously statute.
congress motivation and method in amending fannie mae charter have proved obscure to some.see pirelli armstrong tire.retiree med.benefits trust ex rel.fed.mortg.ass raines.it is true that the legislative history behind the amendment does not expressly discuss the addition of the of competent jurisdiction proviso.but the legislative history does reveal that congress intended to reduce the footprint of the federal government in the national housing market.congress amendment to fannie mae clause was simply one facet of this overriding purpose.
the act was prompted by president eisenhower desire to develop a new and revitalized housing program better adapted to current requirements,which would clearly identify the proper role of the federal government in the housing field and outline more economical and effective means for improving the housing conditions of our people,at.as the house committee on banking and currency put it,one of the act basic objectives was s ubstituting private sources of funds for government expenditures whenever possible,especially in connection with the provision of a secondary market for home mortgages.id.at.
the house passed a version of the act that would dramatically remake fannie mae.pursuant to,fannie mae would be dissolved and rechartered with substantial changes in its authority and with provision for the eventual substitution of private capital for government investment in its secondary market operations,at.the new fannie mae would issue capital stock to the secretary of the treasury and convertible bonds to private investors.see id.at.once the capital stock owned by the secretary was retired,the convertible bonds could be exchanged for common stock and fannie mae could issue more common stock directly to the public.see id.at.notably for our purposes,the house bill included the of competent jurisdiction proviso in fannie mae amended corporate charter.see id.at.
the senate committee on banking and currency strongly disagreed with the house treatment of fannie mae.that committee did not believe that the testimony
