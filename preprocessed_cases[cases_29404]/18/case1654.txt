booz allen the company redeemed joseph nemec and gerd wittkemper stock after their put rights expired,but before selling its government business division.nemec and wittkemper asserted,and the chancellor dismissed,claims that the board breached the company stock plan implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and its fiduciary duty and unjustly enriched itself.because the board exercised an express contractual right,we affirm the judgment of the court of chancery.
factual and procedural background 
the parties 
nemec retired from booz allen on march,after nearly years of service with the company.nemec was elected three times to the company board of directors,where he served on the finance and professional excellence committees and chaired the audit committee.at the time of his retirement,nemec ranked third in seniority among booz allen partners.
wittkemper also retired from booz allen on march,after nearly years of service with the company.wittkemper built the foundation for booz allen german business and helped expand booz allen business throughout europe.for nine years wittkemper was a member of booz allen worldwide commercial business leadership team.he also served as head of the communications media technology practice,and later as head of booz allen european business.
booz allen,a delaware corporation headquartered in mclean,virginia,is a strategy and technology consulting firm.in july,booz allen had approximately shareholders,employees,and annual revenues of approximately billion.booz allen was founded as a partnership in,but later changed its legal structure and became a delaware corporation.booz allen retained,however,the attitude and culture of a partnership,owned and led by a relatively small cadre of corporate officers,who were referred to as the partners.
the individual defendants were members of booz allen board of directors at the time the plaintiffs booz allen shares were redeemed,and at the time the company sold booz allen government business to the carlyle group.the directors collectively owned about of booz allen outstanding common stock.
the booz allen stock rights plan 
throughout their tenure,nemec and wittkemper,along with all other officers of the company,were partially compensated with annual grants of stock rights that were convertible into common stock of the company.those rights were granted under the booz,allen hamilton.officers stock rights plan.under the stock plan,each retired officer had a put right,exercisable for a period of two years from the date of his or her retirement,to sell his or her shares back to the company at book value after that period expired,the company then had the right to redeem,at any time,part or all of the retired officer stock at book value 
when they retired in march,nemec owned shares of booz allen stock representing about of the company issued and outstanding common shares,and wittkemper owned shares representing almost of those shares.nemec retained all of his booz allen stock during the period following his retirement wittkemper sold most of his shares but retained some of them.
the carlyle transaction 
in february,booz allen reorganized its two principal lines of business into two separate business units i a government unit,which provided consulting services to governments and governmental agencies,and ii a global commercial unit,which provided services to commercial and international businesses.at that time,booz allen leadership began to consider spinning off one of those two businesses.
during the summer of,booz allen leadership discussed internally a possible transaction in which booz allen would sell its government business.in october,booz allen and the carlyle group began negotiations,which culminated in the carlyle group november offer to purchase booz allen government business for billion.
on january,the wall street journal reported that booz allen was engaged in discussions to sell its business to firm carlyle group,and that the sale price will likely be around billion.they reported that the transaction was expected to close by march.at some point before march,however,booz allen board and management learned that the carlyle transaction would close later than planned.
in march,booz allen board of directors,in anticipation of the carlyle transaction,extended their and management terms of office by days,until the end of june,and declined to issue new stock rights to its officers,thus preserving the contemporaneous booz allen stock ownership.booz allen commercial business stockholders also elected the persons who would become the board of directors of a newly formed company,would operate booz allen commercial business after the carlyle transaction closed by this point,the purchase price of the carlyle transaction had been agreed upon,and the booz allen board and stockholders knew that the transaction would generate over per share to booz allen stockholders.
on may,booz allen entered into i a formal merger agreement that would result in the sale of its government business to the carlyle group and ii a agreement that would result in the transfer of its commercial business to booz company.on may,booz allen publicly announced the sale of its government business to the carlyle group for billion.that transaction closed on july,months after the plaintiffs put rights expired 
the redemption of plaintiffs booz allen stock 
if allowed to participate in the carlyle transaction,the plaintiffs would have received materially more than the march book value of their booz allen shares.in april,the company redeemed the plaintiffs shares at their book value approximately per share the april redemption of the plaintiffs shares added nearly million to the proceeds received by booz allen working stockholders.at the time of the redemptions,booz allen was awaiting the receipt of an irs private opinion letter regarding the tax treatment of the transaction and the completion of an audit of financials for certain prior fiscal years which had already been certified.none of the parties to the transaction expected that these events would present problems,and everyone anticipated that both would occur within a matter of days or weeks.
the plaintiffs later filed these actions which were later consolidated in the court of chancery.
procedural history 
the plaintiffs amended complaint asserted three separate claims.count i alleged that by redeeming the plaintiffs shares at a time when the carlyle transaction was virtually certain to occur,booz allen breached its covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied in the stock plan.count ii claimed that the directors breached their fiduciary duty of loyalty to the plaintiffs by causing the company to redeem the plaintiffs shares,in favor of the directors personal interests.count iii alleged that as a result of the improper redemptions,the directors were unjustly enriched.
the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.the chancellor granted the motion and dismissed the complaint in its entirety.this appeal followed.
this court reviews de novo the grant of a motion to dismiss under court of chancery rule b,to determine whether the trial judge erred as a matter of law in formulating or applying legal precepts.dismissal is appropriate only if it appears with reasonable certainty that the plaintiff would not be entitled to relief under any set of facts susceptible of proof in reviewing the grant of a motion to dismiss,we view the complaint in the light most favorable to the party,accepting as true their allegations and drawing all reasonable inferences that logically flow from those allegations.we do not,however,blindly accept conclusory allegations unsupported by specific facts,nor do we draw unreasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.
the chancellor properly dismissed count i 
the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing involves a cautious enterprise,inferring contractual terms to handle developments or contractual gaps that the asserting party pleads neither party anticipated o ne generally can not base a claim for breach of the implied covenant on conduct authorized by the agreement.we will only imply contract terms when the party asserting the implied covenant proves that the other party has acted arbitrarily or unreasonably,thereby frustrating the fruits of the bargain that the asserting party reasonably expected when conducting this analysis,we must assess the parties reasonable expectations at the time of and not rewrite the contract to appease a party who later wishes to rewrite a contract he now believes to have been a bad deal.parties have a right to enter into good and bad contracts,the law enforces both.
the plaintiffs lacked a reasonable expectation of participating in the benefits of the carlyle transaction shrader gratuitous,remark and the company actions implementing the company contracted for redemption rights can not outweigh the clearly written,express,contractual language 
the complaint allegation that the company,a delaware corporation,would not be for sale in whole or in part during the redemption period,and that no one at the time of drafting and adopting the stock plan could have anticipated that possibility and if they had,all parties would have agreed to compensate retired stockholders as if they had contributed to the deal value stands naked,wholly unworthy of the inference that it is fully clothed the implied covenant only applies to developments that could not be anticipated,not developments that the parties simply failed to where the contract authorizes the company to act exactly as it did here 
the chancellor found no cognizable claim for a breach of the implied covenant because the stock plan explicitly authorized the redemption price and timing,and booz allen,nemec,and wittkemper received exactly what they bargained for under the stock plan.the chancellor wrote c ontractually negotiated put and call rights are intended by both parties to be exercised at the time that is most advantageous to the party invoking the option.
no facts gleaned from the complaint suggest that anyone negotiating for the working stockholders would have made such a does the complaint point to any reason they should have nothing except the absence of specific language contemplating a private equity,post retirement buyout supports a view that it can be inferred that had the parties to the stock plan specifically addressed the issue at the time of contract,they would have agreed to preclude the company from exercising its redemption right before the carlyle transaction closed.the implied covenant will not infer language that contradicts a clear exercise of an express contractual right.our colleagues thoughtful dissent suggests that we neglect to note that the challenged conduct redeeming the retired stockholders shares must further a legitimate interest of the party relying on the contract emphasis supplied by the dissent.the company directors,at the time of the decision to redeem owed fiduciary duties to the corporation and its stockholders the redemption would not affect the company directly.however,a failure to redeem the now retired stockholders shares consistent with the company right under the stock plan would directly reduce the working stockholders distribution by million.if the company directors had not exercised the company absolute contractual right to redeem the retired stockholders shares,the working stockholders had a potential claim against the directors for favoring the retired stockholders to the detriment of the working stockholders.
the company redemption of the retired stockholders shares now produces the retirees accusation that the company breached the covenant of fair dealing and good faith implied in the stock plan.the directors did nothing unfair and breached no fiduciary duty by causing the company to exercise its absolute contractual right to redeem the retired stockholders shares at a time that was most advantageous to the company working stockholders.the fact that some directors were in the group of working stockholders who received a pro rata share of the million did not make it an interested transaction because those director stockholders received the same pro rata benefit as all other stockholders similarly situated the directors made a rational business judgment to exercise the company contractual right for the million benefit to all working stockholders rather than to take no action and be accused of favoritism to the retired stockholders.
the plaintiffs assert that the company violated an implied obligation to exercise its redemption right in good faith and to deal fairly with the plaintiffs.the stock plan does not address whether retired stockholders should share in any locked in value of the if discussed or even contemplated during negotiation of the stock plan,a reasonable retiring stockholder would have bargained for the potential release of the unlocked value.the complaint alleges no facts that demonstrate that,at the time of contracting,both parties would reasonably have expected nemec and wittkemper to participate in the buy out.nor does the complaint offer us a cautious approach to infer contractual terms.rather,the plaintiffs would have us long term stockholders of a prestigious mergers and acquisition consulting firm would have no expectation that a future acquirer would be interested in purchasing all or part of the company.
crafting,what is,in effect,a post contracting equitable amendment that shifts economic benefits from working to retired partners would vitiate the limited reach of the concept of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing delaware implied duty of good faith and fair dealing is not an equitable remedy for rebalancing economic interests after events that could have been anticipated,but were not,that later adversely affected one party to a contract.rather the covenant is a limited and extraordinary legal remedy.as the chancellor noted in his opinion,the doctrine requires a party in a contractual relationship to refrain from arbitrary or unreasonable conduct which has the effect of preventing the other party to the contract from receiving the fruits of the bargain.these got the benefit of their actual bargain and now urge us to expand the doctrine of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.a party does not act in bad faith by relying on contract provisions for which that party bargained where doing so simply limits advantages to another party.we can not reform a contract because enforcement of the contract as written would raise moral questions.the policy underpinning the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing does not extend to post contractual rebalancing of the economic benefits flowing to the contracting parties accordingly,we affirm the chancellor dismissal of count 
the chancellor properly dismissed count ii 
count ii of the complaint alleges that by causing the company to redeem the plaintiffs shares before the carlyle transaction closed,the directors acted to further their own economic,at the expense and to the detriment of the plaintiffs,thereby breaching their fiduciary duty of loyalty.those allegations,even if true,do not establish an enforceable breach of fiduciary duty claim in the specific circumstances alleged here.
the chancellor held that the plaintiffs fiduciary duty claim fails for two reasons.first,the claim seeks to enforce obligations that are expressly addressed by contract the stock plan,and that,therefore,must be adjudicated within the analytical framework of a breach of contract claim stated differently,the chancellor found that the stock plan created contract duties that superseded and negated any distinct fiduciary duties arising out of the same conduct that constituted the contractual breach.second,the chancellor held that the complaint did not adequately plead facts sufficient to establish that the timing of the directors redemption decision was contrary to the exercise of the directors sound and good faith business judgment because we affirm the dismissal of count ii on the first ground articulated by the chancellor,we do not reach the second.
it is a principle that where a dispute arises from obligations that are expressly addressed by contract,that dispute will be treated as a breach of contract claim.
