rlh industries,rlh,appeals from summary judgment granted to defendants sbc communications sbc,and pacific bell telephone company pacbell.rlh alleged the defendants violated california antitrust law by requiring their local telephone service customers to obtain high voltage protection hvp from defendants or,in pacbell case,from approved hvp device makers other than rlh.rlh contended defendants hvp policies constituted an illegal tying arrangement impairing its ability to compete in the hvp market.
we conclude the court correctly granted summary judgment to pacbell.rlh failed to raise a triable issue as to whether pacbell illegally tied its hvp service to its local telephone service,because the undisputed evidence showed pacbell offered its customers a choice between leasing pacbell hvp services or buying their own hvp devices from two independent suppliers.since pacbell hvp policy does not threaten competition,the court correctly granted summary judgment to pacbell.
on the other hand,we conclude the court erred in granting summary judgment to sbc.a triable issue exists as to whether sbc perpetrated an illegal tying arrangement the evidence tended to show sbc midwest subsidiary required its customers to lease its hvp services in order to receive local telephone service,and prohibited customers from buying their own hvp devices.we can not say,on the existing record and as a matter of law,this policy does not constitute an illegal tying arrangement.
we reject the only two grounds sbc asserts for affirming its judgment.first,sbc contends it is not liable for its subsidiaries hvp policies,but sbc failed to show the nonexistence of triable issues as to whether it is liable under an alter ego or agency theory.second,sbc contends the commerce clause of the united states constitution limits california law to regulating conduct.we conclude the commerce clause does not bar application of california antitrust law to anticompetitive conduct that causes injury in california.accordingly,we affirm the summary judgment in favor of pacbell,and reverse summary judgment in favor of sbc.
in reviewing summary judgment in favor of sbc and pacbell,we view the evidence in a light favorable to rlh as the losing party citation,liberally construing its evidentiary submission while strictly scrutinizing defendants own showing,and resolving any evidentiary doubts or ambiguities in rlh favor.saelzler advanced group cal th,d,saelzler.
sbc subsidiaries provide local telephone service.sbc subsidiary pacbell provides local telephone service in california.sbc subsidiary ameritech corporation ameritech provides local telephone service in illinois,ohio,michigan,wisconsin,and indiana the midwest region.other sbc subsidiaries provide local telephone service in seven other states.
rlh is a california company with its principal place of business in orange,california.it makes hvp devices,which protect telephone lines against hazardous voltages arising from ground potential rise gpr caused by lightning or voltage surges.only three other north american companies manufacture hvp devices positron industries positron,snc manufacturing snc,and westell technologies.
pacbell and ameritech require their local telephone service customers at sites exceeding gpr,like utility companies,to use hvp devices.the two companies have different hvp policies.
pacbell offers its customers a choice between leasing hvp services from pacbell,or buying and installing their own hvp devices.customers who lease hvp protection from pacbell sign leases containing mixed use provisions,which require customers who later want to install their own hvp devices to pay a termination fee and replace any existing hvp devices.customers who install their own hvp devices must buy them from suppliers.pacbell generally approves positron and snc devices for use throughout the state.pacbell generally approves rlh devices for use by northern california customers,but only sporadically approves rlh devices in certain southern california areas.pacbell requires all its customers at locations with gpr exceeding to use rlh devices.
ameritech requires its customers to lease its hvp service.customers can not install their own hvp devices.ameritech installs only positron devices,except it uses rlh devices at sites where gpr exceeds.
rlh sued sbc and pacbell over their hvp policies,alleging defendants illegally used their market power in the local telephone service market to tie customers into leasing hvp services from them.in the operative second amended complaint,rlh asserted causes of action for cartwright act violations,unfair competition,and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage.the court granted summary judgment to defendants,holding the hvp policies did not constitute tying arrangements.
discussion 
to obtain summary judgment,the defendants must show an element of each of rlh causes of action can not be established,or show a complete defense thereto.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,aguilar.they bear the burden to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact.ibid.if they do so,rlh must show some triable issue of material fact does exist.ibid.on appeal,we must independently examine the record to determine whether triable issues of material fact exist.saelzler,supra,cal th at,d.
no evidence suggests pacbell unlawfully tied hvp protection to its telephone service 
rlh alleges pacbell hvp policy violates california antitrust law,the cartwright act bus,subd.a,by constituting a tying arrangement.a tying arrangement is a requirement that a buyer purchase one product or service as a condition of the purchase of another.citation.traditionally the product which is the inducement for the arrangement is called the tying product and the product or service that the buyer is required to purchase is the tied product.morrison viacom,th,d morrison.
the elements of a per se tying arrangement violative of business and professions code section are a tying agreement,arrangement or condition existed whereby the sale of the tying product was linked to the sale of the tied product or service the party had sufficient economic power in the tying market to coerce the purchase of the tied product a substantial amount of sale was affected in the tied product and the complaining party sustained pecuniary loss as a consequence of the unlawful act.morrison,supra,th at,d.
although the parties dispute each element,rlh lack of evidence tending to show the first tying dispositive.the undisputed evidence showed pacbell does not link its telephone service to its hvp service.rather,its customers have a choice among competitors.they can choose to lease pacbell hvp service,or buy and install their own hvp devices from positron or snc.pacbell does not tie its hvp service to its telephone service merely by packaging them together,because its customers can choose to buy telephone service and hvp service separately,from different parties.see northern pacific railway company united states,fn,d northern pacific of course where the buyer is free to take either product by itself there is no tying problem even though the seller may also offer the two items as a unit at a single price see also jefferson parish hosp.dist.hyde,d buyers often find package sales attractive a seller decision to offer such packages can merely be an attempt to compete that is entirely consistent with antitrust law.
for pacbell hvp policy to constitute an illegal tie,rlh must show pacbell had a direct financial interest in the other hvp providers.see suburban mobile homes,amfac communities,d.mobile home park illegally tied home sales to home sites by requiring customers to purchase homes from suppliers who paid commissions to the park carl sandburg village condo.ass first condo.cir,carl sandburg an illegal tying arrangement will not be found where the alleged tying company has absolutely no economic interest in the sales of the tied seller,whose products are favored by the.but no evidence suggests pacbell has any such direct financial interest in positron or snc.positron did give free training for its hvp devices to pacbell,but it is undisputed that positron offers the same free training to all its current and potential customers,whether they buy its hvp devices or not.the free training is not a direct financial interest in positron.
as an alternative theory,rlh asserts pacbell need not have an interest in the approved suppliers,because it unreasonably withheld approval of rlh devices.rlh relies on,omni promotions of cir,which states where a contract provides that buyers shall use only the seller or a source approved by the seller to purchase the tied product,the courts have looked to see if the approval clause was reasonable and permitted the buyer meaningful freedom of choice,or whether it is manipulated by the seller to force the buyer to purchase the tied product from the seller.rlh contends pacbell manipulated customers into leasing its hvp service by unreasonably denying them the option of using rlh purportedly superior hvp devices.
but offers no help to rlh,because it does not eliminate the direct financial interest requirement.the defendant and the approved supplier in that case were under common ownership and management and essentially function ed as a single entity,supra,at.and the cases on which relies expressly endorse the direct financial interest requirement.midwestern waffles,waffle house,cir,only if a franchisee is coerced into purchasing products from a company in which the franchisor has a financial interest does an illegal tie exist kentucky fried chicken diversified packaging cir,when the victim of an alleged is not required to buy a single unit of the tied product from the tying party or from any source in which the tying party has an interest or on whose sales the tying party earns a commission,the arrangement simply does not constitute a tie.
as a final fallback,rlh contends pacbell mixed use policy constitutes a tying arrangement.this policy forbids customers who lease pacbell hvp services from later installing their own hvp devices without first replacing all hvp devices and paying a hefty termination charge.rlh contends the lease terms dissuade pacbell hvp customers from switching to rlh devices,thus impairing competition.but this policy preserves competition because pacbell customers may avoid the purportedly onerous lease terms by choosing to buy their own hvp devices at the outset.queen city pizza,domino pizza,cir,no tying agreement where the domino franchisees could assess the potential costs and economic risks of an requirement at the time they signed the franchise agreement.no evidence suggests pacbell imposed the mixed use policy on customers only after they locked in to leasing its hvp services.eastman kodak image technical services,d.
in short,rlh overlooks that the antitrust law is concern ed with the protection of competition,not competitors.brown shoe united states,d.pacbell hvp policy protects competition by allowing customers to choose between leasing its hvp services or buying their own hvp devices from two suppliers in whom pacbell has no direct financial interest.pacbell decision not to approve rlh devices as often as rlh would like may harm rlh as an individual competitor,but it does not harm competition.
pacbell hvp policy is not unfair or independently wrongful 
having properly granted pacbell summary judgment on the cartwright act causes of action,the court also properly granted pacbell summary judgment on the unfair competition cause of action.bus.
rlh contends pacbell hvp policy may constitute an unfair business practice,even if it does not violate the cartwright act.rlh relies on communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d,which defined unfair as conduct that threatens an incipient violation of an antitrust law,or violates the policy or spirit of one of those laws because its effects are comparable to or the same as a violation of the law,or otherwise significantly threatens or harms competition.id.at,d.rlh claims pacbell hvp policy need not be a antitrust violation to be deemed unfair.
even if so,nothing suggests pacbell hvp policy threatens an incipient violation of the cartwright act,violates its policy or spirit,or otherwise threatens competition,supra,cal th at,d.rlh did not nip an illegal tying arrangement in the bud.pacbell hvp policy does not risk harming competition because it allows customers to choose between leasing its hvp services or buying hvp devices from two independent suppliers.even if some unfair competition causes of action can survive independently of an actual antitrust violation,this one does not.see chavez whirlpool th,d if the same conduct is alleged to be both an antitrust violation and an unfair business act or practice for the same it unreasonably restrains competition and harms determination that the conduct is not an unreasonable restraint of trade necessarily implies that the conduct is not unfair toward consumers.
in the same vein,rlh intentional interference with economic advantage cause of action against pacbell fails.a plaintiff seeking to recover for alleged interference with prospective economic relations has the burden of pleading and proving that the defendant interference was wrongful by some measure beyond the fact of the interference itself.della penna toyota motor sales,cal th,d.a n act is independently wrongful if it is unlawful,that is,if it is proscribed by some constitutional,statutory,regulatory,common law,or other determinable legal standard.korea supply lockheed martin cal th,d.pacbell hvp policy violates no determinable legal standard,is not independently wrongful,and can not support rlh intentional interference cause of action.
sbc was not entitled to summary judgment 
although the court properly granted summary judgment to pacbell,it erred in granting summary judgment to sbc.sbc does not argue its subsidiaries hvp policies do not constitute a tying arrangement.as will be seen,sbc made the right tactical decision in directing its efforts elsewhere.triable issues exist on that point.
rather,sbc defends its summary judgment on two grounds the court did not reach it is not liable for its subsidiaries hvp policies and the commerce clause restricts california law to regulating conduct.the parties thoroughly briefed both issues below and on appeal we require no additional briefing.we conclude sbc failed to show the nonexistence of triable issues as to its liability for its subsidiaries hvp polices,and its commerce clause argument misses the target.
a triable issue exists as to whether sbc is liable for its subsidiaries hvp policies 
sbc failed to meet its summary judgment burden of making a prima facie showing no triable issue exists as to whether it is liable for its subsidiaries hvp policies.whether sbc is liable under either an agency or alter ego theory is a question of fact.las palmas associates las palmas center associates d,d alter ego witkin,summary of cal.law ed.agency,agency.the only evidence sbc offers to show no triable issue exists as to these theories is the declaration of an sbc officer averring that sbc and pacbell are separate entities with separate boards of directors.the declaration says nothing about the relationship between sbc and its other subsidiaries,such as ameritech.it lacks any value in showing no triable issues exist as to whether these subsidiaries are sbc agents or alter egos.sbc thus failed to shift the burden of production on the agency and alter ego theories to rlh,and is not entitled to summary judgment on this ground aguilar,supra,cal th at,d.
the commerce clause does not bar california antitrust and unfair competition law from reaching conduct injuring california residents 
sbc contends the commerce clause bars rlh claims because california law can not reach sbc business practices in other states.the commerce clause of the federal constitution delegates to congress the power t o regulate commerce with foreign nations,and among the several states,and with the indian tribes,art.i,cl.this explicit grant of power has been interpreted as an implied limitation on the power of states and local government to adopt statutes,regulations,and ordinances that burden or interfere with interstate commerce.citation.known as the dormant or negative
