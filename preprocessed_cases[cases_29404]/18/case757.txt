harry edelson brought the present action against chinadotcom corporation chinadotcom raymond ch ien,peter yip hak yung and asia pacific online for an alleged violation of d of the securities and exchange act exchange act,d,and other claims.edelson sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief as well as damages.the district court determined that edelson could not sustain a private cause of action under d,denied edelson injunctive relief and dismissed his d claim.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
backgrounda.changes in chinadotcom board 
edelson served as an outside,director on chinadotcom board of directors board from until chinadotcom is a cayman islands company,headquartered in hong kong its stock trades on the nasdaq exchange.yip is of the board and chinadotcom chief executive officer ceo ch ien is chinadotcom chairman of the board.all three men,edelson,yip and ch ien,hold stock in chinadotcom 
beginning in early,edelson began having serious disagreements with chinadotcom management,especially yip and ch ien,regarding various governance issues.a major source of contention was the propriety of a stock program.yip was in favor of the program according to which chinadotcom would repurchase issued shares at per share.yip and ch ien would have benefitted personally from this because they recently had acquired additional chinadotcom shares at less than per share.edelson and another board member,carter beese questioned the propriety and legality of the.consequently,the board requested that attorney steven chan determine if there were any legal or ethical obstacles to the plan.
this dispute remained unresolved at the march,board meeting.it also prompted an april,from edelson to ch ien in which edelson alleged that the independent directors on the board were being bulldozed in violation of the act,et,with the result that good corporate governance was being disregarded.
about the same time of the,the board was in the process of nominating a new slate of directors.the terms of all three directors who served on the audit.edelson,beese and thomas set to expire.the annual meeting notice to chinadotcom stockholders recommended the of all three of these members of the board specifically,edelson was recommended for a directorship,beese for a directorship and britt for a directorship.the nominations were unopposed,and the election was uncontested.neither yip nor ch ien asserted any outward or overt objection to edelson nomination for to the board,and they purported to concur in the board recommendation that edelson and the other candidates be elected.
at the june,annual meeting,edelson and beese were defeated in an election in which only percent of the shares were voted.of the votes cast,shares were voted in favor of edelson,were voted against edelson,and abstained.the votes for beese were closer in number votes were cast in favor of beese,against his,and abstained.britt,on the other hand,received only shares voted against him,and there were abstentions.the shares beneficially owned by yip were voted against both edelson and beese these shares constituted more than of the votes cast against edelson.
yip files disclosures 
yip,as beneficial owner of more than five percent of the issued and outstanding shares of a class of chinadotcom stock,is required to file certain disclosures under d of the exchange act,d.by rule,a shareholder may file a disclosure form,schedule,if the individual submitting the filing h as not acquired the securities with any purpose,or with the effect of,changing or influencing the control of the issuer.c.
on january,yip filed a schedule disclosure.the following certification appears on the schedule form,which was signed by yip 
by signing below i certify that,to the best of my knowledge and belief,the securities referred to above were not acquired and are not held for the purpose of or with the effect of changing or influencing the control of the issuer of the securities and were not acquired and are not held in connection with or as a participant in any transaction having that purpose or effect.
at.no subsequent schedule was filed prior to yip voting of his shares against edelson and beese at the shareholder meeting.
district court proceedings 
on october,edelson filed the present action.his complaint alleged violations of d as well as tortious interference with prospective economic advantage.edelson sought damages as well as preliminary and permanent injunctive relief.the intent of the requested injunction,edelson stated in his separate motion for a preliminary injunction,is simply to prevent chinadotcom from conducting a stockholders meeting that would deprive edelson,a former chinadotcom director,of the opportunity to campaign to regain his chinadotcom board seat,at.
chinadotcom opposed edelson motion for a preliminary injunction and also moved to dismiss edelson complaint with respect to the preliminary injunction,chinadotcom argued first that edelson could not show a likelihood of prevailing on the merits because he had not alleged any wrongdoing by chinadotcom.additionally,the company argued that edelson lacked standing to bring a d action because congress did not intend d to be a mechanism for to settle old feuds.chinadotcom also maintained that the premise underlying edelson yip action in voting against the recommended slate of directors evidenced an intent to control faulty.according to chinadotcom,edelson construction of rule e,taken to its logical conclusion,would mean that no schedule filer would ever be able to vote its securities in a board election or any other proposal at a shareholder meeting without first filing a schedule because the mere voting of securities is equivalent to changing or influencing control of the issuer.at.finally,chinadotcom posited that edelson could not establish irreparable harm if the injunction did not issue.chinadotcom pointed to the fact that the election that had ousted edelson already had harm already had taken place.therefore,edelson did not establish the need for urgency that typically accompanies a preliminary injunction.
in addition to opposing the motion for preliminary injunctive relief,chinadotcom also moved to dismiss the complaint.in its motion,chinadotcom reiterated its argument that edelson had failed to allege any wrongdoing on its necessity to sustain the complaint though chinadotcom is included as a defendant,the complaint fails to allege any act or omission by chinadotcom which would constitute a violation of section d.indeed,edelson has not even alleged that chinadotcom is subject to the reporting requirements of section d.at.chinadotcom also renewed its claim that edelson lacked standing to pursue a d private cause of action.according to chinadotcom,a d cause of action was not open to seeking to get back at their previous for disagreements or squabbles lost along the way.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
by order of january,the district court denied edelson request for injunctive relief and dismissed count i of edelson complaint after outlining the standards for a preliminary injunction,the district court held that a preliminary injunction was not warranted in this case because edelson can not show a likelihood of success on the merits of his claim.at.indeed,the court determined chinadotcom motion to dismiss should be granted because edelson was not entitled to the the implied cause of d.the district court noted that,in indiana national rich,cir,this court had recognized the existence of an implied cause of action for prospective relief for issuers such as chinadotcom to remedy violations of d.however,the district court believed that indiana national must be read in conjunction with more recent district court opinions which held that a disappointed former director of a corporation could not pursue an implied cause of action under d.see mates american vaccine,d nowling aero serv.int l.the court explained 
this court declines to extend the ruling of the seventh circuit and create a new cause of action under section d for former directors whom management has ousted.if there is a spectrum of shareholder sophistication,with unsuspecting investors on one end,and members of management who can adequately protect their own interests on the other,then edelson certainly lies closer to management than to the common shareholder.
at.the court concluded that congress did not intend former directors to wield section d on their own behalf and,therefore,dismissed count i of the complaint.edelson timely appealed 
discussion 
the gravamen of edelson complaint is that yip intent to vote against edelson amounted to an intent to influence the governance of chinadotcom.because yip failed to disclose this intent and to file the required schedule,edelson contends that yip votes against him should not have been counted,and a new election for directors must be held.
edelson action raises fundamental issues regarding d and the contours of the implied right of action thereunder.first,the present action raises the issue of the scope of the private right of action under d specifically,whether yip failure to disclose his intent,under the circumstances presented here,is sufficient to state a cause of action.the second issue raised by edelson appeal is who may bring a cause of action under d does edelson status as a former director preclude him from invoking the protections guaranteed general shareholders by d finally,this action also poses the question whether an opposed to an individual be a proper defendant to a d cause of action,here chinadotcom.because we hold that,under the circumstances of this case,a shareholder may not institute a private cause of action pursuant to d,we have no occasion to address whether edelson is a proper plaintiff or whether chinadotcom is a proper defendant.
a.the evolution of private causes of action under d 
our first task is to discern whether the allegations contained in edelson complaint,specifically,yip failure to disclose his intent to vote his shares against a sitting director,states a claim under d.although we have not had an occasion to address the specific question presented to us,we do not write on a clean slate with respect to the nature and contours of the d private right of action.almost thirty years ago,this court explicitly recognized that d created a private cause of action.see indiana,at.even before that time,this court and the supreme court had discussed the scope of d and the parameters of an implied right of action based on that provision,as well as on other provisions of the williams act,stat.we turn first to these cases to guide our inquiry.
our review begins with the decision of this court in bath industries,blot,cir.before the court was an order by the district court enjoining the appellant stockholders from proceeding with their plan including,but not limited to removing the chief executive officer of plaintiff bath and calling for a special shareholders meeting until they have complied with section d.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.none of the named defendants owned,individually,ten percent or more of the stock of bath industries thus,this court first had to determine whether the individual defendants constituted a group acting for the purpose of acquiring,holding,or disposing of securities of an issuer,such that,collectively,they were subject to the act disclosure requirements.id.at.in order to answer this question,we stated,it was necessary to honor the whole congressional intent of the williams act,not just the specific passages relied upon by the parties.to assess this intent,we turned to the legislative history of the williams act which 
convince d us that the overriding purpose of congress in enacting this legislation was to protect the individual investor when substantial shareholders or management undertake to acquire shares in a corporation for the purpose of solidifying their own position in a contest over how or by whom the corporation should be managed.
id.with this intent in mind,we concluded that the act should be interpreted to require compliance with its disclosure provisions when,but only when,any group of stockholders owning more than of the outstanding shares of a corporation agree to act in concert to acquire additional shares.id.emphasis added 
the supreme court provided additional insight into the scope of private causes of action under d in rondeau mosinee paper,d.in rondeau,the court addressed the issue whether a showing of irreparable harm wa s necessary for a private litigant to obtain injunctive relief in a suit under d.id.at.in that case,petitioner rondeau,over time,had accumulated a large quantity of mosinee stock.when rondeau had acquired the threshold amount of five percent of the stock,he failed to make the disclosures required by d.rondeau eventually accumulated shares of stock.at that time,mosinee president advised rondeau that his purchases may have created problems under the federal securities laws.after receiving this warning,rondeau ceased purchases,consulted an attorney and subsequently filed a d disclosure which stated 
francis rondeau determined during the early part of that the common stock of the issuer respondent was undervalued in the market and represented a good investment vehicle for future income and appreciation.francis rondeau and his associates presently propose to seek to acquire additional common stock of the issuer in order to obtain effective control of the issuer,but such investments as originally determined were and are not necessarily made with this objective in mind.consideration is currently being given to making a public cash tender offer to the shareholders of the issuer at a price which will reflect current quoted prices for such stock with some premium added.
petitioner also stated that,in the event that he did obtain control of respondent,he would consider making changes in management in an effort to provide a board of directors which is more representative of all of the shareholders,particularly those outside of present management one month later petitioner amended the form to reflect more accurately the allocation of shares between himself and his companies.
id.at.after receiving the disclosure,mosinee informed its stockholders of the information provided by rondeau and also responded to rondeau plans to seek control of the company and effect changes in the management structure.mosinee then filed an action in district court seeking an injunction prohibiting the petitioner and his codefendants from voting or pledging their stock and from acquiring additional shares,requiring them to divest themselves of stock which they already owned.id.at.
the supreme court held that the traditional requirements for injunctive relief apply to implied causes of action under d.the court then rejected mosinee claim that it had suffered the harm necessary to obtain injunctive relief.the court explained that 
t he purpose of the williams act is to insure that public shareholders who are confronted by a cash tender offer for their stock will not be required to respond without adequate information regarding the qualifications and intentions of the offering party.by requiring disclosure of information to the target corporation as well as the securities exchange commission,congress intended to do no more than give incumbent management an opportunity to express and explain its position.the congress expressly disclaimed an intention to provide a weapon for management to discourage takeover bids or prevent large accumulations of stock which would create the potential for such attempts.
id.at.footnote omitted.additionally,the court noted that none of the evils to which the williams act was directed ha d occurred or wa s threatened in this case,id.at.rondeau had not attempted to control the issuer,either by cash tender offer or other device.finally,the court also made clear that both the focus of the williams act and the private remedies available under the act were limited 
nor are we impressed by respondent argument that an injunction is necessary to protect the interests of its shareholders who either sold their stock to petitioner at predisclosure prices or would not have invested had they known that a takeover bid was imminent.as observed,the principal object of the williams act is to solve the dilemma of shareholders desiring to respond to a cash tender offer,and it is not at all clear that the type of harm identified by respondent is redressable under its provisions.
id.at.citations omitted emphasis added.
soon thereafter,the supreme court confronted an action instituted under another provision of the williams act.in piper industries,d,the court addressed whether a tender offeror could institute a cause of action under the williams act provision,e the court reviewed the legislative history and underlying purpose of the act.the court concluded that t he legislative history shows that the sole purpose of the williams act was the protection for investors who are confronted with a tender offer.piper,at.the court then concluded that,given this legislative purpose,a tender offeror competing for control of piper,could not claim the protections of the provisions of the act.the court explained 
it is clear,therefore,that has not asserted standing under e as a piper shareholder.the reason is not hard to divine.as a tender offeror actively engaged in competing for piper stock,was not in the posture of a target shareholder confronted with the decision of whether to tender or retain its stock.consequently,could scarcely have alleged a need for the disclosures mandated by the williams act.
id.the court concluded that a s a party whose previously unregulated conduct was purposefully brought under federal control by the statute,can scarcely lay claim to the status of beneficiary whom congress considered in need of protection.id.at.although the piper case concerns private causes of action under e,as opposed to d,it is instructive for two reasons.first,piper shows the emphasis that courts should place on discerning congressional intent before recognizing an implied cause of action under the circumstances of a given case.second,piper reveals the supreme court determination of congressional intent in enacting the williams provide stockholders with information when they are confronted with the decision of whether to tender or retain their stock.id.at.
slightly more recently,this court has considered,and explicitly recognized,a private cause of action under d in indiana national rich,cir.the issue before the court in indiana national was whether there is an implied private right of action for an issuer corporation to seek injunctive relief on behalf of its shareholders under section d.id.at.the defendants in that case were a group of investors who had acquired more than five percent of indiana national stock and had filed a d disclosure,as well as several amendments.despite these disclosures,an action was initiated by indiana national,alleging that the disclosures were false and misleading because they failed to reveal the defendants intention to acquire control.indiana national sought an order compelling the defendants to file an amended schedule,enjoining the defendants from acquiring more shares of the company,and compelling the defendants to divest themselves of the shares which had been unlawfully acquired.
to determine whether an implied cause of action should be recognized under these circumstances,we took our cue from the methodology employed by the supreme court in williams act cases and looked to the legislative history of the williams act.we noted that t he purpose of the williams act was to insure that public shareholders facing a tender offer or the acquisition by a third party of a large block of shares possibly involving a contest for control be armed with adequate information about the qualifications and intentions of the party making the offer or acquiring the shares.id.at emphasis added.we also addressed the question of whether the issuer could enforce the provisions on behalf of shareholders.congress,we noted,did not intend the williams act to protect incumbent management or to discourage takeover bids i ts sole purpose was the protection of shareholders.id.at.however,we observed that 
the shareholders have neither the knowledge nor the capacity to ensure that section d is enforced and a fair fight thus provided.in this respect and for this limited purpose,therefore,the issuer corporation acts on the shareholders behalf in bringing a suit for injunctive relief until an accurate schedule d is filed.
id.having determined that the issuer could institute the action on behalf of its shareholders,we remanded the action to the district court to consider the propriety of injunctive relief.
our review of these cases provides significant guidance in the interpretive task before us.in exploring the contours of a private cause of action under d,or other sections of the williams act,both this court and the supreme court have been guided by congressional intent in enacting the williams act to insure that public shareholders who are confronted by a cash tender offer for their stock will not be required to respond without adequate information regarding the qualifications and intentions of the offering party.rondeau,at.citing,at see also piper,at.congress was intent upon regulating takeover bidders,theretofore operating covertly,in order to protect the shareholders of target companies.indiana,at the purpose of the williams act was to insure that public shareholders facing a tender offer or the acquisition by a third party of a large block of shares possibly involving a contest for control be armed with adequate information about the qualifications and intentions of the party making the offer or acquiring the shares.bath,at t he overriding purpose of congress in enacting this legislation was to protect the individual investor when substantial shareholders or management undertake to acquire shares in a corporation for the purpose of solidifying their own position in a contest over how or by whom the corporation should be managed.
this purpose not only has informed our general discussion of d,it has been employed to fashion the scope of the implied cause of action recognized under d and under other sections of the williams act.by way of example,the act emphasis on acquisition of shares prevented us from recognizing that a group could be liable under d absent a showing that it had acquire d additional shares towards an undisclosed purpose.see bath,at.relying on the act purpose of providing information to opposed to providing management with a weapon to combat takeover court held that the traditional standards for gaining injunctive relief applied to a cause of action brought pursuant to d.see rondeau,at.similarly,it was the purpose of the williams act that prevented the supreme court from expanding the class of plaintiffs in williams act cases to include a competing tender offeror.piper,at.
finally,we note that,to this point,our williams act jurisprudence has been limited to those situations which involved acquisitions or accumulations of stock for the alleged or actual purpose of gaining control of the issuer.we have not confronted the question before us a plaintiff may maintain a cause of action for a violation of d absent a tender offer or accumulation of stock for the purpose of controlling the issuer.we turn,therefore,to the question of whether we should recognize a d cause of action under the circumstances of this case.
b.the scope of d private rights of action 
the circumstances under which courts can recognize implied rights of action have changed over time.historically,courts looked to the four factors set forth in cort ash,d,to inform the decision those factors are 
whether the plaintiff is a member of the class for whose benefit the statute was enacted whether there is any indication of legislative intent to create or deny such a remedy whether an implied remedy is consistent with the underlying purposes of the statutory scheme and whether the cause of action is one traditionally relegated to the states so that it would be inappropriate to infer a federal remedy.
mallett wisconsin div.of vocational,cir.however,not long after its decision in cort,the court made it clear that not all of these factors were of equal value 
it is true that in cort ash,the court set forth four factors that it considered re
