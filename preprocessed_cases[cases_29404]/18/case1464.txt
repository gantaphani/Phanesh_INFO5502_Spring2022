appellants rameshbhai bhakta,manharbhai bhakta and sarojben bhakta,individually and doing business as the boulevard motel,appeal from a preliminary injunction issued by the trial court restraining them from facilitating or encouraging prostitution or providing a place where prostitution can occur on the premises.we affirm.
appellants either own or operate the motel,located on south figueroa street in the city of los angeles since june,law enforcement officers have made multiple arrests at the motel for prostitution and related crimes.managers of the motel have been repeatedly arrested for keeping a disorderly house in violation of penal code section and failing to properly maintain a motel register in violation of los angeles municipal code section.despite these enforcement efforts,the motel has a reputation in the community as a place where prostitution is permitted to occur.between june and the filing of this action,law enforcement officers have observed prostitution activity at the motel or made prostitution related arrests at least times.
procedural history 
on march,the los angeles city attorney office brought an action against appellants on behalf of the people of the state of california respondent under the red light abatement law,et and the unfair competition law bus,et.respondent sought a preliminary and permanent injunction under the red light abatement law restraining appellants from maintaining the property as a red light nuisance or permitting prostitution to take place on the property.respondent also alleged under the unfair competition law that appellants conduct in permitting the motel to be used for nuisance activities constituted an unfair business practice as the conduct unfairly detracted from the quality of life of the motel neighbors,unfairly contributed to crime and gave appellants an unfair advantage over their competitors who followed the law.in addition to seeking a civil penalty for each act of unlawful competition,respondent sought injunctive relief against the continuation of the unfair or unlawful competition.
respondent filed an ex parte application for an order to show cause why the court should not issue a preliminary injunction against appellants.appellants specially appeared in opposition and objected that they and approximately other motel owners had filed a federal civil rights action,against the city of los angeles in the united states district court,challenging the constitutionality of los angeles municipal code section and alleging enforcement of the municipal code section had violated their constitutional and federal statutory rights.
the trial court granted respondent application for an order to show cause and set the matter for a hearing.
appellants responded by filing a notice of removal of action to the federal district court and attaching a copy of a complaint they had filed against the city of los angeles in the federal civil rights action.the new complaint purported to seek removal of the state court nuisance abatement and unfair competition proceedings to federal district court under,which permits removal of civil rights actions,and,which confers upon the federal court supplemental jurisdiction over related state law claims.appellants subsequently filed a removal of action in the federal district court and a supplemental notice of removal of action with the superior court.the state court proceedings were suspended after appellants removal notice was filed.
respondent filed a motion in the federal district court to remand the proceedings to state court.the federal district court granted a remand,ruling the federal court did not have jurisdiction over the state action and there were no grounds for removal under or.the remand order was filed with the superior court.
appellants appealed from the federal district court remand order.d.however,they did not seek a stay from either the federal district court or the ninth circuit court of appeals.see fed.rules,rule.
the superior court placed the matter back on calendar and scheduled a hearing on the order to show cause why the preliminary injunction should not be issued.appellants answered the complaint and filed an opposition,arguing the superior court did not have jurisdiction to entertain respondent action because appellants had appealed the district court remand order and because the los angeles city attorney lacked standing to bring either cause of action in the name of the people of the state of california.the superior court granted respondent application for a preliminary injunction enjoining and restraining appellants from facilitating or encouraging prostitution or providing a place where prostitution can occur.a preliminary injunction issued and this timely appeal followed.
contentions 
appellants contend the trial court did not have jurisdiction to issue the preliminary injunction because appellants had appealed the federal district court order remanding the action to state court and the los angeles city attorney does not have authority to bring either a red light abatement action or an unfair competition action in the name of the people of the state of california.we disagree.the trial court had jurisdiction to issue the preliminary injunction since there was no stay of the federal court remand order.further,the city attorney had standing to bring an action in the name of the people of the state of california under the red light abatement law and unfair competition law.
discussion 
the trial court had jurisdiction to grant the preliminary injunction 
appellants contend the trial court lacked jurisdiction to grant the preliminary injunction because the federal appellate court had exclusive jurisdiction over this matter once appellants filed an appeal from the district court remand order.
the appeal of a remand order does not deprive the state court of jurisdiction unless a stay is obtained from the federal court.see witkin epstein,law ed,fed.rules,rule a party must ordinarily move first for stay of order in district court and then may seek relief from court of appeals or one of its judges.t he pendency of the federal appeal does not,in and of itself,serve to oust the state court of jurisdiction to proceed.people mason d.although a removal petition deprives the state court of jurisdiction as soon as it is filed and served upon the state court,jurisdiction returns to the state court when a remand order is filed and served on the state court,unless that order is stayed.people bogart d.
appellants appeal from the federal district court remand order did not automatically divest the state court of jurisdiction to proceed with the proceedings on the preliminary injunction.once the federal district court remanded the case to the state trial court,jurisdiction over the proceedings returned to the los angeles superior court.because appellants did not obtain a stay of the federal district court remand order,the trial court below had jurisdiction to issue the preliminary injunction in this action.
the los angeles city attorney has standing to prosecute this action on behalf of the people of the state of california 
issues of law are subject to de novo review,and,when the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction is dependent upon construction of a statute or statutes,we independently determine the proper interpretation of the statute or statutes involved.california air resources bd.hart th,d.
