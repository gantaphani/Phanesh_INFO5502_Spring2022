from until,section of the internal revenue code made available to corporations a tax credit fully offsetting the federal tax owed on income earned in the operation of any trade or business in puerto rico.in,congress enacted the small business job protection act of,stat,setting in motion the complete repeal of section,ameliorated by a transition period during which the credit remained available only to taxpayers who had claimed it in previous years.during the final eight years of that transition period,the taxable income that an eligible claimant could take into account in computing its credit was capped at an amount roughly equal to the average of the amounts it had claimed in previous years.though the cap was generally fixed,it could be adjusted up or down to account for a taxpayer purchases and sales of businesses that had themselves generated income.thus,as the parties agree,if one corporation sold to a second corporation a business that accounted for million in average prior year credit claims,the credit cap for the purchasing corporation would normally increase by million,and the credit cap for the selling corporation would normally drop by the same amount.
this appeal requires us to decide,in a case of first impression,the effect on a taxpayer credit cap of a sale of a line of business in puerto rico to a foreign corporation that does not pay u.corporate income taxes.having made three such sales,appellant omj pharmaceuticals,omj,argues that it was not required to reduce its cap by the amount of income associated with the lines of business sold because the buyer,as a foreign corporation,had no credit cap to increase or even establish.the government disagrees,arguing that regardless of whether the purchaser of a line of business could increase or establish a credit cap,a seller was required to reduce its own cap by the amount associated with the line of business.on for summary judgment,the district court sided with the government,rejecting omj claim for a tax refund of approximately million.because we read the controlling provisions of the internal revenue code to require otherwise,we reverse and remand with instructions to enter summary judgment in omj favor.
background 
a.the puerto rico and possessions tax credit 
between and,congress encouraged corporations to invest in puerto rico and other territories by establishing a possessions corporation system of taxation.congress implemented that system primarily by creating the puerto rico and possession tax credit,codified in section of the internal revenue code.see generally dep t of the treasury,the operation and the effect of the possessions corporation system of taxation,sixth report.as described by the treasury department 
the possessions corporation system of taxation is a set of rules under which a corporation deriving qualifying income from possessions and puerto rico pays no income tax to the united states.as a corporation,a possessions corporation is subject to federal tax on its worldwide income.however,a special credit available under section fully offsets the federal tax on income from a trade or business in puerto rico and from qualified possession source investment income qpsii.a parent corporation can,in turn,offset dividends received from a wholly owned subsidiary with a percent deduction,which frees the dividend income from federal tax.
in,congress amended section to terminate the credit,subject to certain transition rules.small business job protection act of,stat,u.amended.under the transition rules,an existing credit claimant that is,a taxpayer who previously claimed the credit,j could continue to claim the credit for up to ten years,j.beginning in the tax year,however,the amount of the credit became subject to a cap roughly equal to the annual average of a claimant possession income for the five taxable years immediately preceding.see j b,a.
though the cap was based on past activity,it was not entirely fixed.under certain circumstances,if a taxpayer acquired a trade or business that itself qualified for the credit,the acquiring taxpayer could add to its own cap the historic tax attributes of the acquired trade or business,enabling the acquiror new cap to reflect the historic expenditures of both entities.see j d accord,at.the adjusted base period income of the existing credit claimant from which the assets are acquired is divided between such corporation and the corporation that acquires such assets.the selling corporation would then subtract from its cap the same amounts.
omj transactions 
omj is a delaware corporation that among other things develops,manufactures,and distributes healthcare products.its principal place of business is puerto rico.between and,omj reported income from manufacturing operations in puerto rico.the parties agree that throughout the period on which this litigation is focused,omj remained eligible to claim the section credit.
on november,omj transferred three of its ortho,llc,ortho biologics,llc,and lifescan,a fourth company.that fourth company,omj ireland,omj ireland,was an irish corporation also owned entirely by omj.omj ireland had never paid or been required to pay income taxes.
after the transfers,omj paid income tax for and in the amounts it would have owed had its credit cap been reduced by the amount associated with the three businesses it sold.later,however,omj filed two amended returns,claiming a refund of which it later adjusted to for and a refund of which it later adjusted to for,justifying each on the ground that the credit cap reduction was unnecessary.the internal revenue service disagreed and denied the refunds.omj,in pursuit of its refund claims,filed this suit soon afterwards.
the district court,concluding that section required a credit cap reduction upon the sale of any trade or business,no matter who the buyer,granted summary judgment to the united states.omj appealed.

iii.analysis 
this case arises in part because neither congress nor the irs wrote any rules for implementing the details of the credit cap adjustments.rather,in the portion of the tax code governing the possessions credit transition period,congress provided as follows acquisitions and similar to the rules of subparagraphs a and b of section f shall apply for purposes of this subsection.j d.section f,which has nothing to do with the possessions corporation tax regime aside from this cross reference,generally governed the calculation of the tax credit for increases in research expenditures.the parties are in agreement that section should be interpreted to create a framework as similar as possible to section 
we take it as an undisputed given that congress looked to section because that section implemented a framework,like the one created by section,under which calculation of a tax benefit was driven in great part by the taxpayer experience in prior years.in creating the credit for expenditures on qualified research,congress chose to limit the credit to increases in research spending.in simplified form,research spending in a given year established a floor above which such spending had to rise in a subsequent year in order to justify a credit,which would be limited to the incremental increase.
the comparison of one year to another for calculating the credit under section posed the q
