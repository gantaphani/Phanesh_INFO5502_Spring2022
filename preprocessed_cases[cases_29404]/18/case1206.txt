the national labor relations board found that a company and its two owners committed a series of flagrant violations of the national labor relations act.although the board ordered the company to provide backpay to the victims of its unfair labor practices,by that time the had distributed all of the company funds to themselves.in a subsequent compliance proceeding,an administrative law judge pierced the corporate veil and imposed personal liability on one of the owners.the board,however,reversed.because the board failed to cite evidence sufficient to support the findings upon which it based its refusal to pierce the veil,and further failed to explain why it disregarded significant contrary evidence,we set aside that aspect of the board order.
mechanical,was a florida company that specialized in refurbishing gas turbines.william greene and james sanders founded the company and were its sole stockholders and directors.throughout their stewardship of mechanical,greene and sanders commingled their personal funds and assets with those of the company,disregarded corporate formalities and procedures,failed to maintain separate corporate records,and kept the company in an undercapitalized state 
in late,petitioner carpenters and millwrights,local union launched a campaign to organize the employees of mechanical.the company actively opposed the union organizing efforts through a variety of tactics,many of which were clear violations of the national labor relations act nlra,et.as the national labor relations board nlrb subsequently found,those violations included barring employees from speaking about the union interrogating employees about their membership in and support for the union promising benefits for ceasing activity and threatening reprisals for continuing such activity threatening employees with plant closure,loss of jobs,loss of benefits,and discharge because of their activities on behalf of the union and laying off or firing employees,and refusing to consider job applicants,because of their support for the union.the company unlawful conduct began in october and continued through may.much of it took place between december and early february,and much of it involved greene and sanders personally.
in the midst of their battle against the union,greene and sanders wrote themselves a series of checks on the company bank account.in the first distribution,made on february,each received.over the next ten months,both greene and sanders received nine additional distributions.the total paid to each man exceeded million.
on may,the union filed the first of a series of charges with the nlrb,alleging that mechanical had committed unfair labor practices in violation of the nlra.in july,the union prevailed in a representation election and was certified as the representative of a unit of mechanical employees.later that month,the nlrb general counsel issued the first of two complaints against the company.
on or about september,mechanical ceased all operations.immediately thereafter,it auctioned off all of its property and equipment.greene and sanders executed a resolution to liquidate the company on december,and filed articles of dissolution with florida secretary of state on june.
meanwhile,mechanical failed to answer the general counsel unfair labor practice complaints.after several months of silence,the general counsel moved for summary judgment,and the nlrb issued a notice to show cause why that motion should not be granted.the company again failed to respond.on april,the board found that mechanical had engaged in the unfair labor practices,and that greene and sanders were personally involved in many of them.the board ordered the company to provide backpay to its employees to make them whole for the losses they sustained as a result of the company unlawful conduct.the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit enforced the board order in full.see decision and order,mechanical,nlrb,enforced,cir,unpublished judgment.
thereafter,disputes arose over the amount of backpay due under the board order and whether greene,sanders,and their wives who shared equally in the distributions were personally liable for the company obligations.in february,sanders and his wife agreed to pay to settle any backpay claims against them.the greenes did not settle.in october,the board regional director initiated a compliance proceeding to determine two issues the amount of backpay due employees who suffered financial consequences as a result of the unfair labor practices of the company and whether greene and his wife should be held personally liable for such backpay.supplemental decision and order,mechanical,nlrb,at.although the company failed to answer the compliance specification,the greenes appeared personally and testified at the compliance hearing.
following the hearing,the administrative law judge alj issued a supplemental decision,in which he determined that the total amount of backpay owed was and that greene and his wife were personally liable for repayment.supplemental decision,mechanical,nlrb,at.in deciding to pierce the corporate veil,the alj applied the test adopted by the board in white oak coal 
t he corporate veil may be pierced when the shareholder and corporation have failed to maintain separate identities,and adherence to the corporate structure would sanction a fraud,promote injustice,or lead to an evasion of legal obligations.
nlrb.after reviewing greene misuse of the corporate assets and form and the large cash distributions that he received in,the alj found that both prongs of the white oak test were satisfied.nlrb,at.the alj concluded the greenes along with james sanders,engaged in blurring the separate corporate entity of mechanical,and their misuse of the corporate assets and form is unfair,unjust,and has resulted in an evasion of mechanical remedial and backpay obligations for unfair labor practices that greene and others committed.id.at.in reaching this decision,the alj determined that greene was not credible,and stated that he did not credit any of greene testimony,except that which other,credited,evidence corroborates or that which constitutes an admission against interest.id.at.
on appeal,the board supplemental decision and order affirmed the backpay judgment against the company,but reversed the alj decision to hold the greenes personally liable.supplemental decision and order,mechanical,nlrb,at,see revised supplemental order,mechanical,nlrb,unpublished.the board did not question the alj credibility determinations.nlrb,at.and it accepted arguendo the judge conclusion that the separate legal identity of respondent mechanical,had not been maintained under the first prong of the white oak coal standard.id.at.nonetheless,the board concluded that the second prong of the white oak test was not satisfied,disagreeing with the alj that adhering to the corporate form would permit a fraud,promote injustice,or lead to an evasion of legal obligations.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
specifically,the board held that the timing of the corporate distributions does not support the judge conclusion that adherence to the corporate form would lead to the evasion of legal obligations.id.the board noted that t he unfair labor practice charges were filed in may and the complaint was issued in july,and found that it was not until these dates that greene was aware that the company actions were being challenged and that monetary liability could result.id.it also found that the process of closing down and the attendant distribution of assets to shareholders began before those dates.id.hence,in the board view,the distributions did not constitute an evasion of the company legal obligations.
this matter is before us on the board application for enforcement of its august,supplemental decision and order against mechanical,and the union petition for review of the component of that decision and order.we will not waste ink on the board application for enforcement against the company.mechanical did not contest the issue,and it is our longstanding rule that t he board is entitled to summary enforcement of the uncontested portions of its order s.flying food group,nlrb.
