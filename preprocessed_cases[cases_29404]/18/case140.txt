in,cumberland farms,cumberland,a close corporation owned by the six siblings of the haseotes family,filed a petition for reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy act.demetrios of cumberland directors and the appellant claims against the corporation for roughly million of prepetition indebtedness owed on certain promissory notes.in response,cumberland asserted a claim of approximately million,arguing that haseotes breached his duty of loyalty when he caused his company to pay down a debt owed to him,while ignoring a much larger debt owed to cumberland.the bankruptcy court agreed,and disallowed haseotes claims against cumberland.on appeal,the district court affirmed.haseotes then appealed to this court.we affirm.
a proper understanding of this case requires a somewhat detailed recitation of the facts,as found by the bankruptcy court.haseotes is the oldest of six children who together own all of the shares of cumberland.the family business began in,when haseotes parents bought a dairy farm in cumberland,rhode island.cumberland now owns more than one thousand convenience stores and gas stations,conducts wholesale operations in dairy and other products,owns and manages real estate,and delivers refined petroleum products to its own gas stations and those of third parties.through these various endeavors cumberland enjoys a gross annual income of more than billion.
the undisputed family leader,haseotes became cumberland ceo and chairman of its board of directors in.at that time,the corporation was just beginning the gradual process of growth and diversification.cumberland opened its first gas station in the,linking together its existing food and gas operations.by the early,cumberland owned roughly gas stations up and down the east coast.however,the gas crisis of the nearly crippled the growing company,forcing it to close the majority of its new gas stations.
in the wake of the gas shortage,haseotes became convinced that cumberland needed greater security in its gas supply.in,cumberland entered into a petroleum supply agreement with chevron.but haseotes was not satisfied with relying on an outside source for gas he wanted to ensure a supply of his own.thus,when he learned of a dormant refinery located in newfoundland,canada,he saw a valuable opportunity for expansion.
having no experience in refining,haseotes sought advice on the possibility of purchasing the refinery.one source told him that he would need to spend at least million to get the refinery up and running another estimated that the cost would be closer to million.haseotes consultant william gorden,who recently had retired from sun oil company,urged haseotes not to buy the refinery.he told haseotes that sun oil had lost money in its refinery operations,and that cumberland deal with chevron provided it with an adequate source of refined petroleum products.finally,cumberland legal counsel advised haseotes that cumberland could not own the refinery itself because certain states prohibit a company that operates a refinery from selling petroleum products at retail.
undeterred,haseotes decided to go ahead with the purchase.based on the advice from counsel,he chose to own the refinery through his own entities.thus,the refinery physical assets were taken in the name of newfoundland processing,limited,which was formed to conduct the oil refining operations.haseotes also organized a separate crude processing,ccp which would purchase crude oil,transfer it to the refinery,and sell the refined product to cumberland and other third parties.
notwithstanding haseotes nominal ownership of the refinery,the family had an unwritten and somewhat vague agreement that any profits from the refinery would accrue to cumberland,and to the family as its shareholders.based on that sense of common purpose,the family promptly loaned large sums of money to the refinery and to ccp,hoping to bring the refinery to working order.those loans came from the family members individually,but crucially for this cumberland.from through,cumberland loaned more than million to ccp,and another million to the refinery itself.cumberland loans to ccp eventually were represented by a promissory note in the amount of,payable to cumberland on demand,and no later than december.some time later,that note was replaced by a new one in the same amount,but payable no later than october.
throughout the relevant time period,cumberland largest lender was the industrial bank of japan trust company ibj.its agreement with ibj specified that cumberland would put no more than million into the refinery entities.not surprisingly,then,ibj was not pleased to learn that cumberland had loaned a total of roughly million to the refinery and ccp.as the ceo of cumberland and the owner of ccp and the refinery,haseotes bore the brunt of ibj displeasure.in,ibj forced him to step down as cumberland ceo and to loan most of his share of cumberland profit distributions payable to haseotes as a shareholder back to the corporation.those loans form the basis for most of haseotes present claim against cumberland.ibj also demanded that donald was an officer of both ccp and from his post as chief financial officer at cumberland.finally,ibj insisted that under no circumstances was cumberland to loan any more money to either ccp or the refinery.
in order to ensure that cumberland loans to the refinery entities would be repaid,ibj arranged for ccp and cumberland to enter into a subordination agreement.in the agreement,ccp recognized its large debt to cumberland,as well as the smaller debts owed to haseotes and the other family members,then totaling.the latter debt was referred to in the agreement as subordinated debt.the agreement provided generally that ccp would not allow the balance of the subordinated debt to drop below its current level,so that most of the company resources could be allocated to the cumberland loan.in the event of a default on that loan,ccp agreed to cease all payments on the subordinated debt,concentrating only on repaying its debt to cumberland.
after ibj put an end to any additional loans from cumberland,haseotes was forced to look elsewhere for funding for the refinery.his original estimates of the cost of bringing the refinery up to speed had proven to be well short of the mark,and by the end of the the refinery was in dire need of money.haseotes saw an opportunity for a infusion of cash in his separate shipping operations.in,haseotes had purchased three oil tankers in the belief that they could be wedded profitably to his ownership of the refinery.he owned and operated the tankers through several companies for the sake of simplicity,we will refer to those companies,and the ships themselves,as haseotes shipping operation.unlike the refinery,the shipping operation quickly became profitable,and in haseotes had the opportunity to sell it for million more than the purchase price and outstanding loan on the ships.
haseotes sister lily bentas bentas,who then was the president and ceo of cumberland,urged him to sell the shipping operation.however,wary of the tax consequences of an outright sale,and anxious to maximize his available cash flow,haseotes chose instead to take out a second loan on the shipping operation.in september of,he obtained a million loan from chemical bank.haseotes personally guaranteed payment of the loan,thus linking the fate of the shipping operation to that of the refinery.if the refinery failed,haseotes would be unable to repay the loan to chemical bank.and if the shipping operation defaulted on that loan,chemical bank could reach the refinery.
from september,until april,haseotes loaned roughly million from the shipping operation to ccp.nevertheless,the refinery continued to struggle.ccp was unable to repay its loan to cumberland,which was in default as of october.that failure had devastating consequences for cumberland.by,the corporation was teetering on the brink of bankruptcy.
hoping to avert a financial crisis,bentas and other members of the cumberland board pressured haseotes to sell the refinery so that ccp could repay its debt to cumberland.haseotes had received an offer from aron company to purchase a interest in the refinery for million.at the cumberland board meeting on july,the directors voted unanimously with haseotes abstaining to approve and support the concept of the proposed sale to aron.at a second meeting on august,bentas expressed her very strong interest in having cumberland assist in the consummation of a sale to aron or any other entity in order to stabilize economic circumstances at cumberland.ibj also favored the sale.after a particularly contentious meeting between cumberland and ibj in the latter part of,bentas pleaded with haseotes to accept the aron offer.haseotes told bentas to go to hell,it my refinery.
haseotes was convinced that the aron offer was too low,and the sale never went through.as a result,ccp never made any payment on its debt to cumberland.by the end of,cumberland was operating at a loss,unable to buy sufficient products to stock its convenience stores and gas stations.finally,on may,cumberland filed a petition for reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy act.
when cumberland filed for bankruptcy in,it had not received any payment on its loan to ccp since.however,during the period of cumberland financial decline,haseotes had caused ccp to repay some of its debt to the shipping operation,and to him personally.in sum,from january,to may,ccp paid approximately million to haseotes and his companies.then,during the course of cumberland reorganization,ccp paid another million to haseotes enterprises.those the subject of cumberland claim 
pursuant to the reorganization plan approved by the bankruptcy court,cumberland creditors were divided into several different categories,including general unsecured creditors and subordinated creditors.the unsecured creditors all were repaid by early.haseotes,who had been deemed a subordinated creditor,then filed a motion to compel payment on his proof of claim.cumberland opposed the motion,and in addition filed a asserting its claim.haseotes lodged a detailed opposition to the,alleging that cumberland had failed to preserve its claim because it had not filed an objection to haseotes claim at the time the reorganization plan was confirmed.the bankruptcy court held a hearing in july of and,in an order entered that same day,ruled that cumberland rights were preserved by various provisions of the reorganization plan.the court also ordered cumberland to file an objection to haseotes claims,and set a date in january,for trial.
at approximately on january,night before the trial was to filed a motion to dismiss cumberland claim.in that motion,haseotes argued for the first time that cumberland claim was barred by the statute of limitations for such claims.the bankruptcy court heard argument on haseotes motion on the second day of trial.it determined that haseotes had forfeited the affirmative statute of limitations defense by failing to plead it in response to cumberland in june of thus,it denied the motion and allowed the trial to continue on the merits of cumberland claim.
during the trial,the court heard testimony from various figures at cumberland,including holt,haseotes,and bentas.following the trial and further briefing by the parties,the court concluded that haseotes had breached his duty of loyalty to cumberland.it reasoned that any available funds in ccp were akin to a corporate opportunity that haseotes was to offer to cumberland before taking for himself and his own entities.the court found that haseotes had not disclosed that opportunity to cumberland,and that cumberland board had not ratified the payments from ccp to haseotes and the shipping operation.thus,the court allowed cumberland claim,which extinguished the corporation debt to haseotes.see in re cumberland farms.
on appeal,the district court adopted the bankruptcy court findings of fact and affirmed its decision.haseotes cumberland farms.haseotes now appeals to this court.like the district court,we review the bankruptcy court factual findings for clear error,and its conclusions of law de novo.smith barney,strangie in re strangie,cir.
before turning to the merits of cumberland breach of loyalty claim,we first must consider whether the bankruptcy court erred in denying haseotes statute of limitations defense.the bankruptcy court concluded that haseotes forfeited that defense by failing to raise it until the eve of the trial,more than six months after cumberland first asserted its claim.reviewing that decision for an abuse of discretion,see keeler hewitt,cir,we affirm.
local rule j of the massachusetts bankruptcy court provides that i n any opposition to a motion,the opposing party shall admit or deny each allegation of the motion,state any affirmative defense to the motion,and state specifically why the relief requested in the motion should not be granted.that rule parallels rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure,which states that affirmative those based on a statute of be raised in the defendant answer to the plaintiff complaint.under rule c,as under local rule j,failure to plead the statute of limitations promptly ordinarily results in the waiver of the defense.depositors trust slobusky,cir accord knapp shoes,sylvania shoe,cir jakobsen.port,cir.
relying on its local rule,as well as the general principle that a statute of limitations defense must be pleaded in a timely manner,the bankruptcy court reasoned that haseotes should have raised the statute of limitations in june of,when cumberland first asserted its claim.as explained,haseotes filed a proof of claim in,demanding payment on his claim against cumberland.in addition to the usual opposition,cumberland filed a alleging that haseotes had breached his duty of loyalty to the corporation,and that the million in payments from ccp to haseotes should be set off against cumberland debt to haseotes.haseotes filed a lengthy opposition to that in which he argued that cumberland had not properly preserved its claim under the reorganization plan.he did not mention the statute of limitations,though roughly six years had passed since cumberland learned of the challenged payments from ccp to haseotes.nor did he raise the statute of limitations at the hearing held in july.instead,he waited until january,night before the trial was to begin on cumberland claim.
on appeal,haseotes argues that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in refusing to entertain the statute of limitations defense.he points out that the strictures of rule c may be relaxed when there is no prejudice and when fairness dictates.jakobsen,at.under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,the court should liberally allow an amendment to the pleadings if prejudice does not result.and if an affirmative defense is actually tried by implied consent,the pleadings may be later made to conform.id.
haseotes argues that the statute of limitations defense was tried with cumberland implied consent here because cumberland did not object to the introduction of exhibits and testimony regarding when the corporation learned of the disputed repayments.indeed,cumberland introduced some such evidence itself.however,our cases make clear that implied consent will be found only when the opposing party did not object to the introduction of evidence or introduced evidence himself that was relevant only to the affirmative defense.lynch dukakis,cir.here,evidence regarding cumberland knowledge of the payments from ccp to haseotes and the shipping operation was relevant to the question whether cumberland consented to those payments.thus,when cumberland witnesses testified that they were not aware of the challenged payments until,their purpose was not to pin down the date on which the statute of limitations began to run,but to show that cumberland board of directors did not authorize the payments.such testimony and related exhibits therefore can not support a finding that cumberland impliedly consented to the trial of the statute of limitations issue.
in the absence of implied consent,amendment still may be proper if the court concludes that the opposing party will not be prejudiced by the addition of a new claim.see.b fed.as we have explained elsewhere,rules such as.c and the local bankruptcy rule are designed to give the opposing party notice of the defense and a chance to develop evidence and offer arguments to controvert the defense.knapp shoes,at discussing rule c.under the liberal pleading regime prescribed by the federal rules of civil procedure,with such procedural rules does not always preclude consideration of unpleaded claims or defenses.however,w hile the federal rules reflect a universal trend away from stereotyped pleading,they do not presage abandonment of the requirements that parties be given reasonable advance notice of the major issues to be raised.jakobsen,at.accordingly,courts will excuse untimeliness only when doing so is consistent with the notice purpose of the rules.amendment may be permitted,for example,where the opposing party already had notice of the defense through some means other than the pleadings,or would not have benefitted from advance notice in any other words,where the delay was harmless.
haseotes argues that his failure to raise the statute of limitations defense until the eve of trial was harmless here because cumberland would not have needed to muster any new documentary evidence or testimony to rebut the defense.cumberland responds that haseotes dilatory behavior could have resulted in a different sort of prejudice.it emphasizes that the statute of limitations defense raised several potentially complex legal issues.see jakobsen,at finding prejudice where defense presented complex legal issues accord keeler,at.for example,the parties had agreed that massachusetts law governed cumberland allegations of a breach of fiduciary duty because there was no material difference between the law of massachusetts where the alleged breach occurred and delaware where cumberland is incorporated.however,the choice of law question could have proven important for the statute of limitations defense.under delaware law the limitations period may be suspended or ignored completely where a corporate fiduciary engaged in fraudulent or fraudulent concealment.massachusetts recognizes a similar principle,but apparently to a lesser extent.thus,cumberland argues that it was entitled to a reasonable opportunity to develop the arguments that delaware law applied,that haseotes conduct was sufficiently egregious to constitute fraudulent or concealment,and that he should not obtain the benefit of the statute of limitations.
although haseotes arguments are not without force,we can not say that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in concluding that cumberland would be prejudiced unfairly by the untimely presentation of the statute of limitations defense.in light of the dispositive nature of that defense,the court reasonably could have found that cumberland could not,in fairness,be forced to forego the advance notice it was entitled to under rule c.jakobsen,at.as the seventh circuit observed in venters city of delphi,cir 
we recognize that the limitations defense may have been meritorious and plaintiff counsel should have had some inkling that the defense might be raised but it was not plaintiff obligation to raise the defense,and if rule c is not to become a nullity,we must not countenance attempts to invoke such defenses at the eleventh hour,without excuse and without adequate notice to the plaintiff.
id.at.without embracing a ban on all such invocations of a limitations defense,we find no abuse of discretion in the bankruptcy court refusal to forgive haseotes delay in raising the statute of limitations here.thus,we turn to the merits of cumberland claim.
as a member of cumberland board of directors,haseotes owed the corporation a fiduciary duty of loyalty and fair dealing.as the bankruptcy court observed,the principles governing a director duty of loyalty are broad and pervasive.in re cumberland farms,at.corporate directors must act with absolute fidelity to the corporation and must place their duties to the corporation above every other financial or business obligation.demoulas demoulas super markets,internal quotation marks omitted.
the fiduciary duty is especially exacting where the corporation is closely held.cooke lynn sand stone,citing donahue rodd electrotype.in a close corporation like cumberland,the relationship among the stockholders must be one of trust,confidence and absolute loyalty if the enterprise is to succeed all participants rely on the fidelity and abilities of those stockholders who hold office.disloyalty and conduct on the part of any stockholder will engender bickering,corporate stalemates,and,perhaps,efforts to achieve dissolution.donahue,at.
in an attempt to give substance to the general duty of loyalty,courts have recognized several more specific obligations.we focus here on a particular variant known as the corporate opportunity doctrine,which prohibits a director from taking,for personal benefit,an opportunity or advantage that belongs to the corporation.demoulas,at.
the corporate opportunity doctrine is best understood as a rule of disclosure.martin kagan in re tufts,cir.when a corporate director learns of an opportunity that could benefit the corporation,she must inform the disinterested shareholders of all the material details of the opportunity so that they may decide whether the corporation can and should take advantage of it.demoulas,at to satisfy the principle of fairness to the corporation and to meet his duty of loyalty,the fiduciary must fully disclose to the corporation,all material facts concerning the opportunity.it is inherently unfair for the director to deny the corporation that choice and instead take the opportunity for herself.thus,massachusetts courts hold that t he nondisclosure of a corporate opportunity is,in itself,unfair to a corporation and a breach of fiduciary duty.id.at emphasis added.
accordingly,it makes no difference whether,as haseotes insists,his decision to cause ccp to repay the shipping operation before cumberland was a business judgment that seemed fair at the time.haseotes argues at length that the million at issue was best spent paying down the loan from the shipping operation.he maintains that the bulk of the funds was simply funneled through the shipping operation to chemical bank,to repay the million loan that he had personally guaranteed.a default on the chemical bank loan,haseotes insists,would have had catastrophic results for the whole enterprise.be that as it may,the decision as to how to use that money was not his to make if the availability of the million was an opportunity that rightfully belonged to cumberland.we must determine,therefore,whether the availability of money in ccp constituted an opportunity within the meaning of the corporate opportunity doctrine 
existence of a corporate opportunity 
normally,a corporate opportunity is thought of as a business or investment opportunity within the sphere of,or somehow related to,the corporation own activities.see durfee durfee canning,internal quotation marks omitted.so,for example,if one of cumberland directors learned of a gas station for sale in the new england area,she would be obligated to disclose that fact to cumberland before purchasing the station for herself.
although the facts here diverge somewhat from the prototypical corporate opportunity case,we agree with the bankruptcy court that the disputed repayments fall well within the contours of the doctrine.in demoulas,the supreme judicial court of massachusetts sjc noted that recent formulations of the corporate opportunity doctrine have given a broad definition to the scope of potential corporate interests,and have focused on the responsibility of the fiduciary to present these possibilities to the corporation for its consideration.at citing victor brudney robert charles clark,a new look at corporate opportunities,harv,stating that the definition of corporate opportunity should leave little room for the director to appropriate any opportunity conceivably advantageous to the corporation,without its consent.the court explained that,i n selecting a test for determining which ventures rightfully belong to a corporation,and are subject to the corporate opportunity doctrine,the corporation deserves broad protection t he focus is on the paramount obligations of the fiduci
