morgan creek productions,mcp,a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in los angeles,appeals the trial court order adding it to a judgment for more than million which toho towa,a japanese company toho towa was awarded against two companies,morgan creek international,a netherlands company and morgan creek international,a bermuda corporation.mcp maintains that the trial court erred in ruling that the three business entities constituted a single business enterprise for purposes of imposing alter ego liability on mcp for the debts of and.we conclude that the ruling is supported by substantial evidence.mcp also contends that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to set aside its ruling pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision b.we see no abuse of discretion.consequently,we affirm the order.
factual and procedural background 
in,toho towa negotiated with mcp to acquire japanese distribution rights to the motion picture the good shepherd the picture.after the parties had reached agreement as to the terms of the distribution deal,howard kaplan,mcp then general counsel,told toho towa that,rather than mcp,would grant toho towa the distribution rights under the agreement,and that a third entity,would guarantee contractual obligations to toho towa.kaplan indicated to toho towa that this was the structure mcp used for its international distribution deals.kaplan assured toho towa that and would have sufficient assets to meet any financial obligations toho towa might be owed with respect to the picture.as a consequence of these assurances,toho towa entered into a written agreement with to distribute the picture in japan.the obligations of under the agreement were guaranteed by.
pursuant to the terms of the distribution agreement,by the end of october,owed toho towa approximately million in connection with expenses it had advanced to distribute the picture.on october,toho towa submitted its invoice to requesting payment of this amount.on november,toho towa invoice to was forwarded to mcp chief financial officer,gary stutman.on december,stutman advised toho towa by email that he was speaking with our owner,jim robinson,re the payment date.the invoice was never paid.
on april,toho towa initiated a jams arbitration against and,based on failure to pay the reimbursable costs represented in the october,invoice.mcp counsel,don hardison,retained attorney alan gutman to represent and in the arbitration.hardison reviewed the pleadings,consulted with gutman on strategy,reviewed and approved gutman bills,and forwarded them to mcp chief financial officer for payment.
the arbitrator entered a final arbitration award in favor of toho towa against and in the amount of.a jams appellate panel unanimously affirmed the arbitration award.on toho towa motion,the award was confirmed as a judgment on june.with interest and attorneys fees,the amount of the judgment was.
neither nor satisfied the judgment entered against them.
in the fall of,toho towa took examinations under oath,pursuant to section et,of various mcp representatives,including mcp former chief financial officer gary stutman,its vice president brian robinson,and its general counsel don hardison,to ascertain the relationship between the three morgan creek entities.through these examinations,toho towa learned that the three morgan creek entities were owned by a single individual,james robinson that the work of and was performed by employees of mcp and that the companies were operated in such a way that no money flowed to the foreign morgan creek entities.based on this information,toho towa moved,pursuant to section,to add mcp to its judgment against and,on the theory that mcp was the alter ego of the other two entities the section motion.
toho towa motion,filed on december,was supported by a memorandum of points and authorities,the declarations of its california counsel charles shephard,its dutch counsel frederic verhoeven,its president hiroyasu matsuoka,and its employee yusuke horiuchi.these declarations form the basis of the evidence presented in support of the motion,the contents of which are discussed below.
mcp filed its opposition to the motion,together with its memorandum of points and authorities,objections to the declarations of shephard,verhoeven,matsuoka and horiuchi,and a request that the court take judicial notice of the fact that mcp is a delaware corporation,on january.mcp submitted no declarations to counter the evidence provided by toho towa.
on february,the court began the hearing on the motion by announcing its tentative decision to add mcp to the judgment.the court found the following factors relevant to its conclusion that mcp was the alter ego of and,based on the declarations toho towa submitted with its motion 
the entities were all owned by the same person,james robinson.
robinson was the only person with authority to resolve the dispute with toho towa.
had no employees and no bank account.
financial arrangements were structured so that it never received any money.rather,all of licensing income went directly to lender.
employees of mcp negotiated the foreign licensing deals on behalf of the other morgan creek entities.
brian robinson,the owner son,sold television rights for the international film library owned by,even though he was not employed by or 
don hardison,mcp general counsel,handled the legal affairs of and,including drafting contracts and providing legal consultation,though he was not employed by either of these companies.
gary stutman,mcp chief financial officer,who was not employed by,provided financial services to at least once a month,while mcp accountants routinely prepared financial statements.
mcp had control over the underlying arbitration,by selecting counsel,receiving legal bills,reviewing pleadings,consulting on strategy decisions,and designating one of its own officers as the person most knowledgeable as to why and did not pay the money they owed to toho towa.
in response to the court tentative decision,mcp counsel complained that toho towa did not raise the single enterprise theory as a basis for imposing liability on mcp for the debts of and until its reply papers.consequently,the trial court granted mcp the opportunity to address the sole issue of the single enterprise theory as a basis for alter ego liability.the hearing on the section motion was continued until march.
mcp filed its supplemental brief addressing the single enterprise form of alter ego liability on february.again,no evidence was submitted in support of mcp position.
on march,gutman substituted out as mcp counsel,and its current counsel,glaser weil fink jacobs howard avchen shapiro llp,substituted in.the next day,mcp applied ex parte to continue the hearing on toho towa motion to add a judgment debtor,and to introduce additional evidence.the declaration of charles bauermann,mcp outside accountant,was submitted in support of the ex parte application.among the matters to which bauermann attested were the capitalization,assets,and financial status of at the time the distribution agreement was executed that the three companies had separate board meetings,different directors and officers,performed different businesses and filed separate tax forms,and observed the corporate formalities and that the entities did not commingle funds.the trial court denied the ex parte application.
at the continued hearing on the section motion,held on march,the court summarized the procedural history of this matter,including the ex parte application,and indicated that it had considered all the papers and supplemental briefs.the court quoted from toho towa original papers filed with its motion the evidence is overwhelming that the three morgan creek entities are the alter egos of each other and function as a single,unified enterprise under the ownership and control of a single individual,james robinson.the court continued,also in the papers on page,and i quote,here,the evidence is overwhelming that the various morgan creek entities were part of a single enterprise.thus morgan creek claim is not persuasive that it did not know that toho towa alter ego claim was based on a single enterprise theory.in short,the court concluded that the supplemental briefing was unwarranted,and did not cause the court to change its tentative decision.
from the evidence before it,the trial court concluded that and were corporate shells which existed solely for contracting and purposes to shield mcp from liability.consequently,the court made final without change its tentative ruling of february granting toho towa motion to add mcp to its judgment against and.
after the trial court granted the section motion,mcp counsel asked for clarification regarding the evidence the court considered in coming to its decision do i correctly understand from the court ruling that the court has declined to review the declaration of bauermann that was filed with the ex parte application the court responded,the court reviewed everything,counsel.the court then reminded counsel that the hearing was not continued in order to allow mcp to reargue the motion,but solely for the purpose of addressing the supplemental matter of the single enterprise theory.mcp counsel inquired,and by the supplemental matter,you mean bauermann declaration,to which the court replied no.the supplemental matter was the hearing that the court allowed on the single enterprise because counsel had indicated,and the court allowed supplemental briefing with respect to the issue dealing with the single enterprise.
on april,mcp filed its motion to be relieved from judgment pursuant to section,subdivision b the section motion on the grounds of its prior counsel mistake of law and excusable neglect in failing to introduce evidence in opposition to toho towa motion to add mcp as a judgment debtor.in support of this motion,mcp submitted the declarations of bauermann,robinson,and gutman.
the trial court denied the motion.it determined that the mandatory provisions of section,subdivision b did not apply,as there was no default or default judgment entered against mcp,and the discretionary provisions of the statute did not apply,since counsel failure to discharge routine professional duties is not excusable,nor is counsel failure to properly prepare for the hearing the conduct of a reasonably prudent person.
mcp timely appealed both the order adding it as a judgment debtor,and the order denying its section motion.
discussion 
preliminarily,we must resolve the parties disagreement about what evidence is properly before us on this appeal.mcp relies on the declarations of bauermann,submitted with its ex parte application,and bauermann and robinson,submitted in support of the section motion,in its statement of facts in its opening brief.toho towa contends that,while this evidence was filed in the trial court and considered by that court in ruling on the ex parte application and the section motion,because the trial court denied mcp request to present additional evidence,and the section motion was not heard until after mcp was added to the judgment,mcp may rely on the evidence contained in those declarations only in connection with the appeal of the rulings for which they were submitted.and,according to toho towa,because mcp does not appeal the ruling on the ex parte application,the contents of the bauermann declaration submitted in support of that application provides no evidence which mcp may use in its arguments on appeal.we agree.
the trial court unequivocally denied mcp request to present additional evidence in connection with toho towa section motion.thus,bauermann declaration was not before the trial court and could not provide a basis for that court ruling.mcp nevertheless argues that,because the bauermann declaration was filed with the court and is included in the appellant appendix,and the court stated that it had read and considered all papers filed in support of mcp application,it was part of the record below,and may properly be cited by mcp.we reject this argument.
when a trial court rules that a party may not present certain evidence,the party may,of course,cite the evidence to challenge that ruling.in the absence of a challenge to the ruling,however,it should go without saying that the excluded evidence,though part of the record on appeal cal.rules of court,rule may not be used by this court to reverse the order of the trial court.in short,mcp may not rely on the contents of a declaration the trial court specifically ruled it would not permit mcp to introduce,without first successfully arguing that the court erred in denying the ex parte application by which mcp sought to introduce the declaration into evidence.
mcp argument with respect to the bauermann and robinson declarations submitted in support of its section motion is similarly unavailing.mcp contends that it is entitled to cite to the section declarations not only in connection with the order denying its section motion but also the order adding it as a judgment debtor under section because,as a matter of hornbook law,reviewing courts will now,in determining the existence of substantial evidence,look to the entire record of the appeal.bowers bernard s,d,italics in original see also in re marriage of schmir,th,in determining the sufficiency of the evidence an appellate court can not confine itself to isolated bits of evidence but must view the whole record.mcp misreads the hornbook.
perhaps the first rule of appellate practice is that a ruling of the trial court may be reversed on appeal only if the trial court erred.a trial court failure to consider evidence not before it such as robinson may,declaration when the court issued its march,order is not,and can not be,error.
alter ego liability 
the authority of a court to amend a judgment to add a nonparty alter ego as a judgment debtor has long been recognized.see mirabito san francisco dairy d.the ability under section to amend a judgment to add a defendant,thereby imposing liability on the new defendant without trial,requires both that the new party be the alter ego of the old party and that the new party had controlled the litigation,thereby having had the opportunity to litigate,in order to satisfy due process concerns.triplett farmers ins.exchange th,original italics.mcp maintains that the record is devoid of evidence to support these required findings.
we begin with the alter ego doctrine.ordinarily,a corporation is regarded as a legal entity separate and distinct from its stockholders,officers and directors.under the alter ego doctrine,however,where a corporation is used by an individual or individuals,or by another corporation,to perpetrate fraud,circumvent a statute,or accomplish some other wrongful or inequitable purpose,a court may disregard the corporate entity and treat the corporation acts as if they were done by the persons actually controlling the corporation citation.robbins blecher th.when a court does so,it is said to have pierced the corporate veil.because society recognizes the benefits of allowing persons and organizations to limit their business risks through incorporation,sound public policy dictates that imposition of alter ego liability be approached with caution.las palmas associates las palmas center associates d,hereafter las palmas.indeed,the corporate form will be disregarded only in narrowly defined circumstances.mesler bragg management cal d,accord laird capital,th,corporate entities are presumed to have a separate existence,and the corporate form will be disregarded only when the ends of justice require this result,disagreed with on another ground in reid google,cal th.
