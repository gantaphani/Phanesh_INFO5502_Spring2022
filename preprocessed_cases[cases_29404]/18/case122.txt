following trial,the district court found officers and directors with voting control of a closely held family corporation,nyman manufacturing,to be in breach of their state law fiduciary duties to minority shareholders whose shares the three had caused the corporation to redeem without making adequate disclosures.robert nyman,kenneth nyman,and keith johnson were held jointly and severally liable to nine nyman family members for the total sum of,which was,roughly,the value of those shares at the time of the sale of the nyman corporation to a strategic buyer some sixteen months later,following the redemption of their shares.the court also awarded prejudgment interest under state law at the rate of percent from may,the date the plaintiffs sold their shares.
the three defendants appeal,on the basis that the liability finding of breach of fiduciary duty was error in that the information was not material.they also argue the court erred in its award of damages and as to the date on which prejudgment interest started to run.the plaintiffs,find fault with the damages,and argue they were entitled to more.
we affirm the liability finding and remand for further proceedings on the appropriate measure of damages.
nyman manufacturing company was a closely held,company in rhode island that manufactured paper and plastic dinnerware.robert nyman,the president and ceo of the company,and his brother kenneth,the of manufacturing,had worked in the business their entire adult lives.
there were two classes of company stock class a shares,which were,and class b shares,which were voting stock.the company articles of incorporation authorized shares of class a stock and shares of class b stock.traditionally,one or two family members owned all of the class b stock,while the class a shares were dispersed throughout the family.no dividends were ever paid on either class of stock.robert and kenneth nyman had each inherited shares of the class b voting stock from their uncle this was the entirety of the issued class b stock.because they were the controlling shareholders,we refer to them as the majority shareholders of the company.in the beginning of,there were shares of class a stock outstanding.judith lawton,the sister of robert and kenneth,owned class a stock,as did her husband and eight children.the lawtons together owned class a shares.the children of robert and kenneth together owned another class a shares.beverly kiepler,another nyman sibling,and her daughter together owned class a shares.the magda burt estate controlled class a shares,and the walfred nyman trust controlled class a shares.
the company teetered on the verge of bankruptcy in the late.in,the company performance again began to suffer.in,after three consecutive years of losses,the company hired keith johnson,a specialist in turning around and then selling companies,as a consultant.johnson was made the chief financial officer and treasurer in august,and his liability stems from his position as an officer he was promised an equity share of the company if he could revive the company flagging profits.
by the spring of,it appeared that the fortunes of the ailing company were being reversed.earlier,in the fiscal year ending march,the company reported a profit of nearly million,in vivid contrast with its past losses.on april,the company granted johnson options to buy class a stock at a share.this price was equal to eighty percent of book value no effort was made to ascertain the actual market value of the stock,as required by the bylaws in the words of the district court,at this time the prospect of a future sale of the company to a strategic buyer was,at most,nothing more than a remote possibility.
in july,after a series of discussions,the company offered to redeem shares from the magda burt estate.on november,the burt shares were redeemed for per share.that price represented eighty percent of the book value of the stock in april.the price was not pegged to the higher november book value of a share after probate court approval,the estate accepted and the deal closed on november.that same day,the board,which now consisted of johnson,robert and kenneth,issued options to these three to buy the same number of shares as those redeemed,at the same price,a share.robert received options,while kenneth and johnson received options each.
in january,the company also offered to redeem the shares held by the walfred nyman trust.the offer was again for a share.by that time,the book value had risen to a share.one of the beneficiaries of the trust,beverly kiepler,withheld agreement,and the offer was abandoned.
the company fiscal year ended on march.the unaudited financials showed a profit of million and a quadrupling of shareholder equity.although it is true that much of the profit came from items,it is also true that the three defendants,sitting as the board,adopted deferred compensation plans for themselves which had a total value of million.
they also decided to hire a consultant and,at the march,annual meeting,authorized johnson to begin to interview candidates.although the defendants dispute that their intent was for the consultant to help them sell the company,the district court permissibly inferred,from the evidence at trial,that such was their purpose.this inference was based,inter alia,on the contents of the retention letter with the consultant eventually hired,shields,dated in august,which was,in turn,based on an earlier meeting.that letter made clear that shields would offer services including 
strategic issues as they relate to the value of nyman 
operational issues to maximize nyman position in the future in the eyes of a potential acquirer 
the specific dynamics of the merger and acquisition market 
assist you in responding to the numerous acquisition inquiries when appropriate 
none of this information was disclosed to the minority shareholders.there is evidence,not specifically referred to by the district court,that by may the three defendants were also engaged in discussions,also undisclosed,to acquire other companies.those discussions did not lead to a merger or acquisition.
in april,johnson,on behalf of the company,offered to purchase shares of class a stock directly from kiepler and her daughter for a share.by that point,shareholder equity had risen to per share.johnson put kiepler under a false deadline,saying that the bank waivers which would permit the purchase would expire on may.this was untrue no waivers had yet been secured.kiepler declined the offer,based on the low price.
on may,the company,over johnson signature,sent letters to all class a shareholders except robert and kenneth,their spouses,and the walfred nyman trust,offering to redeem their shares for per share.the letter said the following 
i would like to report to you some information about nyman and a limited term opportunity that you now have as a nyman shareholder with shares of class a stock.
as you know,the company has had major ups and downs over the past years including years in which significant losses were experienced.in the two most recent years,the company financial condition has improved and its lending banks have agreed that limited amounts of its common stock may be.this is an opportunity for shareholders who are interested in achieving liquidity now.
last november,the company was able to certain shares of stock held by rhode island hospital trust bank as of marge burt estate at a price of per share.since that time,the company has received several inquiries from other minority shareholders concerning their desire to sell their shares of nyman stock.in response to these inquiries,the company has negotiated with its lending banks to allow it to offer to purchase additional shares of nyman stock at this time.
given favorable economic factors and current estimates of operating results,the company is offering to purchase all of your shares at a price of per share.
since the company can not provide you with any advice as to whether the sale of the stock by you is in your best financial interest,we suggest that you discuss this matter with your financial advisor.you should know that these receipts will be subject to the appropriate federal and state taxes and that you should consult with a tax advisor,particularly with regard to your share of any from the magda burt estate which may help to reduce any tax liability you may have.
please indicate on the enclosed form your interest in selling your shares back to the company at the offer price of per share for a total value of.this offer will expire on may.the company is planning to complete this transaction with you within two weeks after the receipt of your written acceptance of this offer along with the receipt of your stock certificates.
several statements in the letter were not accurate.the record shows that the impetus to redeem the shares came from the company,not that the company made the offer in response to several inquiries from other minority shareholders concerning their desire to sell their stock.the record also shows that there was no deadline of may,as the letter implied.one lender had imposed no deadlines and the other had imposed a deadline of july.this phoney deadline of may meant that the minority shareholders had to decide whether to sell before the company made its next audited financial statements available.
the next day,on may,johnson reported to heller financial,that nyman fiscal profit was estimated to be million,and he included a copy of nyman unaudited fy financial statement.the unaudited financials were not disclosed to plaintiffs,nor was the decision to retain a consultant,nor was the fact that the defendants were in may engaged in discussions to acquire other companies.the letter also implied that the a share price was based on favorable economic factors and current estimates of operating results,but did not disclose what was meant by this.the stock price of a share was based on neither current market value nor book value.defendants did not seek to have an appraisal done.
on may,robert called judith lawton to ensure that she had received the letter.he described the offer as a once in a lifetime opportunity.he gave no further financial information about the company recent upturn or its plans.
most of the lawtons met on the evening of may and,after ruminating over the weekend,all of the lawtons who held stock in nyman manufacturing agreed to sell their shares.judith,her husband thomas,and seven of their children sold all of their combined shares back to the company on may,for a share the children of robert and kenneth nyman also sold their shares back to the company at a share.because this stock was redeemed by the company,the redemption increased defendants share of the class a stock.
on june,the company awarded robert,kenneth,and johnson options to purchase a total of class a shares.this is the same as the number of shares redeemed by the company on may.robert received the right to purchase shares,and kenneth received the right to purchase shares,for a share johnson received the right to purchase shares for a share.
the officers also purchased all class a and b shares in the company treasury on june.for these they signed promissory notes totaling that called for interest payments to be made commencing on june.robert purchased class a and class b shares kenneth purchased class a and class b shares and johnson purchased class a shares.again,there was no appraisal of shares.
by june,the book value of the shares was.the district court accepted the valuation of defendants expert,william piccerelli,that in may and june,the fair market value of the company stock was approximately a share.
johnson at some point discovered that the van leer corporation,a dutch company whose subsidiary,chinet,was a competitor of nyman manufacturing,had funds available to acquire other companies.in october,johnson discussed with thomas shields,a principal of shields,the possibility of a strategic acquisition by van leer.these discussions between johnson and shields continued in january.in march,johnson met with representatives of van leer to discuss a sale.van leer offered to purchase the company,and it signed a letter of intent on june.the sale closed on september.
van leer purchased all of nyman manufacturing stock for.after deducting closing costs of,and an escrow amount of,set aside to satisfy a potential liability of the company,the net amount paid to shareholders was.some was paid for each of the class a shares and options,and was paid for each of the class b shares,times the price of the class a shares.van leer asked that the stockholders options not be exercised,and in return,the options were bought as if they had been exercised.
a chronology is set forth at the end of the opinion.
judith and thomas lawton and seven of their eight children filed suit against robert and kenneth nyman,keith johnson,and nyman manufacturing in the united states district court for the district of rhode island on may.they alleged that the defendants were in breach of their fiduciary duties and had committed securities and fraud.the plaintiffs asserted that the redemption price they were paid for their stock was less than the true value,that the defendants knew that the company might be sold,and that they misrepresented and failed to disclose material facts regarding,inter alia,the sale of the company and the value of the stock.
a parallel suit was filed by beverly kiepler,the beneficiary to the walfred nyman trust who originally rejected the sale of the trust class a shares,and her daughter,against robert,kenneth and johnson.she alleged that the defendants award of options to themselves,and their purchase of treasury stock,diluted the stockholders ownership interests.
after separate bench trials,the district court issued two opinions on the same day.in the kiepler case,the court found that the purchase of treasury shares had constituted a breach of fiduciary duty,but that the granting of options to purchase shares was not in violation of that duty.kiepler nyman,wl,dist.lexis.
in the lawton case,the court found that the company purchase of the lawtons shares was a breach of fiduciary duty.however,the court dismissed the federal securities law claims,finding that disclosure was not required under the applicable statutes.it also found that the claim against the granting of the options failed because it should have been brought as a derivative shareholder action on behalf of the corporation,and that the april grant to johnson was,in any event,not in breach of any duty.lawton nyman,wl,dist.lexis.the court held that it was a breach of fiduciary duty for the defendants to have purchased the treasury shares in june,and accordingly subtracted those shares in determining the value per share in september,but did not deduct the price defendants paid for those shares from the valuation of the company.the lawton plaintiffs appealed the damages calculation and the dismissal of their federal securities claim and their claim regarding the grant of options the defendants appealed the breach of fiduciary duty finding and the damages award.

breach of fiduciary duty under rhode island law 
the defendants frame their challenge to the breach of fiduciary duty finding by arguing that the district court failed to use the correct standard of materiality.they argue the district court was required to use the same standard of materiality for both the federal securities law claim,under section of the securities exchange act of,b,and the state fiduciary duty claim the fact that the court found on materiality grounds that there was no federal securities law violation means,they argue,that it was error for the district court to have found that there was a violation of state law fiduciary duties.
whatever doubts we have about the district court federal securities law analysis need not be resolved.there is no need to explore whether there are significant differences between the disclosure standards under section and the rhode island law on fiduciary obligations owed among shareholders in closely held family corporations.the parties agreed at oral argument that the federal securities law claims have essentially dropped out of the action.we do refer to federal securities law cases by analogy and because rhode island law may look to them for guidance.
defendants here stand in three intertwined capacities as directors,as officers,and,for robert and kenneth nyman,as majority shareholders of a closely held corporation.we consider these capacities as a group for purposes of the analysis.for more than a century,rhode island law has viewed directors of companies as owing a fiduciary duty to the shareholders of the company.olney conanicut land.it has analogized the duties corporate officers owe to stockholders to those of trustees.point trap manchester,hodges screw.
such a relationship is one of trust and confidence and imposes the duty on the fiduciary to act with the utmost good faith.that good faith requirement forbids action on the part of a fiduciary without the knowledge and consent of his cestui que trust when he has an individual interest in the subject matter or when his interest is in conflict with that of the person for whom he acts.
point trap,at.rhode island law also provides that directors of an insolvent corporation owe this fiduciary duty to creditors.olney,at see ed peters jewelry c j jewelry,d.
in teixeira teixeira,the court reiterated that corporate officers stand in a fiduciary capacity and are liable if they take corporate opportunities if a small number of shareholders in a corporation act as though they were partners,then they have a fiduciary duty to each other as partners id.at.the claim at issue here involves,by contrast,breach of a duty to minority shareholders.
the rhode island supreme court has had no occasion to expressly define the obligations owed by shareholders to each other in a closely held family corporation.but in teixeira the court reiterated that shareholders in a close held family corporation may have a fiduciary duty toward one another.id.at citing estate of meller adolf meller,and fournier fournier,emphasis added.the court noted that the existence of such a fiduciary duty is a inquiry and that shareholders could show by evidence,such as a stockholder agreement,that no such duty had been undertaken.id.
the fiduciary duties of corporate directors,officers and majority owners encompass a variety of different situations.see generally rosenblum,corporate fiduciary duties in massachusetts and delaware,in how to incorporate counsel a business mcle mitchell,the death of fiduciary duty in close corporations.still,defendants have essentially conceded that rhode island law would recognize a fiduciary duty among shareholders in a closely held family corporation and that it would be a heightened duty.we too think that the rhode island supreme court would recognize such a duty,at least in the absence of an express shareholder agreement to the contrary.
this case involves the narrow question of the duties owed by officers and directors,including those who are majority controlling shareholders in a closely held corporation,to minority shareholders when the defendants offer to buy,or have the corporation redeem,the shares of minority shareholders.what precise duties are owed in this situation is also a question on which there is no direct precedent in rhode island law.given rhode island rule that officers have a fiduciary duty,we think rhode island is likely to adopt at least those duties required by the common law special facts rule,as described by our sister circuit 
close corporations buying their own stock,like knowledgeable insiders of closely held firms buying from outsiders,have a fiduciary duty to disclose material facts the special facts doctrine developed by several courts at the turn of the century is based on the principle that insiders in closely held firms may not buy stock from outsiders in transactions without informing them of new events that substantially affect the value of the stock.see,strong repide,and the cases discussed in comment,insider trading at common law,chi.janigan taylor,cir 
jordan duff phelps,cir the colorado supreme court applied the special facts rule in a case factually similar to this 
we hold,therefore,that it is a violation of a fiduciary duty for an officer or director of a closed corporation to purchase the stock of minority shareholders without disclosing material facts affecting the value of the stock,known to the purchasing officer or director by virtue of his position but not known to the selling shareholder.
van schaack holdings,van schaack.again,defendants agree that under rhode island law there is a duty to disclose material information to minority shareholders faced with an offer by the close corporation,controlled by majority shareholders,to purchase their shares.
the district court defined the standard for determining materiality as follows when directors of a closely held corporation are purchasing a minority stockholder shares,fiduciary duty imposes an obligation of complete candor to disclose all information in their possession germane to the transaction.quoting thompson,close corporations,at ed.supp.that is a generally accepted standard and its use was appropriate.the court found that under state law,negotiations for a sale need not be underway for there to be a duty to disclose the duty also encompasses transactions that the directors anticipate are reasonably likely to occur or that are something more than remote possibilities.the district court,in its finding that the defendants were in breach of their fiduciary duties,focused on the company repurchase of the plaintiffs stock for a share in may,when the defendants,as it found,had a realistic expectation that nyman manufacturing might be sold.
the defendants argue that when a company is considering the possibility of sale,the standard for materiality,even under state law,requires something much more definite.defendants cite to section securities cases in support see,list fashion park,cir james blackstone mem l library ass gulf,mobile ohio,cir.the cases they cite,however,do not apply federal securities law to closely held corporations.
it seems to be commonly accepted that officers of close corporations have a greater duty of disclosure about the possible sale or merger of a company to minority shareholders than do officers of a publicly traded corporation see,michaels michaels,cir.one reason given is that premature disclosure could itself do more harm than good in a publicly traded market,because it could lead to inflation of the stock price which might prevent the sale or merger.see flamm eberstadt,cir.in public companies,there is also more of a need for a certain,clear rule as to when disclosure is required.id.at greenfield heublein,cir.as the seventh circuit has recognized,those reasons disappear when,as here,there is no public market for a shareholder stock.michaels,at.in a close corporation the company need disclose a decision to sell only to the person whose stock is to be acquired and the company may extract promises of confidentiality.see jordan,at.
rhode island law would,we think,similarly recognize a heightened duty of disclosure in a close corporation setting by officers who are majority shareholders with undisclosed information,who are purchasing minority shares or causing the corporation to do so.it would also,we think,impose an objective rather than a subjective standard of materiality.see,tsc,northway,d see also jackvony riht fin,cir.
materiality depends on all the circumstances.the general rule under the securities laws is that when contingent or speculative events are at issue the materiality of the events depends on the probability that the event will be consummated,and its significance to the issuer of the securities.basic levinson,d emphasis added.no single factor is necessarily determinative of the materiality inquiry.see id.at.here there were only two possible types of buyers for plaintiffs defendants either directly or by causing redemption of the shares or an outside buyer looking to acquire the company.here the defendants did not disclose their decision to work toward selling the company,their decision to hire a consultant,or their acquisition talks in may with other companies.each is pertinent to the question of whether there was an outside buyer for the shares.
the mere causing of a closely held corporation to offer an inadequate price by majority shareholders to minority shareholders is not itself sufficient to establish a breach.it may be evidence,though,as to breach of other duties.and if a majority shareholder violates his duties of disclosure and the minority shareholder sells at an inadequate price,the minority shareholder can seek damages based on the difference between the offered price and the fair value of the stock.see sugarman sugarman,cir applying massachusetts law in scenario.
if the finding of breach of fiduciary duty turned purely on the definiteness of the plan to sell,this would be a difficult liability issue.however,the case does not turn on that isolated proposition,but instead on an interrelated series of and misrepresentations.there is ample evidence to support the district court finding of breach of fiduciary duty.
as the district court held,the redemption of the plaintiffs stock represented a marked departure from the company previous lack of interest in purchasing stock.as the district court also held,additional indications of the defendants suddenly strong and,otherwise,inexplicable interest in acquiring more shares may be found in the urgency with which they sought to redeem the lawton and kiepler shares as shown by the artificial deadlines established for responses to the redemption offers.
the evidence supports the plaintiffs theory that these defendants engaged in a concerted,accelerating effort to buy up the minority shareholders stock,thus increasing the defendants ownership of the company,in anticipation of a sale of the company.we understand the district court to have concluded that the of the possibility of a sale was material,even at this early stage,because it motivated the defendants actions and was information which would aid and be important to the plaintiffs in evaluating the offer made.
there is more than adequate supporting evidence.there was evidence defendants were willing to violate the bylaws in the price set for options they acquired.indeed,the district court found the corporation had from embarked on a program to shares of the company in order to eliminate any shareholders who are not active in operations of the company.internal quotations omitted.the district court found that the defendants made the decision to redeem the minority shares even though the company had a pressing need for cash and was laying off workers to conserve funds.the district court reasonably concluded that the explanation was that on may,when the defendants offered to buy back all of the plaintiffs shares,they anticipated that the company soon could be sold for much more than the amounts that they paid for those shares.
of course,with the may redemption offer the plaintiffs knew that defendants and their families were attempting to get sole ownership of the company.this might have led a reasonable investor to ask why and to seek further information.still,this is not enough to render immaterial as a matter of law the undisclosed and misrepresented information.in all events,the district court factfinding that there was a violation is supportable.
thus,the evidence reasonably can be interpreted to show a scheme by defendants to obtain total ownership of the company for less than fair value through a variety of devices,anticipating a future sale.the devices fall into two general categories first,the failure to disclose that management had decided to try to sell the company and,second,the withholding of other material information as to the redemption and misrepresentation of other information.for example,while defendants on may thought it was material to nyman lenders that they have the company unaudited financials,the defendants failed to disclose that information to the plaintiffs.to effectuate this scheme,defendants pressured plaintiffs to sell by imposing false deadlines,telling judith lawton this was a once in a lifetime opportunity,failing to disclose financial information which would call into question the adequacy of the price offered,and timing the offer so that plaintiffs would not have the audited financial results while defendants simultaneously disclosed financial results to lenders.see jordan,at board decision to seek a buyer coupled with fact that one putative buyer considered company to be worth million sufficient to support a finding of materiality in close corporation.
we find no clear error in the conclusion that this totality of information would be germane and material to a selling minority shareholder and we uphold the liability finding.
theory of damages calculation 
the district court method of calculating damages in this case is essentially a conclusion of law,to which we give full review.see wilson great am,cir.in general,as the district court recognized,where immediate rescission of the purchase is unavailable,there are two different approaches to damages for by majority shareholders in a closely held corporation,with variations on both themes.the usual rule is to measure the plaintiffs loss by the difference in price between what they received for their stock and its fair value at the time of sale.see,sugarman,at applying law holmes bateson,cir.
in appropriate cases,another approach,used in defrauded seller cases under federal securities laws,is to require defendants to pay over their wrongful profits in order to avoid unjust enrichment of a wrongdoer.janigan taylor,cir.in a case involving a violation to a defrauded seller in a public company under a of the securities act,
the correct measure of damages is the difference between the fair value of all the seller received and the fair value of what he would have received had there been no fraudulent conduct,except for the situation where the defendant received more than the seller actual loss.in the latter case damages are the amount of the defendant profit.
affiliated ute citizens united states,d citing janigan,at see holmes,at.
under rhode island damages law,the basic precondition for the recovery of lost profits is that such a loss be established with reasonable certainty.although mathematical precision is not required,the trier of fact should be provided with some rational model of how the lost profits occurred and on what basis they have been computed.long atl.pbs,citations and internal quotation omitted.we do not require mathematical certainty in this calculation.all that is required is that the court be guided by some rational standard.abbey med.abbey rents,mignacca,citation omitted.at the same time,damages awards may not be based on speculation.macgregor,see thermo electron schiavone constr,cir.finally,where breach of fiduciary duty is involved,the rhode island courts have looked to equity for appropriate remedial principles.see,matarese calise.we caution that we are not deciding federal securities law questions,but rather look to cases involving the securities laws for guidance on how the rhode island courts would address the question.the choice between these remedies is within the discretion of the district court,but must accord with proper legal principles.see siebel scott,cir.
difference between price received and fair value absent the breach of fiduciary duty 
the district court used september,when the company was sold to van leer,as the relevant time to compute the difference between the price received and the fair value.the usual rule is that the fair value is to be determined as of the time of the plaintiffs sale.the district court departed from the usual rule based on two rationales.first,the court thought it is reasonable to conclude that,if the possibility of a sale had been disclosed,the plaintiffs would not have sold their shares for each but,rather,would have held on to their shares in the hope that the sale would take place.second,it found that,since,in may of,it was not certain that nyman manufacturing would be sold,it is impossible to calculate precisely the strategic value of the plaintiffs stock at that time.the best indication of that value is the sale price in september.neither rationale can be sustained on this record.
there are a number of problems with the rationale that plaintiffs would have retained the stock over the next sixteen months if the requisite disclosures had been made.none of the plaintiffs testified to this effect,and there is no other evidence from which this conclusion can be drawn.moreover,it is inconsistent with other findings the court made.the conclusion itself does not establish whether the plaintiffs would have sold had all the material information been provided.further,it does not establish whether plaintiffs,in possession of all material information,would have sold if they had been offered a share,a price the district court determined to be the fair market value in may,or whether plaintiffs would have sought a premium,and if so,what premium.and it does not establish whether defendants would have proceeded with redemption at any of these higher prices.key subsidiary factual findings are simply absent largely,we suspect,because the parties neither produced the evidence nor requested the findings.
there is no evidence in the record to support the conclusion that if the possibility of the sale had been disclosed in may,the plaintiffs would have held their stock until september,some sixteen months later.the plaintiffs never testified to this at all,despite the ease with which this line of questioning could have been explored.further,the factual findings made do not support this theory.the district court noted that plaintiffs had not bothered to seek additional financial information or outside advice before they sold their stock in may,that at least some of the plaintiffs had been exploring the possibility of redemption for some time,that plaintiffs accepted the offer two weeks before the deadline and within days after the offer was made,and that the decision was reached over a weekend after a family conference.these findings are more consistent with the conclusion that the family members would have leapt at the opportunity to sell in may,especially at a share,even if told that management was considering a sale of the company and in possession of the unaudited financials.
on appeal,the plaintiffs attempt to excuse their lack of proof by referring to our decision in ansin river oaks furniture,cir,which upheld an inference that the plaintiffs would not have sold their stock when they did had they known about plans for an initial public offering ipo.id.at.plaintiffs overread ansin.in that case,the evidence showed at least one of the plaintiffs was initially planning to hold his stock until the ipo but was pressured into an early sale.id.at.further,there were actual sale negotiations which had not been disclosed,and the defendants knew,at the time they purchased the shares,that the preconditions for an ipo had been met.the court inferred that plaintiffs would not have deviated from their initial plan had they known about the impending ipo.by contrast,here there was no evidence of the plaintiffs investment goals or how they would have responded to news of the potential sale of the business.
plaintiffs rejoinder in their briefs is that of course they would have held on to their stock in may had they known what their shares would have been worth when the company was sold to van leer.the argument very much misses the point.no one knew in may that the company would be sold in september for a per share value of about nine times what the plaintiffs were paid.the damages must be tied somehow to the information withheld or misrepresented.the information withheld was not that the company would in fact be sold to a strategic buyer some sixteen months later,much less at that price.
this theory that plaintiffs would have held on to their stock is also inconsistent with the district court conclusion that,although it is fairly clear that by may,the defendants anticipated the possibility that nyman manufacturing would be sold,there is no indication that,at the time,a sale was anything more than a mere possibility.nothing in the record establishes that a mere possibility of sale of the company would have led plaintiffs to retain their stock.that is particularly so if they had been offered a share in may,the fair market value the district court accepted as true through piccerelli expert testimony.
we also reject the district court second the sale price of the corporation some sixteen months later in represented a reasonable proxy for the market value of the shares in may.no evidence supports this conclusion,and it is clearly erroneous.indeed,several of the district court other findings undercut its conclusion.the court found,as noted,that the fair market value of class a stock in may was a share.it found that while there could be a premium over market value for a strategic sale of the company there was,as of may,no likelihood of a sale,only a mere possibility.finally,the district court rejected the testimony offered by the plaintiffs expert,steven carlson,for a number of appropriate reasons,including his lack of training and education,the inconsistency of his methods with generally accepted methods of business valuation,and miscalculations.
piccerelli,whose testimony the district court accepted,testified to a fair market value of for a single share of company stock in may.he defined fair market value as the amount at which property would change hands between a willing seller and a willing buyer when neither is acting under compulsion and when both have knowledge of the relevant facts.he acknowledged that there were different methodologies available and was on his choice.he was also on his experience with valuing companies and on the total value he assigned the company for may of.piccerelli was asked about whether the van leer sale undermined his confidence in the numbers,and he said it did not.
using different figures,both sides experts said two discounts had to be taken into account in valuing a single share of the company in may a marketability discount and a minority discount.by definition,a sale of an entire company will not involve any minority share or marketability discount,further undercutting the district court assumption of equivalence between the may and september values there is a notable absence of expert or other evidence in support of any assumption that the mere possibility of sale would have increased the fair market value in may by adding a premium.we discuss the premium issue further below.
avoidance of windfall to wrongdoer and award of defendants profits 
there is another possible theory of recovery,first articulated in this court in janigan awarding plaintiffs whatever profits the fraudulent buyers made on resale of the stock in order to avoid unjust enrichment.at see bloomberg lowenfels,securities fraud commodities fraud ed.the rule is based on equity and the principle that it is more appropriate to give the defrauded party the benefit even of windfalls than to let the fraudulent party keep them.janigan,at.under the securities act the supreme court has held,citing janigan,that where the defendant received more than the seller actual loss damages are the amount of the defendant profit.affiliated ute,at.this alternative standard aims at preventing the unjust enrichment of a fraudulent buyer and it clearly does more than simply make the plaintiff whole for the economic loss proximately caused by the buyer fraud.randall loftsgaarden,d.
we believe that rhode island would adopt a similar equitable remedial rule of avoiding unjust enrichment for redemption of minority shareholders stock involving a breach of fiduciary duty by corporate officers who are majority shareholders in close corporations.indeed,equitable principles are routinely applied to remedies for breach of fiduciary duty.
under rhode island law,a court equitable power to award unjust enrichment damages is sometimes wielded under the rubric of the constructive trust.a constructive trust will be imposed upon property that is obtained in violation of a fiduciary duty.simpson dailey.the underlying principle of a constructive trust is the equitable prevention of unjust enrichment of one party at the expense of another in situations in which legal title to property was obtained in violation of a fiduciary or confidential relationship id.while often used to grant the plaintiff legal title to real property,see,matarese,at,the constructive trust can also be used to convey proceeds or other liquid assets,see simpson,at 
but there is need for a great deal of caution.the fiduciary label means different things in different contexts.officers and directors of a close corporation are not wholly comparable to trustees entrusted with the assets of minor wards,and unjust enrichment may not be an appropriate remedy here.the law of remedies as to the latter situation may not be entirely appropriate for the former.and the answer to the question of what are to be counted as windfall profits is far from clear from the record in this case.rhode island law discourages the award of speculative profits.see macgregor,at.further,it is a general principle of equity that the courts impose the least drastic remedy available to achieve the desired goals.see farrand,ancillary remedies in sec civil enforcement suits,harv.
the district court did not independently analyze the janigan avoidance of unjust enrichment theory of damages.rather,based on its earlier error as to the value of plaintiffs shares as of may,it said,that loss is identical to the profit realized by the defendants,and the amount recoverable as damages is the same as the amount that the defendants would be required to disgorge.
there is little circuit law on the issue of how to approach a janigan award based on the avoidance of unjust enrichment.commentators have noted the confusion about damages in securities actions a recent article by the authors of a leading treatise on securities law is entitled compensatory damages in rule actions pragmatic justice or chaos.lowenfels bloomberg,seton hall.this has been called a confused area of law where the courts,forced to rely on their wits,have crafted a myriad of approaches.see dcd programs,leighton,cir.
in equity,the correct legal standards interact with the underlying facts in determining an appropriate remedy.we think the wiser course is to remand the matter of this theory of damages for such further proceedings as are warranted.in doing so we set some general parameters,cautioning that this is not an area where hard and fast rules are either easy to articulate or warranted.
to be clear,janigan does not embody a rule that plaintiffs are automatically entitled to all of defendants profits from defendants subsequent resale of stock regardless of circumstance.janigan itself does not state a per se rule that all subsequent profits accrue to plaintiffs it is subject to significant restrictions which were not considered here.janigan built upon an earlier case which stressed that the particular circumstances surrounding the case must be taken into account.myzel fields,cir.
janigan itself recognized at least two limits.first,it referred only to the profit which was the proximate consequence of the fraud,itself a limiting factor.this court,sitting en banc,limited the application of the janigan rule in the context of publicly traded companies.sec macdonald,cir.macdonald held that the sec could not recover,on a disgorgement of profits theory,the defendants profits from use of insider information for a period beyond a reasonable time after public dissemination of the information.this was so,we held,because when a seller of publicly traded securities has learned of previously undisclosed material facts,and decides nevertheless not to replace the sold securities,he can not later claim that his failure to obtain subsequent stock appreciation was a proximate consequence of his prior ignorance.id.at emphasis added.here,we have a close corporation the plaintiffs lacked the opportunity,available to public shareholders,to reenter the market.rather,macdonald is significant,for our purposes,for its emphasis on the need for the wrongful profits to be causally related to the breach of duty.id.at macdonald also holds that the purpose of recovery is remedial,not punitive.id 
second,janigan said that extraordinary gains in a company affairs attributable to extra efforts by defendants are not part of the windfall profits.see at.a subsequent increase in the value of the stock attributable to special or unique efforts of the fraudulent party other than those for which he is duly compensated is not a windfall subject to disgorgement.nelson serwold,cir see siebel,at.
as the janigan doctrine has been refined,recovery of the defendants later profits is usually applied when the subsequent resale follows fairly closely the original purchase from the plaintiffs.see,pidcock sunnyland,cir company put up for sale in the same month in which the agreement for a fraudulent purchase was signed siebel,at a defendant profits may be disgorged where he fraudulently induces the plaintiff to sell securities to him and resells them shortly thereafter at a higher price emphasis added the mere passage of time,if long enough,may limit the amount of profits recoverable by a previously defrauded seller.pidcock,at see also gerstle,cir the passage of time introduces so many elements that extreme prolongation of the period years for calculating damages may be grossly unfair.in situations where the period of time was short and the defendants thus had more reason to be aware of a possible sale,the dangers of a speculative award are small.the length of time between the repurchase of stock and the eventual sale of the company here falls at neither extreme of this temporal continuum,and the district court is best positioned to make specific findings as to the effect,if any,of the passage of time.
here there are a great many unanswered and perhaps unanswerable questions.for example,would defendants have tendered more than a share upon disclosing the material information to plaintiffs would plaintiffs have accepted a higher tender,say,at a share would defendants have offered that much would plaintiffs have held onto their shares in any of these scenarios is it fair to reward plaintiffs with the fruits of all profits given the risks defendants undertook in their subsequent management can any of these factors be quantified in some sense 
the district court should also consider whether the case is appropriate for application of a janigan approach which deems a defendant later profits from sale of a company to be unjust enrichment.other models of equitable relief may be better suited for the facts of this case,if equitable relief is warranted at all.if the evidence shows that the plaintiffs would have sold their shares even had they received the withheld information,then any profit defendants earned above the premium they would have paid the plaintiffs absent the fraud is not unjust enrichment.rowe maremont,cir.moreover,it may be that the stock sale price in september is so untethered to the stock fair value in may that equitable relief is inappropriate.see holmes,at.
another approach may be to rely not on what the fair market price was at the time of sale,but on the premium plaintiffs would have exacted from defendants were the relevant information disclosed.see rowe,at.this solution would award plaintiffs more than their loss,strictly speaking,while not requiring the disgorgement of all of defendants eventual profit,some of which may have been justly earned.we recognize that this solution may be more akin to the first damages rationale discussed above.in the effort to avoid giving wrongdoers a windfall,there must be attention to what the windfall really is.because of the ambiguity about the meaning of the finding of the district court that the fair market value of the shares was,and whether that figure included a premium for a possible sale,this approach may or may not be an appropriate model.
part of what complicates this case is that there was a series of material omissions or misstatements,and the different categories of breach may produce different remedial results.see sharp coopers lybrand,cir.the district court should make such findings as are necessary and fas
