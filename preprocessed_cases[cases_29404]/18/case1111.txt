factual the plaintiffs and the plan 
plaintiff terrence holdeman is the class representative of a group of employees,and dependents of those employees,of the state line hotel and silver smith casino in wendover,nevada.the hotel and casino were owned and operated by state line hotel,and its related entities state line 
for many years,state line had maintained a employee benefit plan.the funding for this plan came from two sources contributions made by the covered employees and funds allocated to the plan by state line.claims for benefits were paid in the order in which they were received.claims above a certain dollar amount were covered,to the extent they exceeded the relevant dollar amount,by reinsurance.
holdeman and the other class members were covered under the state line silver smith casino resorts employee benefits plan the plan,which became effective on may.the plan,like state line previous plans,was.the summary plan description spd,as originally drafted,was inconsistent in its identification of who the plan administrator was.app.at.in particular,the spd first identified state line silver smith casino resorts as the plan administrator,but later named michael devine as the plan administrator and fiduciary of the plan.the administrator for the plan was identified as mgis companies.on may,the plan was amended.the accompanying spd identified only state line hotel,and affiliated entities as the plan administrator and fiduciary.the amended plan terminated in december of.
defendant michael devine 
defendant michael devine is the son of billie ann smith devine,one of the owners of state line.in late or early,devine,who at the time was practicing law in salt lake city,was asked by professional advisors of state line to consider helping out the family business.devine agreed to do so,and began working as state line executive vice president and general counsel in january.devine later became president of state line august,and ultimately president and ceo of state line april.
at the time devine joined state line in early,state line was facing financial difficulties resulting from a recent,major expansion project.one of devine primary duties thus became working with state line lenders to resolve legal issues.for example,devine was involved in negotiating a forbearance agreement with state line lenders in that allowed state line to continue to operate and avoid foreclosure.under the forbearance agreement,state line had to report monthly to the lenders and was subject to surprise inspections by the lenders auditors,attorneys,and accountants.
devine involvement with the plan 
when devine joined state line in january,he was aware there were some funding problems with the p lan,but was not integrally involved in dealing with those problems at that time.app.at.at some point after joining state line,however,devine became involved in making changes to the plan.id.for example,he and his managerial staff considered changing to a group plan,but concluded that option was too expensive for state line.devine and his managerial staff then requested competitive proposals for a new administrator for the plan,and ultimately chose mgis as the administrator concomitant with selecting mgis,devine and state line implemented a new,medical benefits plan on may.it is undisputed that,as of may,devine was considered a fiduciary of the plan.
when the plan was first implemented,mgis processed all claims and issued all payment checks to providers.id.at.at some point in,this process changed,and instead of issuing the checks directly to providers,mgis forwarded the payment checks to state line for state line to keep until adequate funding was available,at which point state line itself would release the checks.id.state line generally tried to pay the claims on a,basis.
between may,and april,when he became ceo of state line,devine was vaguely aware of plan funding problems and had been told by one employee of a delay in payment.id.at.however,he did not regularly meet during this time period to discuss these issues.id.nor did he advise state line ceo at that time,mac potter,that the p lan had to be funded before any commercial creditors were paid id.according to devine,he believed that state line had to pay both and that these responsibilities were competing.id.
in late january,state line financial personnel determined that the plan unpaid medical claims were greater than previously believed.when all unpaid medical claims were tallied,they totaled approximately million.this determination,in part,led to devine appointment as ceo of state line in april.
after becoming ceo,devine began meeting with all of the executive directors,and u nderfunding of the p lan became a regular topic of conversation at these meetings,as well as at the meetings of state line board of directors,because the arrearages were negatively impact ing the business and the employees.id.at.under devine direction,state line began focusing on growing the top line so that there would be income to pay all medical expenses.id.at.as ceo of state line,devine generally had no involvement in deciding the right balance in terms of who would get paid.id.at.although devine would v ery occasionally direct that a particular medical claim be paid in order to prevent the medical provider from cutting off service to state line employees or refusing to give further discounts,state line general position,under devine leadership,was to pay first whatever was required to keep the doors open and the companies operating and then turn aggressively to the medical claims.id.at.
during the remainder of,state line doubled its cash flow which allowed it to pay down the arrearages.id.in particular,between april and october of,state line bec a me much more aggressive in paying the unpaid medical claims,and managed to zero out the plan liabilities to medical providers.id.at.this zero balance status,however,was.in,state line experienced a downturn in its business.this,in turn,again led to the underfunding of the plan and a new backlog of unpaid medical claims which ultimately grew to a total of approximately million by december.
between may and december,state line,at devine direction,made a number of distributions to its owners beyond their salaries in a total amount of approximately.id.at.during most of this time period the plan was underfunded.the distributions were used by the owners for payment of personal federal income taxes on profits from state line,and estate tax payments for the estate of anna smith which estate consisted solely of state line.state line lenders allegedly signed off on the se distributions in an attempt to ensure that the owners,who had personally guaranteed some of state line loans,not get with the irs and have enforcement actions brought against them,which could have threatened the continued viability of state line.id.at.
state line also made charitable contributions during this time period.the majority of these contributions represented group discounts and packages,for organizations and charities such as the elks club.id.at.these contributions were intended,in part,to promote state line business at a grass roots level id.
in addition to the backlog of medical claims that existed during this general time period,state line was also juggling other bills.id.these expenses included monthly gaming taxes which if not paid would lead to the casino immediate shutdown,payments on slot machine agreements,bills from food vendors,advertising costs,maintenance costs,payroll,and fica and payroll taxes.
at some point during this period,mgis,the administrator of the plan,reported the problems to the department of labor dol.in february,the dol began an investigation into the matter.during the course of the dol investigation,the dol informed devine of its concerns that he had violated erisa duty of loyalty,duty of prudence,and duty to refrain from prohibited transactions id.at.although the dol ultimately took no formal enforcement action against state line or devine,it continued to monitor state line.
in july,with state line revenues continuing to drop,devine concluded that state line would be unable to make its interest payments to its lenders.in an attempt to solve this problem,devine asked the owners to lend whatever personal monies they could to state line so that the loan agreements would not be breached.id.at.marian barnwell could not afford to loan money to state line,but billie ann devine lent by cashing out her personal k account,mary carol johnson also cashed out her personal k account and lent state line,and eve louis smith,the wife of partner jim smith,lent state line by taking money out of her personal schwab investment account.id.these monies were used by state line for principal and interest payments.id.
state line gambling revenues declined further following the september,terrorist attacks.on november,state line ppo network terminated the discount arrangement it had with mgis.id.in turn,mgis sent a letter to devine on november,informing him that mgis was terminating its agreement with state line.id.at.state line,after receiving mgis letter,terminated the plan effective december.as of december,state line switched to a group plan that offered fewer benefits.id.at.on january,state line,facing foreclosure by its lenders,filed for chapter bankruptcy protection.in the bankruptcy proceedings,state line reported that was left outstanding in unpaid medical claims.id.
included among the unpaid medical claims at the time of state line bankruptcy filing were 
approximately in medical expenses incurred by plaintiff terrence holdeman.holdeman wife worked for state line as a pit boss from to,during which time she and her husband were covered under the plan.holdeman incurred the medical expenses with the university of utah that,despite his repeated calls to state line and to the administrator,went unpaid by state line.id.at.
approximately to in medical expenses incurred by gerald anderson,an employee of state line,and his wife.the andersons ultimately paid these expenses by charging them to their credit cards.
approximately in medical expenses incurred by ruth ann wilson,an employee of state line.included among these expenses was a prepayment wilson and her husband had to make,using money from an inheritance and their savings account,to obtain needed back surgery for wilson.
procedural background 
plaintiff holdeman filed this action,on behalf of himself and a purported class comprised of former beneficiaries of the plan,on may.the complaint named as defendants various officers and directors of state line,including devine,and asserted claims under erisa and the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico.the district court dismissed the rico claims and,on december,certified the erisa claims as a class action.holdeman and the class subsequently filed an amended complaint asserting erisa claims against six state line officers and directors,including devine.
after discovery,the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of all defendants,except for devine.with respect to devine,the district court concluded that the the undisputed evidence indicate d that he was a fiduciary of the plan,but that the following issues remain ed for determination the extent of his fiduciary duties to the plan and whether he breached his fiduciary duties to the plan.app.at.
the district court conducted a bench trial on september.on october,the district court issued written findings of fact and conclusions of law.therein,the district court conclude d that devine did not breach his fiduciary duties to the p lan or the plan participants under erisa.id.at.accordingly,the district court entered judgment in favor of devine.plaintiff holdeman,on behalf of himself and the class,has since filed a notice of appeal.

plaintiffs arguments on appeal 
in their appeal,plaintiffs argue generally that the district court erred in ruling that devine did not breach h is fiduciary duties.aplt.br.at.more specifically,plaintiffs argue that devine breached fiduciary duties owed to the class in many ways,including fail ing to ensure that the plan was fully funded,fail ing to act with complete loyalty to the class,fail ing to act prudently in managing and administering the plan,and with his fiduciary hat on,fail ing to act in any way to challenge or question the actions of devine,acting with his ceo hat,in authorizing distributions of over million to the owners of the sponsoring entities.aplt.br.at.plaintiffs also argue that the district court erred in relying on devine subjective belief that he was doing the best he could to carry out his dual roles as both ceo and fiduciary,and in ruling that all of devine decisions were business judgments that fall outside the scope of erisa fiduciary duty requirements id.at.
the decision in luna 
the district court rested its decision almost exclusively on our decision in in re luna,cir.accordingly,we begin by describing,in some detail,the facts and holding in that case.the plaintiffs therein were the trustees of various funds that,pursuant to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement cba,served the employees of luna steel erectors,luna steel,an oklahoma construction company.under the terms of the cba,luna steel agreed to submit monthly employer contributions to the funds for the benefit of its employees.in march,luna steel financial condition worsened,and from march until december of,it failed to make the requisite contributions.on december,luna steel,at the decision of its directors,ceased operations.luna steel two shareholders,joyce luna and her son,mark luna,both filed chapter bankruptcy petitions in august.
in november,the plaintiff trustees filed an adversary proceeding seeking a determination that the lunas were personally responsible for the unpaid contributions to the funds.the trustees alleged this debt was nondischargeable because the lunas had committed fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity because they continued to take some income and personal expenses at a time when they should have been making contributions to the f unds.id.at.in support of this claim,the trustees further argued that the lunas were fiduciaries under erisa a,a,which states,in part,that a fiduciary is one who exercises any authority or control respecting management of disposition of plan assets.id.at quoting statute.
the trustees lost in the bankruptcy court and in their appeal to the federal district court.both of these courts agreed that while erisa imposes fiduciary obligations under a of the bankruptcy code,because unpaid contributions do not constitute plan assets,the lunas had committed no defalcation and the debt could be discharged in bankruptcy.id.the trustees then appealed to this court.
in addressing the trustees appeal,we held at the outset that,t o establish erisa fiduciary status within the meaning of erisa a,a,the t rustees had to show that the unpaid contributions were plan assets,and that the lunas exercised authority and control over the management or disposition of these assets.id.
addressing these issues in order,we first concluded,contrary to the two lower courts,that the contractual right to collect unpaid contributions is a plan asset under erisa.id.in reaching this conclusion,we acknowledged that u nder ordinary notions of property rights,an erisa plan does not have a present interest in the unpaid contributions until they are actually paid to the plan.id.at italics in original.nonetheless,we held the plan does hold a future interest in the collection of the contributions.id.italics in original.thus,we concluded,t he plain meaning of the term asset includes a chose in action to collect contributions.id.at.in turn,we held that the district court erred in concluding that the contributions owed by the lunas to the f unds were not plan assets under erisa.id.
turning to the second issue,we began by noting that,under erisa,an individual may acquire fiduciary status either by a being expressly appointed by the plan as a fiduciary,or b by exercis ing the fiduciary functions set forth in erisa a,a.id.at.these latter functions,we noted,include a variety of duties commonly performed by fiduciaries,including the providing of investment advice,administrative control over a plan,advising on whom to retain as legal or investment advisors to a plan,and ultimately,how to invest plan assets.id.in sum,we noted,o nce deemed a fiduciary,either by express designation in the plan documents or the assumption of fiduciary obligations the functional or de facto method,the fiduciary becomes subject to erisa statutory duties.id.these duties,we stated,relate to the proper management,administration,and investment of fund assets,the maintenance of proper records,the disclosure of specified information,and the avoidance of conflicts of interest.id.quoting.mut.life ins.russell,d.
because the lunas were not named as fiduciaries in the plan at issue,we proceeded to analyze whether the lunas ha d assumed functional or de facto fiduciary status id.at.in particular,we noted that the critical issue,based upon the facts presented by the parties,was whether the lunas exercised any authority or control respecting management or disposition of plan assets.id.addressing this issue,we concluded that i t wa s the t rustees,not the lunas,who control led the contractual right to collect unpaid contributions from the lunas.id.more specifically,we concluded that w hether to enforce their contractual rights wa s entirely up to the t rustees the lunas,meanwhile,ha d no say over whether this right w ould be enforced or not.id.
in concluding that the lunas had not assumed functional fiduciary status,we also rejected the ninth circuit view that an employer automatically becomes a fiduciary of an erisa plan as soon as it breaches its agreement to make employer contributions.id.at citing northern cal.retail clerks unions food employers joint pension trust fund jumbo markets,cir.in our view,erisa text and purpose,the law of trusts,department of labor regulatory pronouncements,and case law all lend support to the conclusion that an employer can not become an erisa fiduciary merely because it breaches its contractual obligations to a fund.id.in the lunas case,we concluded,t he act of failing to make contributions to the f unds c ould not reasonably be construed,under erisa,as taking part in the management or disposition of a plan asset.id.at.rather,we concluded,t he asset in question wa s the t rustees contractual right to collect the unpaid contributions,and the lunas exercised no control over how the t rustees manage d or dispose d of that asset.id.in terms of the law of trusts,we continued,a contract to convey property does not give rise to a fiduciary relationship,id.at citing the restatement third of trusts i and cmt.i,and the relationship of debtor to creditor that results from contract is not fiduciary in nature.id.citing restatement k.finally,applying erisa case law,we concluded that a delinquent employer contributor is merely a debtor,not a fiduciary.id.at.in the lunas case,we noted,they had no duty other than to make monthly contributions,and no discretion other than to fail to make those required contributions.id.at.the mere discretion whether to pay debts owed to an employee benefit plan,we held,does not suffice to confer fiduciary status under erisa.id.
finally,and perhaps most importantly for purposes of the instant appeal,we emphasized that a nother essential ingredient in th e case wa s the fact that the lunas,as owners of a corporation,were required to make business decisions with respect to general corporate funds.id.at.continuing,we stated 
such business decisions must not be confused with fiduciary actions.it is that an erisa fiduciary can wear two hats,meaning an individual can be both an employer and a fiduciary.citation omitted.therefore,as the supreme court has noted,the threshold question in an action for breach of fiduciary duty is whether the alleged fiduciary was acting as a fiduciary that is,was performing a fiduciary function when taking the action subject to complaint.pegram herdrich,d.
because virtually every business decision an employer makes can have an adverse impact on an employee benefit plan,citation omitted,courts must examine the conduct at issue to determine whether it constitutes management or administration of the plan,giving rise to fiduciary concerns,or merely a business decision that has an effect on an erisa plan not subject to fiduciary duties.citation omitted.this is so even where some of the decisions personally benefitted the employer,such as some of the payments made by the lunas to themselves for personal expenses.citation omitted.
under the circumstances of this case,the lunas decision to use their limited funds to pay other business expenses rather than to make contributions to the f unds was a business decision,not a breach of fiduciary duty.citation omitted.in an attempt to keep the company afloat in the fact of deteriorating finances,the lunas opted to pay expenses such as employee wages,insurance,and equipment leases.the company financial condition was so severe,in fact,that joyce luna withdrew funds from her ira to help cover expenses and mark luna borrowed money from a local bank for company use.although the decision to pay expenses rather than make plan contributions had an adverse impact on the f unds,we decline to impute fiduciary status to the lunas based on this fact alone.
the district court application of luna 
the district court,in resolving the instant case,noted that devine conceded at trial that he was a fiduciary of the state line medical benefits plan at all times relevant to this suit,and thus the only legal determination left to make wa s whether,under the facts as found by the court,devine breached any of his fiduciary duties to the plan or the plan participants under erisa.app.at.continuing,the district court concluded that luna discussion of the analysis to be applied in cases where an individual is both an employer and an erisa fiduciary wa s directly on point with the present case.id.at.accordingly,the district court stated it would follow luna and determine whether the actions devine took as an executive and ultimately the ceo of state line were purely business decisions,not regulated under erisa,or whether they were decisions taken in his fiduciary capacity under erisa.id.doing so,the district court concluded that all of the actions taken by devine,from the time he joined the companies in,and during the time period relevant to this lawsuit,we re properly characterized as business and not fiduciary decisions.id.more specifically,the district court concluded as follows 
failure to fully fund the plan was not a result of breach of fiduciary duty to the plan or plan participants,but rather to the pragmatic business decisions devine was forced to make in difficult financial circumstances in order to prevent foreclosure or bankruptcy.id.at.
devine decisions regarding funding of the plan were not fiduciary decisions in any respect,but rather business decisions made to save the companies from bankruptcy that would have obviously hurt all the plan participants immediately.id.at.
devine authorization of distributions to the owners and of charitable contributions during this time period also constituted business,and not fiduciary,decisions.id.
plaintiffs challenges to the conclusions expressly reached by the district court 
in their appeal,plaintiffs challenge the conclusions expressly reached
