introduction 
in this writ proceeding,we hold the indemnification language in nine liability policies obligates the insurer central national insurance company of omaha central national to indemnify its insured powerine oil company,powerine for expenses powerine incurs in responding to two orders issued by the california regional water quality control board the water quality board to clean up and abate contamination originating from powerine subsidiary.in reaching our decision,we distinguish the language of the instant policies from that contained in the standard comprehensive general liability cgl policies,which latter policies were the subject of prior decisions of our supreme court certain underwriters at lloyd of london superior court powerine oil company cal th,d,hereinafter powerine i,and,national union fire ins.cal th,d,hereinafter.
this proceeding comes on the heels of the earlier writ proceeding in the same case powerine i in which the supreme court held that damages in the indemnification wording of the standard cgl policy means only money ordered by a court,and not the cost to comply with administrative agency environmental orders.in granting summary adjudication below,the trial court perceived itself constrained by powerine i to construe the central national insurance policies as denying coverage to powerine for sums powerine spends pursuant to the cleanup and abatement orders issued by the water quality board.distinguishing the language of its policies under consideration here from that before the court in powerine i,powerine seeks a writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate its order granting summary adjudication in favor of real party in interest,central national.we hold the specific indemnification language in the central national policies here is broader in scope than that contained in the cgl policies in powerine i and and includes the costs powerine expends in responding to administrative agencies cleanup and abatement orders.accordingly,we grant the petition and issue the writ.
factual and procedural background 
the parties have stipulated to the following facts powerine,through its various owners,has been engaged in oil refinery operations in southern california periodically since the.as a result of its operations,powerine faces certain environmental liabilities arising from alleged soil and groundwater contamination at various locations.two regional offices of the water quality board issued two orders to powerine to clean up and abate alleged pollution at locations.these cleanup and abatement orders were not issued as a result of litigation or as part of an injunction.
cleanup and abatement order issued by the los angeles region of the water quality board,we are told,followed intensive negotiations and a series of compromises between powerine and the water quality board concerning the scope of the order and the nature and extent of investigative activities to be undertaken thereunder.nonetheless,as of the date of these proceedings,powerine had not incurred any expenses pursuant to the orders.
powerine notified its many insurers of the orders,giving rise to a declaratory relief action against it.highlands insurance company powerine,et,case no.powerine against numerous insurers,including central national alleging the insurers had a contractual duty to defend and indemnify powerine for various claims and losses arising from the environmental orders issued by the water quality board,and requesting,inter alia,declaratory relief and damages for breach of contract and of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
the lawsuit before us involves nine liability policies central national issued to powerine,commencing in the last of the policies expired in february.the meaning of the indemnification provision in these nine policies is the subject of this proceeding 
the pertinent coverage language in these nine central national policies reads in relevant part the company hereby agrees to indemnify the insured for all sums which the insured shall be obligated to pay by reason of the liability imposed upon the insured by law for damages,direct or consequential and expenses,all as more fully defined by the term ultimate net loss on account of property damage caused by or arising out of each occurrence happening anywhere in the world.italics added.
ultimate net loss is defined as the total sum which the insured,or any company as his insurer,or both,become obligated to pay by reason of property damage either through adjudication or compromise and for litigation,settlement,adjustment and investigation of claims and suits which,are paid as a consequence of any occurrence covered hereunder italics added.
while the lawsuit was pending,the supreme court decided.thereafter,a writ proceeding in this action brought by the primary insurers culminated in the supreme court powerine i decision holding the word damages,in the indemnification language of the standard cgl policies,means only those sums ordered by a court of law.
after powerine i was decided,central national moved for summary adjudication,which resulted in the judgment giving rise to this writ proceeding.in its motion,central national sought an order that pursuant to powerine i in particular,and also,it has no duty to indemnify powerine under its policies for any sums spent by powerine pursuant to the water quality board cleanup and abatement orders because no damages within the meaning of those policies had been ordered by a court.premised on the stipulation of material facts the motion addressed a matter of law only.
the trial court granted central national summary adjudication motion.pursuant to powerine i,the trial court ruled central national has no duty to indemnify powerine under its various policies for sums powerine spends pursuant to the cleanup and abatement orders issued by the water quality board.the trial court explained the central national policies definition of coverage for damages did not include cleanup and abatement expenses ordered outside the context of a lawsuit.the trial court rejected powerine argument based on the difference in purpose between its policies and the cgl policies in powerine i.the court explained it could not apply a meaning to damages which changes depending on the type of policy in effect.the instant proceeding ensued.
contentions 
powerine contends powerine i and are not controlling because the language of the central national policies is broader than that considered in powerine i and the policy at issue here is not a standard cgl policy,but an policy.

rules of policy interpretation and powerine 
the rules of policy interpretation have been well established by our supreme court while insurance contracts have special features,they are still contracts to which the ordinary rules of contractual interpretation apply.citations.the fundamental goal of contractual interpretation is to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties.citation.such intent is to be inferred,if possible,solely from the written provisions of the contract.citation.if contractual language is clear and explicit,it governs.citation,supra,cal th at,d.
thus,a policy provision will be considered ambiguous when it is capable of two or more constructions,both of which are reasonable.citations.the fact that a term is not defined in the policies does not make it ambiguous.citations.nor does d isagreement concerning the meaning of a phrase,or the fact that a word or phrase isolated from its context is susceptible of more than one meaning.citation.l anguage in a contract must be construed in the context of that instrument as a whole,and in the circumstances of that case,and can not be found to be ambiguous in the abstract.citation.if an asserted ambiguity is not eliminated by the language and context of the policy,courts then invoke the principle that ambiguities are generally construed against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist,the insurer in order to protect the insured reasonable expectation of coverage.citation,supra,cal th at,d.
supreme court precedent.
as,and especially powerine i,shape and influence our decision here,we begin our analysis by reviewing those decisions.
a.the decision.
at issue in was the language in the standard cgl insurance policy establishing the duty to defend.the policy stated,the company shall have the right and duty to defend any suit against the insured seeking damages on account of such bodily injury or property damage,and may make such investigation and settlement of any claim or suit as it deems expedient,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.
taking a literal approach to interpreting the meaning of the word suit in the duty to defend clause,the supreme court concluded suit was not ambiguous and denoted only a court proceeding initiated by the filing of a complaint,supra,cal th at,d.based on this policy language,the supreme court held the insurer duty to defend the insured in a suit was limited to a civil action prosecuted in a court it did not extend to an order issued by an administrative agency under an environmental statute.powerine i,supra,cal th at,d,citing,supra,at,d.under the policies in,an insurer was required to defend a suit,but had discretion to investigate and settle a claim,supra,at,d.noting the juxtaposition,the supreme court explained,an administrative proceeding under environmental statutes does not constitute a suit,a civil action prosecuted in a court,but rather implicates a claim.citation.italics added,powerine i,supra,at,d,citing,supra,at,d.
this holding was intended to create a rule that,by clearly delineating the scope of risk,reduce d the need for future litigation,by avoiding the determination whether each new and different letter presenting the claim of an administrative agency is to be deemed the functional equivalent of a suit brought in a court of law.citation,supra,cal th at,d,original italics.for our purposes,among the distinctions established by the supreme court in was the contrast between,on the one hand a suit,a civil action in a court commenced by a complaint,and on the other hand a claim,which can be initiated by an administrative proceeding.see id.at,d.
b.the powerine i decision.
the earlier writ proceeding in this case,powerine i,involved interpretation of the word damages in the indemnification provision of the primary cgl insurance policies issued to powerine by certain underwriters at lloyd,london and certain london market insurance companies.powerine i was triggered by the same cleanup and abatement orders and the same complaint brought by highlands insurance company as here.powerine i,supra,cal th at,d.while addressed the scope of the duty to defend,powerine i considered the reach of the duty to indemnify.
specifically limiting its analysis to the standard cgl insurance policy powerine i,supra,cal th at,d,the supreme court in powerine i held the insurer duty to indemnify the insured for all sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages under the standard cgl insurance policy is limited to money ordered by a court.id.at,d,italics added.
this holding flowed directly from the syllogism powerine i,supra,cal th at,d,which states the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify.the duty to defend is not broad enough to extend beyond a suit,a civil action prosecuted in a court,but rather is limited thereto.a fortiori,the duty to indemnify is not broad enough to extend beyond damages,money ordered by a court,but rather is limited thereto.id.at,d.
the powerine i court further explained the term damages in its full context and in its ordinary and popular sense is limited to money ordered by a court because the provision that imposes the duty to defend links damages to a suit,a civil action prosecuted in a court powerine i,supra,cal th at,d,and because in both the legal and the broader culture,damages exist traditionally inside of court.id.at,d.that is,the court elucidated,d amages do not constitute a redundancy to a sum that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay,but a limitation thereof.id.at,d.this limitation,the supreme court reasoned,commends itself to society generally as laying down a rule,having a tendency to promote fairness and efficiency in the judicial sphere.id.at,d.
in reaching its decision,the powerine i court distinguished between the word damages,present in the cgl policy,and the term expenses,ordered by an administrative agency,which latter word did not appear in the analyzed indemnity provision.the duty to indemnify for damages in the primary policies,the supreme court stated,did not extend to any expenses required by an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental,here,proceedings conducted before the regional water boards powerine i,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.the reason,the supreme court explained,is that expenses required by an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute,whether for the cleanup of a contaminated site and the abatement of the contamination effects or otherwise,do not constitute money ordered by a court.id.at,d,italics added.
read together,and powerine i stand for the proposition that the duty to defend a suit seeking damages under the standard cgl policies is restricted to civil actions prosecuted in a court,initiated by the filing of a complaint,and does not include claims,which can denote proceedings conducted by administrative agencies under environmental statutes.likewise,the duty to indemnify for all sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages powerine i,supra,cal th at,d,italics added in the same standard primary policies is limited to money ordered by a court,and does not include expenses such as may be incurred in responding to administrative agency orders.
with the rules and authorities in mind,we turn to the language at hand.
the coverage and ultimate net loss provisions encompass costs incurred in complying with administrative agency environmental orders where no lawsuit is filed.
we are confronted here with the next dispute to ensue from the cleanup and abatement orders issued to powerine by the water quality board,namely whether the words of the insurance policy impose on the insurer a duty to indemnify the insured for the costs incurred to negotiate and comply with environmental orders.while the issue is rather,it bears repeating that we are analyzing the language of policies,not the cgl policies that were at issue in and powerine 
turning to the specific language under consideration here,as noted,the coverage provision of the central national policies states central national agrees to indemnify the insured for all sums which the insured shall be obligated to pay by reason of the liability imposed upon the insured by law for damages and expenses,all as more fully defined by the term ultimate net loss on account of property damage.italics added.
ultimate net loss is defined as the total sum which the insured,become s obligated to pay by reason of property damage either through adjudication or compromise,and shall also include law costs for litigation,settlement,adjustment and investigation of claims and suits which,are paid as a consequence of any occurrence covered hereunder 
the clear and explicit meaning of the policy provisions,interpreted in their ordinary and popular sense,controls judicial interpretation unless used by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage.citation.vandenberg superior court cal th,d.we conclude coverage is unambiguous and clearly extends beyond money ordered by a court.
the terms obligated to pay by reason of the liability imposed upon the insured by law as appears here,and legally obligated to pay as appears in the insuring clause of the standard cgl policy analyzed by powerine i,are considered to have the same import.international surplus lines ins.devonshire coverage d,disapproved on other grounds in vandenberg superior court,supra,cal th,d,see also aiu ins.superior court cal d,legally obligated and obligated by law treated as similar.the phrases connote a legal obligation in the abstract or simpliciter powerine i,supra,cal th at,d.it is the addition of the words as damages that limits the legal obligation to sums ordered by a court.ibid.
however,unlike the general liability policies at issue in powerine i,the coverage provision here does not leave the word damages alone,but adds the term expenses.the use of both terms raises the inference that they were not intended to be synonymous.reserve insurance pisciotta cal d.by supplementing damages with expenses,the umbrella policies have created a category of indemnifiable costs separate and independent from damages and has thus extended its coverage beyond the limitation imposed were the term damages used alone.both literally and in its most ordinary and popular sense,the term expenses is other than damages see powerine i,supra,cal th at,d,and where it is a supplemental term in these central national policies,its addition enlarges the scope of coverage beyond the money ordered by a court declared in powerine 
in addition to including the term expenses to broaden the coverage beyond that provided by the word damages,the central national coverage provision defines both damages and expenses by reference to ultimate net loss.in turn,ultimate net loss is described as the total sum which powerine becomes obligated to pay by reason of property damage either through adjudication or compromise italics added.while adjudication implies a proceeding in a court,compromise,which the policy distinguishes from adjudication reserve insurance pisciotta,supra,cal d at,does not necessarily implicate a suit commenced by filing a complaint.a compromise may be reached before a complaint is ever filed.nor must a compromise be judicially approved.notably lacking from the policy language are words such as judicially approved,judicially sanctioned,or judicially ordered compromise.in its ordinary and popular sense,powerine i,supra,cal th at,d,a compromise is a settlement by arbitration or by consent reached by mutual concessions webster new internat.dict,italics added it is not necessarily the end result of litigation.a compromise may be reached in order to avert a lawsuit altogether.indeed,here we are told that the content of at least one cleanup and abatement order was the result of intensive negotiation between the water quality board and attorneys for powerine without resorting to the courts.as one order is the result of a compromise,our conclusion the cleanup orders would necessarily fall within the ambit of the central national policies coverage provision would comport with the objectively reasonable expectations of the insured.bank of the west superior court cal th,d.
moreover,the definition of ultimate net loss employs both the term suits and the word claims.a claim is not a suit,supra,cal th at,d.whereas the t erm suit has generally been replaced by the term action,which includes both actions at law and in equity,a claim the supreme court in explained,can be any number of things,none of which rise to the formal level of a suit while a claim may ultimately ripen into a suit,claim and suit are not synonymous.citations,supra,at,d,italics added,quoting from fireman fund ins.superior court th,d powerine i,supra,cal th at,d.rather,a claim,included here in the definition of ultimate net loss,can be the document used to initiate a wide variety of administrative proceedings citations,supra,at,d,italics added,quoting from fireman fund.ins.superior court,supra,th at,d.here the policies definition of damages and expenses includes costs of litigation,settlement,adjustment and investigation of claims and suits italics added.manifestly,coverage encompasses the expenses of suits,the expenditures of litigating an action brought in court,as well as the costs of claims,other activities that are not tantamount to litigation,supra,at,d,powerine i,supra,at,d.
the trial court below found the term expenses was intended to be those which arise in the course of that adjudication or compromise.it believed to interpret expenses to mean more would be to read into the contract three separate methods of determining expenses adjudication,compromise,and administrative action,while the policies only explicitly state the first two.however,we think the trial court artificially limited the meaning of expenses.in addition to sums fixed by adjudication,expenses includes money determined by compromise,and includes adjustment costs and other expenses to investigate claims and suits.the only limit on the meaning of expenses in the policies definition of ultimate net loss is the requirement that they be paid as a consequence of any occurrence covered hereunder under the policy,resolved by adjudication or settlement.italics added.referring to the insuring clause,because it identified all these categories of costs separately,the insured would reasonably understand that all of these categories of costs would be covered 
not only is the insuring clause made more expansive than merely money ordered by a court by virtue of its use of more types of losses,but consider also that the ultimate net loss provision contains a laundry list of costs joined together by phrases such as and shall also include,and all sums.that list includes expenses for doctors,lawyers,nurses and investigators and other persons,and for litigation,settlement,adjustment and investigation of claims and suits such list looks very much like the site investigation and cleanup expenses which may be characterized as environmental response costs.see transport indemnity cal th,fn,d,establishing when site investigation expenses are defense costs.where these words are utilized in the ultimate net loss provision,which itself is used to define the scope of coverage,then the costs of investigation,monitoring,and adjusting environmental agency cleanup and abatement orders would fall within the ambit of the policies coverage.
indeed,the powerine i court contrasted the terms damages and expenses,referring to the latter as those costs required by an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute for cleanup of a contaminated site.powerine i,supra,cal th at,d.also,costs incurred in remediation or abatement,but not prevention,of environmental pollution in response to a court order are sums the insured is legally obligated to pay as damages aiu ins.superior court,supra,cal d at,where the costs arise because of property damage within the meaning of the standard liability policy.id.at.costs incurred because of property damage under a general liability policy will include injunctive relief and damages ordered by a court to clean up pollution.id.at.it follows therefore,that costs incurred because of property damage,under these central national policies,include expenses powerine is obligated to pay by reason of the liability imposed by environmental cleanup and abatement orders outside of a lawsuit.see id.at.certainly nothing in the ordinary meaning of the phrase agrees to indemnify the insured for all sums which the insured shall be obligated to pay by reason of the liability imposed upon the insured by law for damages and expenses on account of or by reason of property damage excludes the expenses incurred in responding to and complying with administrative orders and regulations requiring it to clean up environmental pollution.
in sum,the straightforward and unambiguous meaning of the coverage provision here,with its attendant reference to ultimate net loss,interpreted in its ordinary and popular sense vandenberg superior court,supra,cal th at,d,expressly extends coverage beyond damages resulting from a lawsuit to embrace also those costs incurred in responding to orders requiring response,cleanup,and abatement of environmental pollution imposed outside the context of a lawsuit.the policies commit central national to indemnify for expenses and damages,which arise in the context of adjudication or compromise,and as claims and suits,all of which have distinct meanings,and are not limited to money ordered by a court in a lawsuit.the care these policies took to list all of these different kinds of costs indicates that the insurers differing rights and obligations with respect to suits and claims as well as expenses and damages were deliberately and intentionally articulated in the policies.citation,supra,cal th at,d.where cleanup and abatement costs are incurred because of property damage,they are thus covered occurrences under the policies.the purposeful inclusion of both the words expenses and claims indicates the discernible intent that the insurer be responsible in addition to the costs ordered by a court,for the costs incurred in responding to environmental orders initiated by administrative agencies.see aiu ins.superior court,supra,cal d at,fn,croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation,supra.
central national,however,views the ultimate net loss provision as serving one purpose only,namely,to burn limits croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation,whereby the indemnity limit is reduced dollar for dollar by defense costs until zero is reached and the duty to indemnify and the duty to defend are then terminated citation.transport indem,supra,cal th at,fn,d.central national and amici reason,where the ultimate net loss provision serves to consume indemnification limits,the clause can not also be employed to expand coverage.but,these central national policies lack a provision indicating the policies function as or burning limits contracts.see croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation,supra.had central national wanted to include a burning limits clause,it knew how to do so.in any event,regardless of what other purposes the ultimate net loss clause serves in these contracts,the clause is also utilized by the insuring provision to more fully define coverage its very words clearly define coverage more expansively than that set forth in the cgl policies scrutinized by powerine 
our conclusion that the indemnity provision is more expansive than that in the standard primary policies by covering losses incurred in responding to administrative agency orders without resort to a lawsuit is reinforced by examining the indemnification language in context,with regard to the policy as a whole.powerine i,supra,cal th at,d,bank of the west superior court,supra,cal th at,d.central national contention to the contrary notwithstanding,the policies at issue here are not solely intended to operate as excess insurance,following the form of the underlying policies adjudicated in and powerine i.according to the actual policy language wells fargo bank california ins.guarantee th,d,central national will also pay the excess of the amount of ultimate net loss in respect of each occurrence not covered by said underlying insurances.italics added.this limitation of liability provision allows the central national policies to function also as an umbrella policy providing alternative primary coverage as to losses not covered by the primary policy.reserve insurance pisciotta,supra,cal d at,century indemnity london underwriters th,fn,d.the umbrella language here may fill any gaps in coverage left open by the underlying coverage croskey,et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation,supra,at,such as the gap created by the decision in powerine i denying coverage under the primary policies for the costs of complying with administrative agency directives.the fact these central national policies also provide umbrella indemnity tells us that the insured would have expected the policies to grant broader coverage than that provided by the primary insurance.century indemnity london underwriters,supra,fn,d.our reading of the central national insuring clause to be more expansive than the primary insurance in powerine i gives effect to the mutual intent of the parties as evinced by the mechanism of umbrella insurance.bank of the west superior court,supra,at,d,century indemnity london underwriters,supra.
central national characterizes the policies here at issue as materially identical to and fundamentally indistinguishable in both language and function from the cgl policies at issue in powerine i.such an assertion ignores both the actual umbrella language of the policy and the purpose behind umbrella coverage.along these lines,central national and amici quote from the coverage provision only up to the word damages.based thereon,they insist because powerine i held that damages means only money ordered by a court,that powerine here is precluded by principles of law of the case and issue preclusion from arguing that damages could mean more.continuing,central national argues the mere fact the term damages is further defined by the ultimate net loss clause does not call for giving the term a meaning antithetical to the meaning adopted by the supreme court.
we are obviously bound by the powerine i decision definition of damages as stated in the cgl policies.auto equity sales,superior court cal d.yet,we must also consider the specific language of the central national policy at issue in the context of the broader purpose of the umbrella portion of the policy.bank of the west superior court,supra,cal th at,d.a reading that limits the coverage to damages,as that word was interpreted by powerine i,would require us to ignore wholesale phrases extant in these policies.to disregard the fact the policies more fully define expenses by reference to ultimate net loss,or that the latter clause provides an expansive delineation of the costs covered by the policy,would be to rewrite the entire coverage and ultimate net loss provisions.yet,we do not rewrite any provision of any contract,including the standard policy underlying any individual policy,for any purpose.citation.powerine i,supra,cal th at,d.
we are unpersuaded by central national argument premised on the loss payable provision.central national quotes from that provision that liability under the policy shall not attach unless and until the insured,or the insured underlying insurer,shall have paid the amount of the underlying limits on account of such occurrence.based on this wording,central national argues where the underlying policies only indemnify for damages in the form of money ordered by a court pursuant to powerine i,the loss payable condition evidences the same intent to cover damages arising in a judicial context or in a settlement reached with the insurer consent.however,the loss payable provision is a condition of coverage,not a limitation thereof,and can not be read to limit the indemnification obligation.see croskey,et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation,supra,as a general rule,conditions neither confer nor exclude coverage.
we believe our conclusion about the extent of coverage is the logical extension of and powerine i.we do not create patchwork distinctions based on slight differences in language between umbrella and cgl policies,as central national would have us believe.rather,we read the unequivocal language of the central national policies,which includes more terms than the primary insurance policies at issue in powerine i,to comport with the purpose behind the umbrella provision to indemnify for losses not covered by the primary insurances.in short,both the language and the purpose of these central national umbrella policies demonstrate the clear intent of the parties to make distinctions that are not slight.
having said this,the coverage provision in dispute here can not be fully analyzed without reference to the defense coverage endorsements to seven of the nine policies issued by central national between and these endorsements obligate central national to defend any suit against the insured alleging liability insured under the provisions of this policy and seeking damages on account thereof a s respects occurrences covered under this policy,but not covered under the underlying insurance or under any other collectible insurance central national a
