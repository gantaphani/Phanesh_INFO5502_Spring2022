the primary issue in this case is whether the electric cooperative corporation act ecca,particularly as amended in by house bill,act of may,ch.laws,allows a nonprofit electric cooperative to create and own a subsidiary propane business.see.the district court granted summary judgment declaring that hilco electric cooperative,could create and own hilco united services,which does business as hilco propane.the court of appeals reversed and remanded,holding that the ecca prohibits electric cooperatives from creating and owning such companies.although we disagree with the breadth of the court of appeals holding,we affirm its judgment.
we hold that the hilco companies failed to establish conclusively that the creation and ownership of a propane business furthered a proper purpose for a cooperative created under the ecca.accordingly,the court of appeals correctly reversed the trial court summary judgment for the hilco companies.we also hold,however,that the ecca entitles an electric cooperative to create and own a company if necessary,convenient,or appropriate to effectuate the act permitted purposes rural electrification or purposes like those listed in article a of the act.
background 
the texas legislature enacted the ecca in to promote rural electrification through the creation of electric cooperatives.state ex rel.gas upshur rural coop.hilco electric was formed under the ecca to engage in rural electrification and currently provides electricity to rural cooperative members in hill county,dallas county,ellis county,and mclennan county.hilco electric also owns percent of the shares of hilco propane,a texas corporation that sells and delivers propane gas to the general public for a profit.
midlothian butane gas company,rodney jenkins,lynn gray,sam crain,don duke,and david heald collectively,midlothian,and a number of other companies and individuals sued hilco electric and hilco propane.all of the present plaintiffs are hilco electric members and some are propane dealers who compete with hilco propane.midlothian sought a judgment declaring that neither hilco electric nor hilco propane had the statutory authority to engage in the propane sales business and permanently enjoining both hilco companies from selling and distributing propane.the hilco companies responded that state law,including the ecca,as amended in by,authorized hilco electric to create and own a company such as hilco propane.
midlothian moved for summary judgment.the hilco companies responded and filed a for summary judgment.the district court denied midlothian motion for summary judgment and granted the hilco companies,declaring that texas law,including the ecca and,permits hilco electric cooperative,to create and own corporations,including hilco united services,hilco propane,and that did not violate the rule of article iii,section of the texas constitution.
on appeal,the court addressed the question of whether an electric cooperative company can create and own a company under the ecca.at.the court held that electric cooperatives are prohibited from creating and owning companies.id.the court of appeals reversed the trial court judgment and remanded the cause to that court for further proceedings.id.at.because of the court of appeals disposition of the statutory construction issue,it did not reach the constitutional question.id.at.
we granted hilco petition for review to determine whether the ecca permits an electric cooperative to engage in a business without regard to the purposes for which the cooperative exercises its powers.january.
discussion 
the parties dispute centers on the purposes and powers specified in the ecca,as amended by.the hilco companies assert that,because the amendment expanded the purposes for which electric cooperatives could be organized,such cooperatives may create and own subsidiaries like hilco propane,as long as such ownership furthers any lawful purpose.midlothian contends that did not expand electric cooperatives purposes and powers beyond permitting them to use unclaimed funds for certain charitable or nonprofit purposes.alternatively,midlothian asserts that,if enlarged electric cooperatives purposes and powers,then the bill unconstitutionally encompassed more than one subject.const.art.iii.
the powers of electric cooperatives are solely derived from,and therefore measured by,the act which created them.upshur rural coop,at.the ecca states that the act is complete in itself and is controlling.to frame the parties arguments,then,we briefly review the ecca provisions establishing electric cooperative corporations purposes and powers in the original act and in.
section of the ecca,entitled purpose,provided that electric cooperatives could be organized for the purpose of engaging in rural electrification.act of march,ch.laws.section granted electric cooperatives certain powers,including the right to purchase and own any and all real and personal property,and all powers as may be necessary,convenient,or appropriate to effectuate the purpose for which the corporation is organized.id.laws at.in,the legislature amended slightly the purpose provision but still authorized ecca cooperatives to engage in rural electrification.act of may,ch.laws.
these statutes were published as article of the texas revised civil statutes.they were repealed in when the legislature promulgated the texas utilities code.act of may,ch.laws.the statute codifying the utilities code does not contain an express statement of the purposes for which an electric cooperative may be organized,but,generally,codification intends no substantive change.id.laws at.consequently,under the statute codifying the texas utilities code,rural electrification remained the only purpose for which an electric cooperative could be organized.
house bill 
the same legislature that repealed article of texas revised civil statutes passed,entitled an act relating to the disposition of unclaimed funds by nonprofit cooperative corporations.act of may,ch.laws,prior to,electric cooperatives and other nonprofit corporations were required to forward unclaimed funds to the state treasurer now the comptroller.see.amended the property code to grant specified nonprofit corporations the express power to use unclaimed funds for rural scholarship and rural economic development purposes.apparently to facilitate that goal,also amended the agriculture code,the texas corporation act,and the cooperative association act to give the nonprofit corporations governed by those acts the power to deliver money to a scholarship fund for rural students.agric.code a.stat.ann.
with respect to electric cooperative corporations,amended the powers provision of the ecca to give them the power 
t o do and perform,either for itself or its members,or for any other corporation organized under this act,or for the members thereof,any and all acts and things,and to have and exercise any and all powers as may be necessary,convenient,or appropriate to effectuate the purpose for which the corporation is organized,including other or additional purposes benefitting members and nonmembers,whether directly or through affiliates,described in section a,article,texas corporation act article,vernon texas civil statutes.
emphasis in original to indicate additions now codified at.section a of article of the act provides 
except as hereinafter in this article expressly excluded herefrom,corporations may be organized under this act for any lawful purpose or purposes,which purposes shall be fully stated in the articles of incorporation.such purpose or purposes may include,without being limited to,any one or more of the following charitable,benevolent,religious,eleemosynary,patriotic,civic,missionary,educational,scientific,social,fraternal,athletic,aesthetic,agricultural and horticultural and the conduct of professional,commercial,industrial,or trade associations and animal husbandry.subject to the provisions of chapter,title,of the revised civil statutes of texas,and of such chapter or any part thereof as it may hereafter be amended,a corporation may be organized under this act if any one or more of its purposes for the conduct of its affairs in this state is to organize laborers,working men,or wage earners to protect themselves in their various pursuits.
stat.ann.a footnote omitted.
the hilco companies argue that because,section refers to article a of the act,and that statute provides that corporations organized under the act may be organized for any lawful purpose,then electric cooperatives may also be organized for any lawful purpose,notwithstanding the more restrictive enumeration of purposes at the heart of section a.to decide this issue,we must examine more closely.
although stated in terms of powers,section extends electric cooperatives permissible purposes to those described in section a,article,texas act.the purposes described in section a include a general classification any lawful purpose followed by a list of specific,permitted purposes charitable,benevolent,religious,eleemosynary,patriotic,civic,missionary,educational,scientific,social,fraternal,athletic,aesthetic,agricultural and horticultural and the conduct of professional,commercial,industrial,or trade associations and animal husbandry,as well as organiz ing laborers,working men,or wage earners to protect themselves in their various pursuits.stat.ann.a.this list of permissible purposes comports with express intent to promote rural educational opportunities and rural economic development 
if,as the hilco companies contend,the legislature objective was to allow electric cooperatives to engage in any lawful purpose,the legislature could have easily said so in,section itself.because it did not do so,we reject the hilco companies contention that section a reference to any lawful purpose establishes the legislature intent to expand infinitely the purposes for which electric cooperatives can be organized.instead,we apply the rule of ejusdem generis,which provides that when words of a general nature are used in connection with the designation of particular objects or classes of persons or things,the meaning of the general words will be restricted to the particular designation.carr rogers,see also cleveland united states.under the ejusdem generis rule of construction,the general words are confined to the class and may not be used to enlarge it.thus,we hold that the phrase any lawful purpose,in the context of the ecca reference to section a,is limited to purposes similar in kind or class to the identified categories 
this interpretation is consistent with the language of.we find no indication that the legislature intended to expand the purposes for which a corporation may be organized under the ecca from rural electrication to any lawful purpose that fertile minds can fathom.amended the ecca powers provision to allow an electric cooperative to use its powers to effectuate those purposes described in section a of the act.the expansion of electric cooperatives permissible purposes beyond rural electrification,the listed purposes,and purposes of the same nature as those listed must be achieved through the legislative process and not indirectly by a strained interpretation of the statute words.we conclude that under the ecca,as modified by,electric cooperatives may be formed for rural electrification purposes and may exercise their powers to effectuate that purpose,the purposes specifically described in the texas act,article a,and purposes of the same kind or class as those described therein.
we disagree,however,with midlothian contention and the court of appeals interpretation that the limitation on electric cooperatives purposes necessarily precludes them from engaging in any economic endeavor.at.the court of appeals inquiry did not distinguish between an ecca corporation purposes and the scope of its powers to accomplish those purposes.the ecca grants electric cooperatives all the powers that are necessary,convenient,or appropriate to accomplish the cooperative purposes,whether benefitting members or nonmembers,or whether accomplished directly or through affiliates.they may acquire,own,hold,maintain,exchange or use property or an interest in property,as necessary,convenient,or useful.id.there is nothing in the ecca that,per se,precludes ownership of an interest in a enterprise,provided that such activity is necessary,convenient,or appropriate to the cooperative authorized purposes.
in their motion for summary judgment,the hilco companies did not argue that ownership and operation of hilco propane was necessary,convenient,or appropriate to rural electrification,those purposes described in article a of the act,or purposes of the same general nature as those listed.rather,hilco sought judgment on the grounds that the ecca,as amended by,authorized an electric cooperative to engage in any lawful activity.because the hilco companies did not establish that the creation and ownership of a propane business was necessary,convenient,or appropriate to a proper purpose under the ecca,the case should be remanded.
accordingly,we affirm the court of appeals judgment reversing the trial court judgment and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.in light of our disposition of the first issue,we do not reach the respondents argument that violates the texas constitution rule.
while i agree that this case must be remanded to the trial court,i write to set out my understanding of the reasons for doing so,which i think are the same as the court.
since it was first enacted in,the texas electric cooperative corporation act has enumerated certain powers of electric cooperative corporations and then added a catchall provision,which the parties have referred to as subsection,that a cooperative use the current statutory language that has remained essentially unchanged over the years 
perform any other acts for the cooperative or its members or for another electric cooperative or its members,and exercise any other power,that may be necessary,convenient,or appropriate to accomplish the purpose for which the cooperative is organized 
the operative phrase necessary,convenient,or appropriate is a broad one.the word necessary may mean indispensable or much less,as chief justice marshall observed 
if reference be had to its use,in the common affairs of the world,or in approved authors,we find that necessary frequently imports no more than that one thing is convenient,or useful,or essential to another.to employ the means necessary to an end,is generally understood as employing any means calculated to produce the end,and not as being confined to those single means,without which the end would be entirely unattainable 
black law dictionary defines necessary and proper as appropriate and well adapted to fulfilling an objective.convenient means suited to the needs or the circumstances of a particular situation combined,the three words describe a very general power on which the provision imposes two restrictions it must be exercised for an electric cooperative or its members,and it must be exercised to accomplish the cooperative organizing is,to provide for rural electrification 
the ecca was amended in by house bill to add to the end of the catchall provision this clause 
including other or additional purposes benefiting members and nonmembers,whether directly or through affiliates,described in section a,article,texas corporation act article,vernon texas civil statutes 
except as provided by this clause,the texas corporation act does not apply to electric cooperatives hb was titled,relating to the disposition of unclaimed funds by nonprofit cooperative corporations and to that end it amended four statutes besides the ecca and added a section to the property code.
about the time hb passed,petitioner hilco electric cooperative,an electric cooperative corporation organized and operating under the ecca,formed a corporation,hilco united services,doing business as hilco propane,as a subsidiary to market propane.within weeks,six of hilco electric members including four competitors of hilco propane,respondents in this court,sued both corporations collectively,hilco,alleging that the ecca did not authorize hilco electric to own and operate a corporation hilco answered that its actions were permitted by state law the plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on their all
