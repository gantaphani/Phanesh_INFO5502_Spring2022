factual and procedural background 
the creation of the limited partnership 
inge realty company was founded in by brothers robert and oliver inge.it engaged in the business of buying and selling properties and renting properties it owned to tenants.
in september robert and oliver retained gibson,dunn to advise them regarding the best way to restructure their successful business then operating as a real estate trust to minimize income tax liabilities and to implement the succession plan that robert and oliver desired.according to the robert inge family members,during the initial meeting and thereafter,robert and oliver explained they wanted inge realty company to continue as a enterprise after they could no longer run the business.
gibson,dunn recommended the brothers business be converted to a limited partnership with robert and oliver serving as general partners.on september,gibson,dunn partner gordon schaller sent a draft limited partnership agreement to robert and oliver with a cover letter stating,the basic function of this agreement is to allow you to continue the operations of inge realty company in a structure with less tax risks than a trust and more flexibility for purposes of gifting interests and operation in the event of your deaths.
a final form of the partnership agreement,dated october,was executed in october.robert and oliver were each named general partners each held a percent interest in the partnership and each had an equal right to run the business.the oliver inge trust and the robert inge trust were each given a percent limited partnership interest in the business.
paragraph of the partnership agreement provided,the term of this partnership shall commence on the effective date of this agreement,and,unless extended by agreement of all of the partners or terminated earlier pursuant to this agreement,shall continue until december.
paragraph of the partnership agreement provided,in part,anything in this agreement to the contrary notwithstanding,the general partners shall have no authority,without the unanimous vote of the limited partners,to f after the death,retirement or insanity of a general partner,to continue the business of the partnership with partnership property,except as is provided in this agreement.
paragraph of the partnership agreement provided,in part,the partnership shall be dissolved upon the happening of any of the following events a the death,disability,insanity,incompetency,dissolution,bankruptcy,retirement,resignation or expulsion of all of the general partners.
paragraph of the partnership agreement provided,in part,notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in this agreement,upon the death of any of the general partners,the following provisions shall control a if either oliver inge oliver or robert inge robert predeceases the other such predeceasing partner being referred to as the deceased brother,the deceased brother interest as a general partner shall be converted to an interest as a limited partner b upon the death of the survivor of robert and oliver,each of the limited partners hereby agrees that,if so requested by either of robert or oliver respective surviving wives,they shall vote to continue the partnership on the same terms and conditions as are contained in this agreement and elect such requesting wife or wives as the sole successor general partner s of the partnership.either such surviving wife may make such a request by delivering to each of the partners a written notice stating the same within thirty days after the death of the survivor of robert and oliver.
oliver death,the probate action and the issue of involuntary dissolution 
oliver died on february,and robert became the sole general partner of inge realty company.according to oliver estate plan,his assets were held in the oliver inge trust upon his death.bank of the west,which had been substituted for robert as successor trustee of the oliver inge trust shortly before oliver death,also became executor of oliver estate.
the primary asset in the oliver inge trust was its now percent limited partnership interest in the inge realty company,which was valued at approximately million.the trust and the estate,however,did not have sufficient liquid assets to pay the million in estate taxes and other related expenses and bequests made by oliver,which exceeded million.the robert inge family members were advised that if oliver trust were unable to timely pay the taxes due,the internal revenue service might impose a forced dissolution of the partnership.
following oliver death,bank of the west made demands for partnership income distributions from inge realty company on behalf of oliver trust.the demands were refused,apparently on the ground that oliver had impermissibly amended his trust beginning in late by adding family members as beneficiaries and that distributions from inge realty company to family members were not authorized.then,in april bank of the west initiated a probate action a petition for instructions that ultimately sought,among other things,dissolution of the partnership in part pursuant to former corporations code section,subdivision b,because robert had allegedly engaged in pervasive fraud and abuse of authority by not authorizing distributions to bank of the west as trustee of oliver trust and in part on the ground the partnership had dissolved under the terms of paragraph of the partnership agreement because robert was now disabled incompetent to act in the business of inge realty,leaving no general partner to run the business according to the robert inge family members,at the time sophia,robert wife,was prepared to run the company.
the robert inge family members were named as respondents in the bank of the west probate action.they assert they were advised by their lawyers that drafting problems with the partnership agreement presented a real risk that bank of the west would succeed in effecting a dissolution of the partnership and that settlement of the probate action was therefore advisable.robert died in october,but the probate action continued bank of the west did not concede the propriety of sophia assumption of the role of general partner.the parties to the probate action eventually settled their various disputes in.the court approved the settlement on december.
the robert inge family members legal malpractice action 
in december the robert inge family members entered into tolling agreements with gibson,dunn regarding claims that might be asserted regarding the law firm legal representation of inge realty company and its partners,and in particular,with respect to advice concerning,and the drafting of,the october,limited partnership agreement.those tolling agreements were renewed or extended through june.
the robert inge family members filed a complaint on june,a first amended complaint on december,and a second amended complaint on may,asserting claims against gibson,dunn for professional negligence,breach of fiduciary duty and negligent infliction of emotional distress.the second amended complaint alleges,in part,robert and oliver primary goal in retaining gibson,dunn in was to preserve and protect inge realty company as a family business and to ensure it remained at all times in the inge family.yet,under the terms of the partnership agreement as drafted by gibson,dunn,there was no provision for the limited partnership to continue except upon the death of both general partners.in particular,there was no mechanism in the agreement for the continuation of the partnership if the sole remaining partner was incompetent or disabled or retired.according to the second amended complaint,the robert inge family members reasonably believed there was a likelihood robert could be found to be incompetent disabled retired after bank of the west asserted in mid he was largely incapacitated by a stroke and no longer active in the operation of the business and,as a result of gibson,dunn negligent drafting of the provisions of the partnership agreement relating to succession and termination,the partnership would terminate by operation of law.the robert inge family members further allege,because of these drafting deficiencies and risk of partnership dissolution,inge realty company was not in a position to assert necessary claims against bank of the west in the probate action or to vigorously defend the claims made by the bank.
the second amended complaint alleges the robert inge family members were damaged by the negligent drafting of the partnership agreement in three essential respects legal fees were paid to gibson,dunn for the preparation of a partnership agreement that did not accomplish the express goal of the representation because it did not provide a mechanism for the continuation of the partnership except upon the death of both general partners or upon the unanimous consent of all limited partners.the robert inge family members were forced to defend and settle a meritless lawsuit a settlement that required liquidation of assets obtaining of financing to purchase the limited partnership interest held by oliver trust,as well as lifetime payments to recipients who claimed to be beneficiaries of oliver trust.legal fees were paid to lawyers other than gibson,dunn to defend against claims made by bank of the west in the probate action,including claims directly related to the issue of succession and termination of the partnership.
gibson,dunn motion for summary judgment the trial court ruling 
gibson,dunn answered the unverified second amended complaint in august.the answer expressly asserted as a separate and additional defense that each cause of action in the complaint was barred by the limitations period set forth in code of civil procedure section,subdivision a section a.
on july,gibson,dunn moved for summary judgment.the motion asserted the robert inge family members claims are time barred pursuant to section a gibson,dunn did not breach any duty of care to its clients when it drafted the partnership agreement and gibson,dunn alleged negligent conduct did not cause the robert inge family members to suffer any damages.with respect to the application of section a to the claims,gibson,dunn noted that,absent tolling,the limitations period for a claim of legal practice expired no later than october four years after the partnership agreement was drafted and executed.no tolling occurred under section a,gibson,dunn then argued,because the robert inge family members suffered an actual injury upon execution of the partnership agreement that is,when robert and oliver entered into a contract that set forth their legal rights and altered their legal relationship to each other.moreover,gibson,dunn continued,both robert and oliver suffered an additional actual injury in october in the form of attorney fees paid to gibson,dunn,which the robert inge family members seek to recover in their lawsuit on the theory the amount paid exceeded the value of the services provided.
in its moving papers gibson,dunn also pointed to undisputed facts that demonstrated the firm did not continue to represent robert or the robert inge family members regarding the subject matter of the malpractice claim after october,thus precluding tolling under a continuous representation theory.with respect to its argument concerning the absence of loss causation,gibson,dunn contended undisputed facts established that the settlement of the probate action was unaffected by the purported flaws regarding succession in the partnership agreement.
in their opposition papers the robert inge family members argued,in part,no actual injury occurred as a result of gibson,dunn negligent drafting of the partnership agreement until,at the earliest,april,when the succession problems first came to light as a result of bank of the west claim robert was disabled incompetent and the partnership,therefore,was dissolved under the terms of the agreement.because of the tolling agreements thereafter entered by gibson,dunn and the robert inge family members,the lawsuit,filed on june,was timely.the opposition papers also asserted material issues of fact existed with respect to breach and loss causation.
after further briefing and oral argument,on october,the trial court granted gibson,dunn motion on the ground the action is barred by the statute of limitations.as set forth in its tentative ruling,which was provided to the parties and which the court then adopted as its order,defendant met its initial burden of showing that the statute of limitations ran no later than,and plaintiffs have failed to raise a triable issue of material fact re tolling due to lack of actual injury.the court also stated,defendant provides evidence in moving papers that it did not continue to represent plaintiffs from through the probate litigation.plaintiffs fail to address this argument in opposition.plaintiffs therefore fail to meet their burden showing that the doctrine of continued representation tolls the statute of limitations.because its ruling on the limitations issue was dispositive,the court declined to rule on the other grounds asserted in support of the motion for summary judgment.
contentions 
the robert inge family members contend neither execution of the partnership agreement nor payment of fees to gibson,dunn to prepare the partnership agreement constitutes actual injury under section a sufficient to trigger the limitations period.gibson,dunn contends,even if summary judgment was not properly granted on the ground the action is time barred,the judgment should be affirmed because the robert inge family members can not prove loss causation.

a.the limitations period for legal malpractice claims jordache and the meaning of actual injury 
a cause of action for legal malpractice must be filed within one year after the plaintiff discovers,or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered,the facts constituting the wrongful act or omission,or four years from the date of the wrongful act or omission,whichever occurs first.a.however,section a further provides,i n no event shall the time for commencement of legal action exceed four years except that the period shall be tolled during the time that any of the following exist the plaintiff has not sustained actual injury 
gibson,dunn alleged malpractice occurred in september and october when it prepared the inge realty company limited partnership agreement containing the allegedly defective succession and termination provisions and,more particularly,omitted any method for replacement of the general partners if they became incompetent or retired.gibson,dunn asserts,and the robert inge family members do not dispute,that the absence of a comprehensive succession plan and the consequent threat of immediate dissolution in the event the surviving general partner became disabled and ceased being active in the business could have been discovered through the use of reasonable diligence at the time the partnership agreement was finalized and executed.accordingly,the robert inge family members legal malpractice action was untimely if they suffered actual injury within the meaning of section a more than one year prior to december when they entered into formal tolling agreements with gibson,dunn regarding the claims asserted in this lawsuit 
our analysis of this question,as both the robert inge family members and gibson,dunn recognize,focuses on jordache enterprises,brobeck,phleger harrison cal th,d,jordache,the leading and most recent case in which the supreme court addressed the meaning of the term actual injury in section a.the jordache court held,in brief,actual injury occurs when the client suffers any loss or injury legally cognizable as damages in a legal malpractice action based on the asserted errors or omissions s ection,subdivision a,will not toll the limitations period once the client can plead damages that could establish a cause of action for legal malpractice.jordache,at,d.
in jordache the defendant law firm had allegedly failed to advise its clients they had insurance coverage for the defense of a significant,lawsuit.after replacing the original law firm for other reasons,the clients sued their liability insurers for million in attorney fees and costs paid to defend the original litigation.that coverage action was ultimately settled for million,a compromise based at least in part on the potential success of the carriers late notice defense to their contractual obligation to pay fees and costs for the underlying suit.jordache,supra,cal th at,d.
the clients then sued their original law firm for negligence,seeking to recover the additional million in defense costs they felt should have been covered by insurance.the law firm argued the malpractice claim was time barred,contending their former clients had sustained actual injury when they were required to pay defense costs in the underlying litigation,diverting investment funds that otherwise could have been used to earn profits,or when they lost the benefit of the insurance policies for which they had paid during the period before they tendered the defense of the underlying action to the insurance carriers.the clients responded they had not suffered actual injury until forced to settle for less than the full defense costs.the trial court granted summary judgment the court of appeal reversed,concluding whether the law firm omissions impaired the clients interests in the benefits of its insurance policies was contingent on the outcome of the insurance coverage action.jordache,supra,cal th at,d.the supreme court reversed the appellate court in a comprehensive opinion,holding the clients had sustained actual injury within the meaning of section a before the settlement of the insurance coverage litigation.id.at,d.
the court began by summarizing its earlier holdings in adams paul cal th,d,determining actual injury is predominantly a factual inquiry actual injury may occur without any prior adjudication,judgment,or settlement nominal damages,speculative harm,and the mere threat of future harm are not actual injury and the relevant consideration is the fact of damage,not the amount.jordache,supra,cal th at,d.it then reiterated that the actual injury tolling provision in section a derived from the court decision in budd nixen cal d,budd recognized that actual loss or damage resulting from the professional negligence was an essential element of a cause of action in tort for professional negligence.citation.thus,budd held that the statute of limitations began to run when the plaintiff sustained loss or damage from the attorney negligence that allowed the plaintiff to assert a malpractice cause of action.citation.in section terms,the limitations period that commences when the plaintiff actually or constructively discovers the attorney wrongful act or omission is no longer tolled after the plaintiff sustains actual injury,when the plaintiff can plead a legal malpractice cause of action.budd remains instructive on the test for actual injury if the allegedly negligent conduct does not cause damage,it generates no cause of action in tort.citation.the mere breach of a professional duty,causing only nominal damages,speculative harm,or threat of future harm not yet realized does not suffice to create a cause of action for negligence.citations.hence,until the client suffers appreciable harm as a consequence of the attorney negligence,the client can not establish a cause of action for malpractice.jordache,at,d.
while instructing that a n existing injury is not contingent or speculative simply because future events may affect its permanency or the amount of monetary damages eventually incurred jordache,supra,cal th at,d,the jordache court also emphasized the need to distinguish between an actual,existing injury that might be remedied or reduced in the future,and a speculative or contingent injury that might or might not arise in the future.see adams paul,supra,cal th at,d,t he fact of damage rather than the amount is the relevant consideration.citation.in addition,the character or quality of the injury must be manifest and palpable.the court further cautioned,t here are no short cut bright line rules for determining actual injury under section.citations.instead,actual injury issues require examination of the particular facts of each case in light of the alleged wrongful act or omission.jordache,at,fn,d.
applying these principles to the undisputed facts before it,the court held the clients had sustained actual injury by the time they had discovered with the assistance of new counsel their original law firm negligence in not notifying their insurers of the underlying litigation by then,jordache had lost millions of dollar both in unpaid insurance benefits for defense costs in the marciano action and in lost profits from diversion of investment funds to pay these defense costs.as brobeck asserts,these damages were sufficiently manifest,nonspeculative,and mature that jordache tried to recover them as damages in its insurance coverage suits.jordache,supra,cal th at,d.
gibson,dunn allegedly negligent drafting of the partnership agreement caused only speculative or contingent harm or a threat of future harm before robert became disabled 
citing hensley caietti th,d,radovich locke paddon th,d and several other cases holding actual injury occurred when an agreement dividing marital property or other form of settlement agreement was signed because the parties legal relations were altered at that point,gibson,dunn argues the robert inge family members suffered actual injury as a result of its allegedly negligent drafting of the succession and termination provisions of the partnership agreement when the agreement was signed by robert and oliver and became the governing document for their real estate business.although acknowledging the partnership agreement became effective in october,the robert inge family members contend they suffered no actual injury until april,when bank of the west first made its claim that,due to robert disability and supposed incompetence,the partnership could be dissolved.simply put,the question is whether in october the allegedly defective succession provisions in the partnership agreement caused an actual,existing injury that might be remedied or reduced in the future for example,by amending the partnership agreement while both general partners were still alive or a speculative or contingent injury that might or might not arise in the future.see jordache,supra,cal th at,d,speculative and contingent injuries are those that do not yet exist,as when an attorney error creates only a potential for harm in the future.
without question,a party alteration of its legal position in reliance on its counsel can constitute actual injury even though the party may be able to avoid or reduce the injury through subsequent legal action.for example,in hensley caietti,supra,th,d the plaintiff,joyce hensley,alleged her former attorney had committed malpractice by inducing her to enter into an unfavorable marital settlement agreement,which the trial court approved and stated on the record was effective immediately.id.at,d.the judgment incorporating the stipulated agreement,however,was not entered until sometime later.in the interim,hensley and her former counsel argued about the proposed judgment,with hensley insisting she had been unaware of the terms of the stipulation presented to the court.ibid.
the court of appeal affirmed the trial court order granting summary judgment on the ground the action was time barred,rejecting hensley contention she had not sustained actual injury until the effective date of the judgment negligent legal advice which induces a client to enter into a binding contract resolving marital property and support issues results in actual injury at the point of entry.entering a contract is a jural act which alters the legal relations of the parties and creates an obligation.hensley caietti,supra,th at,d.
similarly in radovich locke paddon,supra,th,d,a husband claimed his attorneys had negligently caused him to sign documents waiving his community property rights in various assets,but asserted their wrongful conduct did not cause him injury until his wife death in,many years later,when the community property was divided.adopting the analysis of hensley caietti,supra,th,d and turley wooldridge d.the court of appeal explained that,but for those waivers,during his marriage radovich would have had a present,existing and equal interest in the affected community property,and that property would have been subject in varying measure to his control and disposition and to application to his debts.radovich,at,d.each of these considerations would have been of real and immediate benefit to radovich t hroughout the years of the marriage,and it follows that the agreement by which he ostensibly relinquished any right in the decedent acquisitions caused him immediate and actual injury throughout the same years.ibid.the radovich court further held the fact that the husband had remedied some of his losses by filing litigation against third parties did not mean actual injury did not occur once he signed the documents o nce actual injury has been found,the fact the injury is not irremediable is of no consequence to the section issues.id.at,d.
significantly,in each of these cases not only the agreement itself,but also the specific provisions that adversely impacted the former client of the allegedly negligent attorney,were effective immediately hensley lost certain rights to support and property when the stipulated marital settlement agreement was approved by the court radovich lost his community property interest in his wife assets when he signed the prenuptial agreement.a somewhat different situation was presented in foxborough van atta th,d foxborough a case relied upon by both the robert inge family members and gibson,dunn which involved alleged attorney negligence in connection with a sophisticated real estate transaction in which the attorney failed to secure for his client an unrestricted right,without time constraints,to annex the subsequent development of a property to an existing apartment complex.
foxborough owned two adjoining parcels of land in san jose.one parcel was a unit apartment complex the apartments the smaller parcel was undeveloped.from november through january,foxborough retained van atta to perform legal services concerning the two parcels.van atta was to assist in converting the apartments into condominiums,transferring the apartments to daon corporation daon in a property exchange,and securing the right to develop the smaller parcel with condominiums that foxborough could automatically annex to the apartments without the approval of daon or the owners of condominiums in the apartments.the automatic annexation right,without time constraints,was of particular importance to foxborough.foxborough,supra,th at,d.van atta failed to obtain the automatic annexation right because,notwithstanding language in the parties agreement,a regulation required that any automatic annexation of land to an existing condominium take place within three years after approval of the preceding phase of the development.ibid.foxborough learned of this failure no later than february.id.at,d.foxborough subsequently sued daon for failing to inform it of the limitation on its annexation right,but the daon litigation was unsuccessful.on march,foxborough lost its case and was ordered to pay daon attorney fees and costs.ibid.
foxborough brought suit against van atta on june,alleging van atta had failed to advise foxborough of the existence and effect of the regulation or to advise foxborough how automatic annexation otherwise could have been accomplished.foxborough,supra,th at,d.the trial court granted summary judgment based on the statute of limitations.id.at,d.on appeal foxborough contended its action was not time barred because it did not suffer actual injury until it lost the daon litigation.id.at,d.the court of appeal rejected that argument,explaining,though van atta alleged negligence may have contributed to the daon litigation judgment,that judgment was but the last in time of the alleged injuries.id.at,d.instead,the court held foxborough had sustained actual injury when the initial annexation period expired and he could no longer automatically annex the new project to the apartment complex.w hen malpractice results in the loss of a right,remedy,or interest,or in the imposition of liability,there has been actual injury regardless of whether future events may affect the permanency of the injury or the amount of monetary damages eventually incurred.id.at,d.
in light of the later decision in jordache,supra,cal th,d,the court of appeal conclusion that foxborough had sustained actual injury well before losing the daon litigation is unexceptional what is striking for our purposes,however,is that the appellate court did not hold there was actual injury when all documentation for the real estate transaction was completed in and foxborough right to automatic annexation was limited to three years that is,it lost any right to annexation without time constraints.rather,actual injury was first sustained in may when the period for annexation had expired.as the court explained,during the period that foxborough could have effected an automatic annexation under the pertinent regulation citation,van atta alleged negligence created only the potential for harm,because foxborough could have proceeded with the development and annexation.but when the period for automatic annexation expired on may,foxborough lost the right it had retained van atta to secure.foxborough,supra,th at,d.
so,too,in the case at bar,gibson,dunn alleged negligence in drafting the succession and termination provisions in the partnership agreement created only a potential for harm prior to oliver death and the onset of robert purportedly disabling physical and mental condition.if robert had survived oliver death and then died himself while fully engaged in managing inge realty company as its sole general partner,paragraph b of the limited partnership agreement would have governed and sophia,robert surviving spouse,could have been elected as the successor general partner.in that event,the partnership would have continued on the same terms and conditions as before,and gibson,dunn alleged negligence in failing to provide a succession plan in the event of the retirement or incapacity of the surviving general partner would have never ripened into actual injury in effect,the robert inge family members would have been in the same situation as foxborough had he effected an automatic annexation during the period provided by the governing regulations.in both cases the fact future rights were compromised by written agreements constituted only contingent or speculative harm until such time as the absence of those rights had some meaningful effect.see adams paul,supra,cal th at,d,citing case holding negligent preparation of trust documents did not cause actual damage until trust was challenged and plaintiffs were forced to pay legal fees to defend them for proposition that actual loss of the underlying remedy may remain contingent,that is,the attorney negligence may have created only the potential for future harm see also fritz ehrmann th,d actual injury not sustained at time attorney negligently prepared second promissory note,which failed to specify that deferred interest was to be repaid at the end of the note term injury was speculative at the time of the preparation of the note the borrowers might have paid the deferred interest in accord with the parties original understanding without regard to any ambiguity in the second note.
once robert became incapacitated,however,paragraph of the partnership agreement appeared to require dissolution of the limited partnership and nothing in paragraph,which authorizes continuation of the partnership only upon the death of the surviving general partner,permitted his spouse to succeed him as a general partner or otherwise allowed the partnership to operate as a enterprise.at that point sometime in the first few months of the robert inge family members suffered actual injury as a result of gibson,dunn allegedly improper preparation of the limited partnership agreement see foxborough,supra,th at,d actual injury was sustained when foxborough lost the right it had retained van atta to secure,even though the full amount of damages assuming there was negligence at all could not then be determined.see jordache,supra,cal th at,d,the loss or diminution of a right or remedy constitutes injury or damage.citation.neither uncertainty of amount nor difficulty of proof renders that injury speculative or inchoate.
even if robert was not,in fact,disabled or incapacitated prior to his death on october,the robert inge family members nonetheless suffered actual injury when bank of the west,as oliver trustee,claimed his condition permitted it to force the dissolution of the limited partnership and the robert inge family members were required to incur attorney fees to respond to that claim.as in sindell gibson,dunn crutcher th,d,the mere fact of such litigation is the unwanted consequence hence,the actual injury for which the allegedly negligent lawyers are responsible 
our conclusion the robert inge family members first sustained actual injury either when robert disability triggered the dissolution provisions in paragraph or when they incurred legal fees to respond to bank of the west attempts to terminate the partnership,not when the limited partnership agreement became effective in october,is reinforced by the analysis in truong glasser th,d.in truong vision manufacturing,and its president steven truong collectively referred to in the opinion as vmi,with the advice of vmi attorney bruce glasser,entered into a real property lease for vmi manufacturing operation in late october.disputes about the condition of the property resulted in a lease addendum in december,which resolved certain of the problems and contained a mutual waiver of claims.still dissatisfied with the lessor performance vmi sued the lessor in march new counsel,not glasser,represented vmi in the litigation.judgment was entered against vmi in august,and the lessor was awarded more than in attorney fees.id.at,d.vmi sued glasser for malpractice in september,alleging glasser had been negligent in the advice he gave concerning the lease for the property and the lease addendum.id.at,d.the trial court granted glasser motion for summary judgment,finding the malpractice action was time barred.the court of appeal rejected vmi contention it did not sustain actual injury until it lost the underlying litigation with the lessor and affirmed the trial court order granting summary judgment plaintiffs first sustained actual injury when they were required to obtain and pay new counsel to file a lawsuit seeking to escape the consequences of their signing the lease and lease addendum.id.at,d.
in light of the parties tolling agreements,it appears the exact date of actual injury in this case whether when robert became disabled if he did or when bank of the west first sought dissolution of the partnership based on paragraph of the partnership agreement is immaterial.however,because determining actual injury is predominately a factual inquiry jordache,supra,cal th at,d,to the extent a question remains on this point,the matter is properly resolved by the trier of fact following remand.
payment of gibson,dunn fees to draft the partnership agreement,without more,is insufficient to trigger the running of section limitations period 
as discussed,the second amended complaint alleges the robert inge family members have been damaged by gibson,dunn negligent drafting of the partnership agreement,in part,by payment of attorney fees to the firm in for preparing the partnership agreement,which failed to include a provision for the continuation of the limited partnership except upon the death of both general partners.the pleading asserts,plaintiffs did not receive the legal documents that they sought from gibson,dunn and for which they paid legal fees to gibson,dunn,and but for the negligence of gibson,dunn,this that is,an appropriate succession provision that anticipated the disability or retirement of the surviving general partner would have been provided in the limited partnership agreement.gibson,dunn argued,and the trial court found,its legal fees constituted actual injury at the time incurred because,as a result of the firm alleged negligence,the fees exceeded the value of the legal services provided.
the supreme court in budd nixen,supra,cal d at pages to,recognized that fees previously paid to the in a legal malpractice action,as well as fees paid to a second attorney to compensate that attorney for his efforts to extricate plaintiff from the effect of defendant negligence may,in some circumstances,constitute damages recoverable in the malpractice action.as to the former category of fees,however,the court explained they would constitute actual injury only to the extent that,in consequence of defendant negligence,those fees exceeded the value of defendant legal services.id.at,citing pete henderson d,fee paid to lawyer to appeal a judgment is proper item of damages in malpractice action based on lawyer negligent failure to timely file the notice of appeal see ferguson lieff,cabraser,heimann bernstein cal th,d,an attorney liability,as in other negligence cases,is for all damages directly and proximately caused by his negligence see generally mallen smith,legal malpractice damages,u sually,the fees paid to the bear no relation to the loss of the client.
unlike fees paid for services that were never performed,however,the robert inge family members received substantial value from gibson,dunn legal work a limited partnership agreement under which inge realty company successfully operated for several years.to be sure,as gibson,dunn argues in its brief to this court,had either of the two brothers taken the document to another attorney,that lawyer should have been able to say based on what you have told me,this is not what you want.i can draft an amendment to the agreement,but it will cost you in that situation,the injury would have been x.it does not matter that we do not know what x is the measure of damage is the cost that would have been incurred to pay another lawyer to fix the purported problem.that is,if inge realty company or oliver or robert personally had incurred attorney fees to remedy the defects in the partnership agreement caused by gibson,dunn drafting errors,those fees would be tort damages recoverable in a malpractice action and would constitute actual injury within the meaning of section a.jordache,supra,cal th at,d,see sirott latts th,d client suffers damage when he is compelled,as a result of the attorney error,to incur or pay attorney fees.but no such remedial action was ever taken in this case,and the cost of amending the agreement was merely hypothetical,not actual.
of equal significance,if robert had survived oliver and then died himself while fully engaged in managing inge realty company as its sole general partner,the succession provisions in the partnership agreement,whatever theoretical defects might exist,would have accomplished their intended result and inge realty company would have received full value for the legal fees paid to gibson,dunn.in those circumstances,in the words of the test articulated in jordache,the client would not have been able to plead damages that could establish a cause of action for legal malpractice.jordache,supra,cal th at,d.it is not simply that the robert inge family members had not discovered the fact of injury in october,as gibson,dunn argues,but rather that any potential injury based on overpayment of legal fees remained contingent or speculative until some further,future event occurred.
at a more fundamental level,it would effectively nullify the tolling provisions of section a to construe the language in budd nixen,supra,cal d,suggesting payment of legal fees to an allegedly negligent may be recoverable as malpractice damages as necessarily requiring a finding that actual injury has been sustained at the time such fees are first incurred.legal fees for defective services will inevitably be excessive the client received less than it had agreed to pay for that is,services performed with ordinary skill and knowledge.to equate these potential damages with actual injury would return california to a strict,limitations period for malpractice claims,contrary to the legislature express purpose in adopting section see jordache,supra,cal th at,d,and create the precise type of rule rejected by the supreme court in jordache and adams paul,supra,cal th,d.
although it is reasonable to presume the client has incurred,if not actually paid,legal fees and costs in virtually every case in which transactional malpractice has been alleged and in cases of litigation malpractice,as well,except where the attorney represented the client on a contingency fee basis,gibson,dunn has not cited to this court and we have not been able to locate a single california appellate decision holding that actual injury was first sustained as a result of payment for legal services that exceeded the value of the services provided due to negligence after explaining that excessive fees paid to the or fees paid to new counsel to remedy the consequences of the defendant negligence may be recoverable as damages,the supreme court in budd nixen,supra,cal d,remanded the case to the trial court to decide at trial or on a properly supported motion for summary judgment when the plaintiff had sustained actual damage.id.at.pete henderson,supra,d,cited in budd,concerned the proper measure of damages for legal malpractice,not a limitations issue and all parties conceded the fees paid to file the appeal were recoverable as damages following the lawyer failure to timely file the notice of appeal.similarly,the court of appeal in orrick herrington sutcliffe superior court th,d recognized that fees paid to an attorney in excess of the legal value of services received are recoverable as contract damages,but did not address any question of actual injury or the tolling of the limitations period under section a there appears to be no other case that even discusses this language from budd nixen.
not only is there no support in reported decisions for gibson,dunn assertion that actual injury under section a is sustained when fees are incurred for negligently performed legal services,but also that contention is impossible to reconcile with the myriad cases that have struggled with the question when such injury has first occurred.for example,in sindell gibson,dunn crutcher,supra,th,d,the law firm had been paid more than in and for its legal work in connection with the client estate plan.id.at,d.the legal malpractice action sought to recover as damages,in part,the fees paid to gibson,dunn because the services had no value,as well as the substantial attorney fees subsequently incurred to defend the validity of the estate plan,a defense made necessary by the law firm failure to obtain the consent of the client current wife to the property transfers involved.id.at,d.there would be no question the cause of action for legal malpractice had accrued when the lawsuit was filed if the original payment of fees to gibson,dunn constituted actual injury within the meaning of section a.yet,as discussed in footnote,above,the trial court ruling was that the malpractice action was premature and the court of appeal reversed,explaining the purpose for obtaining a would be to render unlikely or a challenge to the client implicit claim to sole and separate ownership of the assets to be conveyed.accordingly,the mere fact of such litigation is the unwanted consequence t he litigation itself is the event which constitutes damage.sindell,at,d.none of this analysis would have been necessary if gibson,dunn gloss on the language in budd nixen,supra,cal d,were correct.
similarly,if the payment of legal fees for negligent legal advice necessarily equates to actual injury within the meaning of section a,the court in truong glasser,supra,th,d,would not have concluded the clients first sustained actual injury when they were required to obtain and pay new counsel to file a lawsuit seeking to escape the consequences of their signing the lease and lease addendum id.at,d and the court in fritz ehrmann,supra,th,d could not have held no actual injury was sustained when the negligent lawyer included ambiguous terms in an amended promissory note in,but only when the debtor exploited that ambiguity and refused to pay the deferred interest in id.at,d.and in jordache itself,the legal fees paid to the defendant legal firm,which negligently failed to advise the clients of their right to an defense,would have been sufficient to find actual injury without the need to describe the significance under section a of the millions of dollars in unpaid insurance benefits for defense costs in the marciano action and in lost profits from diversion of investment fund to pay these defense costs.jordache,supra,cal th at,d.
in sum,in the circumstances of this case,neither the payment of legal fees in to gibson,dunn for preparation of the allegedly defective limited the partnership agreement nor the execution of the agreement by robert and oliver constituted actual injury and the limitations period for filing a legal malpractice action against the law firm was tolled until robert became disabled or bank of the west asserted robert condition permitted it to dissolve the limited partnership,whichever first occurred.accordingly,the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on the ground the malpractice action was time barred.
gibson,dunn is not entitled to summary judgment on its alternate theory of lack of proof of loss causation 
in the trial court gibson,dunn presented evidence it asserted established that the alleged drafting deficiencies in the partnership agreement did not proximately cause the settlement of the probate action initiated by bank of the west.in particular,gibson,dunn evidence indicated the robert inge family members first sought a settlement with oliver trustee and beneficiaries before any drafting errors were raised in the probate action.in addition,they asserted,based on testimony and documentary evidence,by the time a settlement was finally reached in november,none of the risks associated with litigating the probate action was attributable to the claims relating to the succession or termination provisions in the partnership agreement.accordingly,although the trial court did not rule on the causation issue,if we do not affirm the judgment in its favor on limitation grounds,gibson,dunn urges us to affirm on its alternate theory that the robert inge family members can not prove loss causation.see viner sweet cal th,d,to recover damages in a legal malpractice action,plaintiff must prove that but for the alleged malpractice,it is more likely than not that the plaintiff would have obtained a more favorable result see also id.at,d,in both litigation and transactional malpractice cases,the crucial causation inquiry is what would have happene
