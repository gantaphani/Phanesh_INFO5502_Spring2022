in this appeal pursuant to rule f of the federal rules of civil procedure from an order certifying a class in a securities fraud case,we must decide an issue of first impression in this circuit the standard for determining whether a market was efficient when applying the presumption of investor reliance.we also address the level of inquiry that a district court may pursue at the stage when making that efficiency determination.polymedica corporation,liberty medical supply,liberty,and various officers of both companies collectively,polymedica argue that the district court erred in finding that common questions predominated under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,by determining that the market was efficient for eight months of the class period,from january through august the contested time period,and deeming polymedica expert evidence irrelevant to that determination.for the reasons set forth below,we vacate the district court order certifying the class for the contested time period,and remand for further proceedings.
thomas thuma plaintiff is a purchaser of polymedica stock,who seeks to represent a class of all purchasers of polymedica stock from october through august polymedica is the parent company of liberty,a seller of diabetic testing supplies.according to plaintiff,polymedica reported record revenues and earnings during the class period based primarily on the growth of liberty diabetic supplies business,which accounted for up to of polymedica revenues.as a result of these increases in revenue and earnings,the price of polymedica stock,which traded on the nasdaq and the american stock exchange during the class period,increased substantially.in the consolidated complaint,filed on october,plaintiff alleges that polymedica artificially inflated the market price of its stock by misrepresenting sales,revenues,and accounts receivable,and by issuing false press releases,causing plaintiff and other members of the class to purchase stock at artificially inflated prices.plaintiff further alleges that when the truth of this fraud became known,polymedica stock lost more than of its value.plaintiff seeks damages under section b of the securities exchange act of,b the exchange act and rule promulgated thereunder,and section a of the exchange act,a.
on january,following several years of litigation,plaintiff moved for class certification pursuant to.a and b,asserting that common questions of law and fact predominated,based on the theory.as we explain in greater detail below,under the supreme court plurality decision in basic,levinson,d this theory obviates the need for a plaintiff to demonstrate individualized reliance on a defendant misstatement by permitting a rebuttable presumption of reliance,thereby enabling a securities fraud class action to meet rule b commonality requirement.polymedica opposed the motion,arguing that the presumption of reliance was inapplicable for the contested time period because the market for polymedica stock was not efficient a prerequisite for application of the presumption.both sides submitted expert testimony in support of their respective positions.
plaintiff expert,alan miller,relying upon each of the five factors set forth in cammer bloom,concluded that the market for polymedica stock was efficient.polymedica expert,denise neumann martin,in turn,concluded that the polymedica market was not efficient,based on three factors not enumerated in cammer.a hearing on plaintiff motion for class certification was held on july.on september,the district court granted plaintiff motion to certify the class for the entire proposed class period,rejecting martin evidence as not relevant to the definition of market efficiency,which the court derived from basic.the court also excluded from the class those investors who participated in transactions,transactions involving the sale of a borrowed security,as further discussed below,leaving it to able counsel to develop an efficient solution for identifying.
polymedica filed an interlocutory appeal from the district court order certifying the class pursuant to rule f,which we permitted on february,on appeal,polymedica argues that the district court erred in determining that the market for polymedica stock was efficient during the contested time period,and in concluding that the presumption of reliance was therefore applicable for these months.polymedica further argues that the district court erred in certifying the class without a plan for identifying and excluding from the class.
standard of review 
we generally review decisions granting or denying class certification under the highly deferential abuse of discretion standard.smilow southwestern bell mobile,cir.since rule contains express legal standards for class certification,an appeal of a class certification can pose pure issues of law which are reviewed de novo,that is,without deference to the district court.tardiff knox county,cir.an error of law is,of course,always an abuse of discretion.charlesbank equity fund ii blinds to go,cir.mixed questions of law and fact fall along a continuum,ranging from plenary review for questions,to deferential review for questions.johnson watts regulator,cir.
the formulation of the proper standard for efficiency is a purely legal question reviewed de novo.reviewing the application of that standard to the facts of a case involves the review of a mixed question of law and fact.see cammer.at stating that t he question of whether the theory can substitute for direct reliance in any given case is both a legal and a factual one is the market in which a particular company stock trades efficient given the various factors relevant to an efficiency determination,and the abundant evidence that can be developed with respect to each factor,the determination of whether a market is efficient is a inquiry.therefore,deferential review applies to that determination.the ultimate decision to certify a class is,of course,a discretionary one.
level of inquiry by the district court 
in determining whether to certify the class,the district court went well beyond the four corners of the pleadings,considering both parties expert reports and literally hundreds of pages of exhibits focused on market efficiency.before we can decide whether the district court correctly certified plaintiff class based on a finding of market efficiency,we must determine whether this detailed level of inquiry was appropriate at the stage.plaintiff,relying on the second circuit decision in in re visa antitrust litigation,cir,argues that a district court should not engage in a weighing of competing evidence at the stage,and should instead confine its review to the allegations raised in the plaintiff complaint.at that stage,according to the second circuit,a district court may not weigh conflicting expert evidence or engage in statistical dueling of experts.id.at quoting caridad commuter,cir.in support of its position,the second circuit looked to eisen carlisle jacquelin,d,in which the supreme court held that rule did not authorize courts to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the merits of a suit in order to determine whether it may be maintained as a class action.id.at.see also ex rel.hart valdez,cir recognizing that when deciding a motion for class certification,the district court should accept the allegations contained in the complaint as true.
polymedica,on the other hand,argues that we should follow the majority of courts of appeals that have addressed this issue.according to these courts,a district court is not limited to the allegations raised in the complaint,and should instead make whatever legal and factual inquiries are necessary to an informed determination of the certification issues.see unger,at stating that while c lass certification hearings should not be on the merits of the class or individual claims g oing beyond the pleadings is necessary,as a court must understand the claims,defenses,relevant facts,and applicable substantive law in order to make a meaningful determination of the certification issues quoting castano am.tobacco,cir accord cooper southern,cir gariety grant thornton,llp,cir west prudential,cir tough questions at stage must be faced and squarely decided,if necessary by holding evidentiary hearings and choosing between competing perspectives.johnston hbo film,cir see also wagner taylor,noting that a decision on class certification can not be made in a vacuum,and that some inspection of the circumstances of the case is essential to determine whether the prerequisites of federal civil rule have been met.
in support of this more demanding inquiry at the stage,many of these courts rely on general telephone of southwest falcon,d,in which the supreme court noted that since the class determination generally involves considerations that are enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiff cause of action sometimes it may be necessary for the court to probe behind the pleadings before coming to rest on the certification question.id.at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also amchem,at.noting that rule b involves a close look at predominance and superiority criteria.
we have already expressed our preference for the majority view.in waste management holdings,mowbray,cir,we upheld a district court decision to certify a class,where the court engaged in a analysis that went well beyond the pleadings.id.at.in that case,we also squared the supreme court holdings in eisen and falcon,noting that while eisen prohibits a district court from inquiring into whether a plaintiff will prevail on the merits at class certification,it does not foreclose consideration of the probable course of litigation,as contemplated by falcon.id.at.after all,we explained,a district court must formulate some prediction as to how specific issues will play out in order to determine whether common or individual issues predominate in a given case.id.
three years later,in smilow southwestern bell mobile systems,cir,we noted that a district court must conduct a rigorous analysis of the prerequisites established by rule before certifying a class.id.at citing falcon,at.and last year,in tardiff,we noted the split between circuits,reasoning that while i t is sometimes taken for granted that the complaint allegations are necessarily controlling in our view a court has the power to test disputed premises early on if and when the class action would be proper on one premise but not another.at.therefore,in light of our prior precedent,we conclude that the district court was entitled to look beyond the pleadings in its evaluation of the applicability of the presumption of reliance,and its resolution of the question.
a.the theory 
the supreme court has described the basic elements of a securities fraud action under b of the exchange act and rule promulgated thereunder as including a material misrepresentation or omission scienter,a wrongful state of mind a connection with the purchase or sale of a security reliance economic loss and loss causation.in re stone webster,sec,cir quoting dura,broudo,d see also wortley camplin,cir.while reliance is typically demonstrated on an individual basis,the supreme court has noted that such a rule would effectively foreclose securities fraud class actions because individual questions of reliance would inevitably overwhelm the common ones under rule b.basic,at.
to avoid this result,the supreme court has recognized the theory,which relieves the plaintiff of the burden of proving individualized reliance on a defendant misstatement,by permitting a rebuttable presumption that the plaintiff relied on the integrity of the market price which reflected that misstatement as the supreme court recognized in basic,t he fraud on the market theory is based on the hypothesis that,in an open and developed securities market,the price of a company stock is determined by the available material information regarding the company and its business,including any available material misstatements.id.at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.since investors who purchase or sell stock do so in reliance on the integrity of the market price,id.at,they indirectly rely on such misstatements because they purchase or sell stock at a price which necessarily reflects that misrepresentation.under the theory,m isleading statements will therefore defraud purchasers of stock even if the purchasers do not directly rely on the misstatements.id.at.quoting peil speiser,cir see also shaw digital equip,cir noting that in cases involving theory,the statements identified by plaintiffs as actionably misleading are alleged to have caused injury,if at all,not through the plaintiffs direct reliance upon them,but by dint of the statements inflating effect on the market price of the security purchased.
before an investor can be presumed to have relied upon the integrity of the market price,however,the market must be efficient.see basic,at.recognizing elements cited by court of appeals for invoking presumption of reliance,including that the shares were traded on an efficient market efficiency refers to the flow of information in the relevant market and the effect of that information on the price of the stock.see in re laser arms.sec.at stating that t he underlying premise of the fraud on the market theory assumes that the market is a transmission belt which efficiently translates all information concerning a security,including misleading information,into a price.in an efficient market,the defendant misrepresentations are said to have been absorbed into,and are therefore reflected in,the stock price.conversely,when a market lacks efficiency,there is no assurance that the market price was affected by the defendant alleged misstatement at all.instead,the price may reflect information wholly unrelated to the misstatement.see freeman laventhol horwath,cir stating that a n inefficient market,by definition,does not incorporate into its price all the available information about the value of a security.investors,therefore,can not be presumed to rely reasonably on the integrity of the market price of a security that is traded in such a market.
the presumption of reliance and its relationship to market efficiency can thus be reduced to the following syllogism a an investor buys or sells stock in reliance on the integrity of the market price b publicly available information,including material misrepresentations,is reflected in the market price and therefore,c the investor buys or sells stock in reliance on material misrepresentations.this syllogism breaks down,of course,when a market lacks efficiency,and the market does not necessarily reflect the alleged material misrepresentation.with this understanding as background,we must now decide the appropriate standard for determining whether a market is efficient.
b.the meaning of market efficiency 
the efficient market hypothesis began as an academic attempt to answer the following question can an ordinary investor beat the stock market,that is,can such an investor make trading profits on the basis of new information in an efficient market,the answer is no,because the information that would have given the investor a competitive edge and allowed the investor to beat the market is already reflected in the market price.see lynn stout,the mechanisms of market inefficiency an introduction to the new finance,stating that t he common definition of market efficiency is really a shorthand for the empirical claim that available information does not support profitable trading strategies or arbitrage opportunities internal quotation marks and citation omitted there is,therefore,no bargain from which an investor can benefit.since the stock price fully reflects the information,an investor can not take advantage of it by either purchasing the stock if the information indicates the stock is underpriced or selling the stock if the information indicates the stock is overpriced.see philip dyvig stephen ross,arbitrage,in the new palgrave dictionary of money and finance peter newman et,stating that t he intuition behind the efficient market hypothesis is that if the price does not fully reflect all available information,then there is a profit opportunity available from buying the asset if the asset is underpriced or from selling the asset if the asset is overpriced.
one way information gets absorbed into the market and reflected in stock price is through arbitrageurs,who obtain and analyze information about stocks from a variety of sources,including from the issuer,market analysts,and the financial and trade press.in re verifone sec,see generally ronald gilson reinier kraakman,the mechanisms of market efficiency,discussing variety of mechanisms by which new information is incorporated into stock price.these arbitrageurs immediately attempt to profit from such information for instance,through short sales,thereby causing the stock to move to a price which reflects the latest public information concerning the stock,where it is no longer possible to generate profits.see eckstein balcor film investors,cir stating that c ompetition among savvy investors leads to a price that impounds all available information see also stout,supra,at noting that if arbitrageurs observe a difference between price and value,they immediately eliminate it by their trading internal quotation marks and citation omitted 
the capacity of arbitrageurs to seek out new information and evaluate its effects on the price of securities distinguishes them from ordinary investors,who lack the time,resources,or expertise to evaluate all the information concerning a security,and are thus unable to act in time to take advantage of opportunities for arbitrage profits.robert newkirk,comment,sufficient efficiency fraud on the market in the initial public offering context,chi.in an efficient market,then,an ordinary investor who becomes aware of publicly available information can not make money by trading on it because the information will have already been incorporated into the market by arbitrageurs.stout,supra,at.an example would be an investor who decides to sell a stock upon the public announcement of a decline in corporate earnings,who finds that by the time she calls her broker,the price has already dropped.id 
according to the prevailing definition of market efficiency,an efficient market is one in which market price fully reflects all publicly available information.stout,supra,at citing eugene fama,efficient capital markets a review of theory and empirical work,fin.this definition has been adopted by many lower courts as a prerequisite for applying the presumption of reliance.polymedica urges us to do likewise,arguing that an efficient market is an open and developed one,in which a stock price will move quickly to reflect all publicly available information.
the district court,on the other hand,expressly declined to adopt this prevailing definition of market efficiency.relying upon language gleaned from the supreme court decision in basic,the district court held that the efficient market required for the fraud on the market presumption of reliance is simply one in which market professionals generally consider most publicly announced material statements about companies,thereby affecting stock market prices it is not one in which a stock price rapidly reflects all publicly available material information.in re polymedica.sec,at emphasis in original quoting basic,at.plaintiff agrees with the district court definition,which,he contends,is drawn directly from language used by the supreme court in basic.
polymedica argues that the district court definition of market efficiency,while rooted in a footnote in basic,defies the controlling language of basic,the cases upon which basic relied,and the subsequent cases interpreting basic,all of which support the prevailing definition of market efficiency.specifically,polymedica argues that the definition adopted by the district court wrongly focuses on the thought processes of unidentified market professionals and whether stock prices are in some way affected by their consideration of most but not necessarily all material public information.the prevailing definition,on the other hand,requires a more searching inquiry into whether stock prices fully reflect all publicly available information.we must assess these conflicting positions of the parties.
c.the standard for determining an efficient market 
basic levinson 
while endorsing the presumption of reliance in basic,the supreme court did not explicitly address the meaning of an efficient market.see gariety,at stating that basic offers little guidance for determining whether a market is efficient.polymedica points to various passages in basic purportedly showing a preference for the prevailing definition of an efficient market,noting the supreme court statements that t he market is acting as the unpaid agent of the investor,informing him that given all the information available to it,the value of the stock is worth the market price,and that the market price of shares traded on markets reflects all publicly available information,and hence,any material misrepresentations.basic,at.emphasis added internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
elsewhere,however,the basic decision suggests that something less than all publicly available information may be required,noting that an investor reliance may be presumed b ecause most publicly available information is reflected in market price,id.at.emphasis added.in separate footnotes of the decision,the court further appeared to resist polymedica suggested definition of an efficient market.as pointed out by the district court,the supreme court,after listing several academic articles,noted that 
w e need not determine by adjudication what economists and social scientists have debated through the use of sophisticated statistical analysis and the application of economic theory.for purposes of accepting the presumption of reliance in this case,we need only believe that market professionals generally consider most publicly announced material statements about companies,thereby affecting stock market prices.
id.at.in addition,the court noted that by accepting a rebuttable presumption of reliance,it d id not intend conclusively to adopt any particular theory of how quickly and completely publicly available information is reflected in market price.id.at.
while the supreme court language in basic provides support for both the district court definition of an efficient market as well as the prevailing definition urged by polymedica,the cases relied upon by the supreme court in basic favor the latter definition.in peil,cited extensively in basic,the third circuit noted that t he fraud on the market theory rests on the assumption that there is a nearly perfect market in information,and that the market price of stock reacts to and reflects the available information.peil,at.likewise,in in re ltv sec,which the supreme court also cited,the district court stated that t he central assumption of the fraud on the market theory is that the market price reflects all representations concerning the stock e fficient capital markets exist when security sic prices reflect all available public information about the economy,about financial markets,and about the specific company involved.id.at.
other cases cited in basic,including the decision of the sixth circuit under review in basic,similarly support the prevailing definition.see levinson,at stating that t he fraud on the market theory is based on two assumptions first,that in an efficient market the price of stock will reflect all information available to the public and,second,that an individual relies on the integrity of the market price when dealing in that stock raney,sons fort cobb irrigation fuel,cir stating that t he theory is grounded on the assumption that the market price reflects all known material information.
given the supreme court disclaimer that it was not adopting any particular economic theory in applying the presumption of reliance,on the one hand,and its embrace of the holdings of cases adopting the prevailing definition of market efficiency on the other hand,the most that can be said of basic is that it did not directly address the meaning of an efficient market,choosing instead to leave the development of that concept to the lower courts.see abell potomac ins,cir stating that basic essentially allows each of the circuits room to develop its own rules,vacated on other grounds sub.nom.fryar abell,d.basic is therefore not the benchmark for deriving a definition of market efficiency.we must turn to the decisions of the lower courts,for further guidance.
lower courts interpretation of market efficiency 
polymedica correctly notes that in the wake of basic,many lower courts have accepted a definition of market efficiency which requires that stock price fully reflect all publicly available information.the district court conceded as much i also note that the definition i have derived from basic differs from much of the existing case law.most cases define an efficient market as a market in which prices incorporate rapidly or promptly all publicly available information.in re polymedica.sec,at.
the district court observation was apt.the precedents from other circuits overwhelmingly favor the definition advanced by polymedica.see gariety,at stating that in an efficient market,the market price has integrity it adjusts rapidly to reflect all new information quoting macey miller,supra,at greenberg crossroads,cir stating that where securities are traded in an efficient market,it is assumed that all public information concerning a company is known to the market and reflected in the market price of the company stock joint council pension trust fund am.west holding,cir stating that in a modern and efficient securities market,the market price of a stock incorporates all available public information gfl advantage fund,colkitt.cir defining efficient marketplace as one in which stock prices reflect all available relevant information about the stock economic value joseph wiles,cir stating that in an efficient market the investor must rely on the market to perform a valuation process which incorporates all publicly available information,including misinformation kowal mci communications,stating that in an efficient securities market all publicly available information regarding a company prospects has been reflected in its shares price raab physics,cir reasoning that presumption of reliance assumes the market price has internalized all publicly available information freeman,at stating that t he fraud on the market theory rests on the assumption that the price of an actively traded security in an open,and efficient market reflects all the available information about the value of a company.
the prevailing definition of an efficient market is also consistent with language in our decision in roeder alpha industries,cir.there,we stated that under the theory,t he market price of stock is taken to be the basis for investment decisions because the price reflected all available information,investors are presumed to have been misled by the nondisclosure.id.at 
other arguments supporting the prevailing definition of market efficiency 
polymedica points to statements made by the united states securities and exchange commission sec supporting the prevailing definition of market efficiency.see brief for the securities and exchange commission as amicus curiae,basic levinson,d stating that theory rests on proposition that in an active secondary market,the price of company stock is determined by all material information regarding the company and its business see also arthur levitt,chairman,securities and exchange commission,testimony before house subcomm.on telecomm,cong,available at.
polymedica also argues with some force that the district court definition is logically inconsistent.by requiring that an efficient market need only be affected by most but not all material information in order to be efficient,the district court definition allows some information to be considered material and yet not affect market price.in re burlington coat factory sec,cir stating that i n the context of an efficient market,the concept of materiality translates into information that alters the price of the firm stock.
market efficiency defined 
on the basis of the authorities and considerations cited,we conclude that the definition of market efficiency adopted by the district court is inconsistent with the presumption of investor reliance at the heart of the theory.by rejecting the prevailing definition of market efficiency advocated by polymedica,and focusing instead on the general consideration by market professionals of most publicly announced material statements about companies,the district court applied the wrong standard of efficiency.for application of the theory,we conclude that an efficient market is one in which the market price of the stock fully reflects all publicly available information.
anticipating the possibility of this definition,plaintiff complains that it forces him to prove that market price correctly reflects a stock fundamental value before a market will be considered efficient.this argument misconstrues the conclusion that market price must fully reflect all publicly available information.the words fully reflect have two distinct meanings,each of which points to a different concept of market efficiency.
informational fundamental value efficiency 
the first meaning of fully reflect focuses on the ability of the market to digest information,thereby preventing trading profits market price fully reflects all publicly available information when prices respond so quickly to new information that it is impossible for traders to make trading profits on the basis of that information.stout,supra,at.this is known as informational efficiency,and is best understood as a prediction or implication about the speed with which prices respond to information.id.at see also daniel fischel,efficient capital markets,the crash,and the fraud on the market theory,cornell,stating that u nder this definition,a market is efficient if it is impossible to devise a trading rule that systematically outperforms the market absent possession of inside information.
with many professional investors alert to news,markets are efficient in the sense that they rapidly adjust to all public information west,at.where the market reacts slowly to new information,it is less likely that misinformation was reflected in market price and therefore relied upon.see city of monroe employees ret.bridgestone,cir stating that in an open and efficient securities market,information important to reasonable investors in effect,the market is immediately incorporated into stock prices internal quotation marks and citation omitted freeman,at stating that a n efficient market is one which rapidly reflects new information in price quoting cammer.at fischel,supra,at stating that the more rapidly prices reflect information,the more sensible it is to apply the theory.
determining whether a market is informationally efficient,therefore,involves analysis of the structure of the market and the speed with which all publicly available information is impounded in price.see fischel,supra,at enumerating factors relevant to determination of,informational efficiency,including whether a stock is actively traded,and whether it is followed by analysts and other market professionals,and the speed of price adjustment to new information which can be tested directly by use of statistical techniques.
the second,and much broader meaning of fully reflect,focuses on the price of the stock as a function of its fundamental value market price fully reflects all publicly available information when it responds to information not only quickly but accurately,such that market prices mirror the best possible estimates,in light of all available information,of the actual economic values of securities in terms of their expected risks and returns.stout,supra,at.this is known as fundamental value efficiency.see fischel,supra,at stating that fundamental value efficiency focuses on the extent to which security prices reflect the present value of the net cash flows generated by a firm assets.
determining whether a market is fundamental value efficient is a much more technical inquiry than determining informational efficiency.depending on the method of valuation used,a stock fundamental value turns on an assessment of various factors,including present operations,future growth rates,relative risk levels,and the future levels of interest rates.newkirk,supra,at see,stout,supra,at,discussing valuation of stocks based on capital asset pricing model,which focuses on expected risks and returns fischel,supra,at stating that the results of certain kinds of tests which measure how closely prices reflect value,such as those which measure whether the variability of prices is greater than the variability of dividends over time have been extremely controversial.
courts and commentators often use these two concepts of market efficiency interchangeably.see newkirk,supra,at stating that t he manner in which the courts apply the efficient market hypothesis is problematic because courts often fail to distinguish between value efficiency and information efficiency in fact,informational and fundamental value efficiency often are made to go,with fundamental value efficiency flowing naturally from informational efficiency.see stout,supra,at.despite this blurring of concepts,one thing is clear a market can be information efficient without also being fundamental value efficient.stout,supra,at stating that informational efficiency and fundamental value efficiency are distinct concepts see also fischel,supra,at.while fundamental value efficiency may be the more comprehensive of the two concepts,encompassing both speed and accuracy,e fficiency is not an phenomenon.eckstein,at.
therefore,by requiring that stock price in an efficient market fully reflect all publicly available information in order to establish the presumption,we do not suggest that stock price must accurately reflect the fundamental value of the stock.this distinction is by the legal and economic commentary.see jill fisch,picking a winner,book review stating that s tock prices regularly and persistently depart substantially from present value models as well as from financial variables that would appear to supply most of the information relevant to a calculation of fundamental value baruch lev meiring de villiers,stock prices and damages a legal,economic,and policy analysis,stan,stating that overwhelming empirical evidence suggests that capital markets are not fundamentally efficient newkirk,supra,at noting that a major drawback to fundamental value theory is that it requires a great deal of specific,sometimes unobtainable,information.
our focus on whether a particular market has absorbed all available information and misinformation such that an ordinary investor can not beat the market by taking advantage of unexploited profit not a fundamental value inquiry.see stout,supra,at stating that when finance economists define market efficiency in terms of the difficulty of making arbitrage profits,they have implicitly abandoned the claim that efficient markets price securities accurately.on the contrary,for purposes of establishing the presumption of reliance,investors need only show that the market was informationally efficient.see in re verifone sec.at stating that the theory does not require proof that the market correctly reflects some fundamental value of the security.to apply the theory,it is sufficient that the market for a security be efficient only in the sense that market prices reflect the available information about the security.the theory is concerned with whether a market processes information in such a way as to justify investor reliance,not whether the stock price paid or received by investors was correct in the fundamental value sense.
still,as a matter of logic,we can not say that fundamental value efficiency has no place in applying the presumption of reliance at the stage.evidence bearing on a stock fundamental value may be relevant to the efficiency determination as,for example,circumstantial evidence that arbitrageurs are not trading in the market,with the result that securities prices do not fully reflect all publicly available information.in other words,evidence of fundamental value may be relevant to the extent that it raises questions about informational efficiency.but there are practical limits on the evidence a court can or should consider during the proceedings.courts which choose to consider such fundamental value evidence at the stage run the risk of turning the proceeding into a on the merits,which must not happen.see eisen,at.stating that i n determining the propriety of a class action,the question is not whether the plaintiff or plaintiffs will prevail on the merits,but rather whether the requirements of rule are met internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
evidence necessary to prove presumption of reliance 
it is important to remember that the application of the presumption only establishes just presumption of reliance.that reliance can be rebutted at trial.see cammer.at stating that if it were concluded after a hearing that the market appeared efficient,and that plaintiffs could proceed under the rebuttable presumption,the defendant would be entitled to prove to a jury that the market was inefficient,thereby rebutting the presumption see also lehocky tidel,stating that a t the stage of the proceedings,the court need only inquire whether the stock traded in an efficient market and not examine the merits of the case thus,the court will not address whether defendants sic can rebut the presumption of reliance.
as the notes of the advisory committee on rule of the federal rules of evidence,cited in basic,make clear,a party need only establish basic facts in order to invoke the presumption of reliance.see basic,at.citing rule and advisory committee notes in support of statement that presumptions are useful devices for allocating the burden of proof between parties see also cammer.at stating that under the notes of the advisory committee on rule,the nonmoving party has the burden of establishing the nonexistence of the presumed fact once the party invoking the presumption establishes the basic facts giving rise to it emphasis in original internal quotation marks omitted.
the question of how much evidence of efficiency is necessary for a court to accept the presumption of reliance at the stage is therefore one of degree.district courts must draw these lines sensibly,mindful that evidence of fundamental value may be relevant to the determination of informational efficiency,but other more accessible and manageable evidence may be sufficient at the certification stage to establish the basic facts that permit a court to apply the presumption.
we have no illusions that this is easy.knowing the high stakes in the decision the parties will try to move the court in different directions,with plaintiffs arguing for less evidence of efficiency and defendants for more,some of it highly technical.exercising its broad discretion,and understanding the correct definition of efficiency and the factors relevant to that determination,the district court must evaluate the plaintiff evidence of efficiency critically without allowing the defendant to turn the proceeding into an unwieldy trial on the merits.in this highly variable setting,these generalities are the best we can do.
having concluded that the district court adopted the wrong definition of market efficiency,we must now decide whether the court determination that the market for polymedica stock was efficient is nevertheless supportable.as previously discussed,the question of whether a particular market is efficient is a mixed question of law and fact.while the proper definition of market efficiency is a purely legal issue reviewed de novo,application of this definition to the facts of a case requires district courts to make judgments about the structure of the market for a particular stock.these judgments are reviewed for clear error.many factors bearing on the structure of the market may be relevant to the efficiency analysis,and courts have wide latitude in deciding what factors to apply in a given case,and what weight should be given to those factors.
the district court in this case based its analysis of market efficiency on three factors the involvement of market professionals,the degree to and fluidity with which information is disseminated,and whether information affected stock market prices.in re polymedica.sec,at.applying these factors,the district court determined that the market for polymedica stock met the court definition of market efficiency,that is,one in which market professionals generally considered most publicly announced material statements about polymedica,thereby affecting the stock market price.id.at.the court explicitly rejected polymedica proffered evidence which focused on whether market price fully and rapidly reflect ed all the publicly available material information,ruling that it was not relevant to the definition of market efficiency announced by the court.id.
polymedica argues that by adopting the wrong definition of market efficiency,the district court erroneously refused to consider polymedica evidence and,therefore,erroneously concluded that the market for polymedica stock was efficient.plaintiff argues that regardless of whether the court adopted the wrong definition of efficiency,the factors analyzed by the court were nevertheless sufficient to support a finding of market efficiency under the correct definition of market efficiency that we adopt today.while we agree with plaintiff that the factors considered by the district court were relevant to the issue of market efficiency,these factors are not exhaustive.see unger,at.if the district court had used the definition of market efficiency that we adopt today,other factors cited by polymedica may have also been relevant to the efficiency analysis and may have supported a contrary finding.the district court error,therefore,was not in analyzing the factors that it did,but in applying an erroneous definition of market efficiency that prevented it from analyzing other arguably relevant evidence.we must therefore vacate its decision and remand for application of the proper standard 
we summarize the essential points of our analysis.the district court was entitled to look beyond the pleadings and consider evidence in its evaluation of the applicability of the presumption of reliance,and in its resolution of the question.however,the district court adopted a standard of market efficiency at odds with the prevailing standard,holding that market efficiency means that market professionals generally consider most publicly announced material statements about companies,thereby affecting stock market prices.this was error.
for purposes of establishing the presumption of reliance,we adopt the prevailing definition of market efficiency,which provides that an efficient market is one in which the market price of the stock fully reflects all publicly available information.by fully reflect,we mean that market price responds so quickly to new information that ordinary investors can not make trading profits on the basis of such information.this is known as informational efficiency.we reject a second and much broader meaning of fully reflect,known as fundamental value efficiency,which requires that a market respond to information not only quickly but accurately,such that the market price of a stock reflects its fundamental value.
while evidence of a stock fundamental value may be relevant to the extent that it raises questions about informational efficiency,courts which choose to consider such fundamental value evidence at the stage run the risk of turning the proceeding into a on the merits,which must not happen.the presumption,after all,only establishes a presumption of reliance which can be rebutted at trial.at the stage,a party need only establish basic facts in order to invoke the presumption of reliance.the question of how much evidence of efficiency is necessary to establish the presumption of reliance is one of degree.while district courts have broad discretion to draw these lines,they must do so sensibly,understanding the correct definition of efficiency and the factors relevant to that determination.
having concluded this analysis,we must vacate the district court order certifying the class for the period beginning january and ending august,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.each party shall bear its own costs of appeal.

we recognize that several courts,including the district court in this case,have characterized the determination of whether a particular market is efficient as a question of fact.see,in re polymedica.sec,citing in re laser arms.sec,stating that w hether in fact defendant company traded in an efficient market is a question of fact.because this determination involves the application of the definition of efficiency to a particular market,however,we think it is more accurate to characterize this determination as a mixed question of law and fact.
assuming the plaintiff gets the benefit of the rebuttable presumption at the stage,the defendant may still rebut this presumption at trial.according to the court in basic,a ny showing that severs the link between the alleged misrepresentation and either the price received or paid by the plaintiff,or his decision to trade at a fair market price,will be sufficient to rebut the presumption of reliance.at.
in addition,the plaintiff must prove that the defendant made public misrepresentations that the misrepresentations were material,that there is a substantial likelihood that such misrepresentations would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available,and would induce a reasonable,relying investor to misjudge the value of the
