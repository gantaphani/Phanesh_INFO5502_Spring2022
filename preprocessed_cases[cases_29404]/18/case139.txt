this case involves an effort by a judgment creditor to reach both certain assets of the debtor nominally owned by the debtor wife,and all assets owned by the debtor alleged corporate alter ego,kalif trading.the judgment creditor is goya foods,a major business founded in the which is now a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in new jersey.the debtor is ulpiano,known as charles,and his bankruptcy estate.the factual background and prior proceedings are as follows.
from the late until,charles served as one of the chief officers of goya,a company founded by his father.in june,in a quarrel among family members,charles was dismissed and litigation ensued.as a result of settlements in and,charles received more than million from goya and,in exchange,gave up his interest in goya.charles also agreed not to bring any further claim or suit regarding his father will or estate.the agreement provided for liquidated damages of twice the winning side litigation expenses,including attorney fees,if any signatory wrongfully initiated new litigation against another signatory.
in,charles made a claim for a share of the inheritance from his parents,and litigation in new jersey state court followed,with his brothers seeking a declaration that charles had no interest in either his father estate or his inter vivos trust.in,while the new jersey litigation proceeded,charles filed for bankruptcy in puerto rico,and his bankruptcy estate thereafter became a party to the new jersey litigation.in february,the new jersey court entered a judgment against both charles and his estate for about million,representing liquidated damages for goya,a signatory of the settlement that charles had violated by making his inheritance claims 
meanwhile,prior to this new jersey judgment,goya had begun adversary proceedings in charles bankruptcy case in puerto rico,asserting that charles was concealing his own assets under the names of his wife,liliane,and two other companies,emperor equities,a delaware corporation wholly owned by liliane,and kalif trading,a panamanian corporation which was organized by charles on september,the bankruptcy court dismissed charles bankruptcy case without granting him a discharge.in re,slip op.at.
in november,nine months after obtaining the new jersey judgment for million,goya brought the present action in federal district court in puerto rico against charles,liliane,and kalif trading,seeking to enforce the new jersey judgment against charles and against properties that goya claimed belonged to charles but were held in the name of liliane or kalif trading.a bench trial ensued in the district court in july,and both charles and liliane testified.on october,the court filed a lengthy decision in goya favor,goya foods.clarifying amendments to the judgment followed on march and december.
the district court concluded that charles was the true owner of specified cash,securities and various real properties held in the names of liliane,emperor equities,and kalif trading.the court rejected as false assertions by charles and liliane that kalif trading was owned by a wealthy arab who did not appear at trial,and that a supposed fortune inherited by liliane from her family accounted for various of the real properties held in her name.
the judgment,as finally amended,determined that kalif trading was charles alter ego and was therefore responsible for the new jersey judgment to the full extent of its assets.as for liliane,the court judgment provided that goya could execute only against the following the proceeds of the sutton house apartment liliane had earlier owned in new york but since sold any residence registered to her name,including the fuengirola,malaga,spain villa,and the paris apartment and the stock of emperor equities,all of which was held in liliane name,and which the court directed liliane to deposit with the court.
charles,liliane and kalif trading have now appealed from the district court judgment.they contest the findings of fact and legal conclusions that led the district court to impose liability for the new jersey judgment on property held in the name liliane,kalif trading and emperor equities.they also contend that the statute of limitations and a contractual release debar goya claims and say that the district court committed various procedural errors.we consider the merits of those arguments that have not been forfeited.
kalif trading.it is easiest to begin with the district court treatment of kalif trading,an company that charles organized in and for which he and liliane have had general power of attorney since incorporation.in november,charles transferred over million to kalif trading in assets from his own securities account.at about this time,he ceased to pay alimony to a former wife and also stopped paying taxes,claiming that he no longer had any income or assets.in august,kalif trading was also given title of a penthouse apartment in puerto rico previously held by emperor equities and apparently acquired with charles assets.
at trial,charles claimed that kalif trading was owned by one mohammed kalif,but the court found that there was no evidence that mohammed kalif existed he did not appear at trial,and that the company was a vehicle used by charles to conceal his own assets.this finding was supported not only by charles effective control of the assets,but also by his use of kalif trading bank accounts to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in bills for charles and his wife,by the transfer of assets from charles to kalif trading,and by the timing of kalif trading creation.
in imposing liability on kalif trading,the district court applied new york law,after finding that puerto rico courts would apply a most significant contacts test,capen american trading prod,cir,and that new york contacts with transactions involving kalif trading were greater than those of any other relevant jurisdiction.the brief filed for liliane and kalif trading does not dispute the decision to apply new york law charles does so in his reply brief,but his arguments are terse,unpersuasive and too late,cir 
under new york law,the corporate veil may be disregarded where the challenger shows two facts complete domination of the corporation by its alleged alter ego,and use of that domination to commit a fraud or wrong against the plaintiff.morris new york state dep t of taxation,see also new york easton,misc d.although veil piercing is usually employed to make an individual or a corporate parent liable for the debts of a corporation,reverse piercing which makes the corporation liable for the debts of its owner or parent is allowed under new york law where the assets at issue are held by the target corporation and the liability is that of the individual who dominates the corporation and is using it to perpetrate a fraud or wrong.passalacqua builders,resnick developers,cir.
it may be open to dispute whether kalif trading was initially formed for the purpose of shielding assets from goya.although the district court decision so suggests,new york law requires clear and convincing evidence of such fraud,lowendahl baltimore ohio,aff,and such evidence seems lacking because kalif trading formation and the transfer of charles assets to it took place after charles original litigation with goya had been settled in and and before charles made his claim for a share of his parents estate.
nevertheless,even if kalif trading origin is not tainted by fraud,new york still permits veil piercing where the corporate vehicle is being used to inflict wrongful or inequitable consequences.tns holdings,mki sec.new york courts have held that this test can be satisfied when a corporation is a mere shell dominated and controlled by another for the latter own purposes.guptill holding new york,aff,is inapposite here because,given charles denial of ownership of kalif trading,there is no easy way for goya to levy directly on charles formal ownership interest in kalif trading.
there is ample proof that kalif trading is effectively the alter ego of created it,initially funded it with his own assets,managed it,and paid his own and his wife expenses with its assets.whether or not it was originally created to shield assets from creditors,it is not a business separate from charles,and there is no indication it has any owners other than charles.it appears to us,as to the district court,to be nothing other than charles himself under another name,and therefore under new york law it is permissible to strip away the corporate fig leaf.
assets in liliane name.the claim as to liliane assets is more complicated.in,liliane and charles took joint title to an apartment in san juan,puerto rico,and in,during the earlier round of litigation between charles and goya,the title to the apartment was transferred to emperor equities,a delaware corporation wholly owned by liliane.during and after,the year in which charles received the first installment of payments from goya,liliane and emperor equities developed a pattern of real estate acquisitions in which they obtained title to other luxury residences in puerto rico,new york,france,and spain.
at trial,liliane claimed that these properties had been acquired with assets provided by her once wealthy bulgarian family.however,the district court concluded that this story was untrue,being uncorroborated and inconsistent with other evidence.it also concluded that the properties in question had been purchased by charles,who used and enjoyed all of the residences and in many occasions referred to them as his own in letters to third parties.goya foods.at.in substance,the court found that charles was hiding his assets in the name of his wife for the purpose of impairing his creditors.id.
liliane brief makes no persuasive attack on the district court findings,which we find were adequately supported.rather,the brief concentrates its criticism on the district court theory of liability.because the district court described liliane as charles alter ego in relation to the acquisitions,liliane says that the district court wrongly applied to a human being a theory that is only valid in relation to corporations.see,bednarik,utah an individual can not be the alter ego of another.further,says liliane,property held in her name belongs to her even if it were assumed that liliane obtained her properties with charles money and not with her own 
the district court use of the alter ego language to describe the relationship between charles and liliane may be new york decision appears to use it in such in new york the property of one spouse certainly is not automatically subject to seizure for the debts of the other spouse.but new york courts have used the equitable theory of constructive trust to allow a creditor to execute judgment on assets nominally owned by someone other than the debtor but,based on the court findings,actually owned by the debtor himself it appears to us that,in using the alter ego language,the district court meant only that the properties in question were charles property but were merely held in his wife name.
in some circumstances,even an intended transfer of ownership can be set aside.for example,if a specific transfer from one spouse to another were made without consideration to defraud a creditor,a different set of new york doctrines actual or constructive fraud could be invoked,see scola morgan,jur d creditors rts.remedies but in this case there are no detailed findings with respect to each of the individual transactions at issue that would establish fraudulent intent,see in re montclair homes,or constructive fraud,see debtor creditor law mckinney,nor did the district court purport to make such findings.
however,under the theory of constructive trust,no such specific findings are required if the purchases were with charles own funds,the transfers of title to charles wife liliane were merely nominal,and the parties intended that charles continue to possess beneficial ownership of the properties.see bankers sec.life ins.soc y shakerdge.this,in substance,is what the district court found.it does not make liliane personally liable for her husband debts but it does mean that the property which he beneficially owns but which happens to be held in her name can be reached through the constructive trust doctrine for the benefit of his creditors.
here,the circumstantial evidence of an implicit understanding is strong.the timing of transactions in relation to prospective litigation,charles continued treatment of the properties as his own,the parallels to the deceptive operation of kalif trading,and the inferences to be drawn from liliane baseless claim that the properties were paid for with family funds all contribute to the conclusion that the real estate in question was charles and not liliane.given that charles and liliane agreement could be inferred from the circumstances,see in re estate of knappen,cert.denied,there is enough to sustain the district court assessment of the situation under a clear error standard.
two new york cases,not cited by the parties,make clear that a constructive trust is not automatically justified to undo a property transfer between spouses even when the purpose of the transfer in each case,one involving the marital residence is to protect against present or future claims by the creditors of the transferring spouse however,those cases are distinguishable,for they involved what the new york courts found to be genuine transfers that occurred without an understanding between the parties that the property would remain that of the transferring spouse.in our case,by contrast,the thrust of the district court findings is that ownership was conveyed in name only.
this lack of an effective conveyance and the resulting applicability of constructive trust theory also answers the argument of charles and liliane that the statute of limitations bars the effort to reach property held in liliane name.although the new york statute of limitations requires that suit based on fraudulent conveyance be brought within six years of the transfer or two of discovery actual or constructive of the fraud,wall assocs.brodsky,that is not the theory of recovery.in the case of a constructive trust,the limitations period six years,maric piping,maric,begins to run only when the wrongful withholding occurs,augustine szwed,accord whalen gerzof,and the original date of transfer is not relevant.
the district court rationale justifies its judgment to the extent that it recognizes goya right to execute against the identified real property held in liliane name,specifically,the mentioned above properties in new york,paris,and malaga.however,despite its broad literal wording,goya foods.at,we do not construe the district court judgment as extending to any residence held in liliane name that has not yet been identified in this litigation.the constructive trust doctrine can not easily be applied to property whose identity and circumstances of acquisition are unknown.
emperor equities.next,we consider the various issues raised by liliane ownership of emperor equities.one set of the real properties at issue were three condominium apartments in puerto rico.one was acquired by charles in,title being taken in the joint names of charles and liliane in,during charles litigation with goya,this property was transferred to emperor,a corporation whose sole shareholder was liliane.two further condominiums in san juan were acquired in,after charles received a large initial payment from goya.they too became properties of emperor.one was transferred in to kalif trading,but the other remained in emperor name until being sold to a third party in.
despite its involvement in charles and liliane real estate transactions,emperor was not named as a defendant in goya district court action seeking to reach assets of charles held in the names of third parties.liliane says that this is because emperor was a delaware corporation and,as this was also true of goya,naming emperor as a defendant would have destroyed diversity jurisdiction.strawbridge curtiss,cranch.liliane says that it was an error for the district court to order emperor,a to the litigation,to forfeit its property,since emperor was not itself a party to the case.
the short answer is that the district court judgment did not purport to reach properties held by emperor at all.instead,as clarifie
