ii.corporations code,section 
this appeal is from a special proceeding conducted pursuant to section of the corporations code and is expressly authorized by that statute,subd.c.therefore,we begin by reviewing the statutory procedure.
the present case involves a voluntary dissolution proceeding.shareholders of a corporation who represent percent or more of the voting power may elect to wind up and dissolve that corporation by initiating a voluntary dissolution proceeding.the special proceeding established by section enable s a percent shareholder to avoid dissolution of the corporation by purchasing the stock of the shareholder s seeking to dissolve the corporation.abrams associates d.abrams.this procedure,which also applies in involuntary proceedings,reflects the legislature interest in preserving the corporate enterprise as a going concern if desired by the majority or by the other owners and is intended to be a meaningful alternative to termination of the enterprise.legis.com,west annotated,ed.
section states that,when a voluntary proceeding has been initiated by the vote of shareholders representing only percent of the voting power the moving parties,the corporation or the holders of the other percent of the voting power the purchasing parties may avoid the dissolution of the corporation and the appointment of any receiver by purchasing for cash the shares owned by the moving parties at their fair value,subd.a.
fair value is defined in section as the liquidation value as of the valuation date but taking into account the possibility,if any,of sale of the entire business as a going concern in a liquidation,subd.a.in other words,section expressly requires that the going concern value of the corporation be reflected in the fair value price.the reason for this requirement is that a liquidation does not necessarily contemplate that the assets will be sold piecemeal and the goodwill of the business sacrificed by a termination of the business.marsh,et,cal.corporation law ed.supp.vol,c.it may be possible to sell the entire business as a going concern in liquidation.if that is true,then the moving parties should be entitled to a value which takes into account that possibility,since such a sale of the entire business as a going concern could be made in the liquidation if the dissolution were permitted to proceed.ibid.
anticipating that opposing parties in a dissolution proceeding may not agree as to the fair value of the moving parties shares,the legislature established a procedure for determining that fair value.if the purchasing parties elect to purchase the shares of the moving parties but the parties can not agree upon the fair value of those shares,the purchasing parties may apply to the superior court to stay the dissolution proceeding and ascertain and fix the fair value of the shares owned by the moving parties,subd.b.in such an event,the court shall appoint three disinterested appraisers to appraise the fair value of the shares owned by the moving parties,and shall make an order referring the matter to the appraisers so appointed for the purpose of ascertaining such value the award of the appraisers or a majority of them,when confirmed by the court,shall be final and conclusive upon all parties,subd.c.
the court must then enter a decree which shall provide in the alternative for winding up and dissolution of the corporation unless payment is made for the shares within the time specified by the decree,subd.c.if the purchasing parties desire to prevent the winding up and dissolution,they shall pay to the moving parties the value of their shares ascertained and decreed within the time specified in the decree or fixed on appeal.upon receiving such payment,the moving parties shall transfer their shares to the purchasing parties,subd.d.in other words,once the fair value is set pursuant to section,the purchasing parties have the right,but no corresponding obligation,to purchase the moving parties shares at the fair value price,subd.d.
with this statutory framework in mind,we turn to the facts which led to this appeal.
iii.statement of facts and procedural background 
bay world is a california corporation that sells and exports meat and meat.mart and severson are each shareholders and are both directors of the corporation.
on february,mart signed a written consent of shareholders to the election to wind up and dissolve bay world.mart delivered this written consent to severson the following day at a meeting of bay world board of directors.that same day,severson gave mart notice of his intent to sue mart for breach of fiduciary duty because mart was allegedly attempting to establish a business that would compete with bay world 
on february,mart filed a petition in the superior court pursuant to section requesting court supervision of the voluntary winding up of bay world.according to the petition,court supervision was necessary because the shareholders were divided into factions and the board of directors was deadlocked with regard to management and direction of the corporation.the directors could not agree on a plan of dissolution or liquidation and internal dissention threatened to substantially delay completion of the dissolution process absent court assistance.
on march,severson exercised his right under section to have bay world purchase mart shares at their fair value in order to avoid corporate dissolution.on april,the honorable ronald quidachay stayed dissolution of bay world and initiated the process of selecting a panel of three disinterested appraisers to value mart shares thereafter,the court appointed one appraiser selected by mart and one selected by severson and then ordered those two to select a third who was then confirmed by the court.the three appraisers,kpmg consulting,llc,sierra capital advisors,llc,and law and economics consulting group,llc,submitted a joint report dated november,november report.according to the november report,the appraisers worked together to determine the fair value of bay world,all understood their study was being made pursuant to section of the corporations code,and the opinions expressed in the report were the consensus opinions of all three appraisers.
the appraisers defined fair value as it is defined in section,t he liquidation value as of the valuation date but taking into account the possibility,if any,of sale of the entire business as a going concern in a liquidation.the appraisers expressly stated that we believe the company would be sold as a going concern.therefore,they concluded that a cost approach valuation method,which focuses exclusively on the assets and liabilities of the corporation,was not applicable.instead,the appraisers employed two alternate valuation methods,the income approach and the market approach because these approaches provide a more realistic indication of what bay world would be sold for as a going concern the november report sets forth the following ultimate conclusion based on our analysis,which relied in part on information and data supplied by the company,our conclusion of the fair value of percent of the common stock of bay world as of february,is million dollars.
on december,severson filed a motion to remand the november report.severson argued the appraisers valuation methods were erroneous because they resulted in a calculation of bay world fair market sale value rather than its liquidation value as required by california law.a hearing on severson motion was held on january,before the honorable james robertson.initially,the court expressed the opinion that the appraisers analysis was proper.however,severson counsel maintained that the report was ambiguous as to whether the appraisers had calculated a liquidation value.ultimately,the court decided to request clarification from the appraisers.
on january,the court filed an order instructing the appraisers to submit a supplemental letter further explaining their november valuation of bay world.the order inquired whether the appraisers calculated the liquidation value of bay world or its sale value as a going concern in liquidation.the term liquidation value was not defined in the order.the order set forth several additional questions,including whether the appraisers adjusted their valuation to reflect a forced sale under court supervision,how the valuation differed from a standard fair market valuation,and whether the appraisers considered threatened litigation against the corporation.finally,the appraisers were asked whether they considered the effect of potential competition when calculating bay world value and specifically whether they assumed a covenant not to compete on the part of the shareholders and directors in determining fair value.
on january,the appraisers sent a detailed and again unanimous letter to the court responding to the inquiries in the january order january letter.the appraisers equated the liquidation value method referred to in the court order to the cost approach which,as was stated in the november report,was not applicable.under this approach,the fixed and other tangible assets of the company are sold piecemeal,the liabilities are retired,and the remaining equity after expenses,if any,is distributed to the shareholders.according to the appraisers,this approach is used to value companies that are insolvent or incapable of earning a return adequate to support the value of the assets.each of the appraisers considered the piecemeal liquidation value of bay world,but all three independently concluded that value was irrelevant in light of bay world historical earnings record and future earnings capability.
the appraisers repeated their unanimous opinion that bay world would be sold as a going concern in liquidation.they explained that,as of the valuation date,a seller simply would not accept the piecemeal liquidation value as valid because it would not reflect the value of the intangible assets of the business,such as the brand name and client relationships,which is best reflected through going concern,approaches.the appraisers advised that they did interpret fair value to mean the price that would be received for the corporation in a liquidation sale under court supervision,assuming a tainted sale environment and a forced seller.the appraisers took these factors into account when conducting their analysis.
the appraisers also advised the court that they had considered whether actual or threatened litigation against bay world affected its value,but concluded it did not.the appraisers expressly found that severson lawsuit against mart did not affect bay world value as of the valuation date for several reasons,including the facts that the litigation was primarily personal in nature and that bay world operations had not been materially impacted by mart activities previous to the date of value.
finally,the appraisers explained that they did not adjust their valuation to account for potential competition on the part of the shareholders.relying on california authority construing section,the appraisers assumed hypothetical covenants not to compete would be executed by both shareholders and key employees in a sale of the company on the date of value.the appraisers also explained that,although they had not attempted to estimate the impact on value if such agreements were not signed,it was their opinion that a sale of the company as a going concern would be very difficult,if not impossible,in such a circumstance.
a continued hearing was scheduled for february.prior to that hearing,the court issued a tentative ruling requiring mart to submit a agreement as a condition for the court approval of the appraisers valuation of bay world.at the hearing,the court continued the matter to give mart time to prepare such an agreement.
the hearing was continued to february.at the hearing,the court expressed the view that bay world could be valued as a going concern business only if mart executed a valid covenant not to compete with bay world.the court also expressed concern that such a covenant was not in place as of the valuation date.mart counsel produced a agreement that mart had signed.severson counsel objected to the agreement as untimely.the court concluded that the proffered agreement was too narrow but suggested that mart attempt to draft an alternative agreement that would afford bay world more protection.in the meantime,the court would request that the appraisers calculate a piecemeal liquidation value for bay world.
in an order filed february,the court remanded the appraisers november report and instructed the appraisers to calculate the piecemeal liquidation value of bay world as of february.the order also granted mart leave to submit an alternative covenant not to compete,which the court would consider at the next hearing.
on march,the appraisers submitted their liquidation value analysis which set forth the following conclusion based on our study,our opinion of the liquidation value of bay world as of the valuation date is one million four hundred eighty thousand dollars.
at a hearing on april,the court concluded that the million liquidation value was to be used rather than the greater sum.the court found that a revised agreement mart had submitted prior to the hearing was not fully effective and did not give an absolute guarantee that mart would not compete with bay world.the court found that,even if such a guarantee could be provided now,it was too late because such an agreement did not exist as of the valuation date.
on april,the court filed a decree and judgment winding up and dissolving bay world if confirmed value of shares is not paid and for award of expenses april decree.the april decree set forth the procedure pursuant to which bay world severson could exercise their option to purchase mart shares of bay world for a payment of,plus interest in order to prevent dissolution of the corporation.among other things,the april decree stated that the appraisers march,supplementary report determining the piecemeal liquidation value of bay world trading to be as of the february,valuation date is confirmed and is final and conclusive upon all parties.the decree further stated the court finds that the award was premised upon the execution of an effective covenant not to compete by the parties and that no such covenant has been submitted to the court.as the court has doubts that any effective covenant not to compete could ever be executed,the court adopts the piecemeal liquidation value determined by the appraisers in their march,supplementary report.
on june,mart filed a notice of appeal 
iv.discussion 
mart contends the april decree must be reversed because the trial court determination of the fair value of bay world shares was erroneous as a matter of law.the factual aspects of the court fair value determination are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard.see,winograd american broadcasting th,d.however,the superior court interpretation of the statutory standard set forth in section is subject to de novo review on appeal.see,california teachers san diego community college dist.cal d,see also,eisenberg,et,cal.practice guide civil appeals and writs the rutter group.
the trial court found that the fair value of bay world shares was its piecemeal liquidation value.this conclusion is not supported by substantial evidence and resulted from an erroneous application of the section definition of fair value.
the overwhelming evidence in this record indicates that the fair value of of bay world shares as of the valuation date is.that was the unanimous conclusion of all three disinterested appraisers and that conclusion is supported by the appraisers november report and their january letter to the court clarifying that report.indeed,we find no contrary evidence in the appellate record.the trial court conclusion that bay world fair value was is not supported by the evidence.the appraisers all agreed that this fig
