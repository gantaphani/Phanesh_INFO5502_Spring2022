gary wolf,author of the novel who censored roger rabbit,and his company cry wolf,collectively cry wolf appeal from the judgment entered after a jury awarded only limited damages in their breach of contract action alleging walt disney pictures and television disney had failed to fully compensate cry wolf for its exploitation of the cartoon characters depicted in wolf novel.cry wolf contends the special verdict form unfairly highlighted disney theory of the case the trial court erred in granting disney motions for nonsuit and directed verdict in connection with several of cry wolf claims and the court imposed an incorrect rate of prejudgment interest.disney including parent company and disney enterprises,also appeals from the judgment,contending the trial court erred by submitting legal questions to the jury,denying its motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and awarding costs to cry wolf as the prevailing party.although we reject most of the arguments raised in cry wolf appeal and disney,we reverse the judgment to the extent it is based on an erroneous interpretation of the term purchaser in the parties agreements and remand the matter for further proceedings necessary to correct the impact of that error 
factual and procedural 
the creation of the roger rabbit characters 
in the novel who censored roger rabbit,initially published in,wolf created the original characters of roger rabbit,jessica rabbit,baby herman and eddie valiant the roger rabbit characters and toontown,the place where wolf cartoon characters live.shortly after the novel was published,disney expressed interest in acquiring the rights to it.in wolf agreed in a short form option agreement to grant disney an option to purchase all rights in the novel,exclusive of certain limited publishing rights.
the agreement 
in disney exercised its option to purchase the rights to the novel.the parties entered into a written purchase agreement the agreement executed on disney behalf by ronald miller,then president of walt disney productions.the agreement,which superseded the short form option agreement,expressly granted disney the right to exploit the characters from the novel in a wide variety of contexts,including the right to produce television programs and motion pictures based on the book,the right to make and sell representations of wolf characters in connection with merchandising and advertising and to otherwise promote the roger rabbit franchise.under the terms of the agreement,disney was under no obligation to exercise any of the rights granted to it and could assign or license any and all rights granted to it under the agreement as it s aw fit.in exchange,disney agreed to give wolf percent of any motion picture net profits and percent of the gross receipts it derived from its exploitation of the roger rabbit characters.the term gross receipts was not defined in the agreement.
the settlement agreement 
the movie who framed roger rabbit,coproduced by disney,was based on wolf novel.following the film extraordinary success,a dispute arose between wolf and disney as to wolf entitlement to compensation for disney exploitation of the roger rabbit characters.wolf,through cry wolf,and disney resolved their dispute by entering into a new agreement the settlement agreement.in the settlement agreement disney obtained the rights to wolf sequel to the novel.that agreement also granted cry wolf audit rights relating to disney accountings for the revenues derived from its exploitation of the roger rabbit characters.by its terms,the agreement was intended to amend and supplement the agreement,not to supplant or supersede it.as both cry wolf and disney acknowledge,the settlement agreement did not alter the agreement provisions relating to cry wolf entitlement to merchandising royalties as a percentage of disney gross receipts.
cry wolf lawsuit 
cry wolf initiated the instant lawsuit in may,after concluding that several audits of disney financial records had disclosed unreported and underreported revenue streams in relation to the merchandising of the roger rabbit characters.in the operative second amended complaint,cry wolf asserted causes of action for breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and sought declaratory relief and an accounting.as to the breach of contract claim,cry wolf alleged disney had failed to report as part of its gross receipts the value in promotional benefits it had received from various agreements with third parties such as burger king,mcdonalds and eckard kodak in which disney licensed to those companies the right to exploit the roger rabbit characters in exchange for the companies agreement to promote the roger rabbit franchise.in addition,cry wolf alleged disney had underreported or failed to report its gross receipts in connection with disney sales of roger rabbit merchandise at various disney venues sales of roger rabbit merchandise available exclusively at disneyland,walt disney world and the disney store merchandise and domestic sales of record,tape or compact discs connected with the roger rabbit characters.finally,cry wolf alleged disney had failed to compensate it for the nonmerchandising uses of the roger rabbit characters at disney foreign theme parks.
disney responded to the complaint by filing a demurrer to the breach of fiduciary duty cause of action.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend on the ground there was no fiduciary relationship between disney and cry wolf,a conclusion this court affirmed when we denied on the merits cry wolf petition for a writ of mandate seeking to vacate the trial court order.see wolf superior court th,d wolf i.
following its successful demurrer to the cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty,disney answered the complaint and filed its own asserting causes of action for declaratory relief,reformation,money had and received and unjust enrichment disney alleged that it not only had adhered to its obligations under the agreement and settlement agreement,but also had overpaid cry wolf.according to disney,in computing cry wolf royalties,it had erroneously paid a percentage of the gross receipts of all disney entities involved in the exploitation of the roger rabbit characters instead of receipts earned by walt disney productions and its successor in interest,disney enterprises,the disney parent company that had entered into the agreement and the settlement agreement.disney sought return of those overpayments and a judicial determination in the form of declaratory relief that,under the agreement,as amended by the settlement agreement,it had no obligation to pay cry wolf the value of its promotional agreements for which it received only nonmonetary consideration a royalty in connection with its use of the roger rabbit characters in its theme parks or a royalty in connection with its resale of merchandise.
disney summary adjudication motion 
in october disney moved for summary adjudication of its claim seeking a judicial determination it had no obligation to pay cry wolf for nonmonetary consideration received in connection with its promotional agreements with third parties.disney argued the clear and unambiguous meaning of the term gross receipts in the agreement could only include receipt of cash money wolf argued the term was ambiguous,proffering with his opposition papers expert testimony that the term gross receipts was commonly understood in the entertainment industry to refer to both the total amount of money and the value of all nonmonetary consideration received unless otherwise expressly specified in the contract.
the trial court granted disney summary adjudication motion.cry wolf petitioned this court for a writ of mandate,arguing triable issues of material fact existed as to the meaning of the term gross receipts and whether it was intended to include the value of nonmonetary benefits disney received in connection with its promotional agreements.following briefing and oral argument,we granted the petition and directed the trial court to vacate its summary adjudication order on the ground the evidence established the term gross receipts as used in the agreement was ambiguous and triable issues of fact existed as to whether that term was intended to include the value of nonmonetary benefits.see wolf superior court th,d wolf ii.
the bifurcated jury trial phase one 
disney successful motions for nonsuit 
the case was tried to a jury in bifurcated proceedings.phase one of the jury trial in march was directed to the intended meaning of certain contractual terms such as gross receipts that had been determined to present triable issues of fact for the jury to resolve.at the conclusion of cry wolf,the trial court granted disney motions for nonsuit on cry wolf contract claims for a royalty in connection with the nonmerchandising uses of the roger rabbit characters at disney theme parks and a royalty on disney resale of merchandise.
b.the special verdict and the court order granting disney motion for a directed verdict on cry wolf claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing 
after disney concluded its evidentiary presentation and rested its case in phase one,it moved for a directed verdict on the claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.the trial court did not immediately rule on the motion.meanwhile,the issues were submitted to the jury.in a special verdict form the jury was asked to decide certain contract interpretation issues,including whether the term gross receipts was intended to include the value of any nonmonetary consideration disney received in connection with its promotional agreements.
the jury concluded the term gross receipts meant monetary consideration or nonmonetary consideration only if and when it was turned into monies by disney.it rejected cry wolf contention gross receipts included the value of nonmonetary benefits disney received in connection with its promotional agreements with third parties.the jury also found the term purchaser in the agreement referred to disney and its subsidiaries,rejecting disney contention the agreement bound only walt disney productions,its successors and assigns,and not its subsidiaries.
after the jury returned its special verdict,the court concluded there was no evidence from which a jury could find a breach of the implied covenant and granted disney pending directed verdict motion.
the bifurcated jury trial phase two 
phase two of the jury trial was directed to whether and in what amount disney had underreported gross receipts relating to merchandise sales of the roger rabbit characters.in a second special verdict the jury determined disney had underreported its gross receipts for merchandise sold at walt disney world,disneyland and the disney store by,and,respectively,entitling cry wolf to,percent of those gross receipts.the jury also determined cry wolf was owed an additional in royalties for record,tape and compact disc revenues involving the roger rabbit characters.
the court denied disney motions for new trial and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.on june,the trial court entered judgment in favor of cry wolf.the judgment awarded cry wolf in damages including that disney had conceded at trial it had withheld based on a interpretation of the agreement that the jury ultimately found erroneous,in prejudgment interest and for costs of suit.both cry wolf and disney filed timely appeals from the judgment.
discussion 
wolf.the special verdict form was not improper relevant proceedings 
to promote the theatrical and home video releases of the film who framed roger rabbit,as well as the roger rabbit franchise generally,disney entered into promotional agreements in which it licensed the right to exploit the roger rabbit characters to a variety of retailers of consumer products.the agreements allowed the third parties to use the roger rabbit characters as a promotion with its own products.for example,mcdonalds featured the roger rabbit characters on its cups and promoted the roger rabbit movie and the roger rabbit franchise at the same time it advertised its own menu items.on some occasions disney received cash for these licensing rights.other times,disney simply received substantial promotional benefits in lieu of cash.
a central issue in phase one was the meaning of the term gross receipts,left undefined in both the agreement and the settlement agreement,as it related to these promotional agreements.cry wolf contended the term included not only the monetary consideration disney received in connection with licensing agreements,but also the value of any nonmonetary consideration obtained in connection with the promotional agreements,which cry wolf valued at million.in support of that theory,cry wolf presented the trial testimony of david held,a former executive vice president of business and legal affairs at paramount pictures,who testified it was custom and practice in the entertainment industry to use the term gross receipts to refer both to money and all other valuable benefits received.
disney,for its part,argued the term gross receipts was intended to include only monies actually received and nonmonetary payments that were and could be monetized,that is,recorded in the book of accounts.it offered evidence relating to the writers guild of america wga basic agreement,which afforded screenwriters a merchandising royalty based on a percentage of absolute gross,defined in the wga basic agreement as monies remitted.disney expert witness,schuyler moore,an entertainment and tax lawyer and adjunct professor of entertainment law at the university of california,los angeles,testified the wga definition of absolute gross,a synonym for gross receipts,had become the commonly understood meaning of gross receipts throughout the entertainment industry.
both cry wolf and disney submitted proposed special verdict forms.initially cry wolf suggested the jury be given a single question does the term gross receipts as used in paragraph of the agreement and paragraph of the agreement include the value of the noncash benefits or other consideration received by disney as a result of its promotional agreements with third parties such as mcdonalds and coca cola disney insisted a special verdict that did not indicate how the jury arrived at its definition of gross receipts was insufficient.thus,in addition to inquiring as to the ultimate the parties intend ed to use the phrase gross receipts to mean monies received,including nonmonetary consideration or benefit received if and when turned into monies or monies received and the value of other consideration or benefit whether or not received and whether or not it is or can be turned into monies it proposed a special jury verdict form that included several additional questions directed to whether each of the individuals who negotiated the option agreement,the agreement and the settlement agreement was aware of the wga basic agreement and took that agreement into account in negotiating those agreements on behalf of cry wolf and disney 
cry wolf argued disney questions relating to the wga agreement were unduly repetitive and unfairly highlighted disney version of the case that is,that the wga definition of absolute gross in the basic agreement reflected the common understanding of the term gross receipts in the entertainment industry.ultimately,after several proposed revisions and an extensive hearing on the matter,the court concluded the special verdict form should contain questions relating to the wga agreement so that the court can understand how the jury resolved various factual issues raised by the parties.
b.the special verdict form was not unduly prejudicial 
the use of special interrogatories in a verdict form lies within the sound discretion of the trial court,and the court determination will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion.red mountain,llc fallbrook public utility dist.th,d masonite pacific gas electric d.cry wolf has failed to show the trial court abused its discretion by including the questions in the special verdict form.although the questions concerning the wga were no doubt repetitive,they were not,as cry wolf suggests,tantamount to placing the trial court imprimatur on disney theory of the case.to the contrary,the record shows the court spent a great deal of time and effort to create a form that would permit the understand the jury resolution of the underlying factual dispute relating to the custom and practice and common understanding of terms in the entertainment industry.to that end,in addition to inquiries directed to the negotiators knowledge of the wga basic agreement,the special verdict form asked a number of questions relating to the custom and practice in the industry independent of the wga basic agreement,including whether,a s used in the motion picture industry generally,the term gross receipts means monies received or monies received and the value of other consideration or benefit or whether there is no custom and practice in the motion picture industry with respect to the meaning of gross receipts.the special verdict also inquired whether it was customary to compensate participants in merchandising such as wolf based upon monies received or the value of promotional benefit whether or not that benefit can be turned into monies.read as a whole,the special verdict form embraced both disney theories and cry wolf theories relating to custom and practice in the industry.the references to the wga agreement,a pertinent piece of evidence in the case,fall far short of an abuse of the court broad discretion in these matters.see red mountain,at,d see also valentine baxter healthcare th,d selection of a more detailed special verdict form was well within the trial court discretion.
the trial court did not err by directing a verdict in favor of disney on cry wolf claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing

b.there was no breach of the implied covenant as a matter of law 
it has long been recognized in california every contract contains an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing that neither party will do anything which will injure the right of the other to receive the benefits of the agreement.kransco american empire surplus lines ins.cal th,d,see also wolf i,supra,th at,d.this covenant is read into contracts in order to protect the express covenants or promises of the contract,not to protect some general public policy interest not directly tied to the contract purpose.carma developers cal,inc marathon development california,cal th,d,carma developers.for example,covenants to use good faith or best efforts to generate profits for a licensor are routinely implied where the licensor grants exclusive promotional or licensing rights in exchange for a percentage of profits or royalties,even though the licensee does not expressly promise to do anything.see third story music,waits th,d third story music although the contract does not promise in so many words that the licensee will use its best efforts,such a promise is fairly to be implied.the law has outgrown its primitive stage of formalism when the precise word was the sovereign talisman,and every slip was fatal.it takes a broader view today.a promise may be lacking,and yet the whole writing may be instinct with an obligation,imperfectly expressed,quoting wood lucy,lady cardozo.
however,the implied covenant will only be recognized to further the contract purpose it will not be read into a contract to prohibit a party from doing that which is expressly permitted by the agreement itself.carma developers,supra,cal th at,d,t he general rule regarding the covenant of good faith is plainly subject to the exception that the parties may,by express provisions of the contract,grant the right to engage in the very acts and conduct which would otherwise have been forbidden by an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,second brackets in original.this principle is consistent with the general rule that implied terms can not vary the express terms of a contract if the defendant did what it was expressly given the right to do,there can be no breach.see also tanner title insurance trust cal d.thus,although it has been said the implied covenant finds particular application in situations where one party is invested with a discretionary power affecting the rights of another carma developers,at,d,see also locke warner,th,d,if the express purpose of the contract is to grant unfettered discretion,and the contract is otherwise supported by adequate consideration,then the conduct is,by definition,within the reasonable expectation of the parties and can never violate an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.carma developers,at,d,lessor termination of lease for lessor own financial gain was not breach of implied covenant of good faith because it was expressly permitted by the lease and therefore within parties reasonable expectations see also third story music,supra,th at,d.
at trial,cry wolf argued that,if the term gross receipts was intended to mean only monetized benefits received by disney in exchange for licensing the roger rabbit franchise,then disney breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by purposefully orchestrating promotional agreements for which it received no monetary consideration.cry wolf asserts the trial court erred in directing a verdict on that issue,thus removing it from the jury consideration.see hicks legg associates th,d whether implied covenant has been breached is ordinarily a question of fact unless only one inference can be drawn from the evidence.
contrary to cry wolf contention,there were no disputed factual issues for the jury to decide.the question was not what disney did,but whether it was authorized by the parties agreements to do it.in light of disney unfettered discretion under the agreement to license or not license the roger rabbit franchise as it saw fit,cry wolf attempt to limit that discretion by use of an implied covenant,a pure legal question of contract interpretation,is improper.see carma developers,supra,cal th at,d,see also third story music,supra,th at,d.
on this point,third story music,supra,th,d is illustrative.in third story music a music production company tsm entered into an agreement with a record company,records,a division of warner communications,warner,to produce master recordings featuring performances by one of tsm,tom waits.under tsm agreement with warner,warner received the worldwide right to manufacture,sell,distribute and advertise records or other reproductions visual or nonvisual embodying such recordings and to lease,license,convey or otherwise use or dispose of the recordings.the agreement also allowed warner to refrain from any or all of the foregoing at its sole discretion.id.at,d.in return for the rights it gave up,tsm received an initial payment and a percentage of the amount earned by warner from its exploitation of the music once realized.id.at,d.when warner refused to license a recording to which waits had objected,tsm sued warner and waits,alleging,among other things,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
the trial court sustained warner demurrer to the implied covenant claim.the court of appeal affirmed,finding it would be improper to recognize an implied covenant that would contradict the unfettered discretion expressly bargained for in the agreement c ourts are not at liberty to imply a covenant directly at odds with a contract express grant of discretionary power except in those relatively rare instances when reading the provision literally would,contrary to the parties clear intention,result in an unenforceable,illusory agreement.third story music,supra,th at,d.that is,so long as the agreement is supported by adequate consideration such that the grant of discretion does not render it illusory,the court will not recognize or enforce an implied term directly at odds with an express contractual grant of unfettered discretion.id.at,d.
here,as in the contract in third story music,supra,th,d,the agreement afforded disney the unlimited discretion to grant or not grant to third parties licenses to exploit the roger rabbit characters.cry wolf complaint that disney failure to receive monetary consideration in some but not all of its promotional agreements is unfair or unjust because it prevented him from receiving royalties in some circumstances is quite simply beside the point.it is not enough to say that without the proposed implied covenant,the contract would be improvident or unwise or would operate unjustly.parties have the right to make such agreements cry wolf was free to accept or reject the bargain offered and can not look to the courts to amend the terms that prove unsatisfactory.third story music,at,d see also storek storek,citicorp real estate,th,d.
cry wolf effort to distinguish this case from third story music,supra,th,d is unpersuasive.had disney,like warner in third story music,simply elected not to exploit the rights granted to it under the agreement,cry wolf agrees it would have no recourse against disney.however,once disney elected to enter into licensing agreements with third parties in connection with the exploitation of the roger rabbit characters,cry wolf argues,it had a duty to do so fairly and in good faith so as not to deliberately thwart cry wolf opportunity to obtain a royalty.that argument rests on a distortion of the language in the agreement,which did not merely grant disney the ability to refrain from exercising the rights conveyed,but also conferred the express authority to grant licenses to third parties in connection with the exploitation of the roger rabbit characters in any manner it saw fit.as explained,recognizing an implied term that would limit the unfettered discretion given to disney to license the characters as it saw fit would be at odds with the express terms of the agreement 
even if the agreement were susceptible to the interpretation cry wolf advances and a covenant of good faith and fair dealing could be inferred to limit the discretion given to disney in connection with the manner in which it licensed the roger rabbit characters,the directed verdict was still proper because no substantial evidence was presented from which a rational juror could find the covenant had been breached.
to establish a claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,cry wolf was required to show either disney lacked subjective good faith in the validity of its the characters to third parties for promotional benefits in lieu of monetary the act was intended to and did frustrate the common purpose of the agreement.see carma developers,supra,cal th at,d,the covenant requires the party holding such discretionary power to exercise it for any purpose within the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time of capture opportunities that were preserved upon entering the contract interpreted objectively locke warner,supra,th at,d.cry wolf argues there was sufficient evidence to find a breach of the implied covenant because the fact disney entered into promotional agreements in which it received monetary consideration demonstrates disney knew how to structure agreements that would enable cry wolf to receive a royalty.cry wolf also points to testimony from disney executives that one of the reasons disney entered into nonmonetary promotional agreements was to avoid having to account on its books for additional revenues.while cry wolf limited evidentiary summary is accurate,nothing in this evidence supports the conclusion the nonmonetary promotional agreements were designed to frustrate cry wolf right to a royalty or that all,or even most,of disney licensing agreements were structured to require only nonmonetary consideration to disney.in fact,the evidence showed many promotional agreements involving the roger rabbit characters were entered into for monetary consideration,a portion of which was given to cry wolf as royalties,as required under the agreement.there was also no evidence disney nonmonetary promotional agreements were objectively unreasonable.in fact,the undisputed evidence at trial was such agreements were customary in the entertainment industry,made good economic sense and ultimately inured to cry wolf benefit because they encouraged the purchase of movie tickets or merchandise.
cry wolf also asserts the jury could have inferred bad faith or improper intent solely from evidence disney had failed or refused to produce for cry wolf auditors copies of the nonmonetary promotional agreements.however,disney prelitigation statement of its cry wolf was not entitled to any royalties based on nonmonetary promotional licensing agreements because they did not involve receipt of any alone,is simply not sufficient evidence of subjective bad faith or objective unreasonableness to defeat a directed verdict in this case,as the jury had already found,prior to the entry of the directed verdict,that disney was correct on that issue and that gross receipts included only monetized benefits 
the trial court did not err in granting disney motions for nonsuit

b.the trial court properly granted nonsuit on cry wolf contract claim concerning disney sale of merchandise 
cry wolf alleged disney had breached paragraph h of the agreement when it refused to pay a percentage royalty on any revenue obtained from its sale of roger rabbit merchandise,that is,merchandise manufactured by a third party pursuant to a licensing agreement with disney and then purchased by disney for resale at disney venues.among other things,paragraph h grants to disney t he sole and exclusive right to make,publish and vend,throughout the world,or to license others so to make,publish and vend,representations of the roger rabbit characters in connection with articles of merchandise,or the advertising,display or exploitation of merchandise or in connection with any commercial activities.italics added.
the trial court concluded as a matter of law paragraph h granted disney two distinct merchandising rights the right to make,publish and vend the roger rabbit merchandise itself and the right to license to others the right to make,publish and vend the merchandise.when disney makes the merchandise and sells it,disney owes cry wolf a percentage of the revenue from those sales.when disney does not make and sell the merchandise itself,but licenses the right to do so to others,it owes cry wolf a percentage of the licensing fee.however,when disney purchases merchandise made pursuant to one of the licenses it has granted and sells it as a retailer at disney venues,it is neither making,publishing and vending nor licensing others to make,publish and vend.rather,it is acting like any other retailer who would buy merchandise from a wholesaler or manufacturer.
cry wolf acknowledges the issue is one of contract interpretation,but contends the agreement generally,and paragraph h in particular,are reasonably susceptible to the interpretation it cry wolf is entitled to a portion of the revenues from disney sale of merchandise.thus,cry wolf argues it was error to remove this issue from the jury by granting the motion for nonsuit.
the rules governing the role of the court in interpreting a written instrument are well established.the interpretation of a contract is a judicial function.pacific gas electric thomas drayage rigging cal d,pacific gas electric.in engaging in this function,the trial court give s effect to the mutual intention of the parties as it existed at the time the contract was executed.ordinarily,the objective intent of the contracting parties is a legal question determined solely by reference to the contract terms,w hen a contract is reduced to writing,the intention of the parties is to be ascertained from the writing alone,if possible,the language of a contract is to govern its interpretation.

here,the trial court admitted extrinsic evidence to determine whether the words in paragraph h,in particular the phrases make,publish and vend throughout the world and license others so to make,publish and vend,were ambiguous and,if so,whether the interpretation of that paragraph turned on the credibility of extrinsic evidence.finding no conflict in the extrinsic evidence,the court decided the meaning of paragraph h as a matter of law and granted the nonsuit.
in claiming the nonsuit was error,cry wolf relies exclusively on its interpretation of the testimony of robin russell,disney former senior vice president of legal and business affairs and its principal negotiator of the settlement agreement,who testified it was her understanding when negotiating the settlement agreement that cry wolf was entitled to a royalty when licensed roger rabbit merchandise was sold at disney venues.according to cry wolf,this testimony demonstrates the agreement was susceptible to the interpretation it advanced concerning its right to a royalty in connection with disney sale of merchandise.
whether or not the agreement can reasonably be read as cry wolf suggests,the proper interpretation of paragraph h does not turn on conflicting extrinsic evidence as to the meaning of the terms make,publish and vend,and there was nothing improper about the court,rather than the jury,deciding the contract interpretation issue.first,russell,who was not an employee of disney at the time of the agreement and did not participate in its negotiation,testified simply it was her understanding that disney was required to pay cry wolf a royalty when it sold roger rabbit merchandise at a disney venue she did not specify that entitlement included royalties for the sale of licensed roger rabbit merchandise more importantly,russell explained that in negotiating the settlement agreement she and cry wolf simply agreed cry wolf right to royalties for the merchandising sales of the roger rabbit characters at the theme parks as guaranteed under paragraph h of the agreement would remain unaffected by the settlement agreement thus,russell testimony that the parties agreed the agreement would control cry wolf merchandising rights has no impact on the question of the parties intent as reflected in paragraph h of the agreement.because cry wolf points to no conflict in the extrinsic evidence as to the parties objectively intended meaning of the terms at issue,the trial court interpretation of paragraph h as a matter of law,rather than submitting the issue to the jury,was entirely proper.see city of hope nat.medical center genentech,supra,cal th at,d at shaw regents of the university of california th,d when extrinsic evidence not in conflict,question of contract interpretation appropriately decided as matter of law.
cry wolf appellate brief challenges the grant of nonsuit solely on the ground the contract interpretation issue should have been given to the jury.cry wolf does not argue,even if properly decided as a matter of law,the trial court interpretation of paragraph h as applied to disney sale of merchandise was wrong.accordingly,that argument is not properly before us.see sunset drive city of redlands th,d court need not consider issues inadequately raised in appellate briefs.
c.the trial court properly granted disney motion for nonsuit on cry wolf claim to a royalty for the nonmerchandising use of the roger rabbit characters at eurodisney and tokyo disneyland 
cry wolf also challenges the order of nonsuit directed to its claim for compensation for disney uses of the roger rabbit characters at its theme parks for example,the use of the roger rabbit characters as characters or in connection with rides and attractions.cry wolf admits it waived all rights to the nonmerchandising uses of the roger rabbit characters at disney theme parks in the settlement agreement however,cry wolf argues the waiver,which expressly covered use of the roger rabbit characters in walt disney productions company theme parks and attractions,was intended to govern use of those characters only in theme parks actually owned by disney,not at independent theme parks such as eurodisney in paris or tokyo disneyland,neither of which is owned by disney but rather operates under a license agreement entitling it to use the disney name.
in arguing the nonsuit was improperly granted,cry wolf points to the testimony of david colden,the lawyer who negotiated the settlement agreement on its behalf,who said russell had expressly told him the waiver in paragraph e of the settlement agreement would not apply to any use of the roger rabbit characters at theme parks not owned by disney,such as magic mountain.cry wolf contends colden testimony alone is sufficient to defeat the nonsuit.
as was true with respect to paragraph h of the agreement,the extrinsic evidence directed to the intended meaning of the phrase walt disney productions company theme parks in paragraph e of the settlement agreement was not in conflict colden testified that,on cry wolf behalf,he had initially requested,as a condition for granting disney the sequel rights and entering into the settlement agreement,that cry wolf receive a royalty on the nonmerchandising uses of the roger rabbit characters at all disney theme parks,including eurodisney.colden and russell each testified disney had adamantly refused that request,and colden testified he believed he had lost on that issue at the time cry wolf agreed to the waiver in paragraph e of the settlement agreement.in addition,both colden and russell testified that,at the time the settlement agreement was entered into,both believed the phrase walt disney productions company theme parks in the waiver included eurodisney and the,but tokyo disneyland.there was no conflicting evidence of any intent to provide cry wolf with royalties for the uses of his characters at either eurodisney or tokyo disneyland.instead,the only evidence was that both parties had agreed that theme parks such as magic mountain were excluded from the waiver.thus,absent any conflict in the extrinsic evidence,the question whether walt disney productions company theme parks meant parks owned and operated by disney or something else was a matter of contract interpretation properly decided by the trial court as a matter of law.see city of hope nat.medical center genentech,supra,cal th at,d at parsons bristol development,supra,cal d at.
moreover,even if the waiver in the settlement agreement was reasonably susceptible to the interpretation suggested by cry is,it was strictly limited to parks,and there was a conflict in extrinsic evidence on that waiver did not confer on cry wolf any right to royalties for the nonmerchandising use of the roger rabbit characters that wolf did not enjoy under the agreement.at trial,cry wolf agreed,but claimed its right to such royalties arose from paragraph h of the agreement,which granted disney the right to exploit the roger rabbit characters in connection with any commercial activities.cry wolf argued commercial activities in paragraph h must be interpreted to include nonmerchandising use of the characters at the theme parks.yet cry wolf does not cite any extrinsic evidence in the record as to the customary meaning of commercial activities or the parties intent that the term be interpreted to include use of the roger rabbit characters as characters at theme parks.in fact,the evidence in the record is to the contrary.wolf testified he understood the agreement did not confer any right to a royalty for the nonmerchandising use of the roger rabbit characters at disney theme parks colden similarly testified that receipt of a royalty for theme park uses was a new negotiation point in the settlement agreement.absent any conflicting evidence as to the meaning of commercial activities in paragraph h of the agreement,the interpretation of that term in connection with the use of the roger rabbit characters for nonmerchandising purposes at theme parks was properly decided by the court as a matter of law.
as with its argument concerning merchandise,cry wolf argues only that the jury should have been permitted to decide the meaning of commercial activities,as well as the meaning of the phrase walt disney productions company theme parks,not that,even if properly decided by the court as a matter of law,the court interpretation of those terms in this context was erroneous.accordingly,any argument to that effect has been forfeited.sunset drive city of redlands,supra,th at,d.
the trial court did not err in concluding the proper prejudgment rate of interest is percent 
civil code section,subdivision b,provides that,when a contract entered into after january,does not provide for a legal rate of prejudgment interest,the prejudgment interest rate in a breach of contract action is percent per annum.for contracts entered prior to january,the legal rate of prejudgment interest is percent per annum.cal.const.art.xv,the rate of interest upon a judgment rendered in any court of this state shall be set by the legislature at not more than ten percent per annum.in the absence of the setting of such rate by the legislature,the rate of interest on any judgment rendered in any court of the state shall be seven percent per annum.michelson hamada th,d for agreements entered into prior to,that do not stipulate a rate of interest chargeable after breach,constitutional rate of percent per annum applies.
cry wolf contends the court erred in concluding the contract damages it received were based on the agreement and in awarding prejudgment interest at the rate of percent.it argues the controlling agreement is the settlement agreement,which amended and reaffirmed the agreement,granted cry wolf audit rights and resolved certain allocation issues.cry wolf also notes the settlement agreement added walt disney pictures as a signatory,the to walt disney pictures and television,the entity sued in the instant matter.according to cry wolf,the settlement agreement,not the agreement,governs the statutory rate of prejudgment interest to be applied.
cry wolf breach of contract claims were unquestionably based on disney failure to pay the percentage of gross receipts required by the agreement.had cry wolf claims been predicated on the new terms in the settlement agreement,for example,the grant of literary and movie rights to the novel sequel,our conclusion might be different.similarly,if the settlement agreement had superseded the agreement,we would agree it is the controlling contract.however,cry wolf complaint relies expressly on the royalty rights granted under the agreement cry wolf evidentiary presentation was largely directed to the meaning of paragraphs h and of the agreement the settlement agreement expressly refers to the rights granted by the agreement and cry wolf success at trial was based on the jury findings concerning the agreement.because the agreement provided the basis for cry wolf claims at trial,the trial court properly awarded cry wolf prejudgment interest on those claims at a rate of percent.
the trial court erred in allowing the jury to interpret the term purchaser in the agreement 
the agreement states it embodies the agreement between gary wolf,referred to as seller,on the one hand,and walt disney productions,referred to as purchaser,on the other hand.paragraph of the agreement clarifies that the term purchaser as used herein shall include the purchaser herein named walt disney productions,and also its successors,privies and assigns.
throughout this litigation,in motions for summary judgment or adjudication,motions in limine and motions for a directed verdict,disney argued cry wolf was only entitled to a royalty on the gross receipts of the purchaser,identified as walt disney productions,its successor,privies and assigns,not disney subsidiaries.the trial court,over disney objection,submitted that issue to the jury.the jury found in cry wolf favor,concluding the term purchaser included disney and future subsidiaries 
disney contends the trial court erred in submitting that question of contract interpretation to the jury and argues the court was required to decide the meaning of the term purchaser in the agreement as a matter of law.cry wolf,on the other hand,contends the issue was properly submitted to the jury because the term purchaser is ambiguous,as reflected in evidence that,for more than years,disney operated in accordance with the view that gross receipts of the purchaser meant that cry wolf was entitled to a royalty from the gross receipts earned by its subsidiaries and paid cry wolf pursuant to that understanding of its obligation.disney admitted at trial it had knowingly made those payments to cry wolf over the years,but asserted it did so based on oversight and an erroneous interpretation of the contract and argued such an arrangement was never contemplated under the agreement.
to the extent disney contends the court erred in entertaining,even provisionally,extrinsic evidence concerning conduct to demonstrate an ambiguity,it is mistaken.as we explained in wolf ii,supra,th at pages,d to,a contract apparently unambiguous on its face may still contain a latent ambiguity that can only be exposed by extrinsic evidence.see also pacific gas electric,supra,cal d at fn,crestview cemetery dieden cal d,crestview p arties to a contract have the right to place any interpretation upon its terms as they see fit,even when such an interpretation is apparently contrary to the ordinary meaning of its provisions.in this regard,predispute,postcontracting conduct is admissible to demonstrate an ambiguity.city of hope nat.medical center genentech,supra,cal th at,d at a party conduct occurring between execution of the contract and a dispute about the meaning of the contract terms may reveal what the parties understood and intended those terms to mean.for this reason,evidence of such conduct is admissible to resolve ambiguities in the contract language.crestview,at,t he acts of the parties under the contract afford one of the most reliable means of arriving at their intention.
of course,that extrinsic evidence may reveal an ambiguity subjecting a contract to more than one reasonable interpretation does not mean resolution of that ambiguity is necessarily a jury question.absent a conflict in the evidence,the interpretation of the contract remains a matter of law.city of hope nat.medical center genentech,supra,cal th at,d at parsons bristol development,supra,cal d at,new haven unified school dist.taco bell,supra,th at,d.here,the meaning of the term purchaser was not dependent on the credibility of conflicting extrinsic evidence.although wolf presented evidence that,for more than years,disney had knowingly paid wolf a royalty from the gross receipts earned by its subsidiaries,disney did not dispute that fact.instead,it claimed its payments were the product of a misunderstanding of its obligations under the controlling agreement.there was no conflict in the evidence of disney predispute conduct,and thus no factual issue for the jury to resolve absent such a conflict,the interpretation of the meaning of the term purchaser was properly a judicial function and the court erred in submitting this question to the jury.see dore arnold worldwide,supra,cal th at,d,absent conflicting extrinsic evidence,question of contract interpretation is judicial function parsons,at,same.
the term purchaser in the agreement does not include disney subsidiaries 
because interpretation of the term purchaser in the agreement is a question of law,we would review de novo the trial court interpretation of that term had it not submitted the question to the jury.see parsons bristol development,supra,cal d at,when extrinsic evidence not in conflict,interpretation of contract is question of law reviewed de novo.accordingly,notwithstanding the trial court error in failing to decide the question itself,we need not remand the matter on that point and instead proceed directly to determining the proper meaning of purchaser as used by disney and cry wolf.
under the de novo standard of review,we conclude purchaser in the agreement was intended to include walt disney productions,successors and assigns only,and not walt disney productions subsidiaries.this interpretation is based in the first instance on the express definition of the term purchaser in the agreement,which specifically includes walt disney productions,its successors and assigns and does not mention subsidiaries.the plain meaning of the actual language used by the parties is emphatically reinforced by paragraph of the same agreement,which delineates the royalties cry wolf is to receive when disney exploits the characters or licenses others to exploit the characters.paragraph provides,purchaser agrees to pay to seller a sum equal to five percent of purchaser gross receipts derived from the exercise of such rights,which,in the event of purchaser licensing of any such rights to others,shall be composed of purchaser royalties so derived from the licensee.in the event that such a licensee is a subsidiary of purchaser,then such royalties received by purchaser from such subsidiary shall be deemed to be not less than five percent of such subsidiary gross receipts derived from the exercise of such rights.
paragraph thus guarantees cry wolf payment for use of the rights granted in three distinct ways if walt disney productions exploits the roger rabbit characters itself,cry wolf receives a royalty equal to percent of walt disney productions gross receipts.if walt disney productions licenses those characters to a third party to exploit,cry wolf receives percent of the gross receipts walt disney productions derives from the granting of the license.if walt disney productions licenses the same rights to one of its own subsidiaries,then a percent minimum royalty is imputed to walt disney productions in the event it receives less than that sum in consideration from its subsidiary cry wolf is then entitled to percent of that licensing fee paid by disney subsidiaries.in other words,the imputed minimum royalty guarantees cry wolf the same royalty percentage whether walt disney productions licenses the characters to third parties or licenses it to one of its own subsidiaries.
as disney notes in its arguments to this court,the choice of language in paragraph is highly significant.when the parties intended to identify subsidiaries,they knew how to do so.moreover,if walt disney productions includes subsidiaries,the third category of exploitation identified in paragraph imputation protection little sense in effect,it would include a subsidiary licensing itself to utilize the roger rabbit characters,a meaningless concept.even more significantly,if cry wolf were entitled to a royalty on the gross receipts earned not only by walt disney productions but also by its subsidiaries,there would be no need to include any imputation protection whether walt disney productions exploited the character rights directly or licensed them to a subsidiary to exploit,cry wolf would simply receive percent of the gross receipts actually earned by the entity utilizing the roger rabbit characters.thus,when the term purchaser is interpreted in light of the contract as a whole see,whole of a contract is to be taken together,so as to give effect to every part,if reasonably practicable,each clause helping to interpret the other contract to be interpreted consistent with contractual language and to avoid absurdity,and in particular in light of paragraph,it is plain cry wolf was entitled to a royalty on the earnings of disney subsidiaries only indirectly,based on walt disney productions or its successors or assigns actual or imputed gross receipts,not those earned directly by its subsidiaries.
cry wolf argues interpreting paragraph in this manner leads to a grossly unfair result,effectively rendering its entitlement to a percent royalty meaningless.it offers the following illustration if disney were to license a third party to produce an item of merchandise and received a licensing fee of percent of the third party revenues,and the third party sold of goods,disney would be paid.cry wolf royalty would be percent of that figure.however,if disney were to create a merchandising subsidiary to do the same pay disney percent of its revenues for the right to license items of merchandise to independent third the subsidiary authorized a third party to manufacture and sell the merchandise in exchange for a percent royalty,the subsidiary would earn percent on the sale of worth of goods by the licensee or the disney subsidiary would then pay the disney parent company percent of that royalty,and the disney parent company would pay cry wolf percent of that royalty.thus,according to cry wolf,the exact same economic result for disney receipt of for licensing a third party to exploit the character rights would result in a percent diminution in cry wolf royalty.plainly,cry wolf urges,that is not the kind of protection from a sweetheart deal between parent and subsidiary bargained for in the agreement.
cry wolf hypothetical is troublesome,but the consequences of cry wolf interpretation are equally problematic.using its licenses a new merchandising subsidiary,which in turn licenses a third party to manufacture and sell roger rabbit merchandise in exchange for a percent the third party sold in licensed products,cry wolf would receive percent of the subsidiary gross receipts that is,percent of,plus percent of the fee paid by the disney subsidiary to the disney parent percent of.yet,as discussed,if the disney parent directly licensed a third party manufacturer,the same sales volume produces only in royalties for cry wolf.to paraphrase cry wolf,plainly this bonus to cry wolf for an intracorporate transfer is not the kind of protection from a sweetheart deal the parties contemplated 
whatever the extreme hypotheticals disney and cry wolf lawyers may now generate,our task is to interpret the agreement as intended at the time of contracting.paragraph plainly protects cry wolf from a sweetheart deal,making any contract between disney and one of its subsidiaries the economic equivalent of a licensing agreement between disney and a third party.in either case,cry wolf is entitled to the gross receipts of the disney parent company,whether those revenues are generated by a third party or one of its subsidiaries,not to the gross receipts earned at each level of the disney corporate structure.
we reverse the judgment because it was based,in part,on an incorrect interpretation of the term purchaser,a question the trial court improperly submitted to the jury.on remand the trial court must reassess the damages awarded to cry wolf to the extent they were dependent on the erroneous interpretation of that contract term.
the trial court erred in awarding for disney failure to pay cry wolf a percentage of its subsidiary gross receipts following initiation of this lawsuit 
after cry wolf filed this lawsuit,disney ceased paying any royalties based on the gross receipts earned by its subsidiaries.after the jury concluded that disney litigation position regarding the proper interpretation of the term purchaser in the agreement was incorrect and the gross receipts of disney subsidiaries were to be included in cry wolf royalty calculation,the court awarded cry wolf,the amount disney and cry wolf stipulated had been withheld based on disney interpretation of the agreement.in light of our conclusion that cry wolf royalty payments under the agreement did not include any entitlement to the gross receipts of disney subsidiaries,the trial court award of this amount to cry wolf was erroneous.
the trial court did not err in denying disney motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict 
standard of review 
the trial court power to grant a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is the same as its power to grant a directed verdict.code civ.a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict may be granted only if it appears from the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the party securing the verdict,that there is no substantial evidence in support.sweatman department of veterans affairs cal th,d,see also tognazzini san luis coastal unified school dist.th,d.on appeal from the denial of a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,we determine whether there is any substantial evidence,contradicted or uncontradicted,supporting the jury verdict.sweatman,at,d,hansen sunnyside products,th,d.if there is,we must affirm the denial of the motion.sweatman,at,d,hauter zogarts cal d.if the appeal challenging the denial of the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict raises purely legal questions,however,our review is de novo.see trujillo north county transit dist.th,d ordinarily,when reviewing an order denying judgment notwithstanding the verdict,appellate court considers whether there is any substantial evidence to support verdict however,when issue presented deals solely with legal question in context of undisputed facts,review of court decision is de novo.
relevant proceedings 
in connection with its contract claims,cry wolf asserted disney had underreported its gross domestic sales of records,tapes and compact discs in its participation statements.in particular,cry wolf argued disney had improperly allocated domestic revenues for those items in violation of a provision in the settlement agreement that prohibited disney from allocating revenues if its characters appeared with other disney characters on the same item of merchandise 
after the close of evidence in phase two of the trial,disney asserted for the first time,in connection with discussions with the court concerning preparation of the special verdict form,that cry wolf claim of underreporting for records,tapes and cd domestic revenue was barred by an incontestability clause in the settlement agreement because cry wolf had not submitted a written challenge to disney accounting records within the specified time limit in response,cry wolf,relying on documents admitted into evidence,argued it had satisfied the clause requirements by submitting a reservation of rights in response to disney participation statements,advising disney it had not been provided with sufficient information from which to determine if the statements were accurate.
the trial court concluded parol evidence was needed to determine whether cry wolf reservation of rights could be considered an effective objection under the contract terms and refused to consider the issue because disney had raised it too late in the proceedings the court removed the issue from consideration,ruling the statute of limitations defense is no longer part of this case.
notwithstanding the court ruling,in its closing argument disney argued the incontestability clause to the jury,not as a limitations defense,but as a failure to perform under the contract.specifically,disney argued,without objection by cry wolf or admonition from the court,that cry wolf violated the incontestability clause and thus could not demonstrate it had fully performed all of its obligations under the agreement.in a special verdict the jury found disney had underreported its revenues for records,tapes and compact discs and awarded cry wolf.
disney moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,arguing the jury was not free to disregard the undisputed evidence that cry wolf had breached the incontestability clause and thus had not fully performed its obligations under the agreement and the settlement agreement.see stop loss ins.brokers,brown toland medical group th,d party seeking to prevail on breach of contract must prove its own full performance under contract or demonstrate its performance was excused.disney also argued the jury finding it had breached the nonallocation provision in connection with the sale of records,tapes and compact discs was not supported by substantial evidence.the trial court took the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict under submission and then denied it without elaboration.
substantial evidence supports the jury implied finding cry wolf complied with the incontestability clause and thus fully performed under the agreement and the settlement agreement 
in challenging the court denial of its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,disney does not object to the trial court ruling removing the limitations defense from the case.instead,it argues,because the evidence cry wolf failed to comply with the incontestability clause was undisputed,there is no substantial evidence to support the jury implied finding that cry wolf had fully performed under the contract.disney argument,however,is predicated on the faulty premise its interpretation of the incontestability provision is necessarily correct and the evidence cry wolf consistently reserved its rights in response to disney participation statements and accountings was,therefore,insufficient to support the jury implied finding.yet that is precisely the issue the court held disney had forfeited by its delay in raising the incontestability clause as a defense.
at trial cry wolf presented documentary evidence it had reserved its rights to object,arguing that reservation was,in effect,an objection to disney failure to provide it with proper documentation from which it or its auditors could make an informed judgment about the accuracy of disney participation reports.in reaching a verdict for cry wolf on this issue,the jury necessarily found,absent evidence from either party concerning the meaning of the contract clause or the effectiveness of a reservation of rights rather than a specific objection,the reservation was sufficient to comply with the incontestability clause.whether the trial court denied disney motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the ground substantial evidence supported this implied finding or on the ground the motion was an improper attempt to resuscitate a limitations defense it had already rejected is of no consequence.either way,the motion was properly denied.
substantial evidence supports the jury finding disney breached the nonallocation provisions of the agreement 
disney also contends there is no substantial evidence to support the jury finding it violated the nonallocation provision in connection with its royalty payments for sales of records,tapes and compact discs,arguing,as it did to the jury,the provision applies only to an item of merchandise that is,a product captured by paragraph h of the agreement.records,tapes and compact discs,disney argues,are not merchandise,but are more appropriately considered children records,an item sufficiently distinguishable from merchandise that it warranted its own i in the agreement in addition,disney argues the nonallocation provision applies to an item of merchandise,not to multiple items of merchandise that are prepackaged together,as was the case with the records,tapes and compact discs at issue in this claim.
disney contends only that substantial evidence does not support the jury findings it breached the nonallocation provision.the record belies this contention.disney own participation reports and working documents,introduced into evidence,apparently showed that disney reported revenue in connection with sales of roger rabbit records,tapes and compact discs as a single item of merchandise.although disney contested cry wolf interpretation of these participation reports and argued they indicated allocations only when multiple items were prepackaged together,not when a roger rabbit character appeared together with another disney character on the same item,the jury was free to,and did,reject that characterization of the evidence,particularly in light of the absence of any evidence supporting disney explanation of what it meant by prepackaged items.because substantial evidence supported the jury findings,the trial court did not err in denying disney motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict 
on remand,the trial court should exercise its discretion to determine the prevailing party 
except as otherwise provided by statute,a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding.code civ,subd.b.code of civil procedure,section,subdivision a,identifies four categories of prevailing parties for purposes of awarding litigation costs t he party with a net monetary recovery,a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered,a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief,and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant.see also michell olick th,d.when any party recovers other than monetary relief and in situations other than as specified,the prevailing party shall be as determined by the court,and under those circumstances,the court,in its discretion,may allow costs or not and,if allowed may apportion costs between the parties on the same or adverse sides pursuant to rules adopted under section.code civ,subd.a michell,at,d.
disney contends the trial court erroneously believed cry wolf was entitled to costs as a matter of right as the party with the net monetary recovery.because its contained claims for declaratory relief on which it prevailed,disney asserts this case presents a situation other than as specified in the statute and the prevailing party is properly determined by the court in its discretion.code civ,subd.a.
under the circumstances presented by this case,the prevailing party determination is properly a matter for the trial court discretion.see,lincoln schurgin th,d when plaintiff wins net monetary recovery but defendant prevails in its for declaratory relief,case presents circumstance not otherwise specified in that case,determination of prevailing party is matter within court discretion.it is not apparent from the record before us whether the trial court exercised its discretion to award costs to cry wolf or believed it had no choice but to conclude that cry wolf,as the party with the net monetary recovery,was the prevailing party in the action.on remand,in light of our conclusion the term purchaser does not include subsidiaries,we anticipate the net damages awarded to cry wolf may be reduced,perhaps significantly.even if cry wolf maintains a net monetary recovery,in determining the prevailing party in the litigation the trial court should also consider disney success on its declaratory relief claims and exercise its discretion to allow costs or not and,if allowed,to apportion them as appropriate.
disposition 
the judgment is reversed to the extent it is based on an improper interpretation of the term purchaser in the agreement,and the matter is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.on remand the trial court should consider what impact,if any,our interpretation of the term purchaser has on the other issues in the case,including the court determination of the prevailing party.each party is to bear his and its own costs on appeal.
as discussed more fully below,the trial court erred in permitting the jury to decide the meaning of the term purchaser in the controlling contract between disney and cry wolf,and the jury interpretation of that term was incorrect.although that error requires a reassessment of the damages properly awarded to cry wolf and may affect other issues in the case,including determination of the prevailing party,the parties briefing does not provide sufficient information for us to fully evaluate the nature and extent of that impact.accordingly,we decide the issues on appeal as presented and leave to the trial court to determine on remand whether any further modifications in the judgment are required by our decision.
this is the third time this case has been before us.the first two occasions involved writ proceedings prior to entry of the judgment.see wolf superior court th,d denying petition for writ of mandate seeking to vacate order sustaining demurrer to breach of fiduciary duty cause of action without leave to amend wolf superior court th,d granting petition for writ of mandate and directing trial court to vacate summary adjudication order.
wolf complaint named walt disney pictures and television as a defendant.disney was filed by both walt disney pictures and television and disney enterprises,successor in interest to walt disney productions,the entity that had entered into the agreement and the settlement agreement.
disney based its argument for summary adjudication on paragraph of the agreement,which provides in part,purchaser obligation to pay such sums to seller wolf shall not accrue unless and until monies with respect to which the same are to be paid shall have been received within the united states of america by,and placed a
