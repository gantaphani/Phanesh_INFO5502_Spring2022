introduction 
we hold corporations code section section does not create an independent basis for personal jurisdiction for claims arising under the franchise investment law,corporations code section et.section is a service of process statute providing that a nonresident,by engaging in conduct prohibited by or made actionable under the franchise investment law,consents to the appointment of the commissioner of corporations as attorney to receive service of process of a complaint brought under the franchise investment law.notwithstanding section,there still must exist grounds for exercising personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant that are not inconsistent with the united states constitution.
plaintiff robert stephen thomson brought this action alleging violations of the franchise investment law and asserted defendants kenneth anderson,garrett boone,goodhue smith iii,and roy terracina the moving defendants,all texas residents,were subject to personal jurisdiction in california pursuant to section.the trial court granted the moving defendants motion to quash service of summons for lack of personal jurisdiction.we conclude section does not create an independent basis for personal jurisdiction and thomson failed to meet his burden of producing evidence to establish the moving defendants had sufficient minimum contacts with california to support personal jurisdiction.we therefore affirm.
