this case concerns whether tandem energy corporation tandem colorado,tandem energy holdings,tandem nevada,todd yocham,tim culp,jack chambers,and michael cunningham collectively defendants can be held liable for conversion and civil conspiracy.we find genuine issues of fact regarding whether plaintiff arthur tifford,pa tifford,a florida corporation,owns a valid interest in tandem nevada,and whether defendants actions unreasonably deprived tifford of that interest.we therefore reverse the district court grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.
this dispute centers on a stock certificate in tifford possession.the certificate,number te certificate,represents million tandem nevada shares.defendants believe certificate is invalid,and have refused tifford demand to be listed as a record owner on tandem nevada books.tifford says genuine issues of fact exist regarding the certificate validity,and whether tandem refusal to transfer record ownership constitutes conversion.
the conflict arises from a corporate deal gone wrong.in,the owners of tandem colorado agreed to sell the company.the buyers hired ron williams to make a deal happen.williams hired aritex consultants aritex,which was owned and operated by lyle mortensen.williams and mortensen were to execute a reverse merger,in which a publicly held shell company acquires the stock of a private company in exchange for the public company stock.the plan was this tandem texas,a private company,was to purchase tandem colorado and other assets.the shell company,tandem nevada,was then to purchase tandem texas.there was apparently no written agreement concerning the duties and compensation of williams,mortensen,or aritex.mortensen purchased a public shell company,renamed it tandem nevada,and named himself president,secretary,and sole director.in that capacity,he issued million shares to himself in march,to allow him to complete the formalities necessary to the deal.what happened next is disputed.
tifford acknowledges that the deal did not go according to plan,but notes that a reverse merger took place.after the merger,mortensen just over million shares of tandem nevada.of those,just over million went to the sellers of tandem colorado and new investors.three million shares went to aritex,mortensen company,as compensation for expenses and services.mortensen resigned from the positions he held in tandem nevada,appointing in his place certain of the defendants.his shares were later reissued,including into a block of million shares represented by certificate.all stock issuances and transfers were done by manhattan transfer registrar company manhattan transfer,tandem nevada transfer agent 
defendants paint a different picture.they agree that aritex was supposed to receive million shares of tandem nevada for shepherding the reverse merger to a close.however,defendants say that williams,who is a securities fraud felon and disbarred attorney,sold million of the shares issued by mortensen in a pump and dump scheme,with mortensen knowledge or complicity.defendants also aver that mortensen did not have the power to issue stock in tandem nevada in march because he was not actually a director of the company.moreover,williams and mortensen acts allegedly caused the original buyers to back out of the deal.after williams and mortensen moved on,defendants restructured the deal.they capitalized tandem nevada directly with the assets of tandem colorado,some other assets,and borrowed funds.in sum,the originally contemplated reverse merger failed,but defendants salvaged a deal by converting tandem colorado into publicly held tandem nevada.
defendants state that o n august,the new tandem board of directors,by unanimous resolution,and pursuant to.cancelled the million stock shares,including certificate,based on an investigation and certified opinion of counsel concluding the shares were issued without consideration and were,therefore,invalid.most of the cancelled shares were then reissued only the shares issued to aritex were not.in a letter dated august,tandem directed manhattan transfer to not make any transfers of cancelled shares and notify us immediately if any attempt or request is made to transfer any of the cancelled shares.defendants say that they notified mortensen of the cancellation in a certified letter dated september.defendants submitted the letter as summary judgment evidence,but did not produce a certified mail receipt.mortensen said in an affidavit that he does not recall receiving notice of the cancellation.
in april,mortensen signed a stock power on behalf of aritex which purports to transfer the shares represented by certificate to tifford.in an affidavit,arthur tifford,the owner of the eponymous corporate plaintiff,states that the transfer was in partial satisfaction of a judgment entered for tifford client,universal express,in a florida lawsuit.tifford now claims a partial interest in the shares by virtue of a agreement with universal express.additionally,tifford alleges he had no knowledge of tandem nevada efforts to cancel the shares.in may,tifford agent,ameritrade,made a demand on manhattan transfer to have certificate reissued in its name.manhattan transfer refused due to the august,stop order.on may,tifford sent a letter to tandem nevada attorneys demanding that the shares be reissued.tandem nevada refused.
on june,tandem nevada sued aritex,arthur tifford and his corporation,williams,mortensen,and manhattan transfer in nevada state court.tandem nevada sought a declaration that certificate was invalid.all defendants but manhattan transfer were dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction.on may,the court found that the dismissed defendants were not indispensable parties,and granted summary judgment in favor of tandem nevada.the court held that the shares issued by mortensen,including certificate,were invalid and void.the court ordered manhattan transfer to void and refuse to transfer certificate if such were presented to it.a separate lawsuit involving aritex and concerning the validity of the stock is currently proceeding in a texas state court.
tifford filed this suit on june.tifford sought a declaration of its rights in tandem nevada and damages in excess of million for conversion and civil conspiracy.initially,defendants moved to have the claim dismissed for failure to state a claim.upon considering evidence outside of the pleadings,the district court construed defendants motion as one for summary judgment.however,defendants have not filed answers to tifford complaint.in a written order,the court stated that the parties agreed that the conversion took place on august,and tifford did not own certificate at that time.thus,defendants did not deprive tifford of a property interest,and summary judgment was proper.in the alternative,the court held that the nevada judgment invalidating certificate was an in rem judgment,and thus bound tifford.as tifford could not demonstrate an unlawful act,the court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on tifford civil conspiracy claim as well.final judgment was entered and tifford appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
