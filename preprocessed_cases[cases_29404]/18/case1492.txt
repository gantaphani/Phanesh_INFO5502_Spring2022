procedural history 
jara,filed a complaint against suprema,jara,and rodriguez on november,which was later twice amended the second amended complaint alleged four causes of action.the first cause of action alleges that jara,and rodriguez,as majority shareholders and officers of suprema,breached an oral contract not to increase their salaries or bonuses unless all shareholders agreed on the amount of the increase.the second cause of action alleged that jara,and rodriguez,as majority shareholders,breached a fiduciary duty to the minority shareholder,jara,by paying themselves excessive compensation and denying jara,a fair share of the corporate profits.the third cause of action claimed that the defendants refused the requests of jara,under corporations code sections et,to inspect and copy corporate records.the last cause of action sought an accounting.
the matter came up for a court trial on january,before a temporary judge appointed by stipulation of the parties.on the day before trial,defendants filed a motion in limine to exclude all evidence seeking to establish that suprema paid jara,and rodriguez excessive compensation.the motion contended that damages for excessive compensation could be recovered only by the corporation itself through a derivative action based on breach of fiduciary duty and that jara,had failed to bring such an action.deferring a ruling on the motion,the trial court received expert testimony of both parties concerning the reasonableness of the compensation paid to jara,and rodriguez.shortly after presentation of evidence,the court granted the motion in limine,thereby effectively denying jara,claim to recover individual damages pursuant to his second cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty.jara,moved to amend the complaint to state a derivative cause of action in conformance to proof,but the motion was denied.
the court trial,which spanned seven days of testimony and arguments,created an extensive record concerning the short history and remarkable success of suprema and the conflictive relationship between jara,and the other shareholders.the court issued a statement of tentative decision approximately two months after conclusion of the trial and a substantially identical final statement of decision on may.the statement of decision noted that the cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty had been dismissed by the court,and found that the cause of action for an accounting was no longer relevant in the absence of a derivative cause of action but granted relief on the breach of contract and corporate disclosure causes of action.
the trial court found that an agreement was reached that no compensation in excess of per week could be received by jara,or rodriguez at any time without the unanimous approval of all three shareholders.jara,and rodriguez breached this contract by paying jara,compensation that exceeded the agreed salary in the amount of and paying rodriguez compensation that exceeded this amount by.adding interest to these amounts,the court found contract damages to be,plus daily interest accruing until the judgment is paid in full.the court found,however,that the injury was suffered by the corporation rather than the plaintiff,jara,because the corporation was deprived of funds which would,except for the acts of defendants,have remained with the corporation.in effect,suprema was the third party beneficiary of the contract.accordingly,the court awarded the damages solely to suprema.
in the remaining cause of action,the court found that all defendants failed to comply with corporations code section by refusing to give jara,monthly financial statements.the court therefore ordered suprema to provide jara,access to its monthly financial statements upon written request for review and copying and awarded jara,attorney fees and costs relative to enforcement of his rights under section pursuant to section of the corporations code.
defendants,suprema,jara,and rodriguez,filed a notice of appeal from the judgment entered on the statement of decision.jara,separately appealed from the judgment and certain intermediate orders.the brief in support of his raises issues with respect to the portion of the judgment awarding damages to suprema for breach of contract and from the intermediate orders granting defendants motion in limine and denying jara,motion to amend the complaint to conform to proof.the appeal has been consolidated with separate appeals from the award of attorney fees under corporations code section and from an order compelling suprema enforcement of the judgment.
statement of facts 
jara,a native of mexico,has lived in this country continuously since,when he acquired legal immigration status.in,he opened a taco restaurant in the mission district of san francisco and five years later opened a second restaurant in san jose.the restaurants were successful and provided the financial resources for other investments in real estate.jara,claims to have been raised by his grandparents since the age of four.his first work experience was as a butcher,but he moved to a series of jobs before finding a job as a meat salesman for a wholesale meat distributor.in this position,he became friends with rodriguez,another meat salesman.together they formed plans to launch their own wholesale meat distribution business to serve hispanic restaurants.rodriguez was able to contribute to the venture,but jara,had no funds of his own.when they were rebuffed in an attempt to get a commercial loan,jara,approached his father for financial backing sometime early in.
since the trial court found the testimony of jara,to be credible,we will rely on his account of what ensued without attempting to weigh or evaluate the conflicting trial testimony.according to jara,he agreed to obtain a line of credit in return for a percent stock interest in the new company.he actually succeeded in securing a larger line of credit for from bank of the west and made the full amount available to the business.as preparations proceeded for opening the business,jara,made a series of other financial contributions he helped negotiate leases on refrigerated trucks and paid first and last months lease payments amounting to a total of,and he paid to lease some forklifts and in legal fees for the incorporation of the business.in addition,he cosigned a warehouse lease and claimed at trial to have made payments on the lease in recognition for this support,jara,and rodriguez decided to give jara,another percent ownership interest in the business 
suprema was incorporated on june.jara,and rodriguez were each issued shares of stock and jara,was issued shares.jara,was president and treasurer rodriguez was and secretary and jara,was.all three shareholders were members of the board of directors.
suprema opened for business on june.during the first months,jara,often called his father for business advice.on one of these occasions near the beginning of the company,jara,called in the evening for advice on the salary that the corporation should pay him and rodriguez.jara,suggested that they begin by paying themselves no more than what they needed to live and asked what the son was making as a meat salesman.jara,replied that he was making per week.jara,recalled that he advised,you know,if you want to do that,you know,if you think that you work more or you earn more money than the,why do you put it in the books and when there some money,you pull the money out,you know.jara,added that his son should call rodriguez to see if this approach would be all right with him.
according to jara,his son called back later in the evening to say that he had talked to rodriguez about the advice jara,had given.as jara,recalled the conversation,his son said i talked to gonzalo rodriguez and he said it is okay with him.whenever we going to pull the money out,we will make sure all of us agreed how much money that going to be.and i jara,said it okay.emphasis added.
jara,testified that he understood from this conversation that all three shareholders had to agree on a salary increase for jara,and rodriguez.he explained,w henever we going to take some more money out,we will get together and we will agree at how much money they will have.the was already agreed at.he recounted that his son said whenever we were going to do anything about salaries,we all have to agree and he agreed to that.
at jara request,bruce maddox,suprema accountant,drafted a footnote to the annual financial statement to memorialize this understanding.the footnote was edited by jara,and included in the and financial statements in the following form the board of directors has agreed in princip le to compensate the officers who maintain customer accounts in accord with normal industry practice subject to the restriction in the following paragraph,management has elected not to pay such compensation currently in order to conserve working capital and provide for growth.the compensation to be paid is undetermined as of the date of this report,and,before payment may be made,it must be approved by all current.
the business experienced rapid growth.the financial statement for the year ended march,showed revenues of approximately million and a gross margin of and net income of.after switching to a september calendar year,the financial statement for the year ended september,reported revenue of and a gross margin of and net income of.concurrently,suprema began to secure credit terms from major meat suppliers.the effect was to relieve it of dependence on the line of credit with bank of the west,which it initially used to offer suppliers letters of credit guaranteeing payment of their orders.
despite burgeoning revenues and profits,suprema continued to pay jara,and rodriguez,annual salaries of,or per week,throughout the first three and a half years of operation.at the end of,jara,and rodriguez decided to call a meeting of the board to increase their compensation.the accountant,bruce maddox,testified that the purpose of the meeting was to carry out the second paragraph of note to the financial statements that said all shareholders must agree.the meeting was attended by the three board members and maddox,who took written notes.though testimony of what occurred varies significantly,we will review only the testimony jara,which the trial court found most credible.
according to jara,his son called him to tell him of a meeting on december,and said he and rodriguez each wanted percent of the profits.he commented that it seems to me like you trying to milk the cow.jara,recalled that the board took two votes.he first agreed to the proposal of percent of gross profits but he was not happy with this outcome.jara,insisted that they come to a real agreement and rodriguez proposed percent.they voted on this proposal and this time he voted no.rodriguez announced that it was decided by a vote.jara,wanted to continue the discussion and suggested that they hire an expert to determine what the compensation would be.jara,recalled that he agreed to this,but the accountant,maddox,testified that the parties could not come to an agreement on a way of hiring a mutually acceptable expert.
both jara,and maddox recalled that no agreement was reached at the meeting.jara,testified that a few days later maddox told him that jara,did not want to retain a compensation expert.maddox,who was the accountant for jara,ceased serving as suprema accountant shortly after the meeting because he did not think he could work for both clients in view of the emerging conflict.
in the second week of january,jara,retained an attorney,kenneth nissly,to assist him in negotiating a shareholder agreement.we will later examine closely the correspondence between nissly and suprema in connection with the corporate disclosure issues.on april,nissly wrote a letter to jara,stating that the financial analysis of a retained accountant,roberto maragoni,indicated that was likely to be a good number for executive compensation.upon receiving the letter,jara,and rodriguez decided to increase their weekly draw from to per week.about this time,suprema stopped making meat deliveries to jara,restaurants.
the record indicates that jara,and rodriguez met on july,to handle corporate business.rodriguez thought that they conducted a meeting of shareholders and board of directors at the same time.jara,was not notified of the meeting and did not attend.the two directors in attendance,jara,and rodriguez,voted themselves bonuses of and,respectively,payable between july and december.
the record reveals that jara,attended one more meeting of shareholders and board of directors on july.at that time,he was formally removed from the board and suprema established a board of directors,but he remained a of the company.
in the two and period from july through december,jara,and rodriguez received a series of further bonuses in addition to the enhanced weekly draw.they agreed to a split of officer compensation with jara,receiving the larger share.jara,calculates that jara,received total compensation of in the fiscal year ending september,and compensation of and for the succeeding years ending on september,and.rodriguez received total compensation of,and for these fiscal years.in july,rodriguez agreed to sell his stock interest to jara,but the sales agreement provided for continued salary payments to the end of the year.the defendants retained a compensation expert in preparation for trial,who advised jara,on the amount of the bonuses to be paid at the end of.
rodriguez acknowledged that he and jara,wanted to take money out of the company through their compensation,but they repeatedly loaned all or part of the bonus payments back to the company during this period.the corporate accountant,barry goldstein,explained that they wanted to maintain an operating reserve of and the company was in fact never short of cash.at the time of trial,the corporation had paid off all the loans made by jara,and rodriguez for the purpose of meeting current cash needs.
the size of the executive compensation reflected the continued growth of the company.at the fiscal year ended september,suprema had revenues of and gross margin of in the fiscal year,it reported revenues of and gross margin of and in the fiscal year,it had revenues of and gross margin of.
jara,testified that he was happy with the way his son and rodriguez ran the company,but he objected to the payment of executive compensation without his consent or approval.in july,suprema for the first time paid him a dividend of.
at the trial,the parties presented conflicting expert testimony on the reasonableness of executive compensation paid to jara,and rodriguez.in the absence of any finding on this issue,we have no need to review this testimony in detail.it suffices to say that the expert witness for jara,relied on comparable market data whereas the expert witnesses for suprema and the individual defendants,jara,and rodriguez,placed greater weight on executive performance,corporate profitability and return on investment.
discussion 
legal principles 
in their first and dispositive assignment of error,jara,and rodriguez,argue that the trial court erred in finding an enforceable agreement among shareholders to require the approval of all shareholders for an increase in officer compensation.they argue that jara,promise to this effect in the evening telephone conversation with his father,which was memorialized in note of the and financial statements,was a gratuitous promise lacking in consideration.
this assignment of error calls on us to review the doctrine of consideration in california contract law.we begin by noting that,in bard kent cal d,the supreme court authoritatively adopted the concept of consideration as a exchange as formulated in the restatement of contracts,section,which is now expressed with insignificant changes in language in restatement second of contracts,section.this understanding of the doctrine of consideration was reaffirmed in simmons cal.institute of technology cal d,and continues to guide california courts.asmus pacific bell cal th,d,us ecology,state of california th,d flojo,lassleben th,d enslow von guenthner d.
section of restatement second of contracts states in pertinent part to constitute consideration,a performance or a return promise must be bargained for.a performance or return promise is bargained for if it is sought by the promisor in exchange for his promise and is given by the promisee in exchange for that promise.comment b observes in the typical bargain,the consideration and the promise bear a reciprocal relation of motive or inducement the consideration induces the making of the promise and the promise induces the furnishing of the consideration.
farnsworth explains that the courts began to require that consideration be bargained for in the late century.the effect of this development of the doctrine was to direct legal analysis to the process by which the parties had arrived at that it the product of bargain i farnsworth on contracts ed.in california,the concept is consistent with the early statutory definition of good consideration in civil code section any benefit conferred,or agreed to be conferred,upon the promisor,by any other person,to which the promisor is not lawfully entitled,or any prejudice suffered,or agreed to be suffered,by such person,other than such as he is at the time of consent lawfully bound to suffer,as an inducement to the promisor,is a good consideration for a promise.emphasis added.the phrase as an inducement to the promisor reflects the requirement,more clearly enunciated in the restatement,that the consideration be a exchange.
in view of the requirement of a exchange,california courts have repeatedly refused to enforce gratuitous promises,even if reduced to writing in the form of an agreement.simmons cal.institute of technology,supra,cal d,written agreement to secure approval of research institute for licensing of invention simonian patterson th,d,father promise to persuade his daughter to return property to an sparks lauritzen d,decedent promise to leave estate to appellants who gave him food,shelter,and care enslow von guenthner,supra,d.written agreement revising contractor obligation after performance was rendered and payment due dow river farms d,corporate resolution to pay officer for past services in the absence of any expectation of payment when services were rendered.
the decision in passante mcwilliam th,d is based on facts closely parallel to the present case.passante,an attorney for a company,arranged a loan that allowed for a deposit required by a contract vital to the company success.the money was wired to an account controlled by a board member before the loan was presented to the board for its approval.in gratitude,the board promised to give passante a percent stock interest in the company.when the company later reneged on this promise,passante sued for breach of contract and secured a million jury verdict,but the trial court entered a judgment for the defendants notwithstanding the verdict.
affirming the judgment,the court held as a matter of law,any claim by passante for breach of contract necessarily founders on the rule that consideration must result from a bargain.passante mcwilliam,supra,th,d.the court found that the stock had not been bargained for in exchange for arranging the loan passante had already arranged the loan even though the loan had not been formally accepted by the board before the idea of giving him stock was ever brought up.there is no evidence that passante had any expectation that he be given stock in return for arranging the loan i f there was no expectation of payment by either party when the services were rendered,the promise is a mere promise to make a gift and not enforceable.citation.id.at,d.
standard of review 
in applying these principles to the facts,we view the record in the light most favorable to the judgment.it is a familiar principle that every intendment and presumption not contradicted by or inconsistent with the record on appeal must be indulged in favor of the orders and judgments of superior courts.citation.walling kimball cal d.
the relevant evidence on the issue of consideration is found in the testimony of the parties themselves,jara,jara,and rodriguez.in this appeal,jara,and rodriguez,seek to minimize issues of fact by predicating their argument solely on the testimony of jara,whom the trial court found most credible.we likewise will confine our review to the testimony of jara,while indulging in every inference favorable to the judgment in construing his testimony.
absence of consideration 
in our view,the testimony of jara,can only be construed as revealing that his son promise not to increase compensation without unanimous shareholder agreement was unsolicited.the testimony makes clear that jara,first raised the idea of unanimous shareholder agreement on executive compensation,without any prompting or solicitation,in an evening telephone conversation.according to jara,account of this conversation,his son called him for advice on what he and rodriguez should pay themselves and he responded by suggesting that they pay themselves what they received at their past job,while clearly indicating that they were free to adopt or reject his advice.if you want to do that,if you think that you work more or you earn more money than the,why do you start with the low salary and take more when appropriate.when jara,called back after consulting rodriguez,he said they accepted the advice and then volunteered an entirely unsolicited promise we will make sure all of us agree how much money that going to be.we find nothing in jara,testimony suggesting that the promise arose from any earlier conversation about shareholder approval or that the promise responded to any suggestion,objection or inducement that jara,may have made.
again,jara,account of the conversation clearly indicates that his son promise was gratuitous in the sense of being offered without expectation of any exchange promise or performance.nothing in the record suggests that jara,sought to elicit a similar promise from jara,or that he hoped to induce some other kind of performance in exchange for his promise to secure unanimous approval.jara,had already given the new company the full extent of his financial support.so far as revealed in the record he did not make any further contribution to the business other than rendering occasional advice,and jara,and rodriguez did not seek any further contribution.
it does not matter whether jara,promise arose from a feeling of gratitude toward his father or from fear that the father would retract his support for the line of credit the company needed.again,it is irrelevant that jara,may have tried to keep faith with the promise by incorporating it in footnote and by calling the meeting on december,to seek his father agreement.the existence of consideration does not depend on jara,subjective state of mind but on whether the objective manifestations of agreement by the parties constituted a bargain.winograd american broadcasting th,d.it is relevant only that jara,promise was unsolicited and gratuitous it was neither induced by promises or conduct of his father nor given to induce a return promise or performance.
in this appeal,jara,now contends that we adopt the trial court analysis that three shareholders exchanged promises to refrain from voting in favor of an increase in officer compensation without the approval of the other two shareholders.the effect of this agreement,he argues,would be a valid bilateral contract,analogous to a voting trust,to protect each shareholder from a combination of the other two in setting officer compensation.see bleecher conte cal d,bilateral contract garratt baker cal d,bilateral contract ramos estrada th,d voting trust.
we consider,however,that this analysis has an entirely theoretical character.the record contains nothing suggesting that jara,sought a return promise on the part of his father or contemplated anything resembling a voting trust.jara,did not condition his promise on receiving a similar commitment from the father or manifest any expectation of securing an exchange promise.it follows that,if jara,had responded by promising to abide by a shareholder agreement resembling a voting trust,the promise would not have constituted consideration because it would not have been given in response to any inducement of jara.but jara,testimony does not indicate that he in fact tried to seize on this opportunity to bind his son to the kind of bilateral contract he now describes.instead,the noncommittal response that he recalls giving to his son and i said it okay evidenced no more than acquiescence in his son apparent goodwill and can not be reasonably construed as a bid to enter into a bilateral contract regarding the future exercise of voting rights.
our conclusion calls for reversal of the judgment awarding damages for breach of contract as well as reversal of the postjudgment order filed december,compelling performance of this judgment,which is the subject of a separate appeal consolidated herewith.
derivative action 
in a separate appeal,jara,argues that the trial court erred in dismissing the second cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty on the ground that the claim could only be asserted in a derivative action.all parties argue that the unusual procedural route that the court took in dismissing the cause of action,granting of a motion in limine after presentation of evidence,calls for an exceptional standard of review.we consider,however,that the order granting the motion in limine to an entire category of pertinent evidence was tantamount to a dismissal of the second cause of action and is to be reviewed under the same standard as any other judgment of dismissal.mechanical contractors greater bay area th,d.
the parties do not question the basic principle of the fiduciary duty owed by majority shareholders to minority shareholders.as stated in jones ahmanson cal d,california courts have often recognized that majority shareholders,either singly or acting in concert to accomplish a joint purpose,have a fiduciary responsibility to the minority and to the corporation to use their ability to control the corporation in a fair,just,and equitable manner.majority shareholders may not use their power to control corporate activities to benefit themselves alone or in a manner detrimental to the minority.
we have no occasion to review the application of this principle to the facts of the case since the trial court made no findings on the issue of breach of fiduciary duty.the trial court ruling was predicated instead on a procedural bar firmly rooted in a long line of precedent an injury to the corporation can not be maintained in an action brought by an individual shareholder on his own behalf but must be asserted in a derivative action in which the shareholder is a mere nominal plaintiff,the corporation is the real party in interest,and any judgment recovered inures to its benefit.thomson mortgage investment,sutter general petroleum cal d,anderson derrick cal.looking only to the pleadings,the court found that the gravamen of the second cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty was an injury to the corporation for which a derivative action was the only permissible remedy.since jara,sought individual recovery of damages,the cause of action was subject to dismissal.
jones ahmanson,supra,cal d,offers an authoritative analysis for distinguishing claims that must be asserted in a derivative action and those that may be asserted in an individual action.the jones plaintiff owned shares of capital stock in united savings and loan association association.as a means of developing a market for association shares,a group of majority shareholders incorporated a holding company,united financial corporation united financial,and exchanged their shares in the association for those of united financial.after the exchange,united financial held percent of the outstanding association stock.the holding company then created a market for its stock through certain public offerings of stock.then,it offered to purchase or exchange association stock on terms that did not offer a value comparable to that of an equivalent holding in the holding company stock.it justified the low valuation of association shares on the ground that they lacked the marketability of the holding company stock.
plaintiff filed an individual action against united financial and several majority stockholders individually,alleging that the value of her stock had been diminished by their actions.jones ahmanson,supra,cal d.the trial court sustained defendants demurrer to the complaint on the ground that the cause of action,if valid,was derivative in nature and could not be filed in a stockholder individual suit.on appeal,the court first reviewed the concept of a derivative suit a shareholder derivative suit seeks to recover for the benefit of the corporation and its whole body of shareholders when injury is caused to the corporation that may not otherwise be redressed because of failure of the corporation to act.thus,the action is derivative,in the corporate right,if the gravamen of the complaint is injury to the corporation,or to the whole body of its stock and property without any severance or distribution among individual holders,or it seeks to recover assets for the corporation or to prevent the dissipation of its assets.citations.id.at.in contrast,a stockholder individual suit is a suit to enforce a right against the corporation which the stockholder possesses as an individual.citation.id.at.
applying this distinction to the facts,the court concluded i t is clear from the stipulated facts and plaintiff allegations that she does not seek to recover on behalf of the corporation for injury done to the corporation by defendants.although she does allege that the value of her stock has been diminished by defendants actions,she does not contend that the diminished value reflects an injury to the corporation and resultant depreciation in the value of the stock.thus the gravamen of her cause of action is injury to herself and the other minority stockholders.jones ahmanson,supra,cal d.the court therefore allowed the plaintiff to seek damages based on the appraised value of her shares.id.at.
jones calls for closer scrutiny of earlier court of appeal decisions denying individual plaintiffs standing to sue.it expressly disapproved shaw empire sav.loan d,which held that a minority shareholder could not maintain an individual action unless he could demonstrate the injury to him was somehow different from that suffered by other minority shareholders.jones ahmanson,supra,cal d.and the holding in jones,which allowed a plaintiff to sue for diminution of the value of her shares,is difficult to reconcile with the language of certain earlier decisions,shenberg degarmo d,an individual stockholder may not maintain an action in his own right against the directors for destruction of or diminution in the value of the stock.but to the extent that it expanded somewhat the right to bring individual shareholder actions,jones leaves intact the authority of earlier precedents allowing individual suits.
following jones,several courts have held that a derivative suit is the required means of asserting injury to the corporation resulting from mismanagement of corporate business.in avikian wtc financial th,d,the plaintiffs core claim was that the defendants mismanaged the corporation and entered into deals to sell its assets to third parties.the court held that these allegations amounted to a claim of injury to the corporation that could be recovered only in a derivative suit.in nelson anderson th,d,a corporation engaged in a marketing venture had only two shareholders.nevertheless,the court held that the minority shareholder had no standing to sue the majority shareholder for mismanagement of the corporation the corporation itself had to bring the action through a derivative action.again,in pareto cir,the court held that the plaintiffs lacked standing to assert a claim that the directors of a bank breached their duty of care in arranging the liquidation and merger of the bank with another financial institution because the claim was clearly derivative.id.at.
other decisions,however,uphold the individual standing of a minority shareholder to bring suit against majority shareholders alleging a breach of a fiduciary duty that deprives the minority shareholder of a proportionate share of the corporation value.in smith,d,a parent corporation filed a consolidated tax return with the subsidiary while it engaged in liquidating the subsidiary.the filing had the effect of appropriating tax benefits to the parent corporation and reducing the distribution to the single minority shareholder in the subsidiary.the court held that the gravamen of the complaint was injury to the plaintiff as the only minority shareholder arising from an alleged breach of fiduciary duty by the majority shareholder.the allegations raised a question as to whether the allocation of tax savings was inherently fair and equitable to the plaintiff.id.at.
similarly,in crain electronic memories magnetics d,the majority shareholder of a computer company exercised its control over the company to sell the entire business to a third party for cash and to loan the cash back to itself in return for an unsecured promissory note payable to the computer company.the minority shareholders sued the majority shareholder alleging,that the effect of the transaction was to leave the computer company as a shell corporation with an unsecured note as its principal asset.the court held that the complaint alleged a breach of fiduciary duty that entitled the plaintiffs to individual relief,not solely derivative relief,against the majority shareholder.id.at.
we see some tension between smith and crain and two opinions involving the transfer of corporate assets to a second corporation controlled by majority shareholders.the first,paclink communications,superior court th,d,itself distinguishes crain and thereby provides a reasoned basis for harmonizing the decisions.the paclink plaintiffs alleged that the defendants transferred the assets of the corporation to a second and a third corporation,in which the plaintiffs had no involvement,without payment of any consideration.in a mandate proceeding,the court sustained a demurrer to causes of action against the transferee corporations alleging fraudulent transfer,conspiracy,and constructive trust.distinguishing crain,the court observed that the writ proceedings did not concern a personal cause of action by the minority shareholders against majority shareholders for breach of fiduciary duty.
a second opinion involving a transfer of corporate assets rests on authority that jones rejected six years earlier.in rankin frebank d,the majority shareholders transferred the manufacturing aspects of the business then being conducted by frebank to a newly formed corporation in which the minority shareholders had no interest.the court held that the minority shareholders could not recover individually for the diversion of corporate assets through this device because the gravamen of their case was injury to the corporation.the decision,however,represents questionable authority because it relied on shaw empire sav.loan,supra,d,which was expressly disapproved in jones on a closely related point,and cites language in shenberg degarmo,supra,d,that is inconsistent with jones to allow individual recovery for diminution of stock value.rankin frebank,supra,at.
finally,we note that precedents include two cases that upheld individual causes of action on facts similar to the present case.de martini scavenger protec.d,supports jara,claim that payment of excessive salaries to working shareholders may be tantamount to a discriminatory payment of dividends.the scavenger protective association was a corporation largely but not entirely owned by working employees.beginning in,it began a practice of making monthly distributions,described as wages,only to working shareholders.the four plaintiffs,who were stockholders not employed by the company,secured a judgment against the corporation in the amount of these distributions.affirming the judgment,the court held that the corporation could not deprive shareholders of their share of the profits in the business by denominating distributions as wages.de martini cited a washington opinion holding that a corporation can not,by paying excessive or extravagant wages to the working stockholders,deprive the appellant of her share of the profits of the business.id.at.
low wheeler d,affirmed a judgment in favor of a minority shareholder,who claimed to be unfairly treated preceding the company sale to a third party.the evidence at trial showed that the majority shareholders reduced the value of the minority shareholder shares by refusing to pay dividends,excluding him from representation on the board,and negotiating a sale of the company that gave majority shareholders a better price per share than minority shareholders.the court held the wrong alleged by plaintiff and found by the jury was one to plaintiff as an individual,because the corporation was about to be dissolved at the time of the sale of all of the corporate stock,and was dissolved promptly by the purchaser where a stockholder is directly and individually injured,he may sue as an individual.id.at.
defendants cite three cases for the proposition that the payment of excessive compensation by corporate officers may be challenged only through a derivative cause of action.shenberg degarmo,supra,d,offers a degree of support for this position,though excessive compensation was only one of a number of related issues.the plaintiff,a minority shareholder,alleged that a group of dominant majority shareholders engaged in a course of wrongdoing,including the payment of an excessive salary to one of their number,which diminished the value of his shares.the court held that the plaintiff only remedy was through a derivative suit.a second case,thompson price d,does not address the procedural distinction between a derivative and individual action,though it allowed a corporation to recover funds that were in part withdrawn as excessive salaries.the third case,rankin frebank,supra,d,represents questionable authority,as noted above.ante,at.
this review of the case law serves to demonstrate that we may most profitably look to jones itself in applying the distinction between individual and derivative actions.jones not only represents controlling authority but also displays a clarity and relevance to the present case that we have not found elsewhere in the case law.like the federal court in pareto,we read jones as allowing a minority shareholder to bring a personal action alleging a majority stockholders breach of a fiduciary duty to minority stockholders,which resulted in the majority stockholders retaining a disproportionate share of the corporation ongoing value.pareto,supra.though inconsistent with rankin,this interpretation of jones is supported by de martini,low,smith,and crain.everest investors mcneil partners th,d.other opinions dealing with mismanagement,avikian and nelson or fraud,sutter and paclink have no direct relevance to the present case.
the case at bar comes within the scope of allowable individual actions under this interpretation of jones.the gravamen of jara,complaint is that he was deprived of a fair share of the corporation profits as a result of defendants generous payment of executive compensation to themselves.as rodriguez conceded on,the corporation paid bonuses to defendants with the objective of reducing the amount of profit in the corporation that had to be shared with jara.these payments gave rise to an injury to jara,as an individual.
we recognize that the present case represents a closer case than jones with respect to possible injury to the corporation itself.in jones the manipulation of stock values by the defendants had no effect whatever on the underlying business here,the alleged payment of excessive compensation did have the potential of damaging the business.but the record shows that the company in fact experienced extraordinary growth while preserving operating reserves and access to credit.indeed,jara,testified that he was happy with the way jara,and rodriguez ran the business.he does not claim that the company would have experienced still greater prosperity and growth if the salaries had been smaller but rather maintains that the payment of generous executive compensation was a device to distribute a disproportionate share of the profits to the two officer shareholders during a period of business success.
we find further support for this conclusion in the absence of any policy considerations favoring derivative actions in the procedural context of the present case.as explained in a leading treatise,the traditional justification for requiring a derivative action is that it is designed to prevent a multiplicity of actions by each individual shareholder and a preference of some more diligent shareholders over others,and to protect the creditors who have first call on the corporate assets marsh cal.corporation law ed.supp.shareholders rights,a,see sutter general petroleum,supra,cal d,multitudinous litigation anderson derrick,supra,cal,every stockholder must be accorded the same right shenberg degarmo,supra,d,the rights of creditors of the corporation,which are superior to those of the shareholders,would not be protected if individual shareholders were permitted to sue in their own right.
the rule requiring a derivative action may also be justified as serving the policies of corporations code section formerly section,which imposed a series of procedural prerequisites for bringing a derivative action when enacted in.subdivisions b and c have the purpose of shielding the corporation from meritless lawsuits by requiring the plaintiffs to have contemporaneous stockownership and by giving the defendants the right to move the court for an order requiring a bond.gaillard natomas d,contemporaneous ownership.subdivision b,which requires the plaintiffs to submit a demand to the board of directors before filing suit,reflects the legislative intent of encouraging the intracorporate resolution of disputes and protecting managerial freedom.shields singleton th,d.
these policies find little or no application in the present case.the objective of preventing a multiplicity of lawsuits and assuring equal treatment for all aggrieved shareholders does not arise at all when there is only one minority shareholder.the objective of encouraging intracorporate resolution of disputes and protecting managerial freedom is entirely meaningless where the defendants constitute the entire complement of the board of directors and all the corporate officers.and the policy of preserving corporate assets for the benefit of creditors has,at best,a very weak application where the corporation remains a viable business.
in the absence of policy considerations favoring a derivative action,we have no reason to look beyond the strict application of precedent in determining whether a derivative action must be brought to assert a shareholder grievance.we see nothing in jones that bars jara,from bringing an individual action claiming damages for the breach of fiduciary duty of majority shareholders as alleged in the second cause of action.
defendants object that any award of damages to jara,would have rested entirely on the entirely speculative assumption that suprema would have distributed that amount to jara,as dividends or otherwise,had it not paid jara,and rodriguez excessive compensation.as oblique support of this argument,they point to the trial court finding that there is no basis for the court to find with reasonable certainty that additional allocations would have been paid if the company was an s corporation or c corporation.but following de martini,we interpret the complaint as seeking a share of disguised dividends paid to jara,and rodriguez in the form of excessive compensation it is possible to calculate the amount of such disguised dividends and to award jara,his fair share after taking into account the dividend that he did receive.
we conclude that the trial court erred in failing to rule on the second cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty.
corporations code section 
procedural background 
suprema appeals from the portion of the judgment ordering it to provide jara,with access to monthly financial statements and awarding attorney fees in an amount to be determined by motion in a separate and consolidated appeal,suprema appeals from a postjudgment order entered september,setting the award of attorney fees at approximately.jara,and rodriguez join in suprema appeals.
the procedural history of these appeals involves rights afforded by five sections of the corporations code,which should be briefly identified at the outset.section concerns the corporation duty to provide shareholders with annual reports section addresses the shareholders right to inspect corporate records section pertains to directors rights of inspection section provides for the enforcement of rights of inspection by court order and section authorizes the award of attorney fees expended in enforcing rights to inspection under section.
the original complaint and first amended complaint sought an order pursuant to section enforcing jara,right as a director to inspect corporate records as provided by section.the second amended complaint,filed august,again sought an order enforcing a director right of inspection,but,in addition,it sought an order enforcing a shareholder right of inspection of corporate records under section and right to receive annual and quarterly financial statements under section,subdivision c,as well as an award of attorney fees under section.
the statement of decision found no evidence of a violation of section,subdivision c,and did not address the alleged violation of section but ruled that suprema violated its duty of disclosure under section.specifically,the court found it is clear that on numerous occasions commencing in january plaintiff through his counsel requested monthly financial statements be provided to plaintiff.except for year end financials these requests were ignored.defendants merely ignored plaintiff requests and never offered access to such records and in fact denied the existence of monthly financial reports.the judgment ordered suprema to provide plaintiff access to its monthly financial statements upon written request for review and copying and awarded plaintiff attorney fees expended to enforce corporations code section in an amount to be determined by noticed motion.
