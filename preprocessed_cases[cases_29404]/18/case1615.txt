the united states constitution prohibits a court from exercising jurisdiction over a party that lacks minimum contacts with the forum.personal jurisdiction has been described as either is,based on contacts arising from the dispute at general,predicated on a party continuous and systematic contacts with the forum.analysis is easily muddled,however,as courts frequently import contacts relevant to one type of jurisdiction when deciding the other.additionally,courts sometimes impute contacts of related entities to each other,when mere relatedness is an insufficient basis on which to confer jurisdiction.today,we must determine whether a louisiana hospital,either independently or through its parent corporation,has continuous and systematic contacts with texas.we conclude that it does not.
factual and procedural background 
while traveling through louisiana on december,texas resident jajah eddington sought medical care at hospital minden hospital,a acute care hospital located in minden,louisiana.medical personnel treated eddington symptoms in the emergency room and advised her to consult her primary care physician if her condition did not improve.four days later,eddington was admitted to good shepherd medical center in longview,texas,where she ultimately was diagnosed with toxic shock syndrome.that infection led to her death on december.
dewayne eddington,individually and as next friend of devvyn eddington,and as representative of jajah eddington estate,sued corporation asserting product liability,breach of warranty,and negligence claims.he alleged that eddington use of kotex tampons led to the infection that caused her death.on february,filed a petition against,minden,which owns minden hospital,asserting that minden negligence proximately caused eddington death minden is a nonresident of texas and a wholly owned subsidiary of province health care province.pleaded that province,whose headquarters is in tennessee,did business in texas and that its acts should be imputed to minden because province owns minden province and minden share officers,directors,and common departments or business province and minden do not differentiate their operations and have failed to erect formal barriers between themselves and province officers and directors control minden policies.minden filed a special appearance and,subject thereto,a general denial.the parties conducted extensive discovery relating to the jurisdictional issue.after a hearing,the trial court concluded it had general jurisdiction over minden and denied the special appearance.
the court of appeals affirmed,reasoning that minden itself had continuous and systematic contacts with texas and minden and province operated as a single business enterprise,and minden,through province,did business in texas.we granted minden petition for review to decide whether texas courts have general jurisdiction over minden.
general jurisdiction 
the texas statute governs texas courts exercise of jurisdiction over nonresident defendants.see.civ.prac.that statute permits texas courts to exercise jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant that does business in texas,and the statute identifies some activities that constitute doing business.id.the list,however,is not exclusive.bmc software,marchand.we have held that section language extends texas courts personal jurisdiction as far as the federal constitutional requirements of due process will permit,burt.thus,we rely on precedent from the united states supreme court and other federal courts,as well as our own decisions,in determining whether a nonresident defendant has negated all bases of jurisdiction.see bmc software,at.personal jurisdiction over nonresident defendants is constitutional when the defendant has established minimum contacts with the forum state,and the exercise of jurisdiction comports with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.int l shoe washington.
in helicopteros nacionales de colombia,hall,the supreme court adopted the terms specific and general to describe the differing types of personal jurisdiction.helicopteros,d citing arthur von mehren donald trautman,jurisdiction to adjudicate a suggested analysis,harv.the court defined specific jurisdiction as arising out of or related to the defendant contacts with the forum.id.at.by contrast,the court referred to general jurisdiction as personal jurisdiction over a defendant in a suit not arising out of or related to the defendant contacts with the forum.id.at citations omitted.
in helicopteros,the court concluded that texas courts did not have general jurisdiction over a colombian company,helicol.one of helicol helicopters had been involved in a crash in peru,and the survivors and representatives of the decedents sued helicol in state district court in harris county,texas.helicol filed a special appearance and moved to dismiss the case,but the trial court denied the motion.the court of appeals,however,agreed with helicol that in personam jurisdiction over helicol was lacking.helicopteros nacionales de colombia,hall.our court reversed.hall helicopteros nacionales de colombia.
the supreme court granted certiorari,and it summarized the pertinent jurisdictional facts 
it is undisputed that helicol does not have a place of business in texas and never has been licensed to do business in the state.basically,helicol contacts with texas consisted of sending its chief executive officer to houston for a session accepting into its new york bank account checks drawn on a houston bank purchasing helicopters,equipment,and training services from bell helicopter for substantial sums and sending personnel to bell facilities in fort worth for training.
helicopteros,at.the court concluded that the ceo trip to houston could not be described as a continuous or systematic contact.id.similarly,it held that helicol acceptance of checks drawn on a houston bank was of negligible significance.id.at.the court held,relying on a unanimous opinion written by justice brandeis,that purchases and related trips,standing alone,are not a sufficient basis for a state assertion of jurisdiction.id.at.citing rosenberg curtis brown.
the point at which jurisdictional contacts reach a tipping point,however,has eluded precise formulation.beyond stating that mere purchases and related travel are not enough,the supreme court has given little guidance on the appropriate inquiry for general jurisdiction,although its helicopteros conclusion that general jurisdiction was improper suggests that the requisite level of contacts is fairly substantial.james moore et,moore federal practice ed charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice procedure noting that the court rejection of each contact and its failure to aggregate contacts suggests very strongly that the threshold contacts required for a constitutional assertion of general jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant are very substantial,indeed.perkins benguet consolidated mining,the only case in which that court has upheld a finding of general jurisdiction,offers an insight into the nature of the contacts required.perkins.in assessing whether the nonresident defendant ohio contacts were sufficient to warrant a finding of general jurisdiction,the court noted that the company president,who was also the general manager and principal shareholder,maintained an ohio office in which he did many things on behalf of the company.id.at.he maintained company files in ohio,carried on correspondence from there,drew and distributed salary checks from his ohio office,used two ohio bank accounts for company funds and had an ohio bank act as transfer agent for the company stock,held directors meetings in ohio,supervised policies dealing with the rehabilitation of the corporation properties in the philippines there,and dispatched funds from ohio bank accounts to cover purchases of machinery for such rehabilitation.id.the court concluded that the company carried on in ohio a continuous and systematic supervision of the necessarily limited wartime activities of the company,and even though no mining properties in ohio were owned or operated by the company,many of its wartime activities were directed from ohio and were being given the personal attention of its president in that state at the time he was served with summons.id.at.the court held that under the circumstances above recited,it would not violate federal due process for ohio either to take or decline jurisdiction of the corporation in this proceeding.id.
a general jurisdiction inquiry,therefore,is very different from a specific jurisdiction inquiry and involves a more demanding minimum contacts analysis,csr,link,with a substantially higher threshold,wright miller,federal practice procedure.usually,the defendant must be engaged in longstanding business in the forum state,such as marketing or shipping products,or performing services or maintaining one or more offices there activities that are less extensive than that will not qualify for general in personam jurisdiction.wright miller,federal practice procedure see also hall,at pope,dissenting noting that substantial and continuous activity required for general jurisdiction suggests that defendant must establish some close substantial connection with the state approaching the relationship between the state and its own residents moore federal practice stating that general jurisdiction typically requires the defendant to have an office in the forum state lea brilmayer,a general look at general jurisdiction,proposing that the basic inquiry must be whether the defendant level of activity rises to the level of activity of an insider,so that relegating the defendant to the political processes is fair charles rocky rhodes,clarifying general jurisdiction,seton hall,suggesting that a proper general jurisdiction query should evaluate whether the defendant engaged in activities in the forum state similar in frequency and nature to the activities of local businesses mary twitchell,the myth of general jurisdiction,harv,noting that traditional indicia of general jurisdiction are a home base,an agent for the service of process,a local office,or the pursuance of business from a tangible locale within the state.
general jurisdiction has been described as,an exercise of the court jurisdiction made without regard to the nature of the claim presented.twitchell,the myth of general jurisdiction,harv.at.it involves a court ability to exercise jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant based on any claim,including claims unrelated to the defendant contacts with the state.moore federal practice.some commentators suggest that courts assessing general jurisdiction employ an analytical device to determine whether the jurisdiction is,in fact.twitchell,the myth of general jurisdiction,at rhodes,clarifying general jurisdiction,seton hall.at.they propose that the court construct a hypothetical claim without any forum connection to insure that any related forum activities of the defendant are not improperly infiltrating the query.clarifying general jurisdiction,seton hall.at.for example 
a re the corporate defendant actual activities in california so pervasive and extensive that it should be amenable to the adjudicatory jurisdiction of california for a hypothetical employment discrimination claim filed by a new york citizen employed at corporate headquarters in new york or,with respect to a foreign corporation,do the corporation actual california contacts support jurisdiction even for a hypothetical cause of action arising from its sale of a product in germany that injured a german citizen 
id.at.such an inquiry properly frames the issue,as general jurisdiction is based solely on the defendant continuous and systematic contacts with the forum.helicopteros,at.
minden contacts 
with this in mind,we turn to an analysis of minden texas contacts,as the court of appeals concluded that minden had continuous and systematic contacts with texas sufficient to support general jurisdiction.at.we first determine the appropriate time period for assessing contacts for purposes of general jurisdiction,an issue on which our courts of appeals are in conflict.some examine the defendant activities up to the time of the occurrence that prompted the suit.see medcost,loiseau,no pet.schott glas adame,dist,pet.denied amquip cloud,dist,no pet.others focus on contacts up to the time of filing suit.see,equitable prod,antonio,pet.denied considering corporate defendant relocation from texas,which occurred after the cause of action accrued but before suit was filed,for purposes of determining jurisdiction see also tuscano osterberg,paso,no pet.holding that jurisdictional contacts were too attenuated in time,because such activities occurred more than three years before service of this suit was effected.court of appeals in this the conflict and assessed contacts under both timetables at a relevant continuous contact in this analysis includes those contacts over a period up to the date of injury or up to and including the date suit commenced.
we conclude that the relevant period ends at the time suit is filed.as noted above,general jurisdiction is accordingly,and in contrast to specific jurisdiction,the incident made the basis of the suit should not be the focus in assessing continuous and systematic on which jurisdiction over any claim may be based.see charles rocky rhodes,the predictability principle in personal jurisdiction doctrine a case study of the effects of a generally too broad,but specifically too narrow approach to minimum contacts,baylor,noting that analyzing the contacts at the time of accrual is not appropriate under the proper explanation of general jurisdiction as general adjudicative authority see also wright miller,federal practice procedure noting that a court should consider all of a defendant contacts with the forum state prior to the filing of the lawsuit.we also agree that a mere snapshot of the defendant activities may not be sufficient,see rhodes,predictability principle,baylor.at,and contacts should be assessed over a reasonable number of years,up to the date suit is filed,see access telecom,mci telecomms,cir.this includes contacts at the time the cause of action arose,and it comports with the supreme court guidance on the issue,as well as our prior caselaw.see helicopteros,at.evaluating contacts over the period before suit was filed american type culture collection,coleman,assessing contacts over the period preceding suit.
we now turn to minden contacts up to the time of suit.a general jurisdiction inquiry can be tedious,as it demands that all contacts be carefully investigated,compiled,sorted,and analyzed for proof of a pattern of continuing and systematic activity.schlobohm schapiro.in conducting this inquiry,jajah eddington status as a texas resident,her treatment in minden hospital emergency room,and her family choice not to sue minden are irrelevant.instead,we focus solely on minden contacts with texas.minden is a nonresident limited partnership that owns a hospital licensed by the state of louisiana.minden only facility is in minden,louisiana,and ninety percent of its patients reside within a mile radius of minden hospital.minden does not advertise in texas.it owns no texas property and has no texas office or bank accounts,nor does it maintain a registered agent for service of process here.the court of appeals relied on three categories of contacts in determining that minden texas contacts were continuous and systematic minden employees attendance at seminars in texas minden purchases from vendors with texas addresses and three contracts with texas entities.we examine each in turn.
texas trips 
the evidence showed that,since,minden employees attended two meetings in dallas.these isolated trips fall short of the continuous and systematic contact the supreme court requires.in helicopteros,the supreme court rejected the notion that multiple trips to fort worth supported general jurisdiction,noting that the trips did not in any way enhance the company contacts with texas.at.see also kulko california superior court,d basing california jurisdiction on and stopovers in that state would make a mockery of due process limitations on assertion of personal jurisdiction indus.sand ass gibson,concluding that attending a meeting in texas,as well as periodic mailings to texas members,presented no evidence of general jurisdiction.we agree with that analysis.
payments to texas vendors 
since october,minden paid to entities with texas addresses.the largest payment,was to alcon laboratories in dallas,texas,and the second largest,to centerpoint energy in houston,texas.most of the remaining payments are for less than each.in helicopteros,at,the supreme court held that mere purchases,even if occurring at regular intervals,are not enough to warrant a state assertion of in personam jurisdiction over a nonresident corporation in a cause of action not related to those purchase transactions.and we have recognized that purchases from texas vendors will not alone support the exercise of general jurisdiction.american type culture collection,at.we conclude that the payments to texas vendors do not support general jurisdiction over minden in texas.
contracts with texas entities 
the court of appeals also identified three contracts with a texas connection a september,contract with cox business services,a tyler,company,for internet service at a charge of per month and a cable modem a july contract with lone star research,located in the woodlands,texas,pursuant to which lone star research would conduct a marketing survey of adult residents in minden hospital service area and an april professional services agreement with horizon radiology,a texas company,whereby horizon would provide specialty coverage via teleradiology equipment to minden hospital,in exchange for per month.
we agree with the court of appeals that the cox contract,entered into after suit was filed,is irrelevant to the jurisdictional inquiry here.at.the lone star contract pursuant to which a texas company conducted a marketing study of residents in minden hospital service louisiana,as ninety percent of the hospital patients live within miles of the not establish a continuous and systematic texas contact.lone star agreed to conduct telephone interviews and analyze the data within a week of the survey completion,in exchange for.this type of sporadic texas contact is not substantial enough for general jurisdiction.
of the three contracts,the horizon agreement has the most substantial connection to texas.the agreement,signed in and renewed twice thereafter,required that physicians located in texas provide teleradiology services,for which minden supplied the necessary equipment,in exchange for per month.even this agreement,however,does not support general jurisdiction.hiring a contractor to perform such limited services in the forum state does not equate to continuous and systematic contacts.
even when amassed,minden texas contacts simply are not continuous and systematic general business contacts sufficient to support general jurisdiction,particularly when compared to the substantial,regular business activities conducted by the nonresident defendant in perkins.helicopteros,at.perkins,at.instead,the facts here are more like those described in helicopteros the nonresident defendant had limited contacts with texas but none sufficient to support general jurisdiction.accordingly,the court of appeals erred in holding otherwise.
jurisdictional 
as its second basis for general jurisdiction,the court of appeals imputed province texas contacts to minden,concluding the two entities operated as a single business enterprise and that minden,through province,did business in texas.in,the supreme court of the united states considered whether a north carolina court had jurisdiction over a nonresident parent corporation whose subsidiary did business in north carolina.cannon cudahy packing.in affirming the district court dismissal for lack of jurisdiction,the court held 
through ownership of the entire capital stock and otherwise,the defendant dominates its subsidiary,immediately and completely and exerts its control both commercially and financially in substantially the same way,and mainly through the same individuals,as it does over those selling branches or departments of its business not separately incorporated which are established to market the defendant products in other states.the existence of the subsidiary as a distinct corporate entity is,however,in all respects observed.its books are kept separate.all transactions between the two corporations are represented by appropriate entries in their respective books in the same way as if the two were wholly independent corporations.
id.the court concluded that the corporate separation,though perhaps merely formal,was real.it was not pure fiction.id.at.
the court has never disavowed cannon,despite an opportunity to do so.instead,it essentially echoed the cannon rule in keeton hustler magazine,d.see william voxman,comment,jurisdiction over a parent corporation in its subsidiary state of incorporation,noting that keeton footnote implicitly recognized cannon continuing validity.in that case,rehnquist,writing for the court,noted that jurisdiction over a parent corporation does not automatically establish jurisdiction over a wholly owned subsidiary each defendant contacts with the forum state must be assessed individually.keeton,at.see also voxman.at noting that t he clear implication of rehnquist assertion is that the nature of the relationship may well be a factor in determining whether jurisdiction comports with due process,but the existence of the relationship will not,in and of itself,be dispositive of the issue.
the fifth circuit court of appeals followed cannon in hargrave fibreboard 
cannon stands for the proposition that so long as a parent and subsidiary maintain separate and distinct corporate entities,the presence of one in a forum state may not be attributed to the other.cases in this circuit appear to have followed the cannon rule in applying the texas statute,although sometimes without explicit citation.we have noted often that stock ownership and commonality of officers and directors are not alone sufficient to establish an alter ego relationship between two corporations.generally,our cases demand proof of control by the parent over the internal business operations and affairs of the subsidiary in order to fuse the two for jurisdictional purposes.the degree of control exercised by the parent must be greater than that normally associated with common ownership and directorship.all the relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the operations of the parent and subsidiary must be examined to determine whether two separate and distinct corporate entities exist.
hargrave,cir citations omitted.the court held that the two corporations at issue maintained a degree of corporate separation that was more than superficial and t he policy making authority held and exercised by the parent was no more than that appropriate for a sole shareholder of a corporation and not enough to warrant the extraterritorial exercise of jurisdiction over that shareholder.id.at.the court concluded the lone star of texas may shine brightly throughout the world,but its long arm is not judicially all encompassing.id.
we recently followed hargrave and,by implication,cannon in explaining when the contacts of a related corporate entity may be considered for purposes of determining general jurisdiction.bmc software,marchand.we held that p ersonal jurisdiction may exist over a nonresident defendant if the relationship between the foreign corporation and its parent corporation that does business in texas is one that would allow the court to impute the parent corporation doing business to the subsidiary.id.at citing hargrave,at and walker newgent,cir.the rationale for exercising jurisdiction is that the parent corporation exerts such domination and control over its subsidiary that they do not in reality constitute separate and distinct corporate entities but are one and the same corporation for purposes of jurisdiction.id.quoting hargrave,at citations omitted.we required that the party seeking to ascribe one corporation actions to another by disregarding their distinct corporate entities prove this allegation,because texas law presumes that two separate corporations are distinct entities.accord wright miller,federal practice procedure noting a reluctance to exercise personal
