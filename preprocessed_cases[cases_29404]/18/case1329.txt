in this fraud in the inducement action against the general partners of a limited partnership,a jury found in favor of respondent george miske,as assignee of a limited partner fraud claim,and the court entered judgment for,including compound prejudgment interest.following the denial of posttrial motions,the court awarded miske substantial attorney fees,based on the attorney fee provision in the underlying limited partnership agreement lpa.now appellant coxeter challenges the judgment against him because the jury found that he did not participate in or ratify the fraud perpetrated on a limited partner by his partner,appellant bisno.he relies principally on kazanjian rancho estates,d,d kazanjian,in which the reviewing court held that an innocent general partner is not personally liable to a limited partner for the wrongdoing of a partner.we affirm the judgment against coxeter,concluding that for purposes of ascertaining his liability for bisno wrongdoing under the rule of kazanjian,we treat the defrauded limited partner in question as an innocent third party.
all appellants challenge the award of attorney fees to miske and the compounding of prejudgment interest.we reverse the attorney fee award because the limited partner assignment to miske of its fraud claim did not pass to him any rights under the lpa.and finally,we affirm the compound prejudgment interest award on grounds of estoppel.
background 
formation of and investment in limited partnerships 
in,appellants james coxeter,robert bisno and tafc formed two california limited partnerships for the purpose of redeveloping certain property in downtown berkeley appellant taci and trans action commercial mortgage investors,tacmi.both companies were private placement limited partnerships.coxeter,bisno and tafc were the general partners of the two limited partnerships.
bisno was responsible for managing the berkeley project coxeter managed projects in southern california and other parts of the state.bisno approved the promotional work for the berkeley project,handled the advertising,flyers and brochures on behalf of the partnerships,and approved and oversaw distribution of a private placement memorandum.as well,bisno solicited potential investors,took them to the site,gave tours of the property,and made presentations encouraging them to invest.
in early,bisno transferred from tacmi for his personal use to purchase a personal residence,without the knowledge or consent of the other partners.
then in february and april,bisno met with makoto moriwaki,the president and owner of the hong kong company haldir,haldir to discuss the partnerships.moriwaki traveled each time to berkeley,and visited the property.haldir ultimately purchased tacmi limited partnership units for.on april,its managing director executed a subscription agreement.thereafter,moriwaki tendered the purchase money.and finally,on april,bisno,on behalf of the partnership,countersigned the subscription agreement accepting haldir subscription and making the company a limited partner.
for a short period of time thereafter,haldir received distributions totaling from tacmi,and then the payments stopped.haldir received new cash flow projections from tacmi that were significantly less than the original projections.
in march,haldir sold its tacmi limited partnership interest for to berkeley commercial center,llc berkeley center.
in,dolores staudenraus,another tacmi limited partner,sued tacmi,bisno,coxeter and others for fraud.the general partners of tacmi.
respondent miske,another tacmi investor,had been instrumental in introducing moriwaki to the berkeley project.in he traveled to japan to meet with moriwaki.miske discussed the misconduct and bad things that had happened in the partnership before haldir invested in the company.after learning of the wrongdoing,moriwaki,on behalf of haldir,assigned to miske all of haldir right,title,and interest in any and all of our claims and causes of action for the monetary losses sustained as a result of the fraud and deceit of bisno,coxeter,tacmi,taci and tafc that induced haldir to purchase and me to facilitate the purchase by haldir of the limited partnerships units in tacmi.according to the terms of the assignment,haldir would receive percent of any net recovery miske obtained on the assigned claims.
prior to investing in tacmi,moriwaki had not been advised of multiple material facts concerning the project,including that the purchase price of a key asset was million above its appraised value contrary to a statement in the promotional materials that the property was acquired with no markup,in fact a markup had been added to the price of the property before the seller sold it to taci and tacmi and bisno embezzled from tacmi to buy a home.
litigation and procedural history 
in late and early,miske,on his own behalf and as assignee of haldir claim,and other tacmi limited partners separately filed actions against tacmi,taci,and three of the limited partnerships general partners bisno,coxeter and tafc.each action alleged that plaintiffs had been fraudulently induced to purchase units in tacmi.the court consolidated the three actions,but thereafter ordered that those plaintiffs entitled to trial preference because of age and health issues the preference plaintiffs would have their claims tried separately,before the claims of the plaintiffs.miske was not a member of the preferential group.
the jury returned a special verdict in the preference plaintiffs case against all defendants,awarding damages of and compound prejudgment interest of more than million as of the date of judgment.this court affirmed the judgment in an unpublished opinion.emanuele bisno,wl emanuele.
after the remittitur issued on the preference plaintiffs claims,defendants settled with all remaining plaintiffs except miske,as haldir assignee.prior to trial,miske asked the court to bar relitigation of certain issues,namely relating to proof of defendants fraudulent conduct and the propriety of the compound interest award.ultimately the court ruled in haldir favor,and instructed the jury as follows you must accept as proven that all defendants made knowing,intentional,and deceptive misrepresentations and concealment in and that were material and important were made with the intent to deceive and induce persons to purchase tacmi limited partnership units and were made with the intent to have purchasers rely on the misrepresentations.the court also instructed the jury on the liability of a partner a limited partnership and each of its general partner s is responsible for the harm caused by the wrongful conduct of a general partner while acting within the scope of his authority,e ven if the other general partners were not aware of it or did not participate in the wrongful conduct.robert bisno conduct was within the scope of his authority 
on the issue of compound interest,the court ruled that d efendants are barred from relitigating the plaintiff entitlement to prejudgment compound interest if plaintiff prevails on his fraud claim at trial.the positive misconduct of the defendants is the same in the present case and in the case of the preference plaintiffs whose claims have already been tried.
the jury in the present case returned a special verdict finding that haldir reasonably relied on a concealment by bisno that was a substantial factor in causing harm to it bisno was acting within the scope of his authority when he concealed a material fact from haldir coxeter did not ratify bisno harmful conduct and the amount of compensatory damages,including compound interest,was.the court entered judgment stating the jury returned a special verdict against all defendants and decreed that miske recover from defendants jointly and severally.
thereafter coxeter moved unsuccessfully for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or,alternatively,to set aside and vacate the judgment and enter a new judgment.coxeter argued he was an innocent general partner and could not be liable to limited partner haldir for his partner tortious conduct,citing kazanjian.the trial court disagreed,finding kazanjian distinguishable because haldir was an innocent third party for purposes of determining defendant coxeter liability for the actions of defendant robert bisno.
miske moved for an award of attorney fees,relying on a provision in the tacmi limited partnership agreement.responding to coxeter argument that haldir was not entitled to a fee award because the company prevailed against him based on its status as an innocent third party and not as a limited partner,the court ruled that o nce the purchase of its limited partnership interest had been made,haldir was entitled to the benefit of the attorney fees clause in the partnership agreement.the court awarded in attorney fees,exclusive of costs.these consolidated appeals followed.
ii.discussion 
coxeter liability 
coxeter first protests that miske can not recover from him because he was found innocent of any wrongdoing.we start with the general proposition that all partners in a partnership are bound by the fraud of a copartner acting within the scope of his or her authority in a partnership transaction with an innocent third party,and thus all are responsible liable for the injury occasioned thereby.stout turney cal d,fn.coxeter,however,maintains that because the jury found that only bisno concealed material information from haldir,coxeter is an innocent general partner and thus can not be liable to haldir,a limited partner,for bisno tortious acts.from this coxeter asserts that the court erred in entering a joint and several judgment against him based on the premise that haldir fraud claim,asserted by miske as assignee,was brought in the capacity of a third party rather than a limited partner.
coxeter centers his argument on kazanjian.there,limited partner kazanjian sued two general partners for one partner misappropriation of partnership funds.the other partner was innocent of any wrongdoing,and the wrongdoing occurred well after the limited partner joined the partnership.the matter was referred to a referee for an accounting,and the trial court rendered judgment in accord with the referee findings.denying kazanjian claim against the innocent general partner,the court ruled that such a partner was not personally liable to a limited partner for damages suffered by acts of the partner.kazanjian,supra,d at,d.
not surprisingly,the question on appeal was whether the innocent general partner was jointly liable to the limited partner for the loss he suffered because of the other partner malfeasance.the reviewing court concluded he was not,turning to provisions of the corporations code law to determine the rights of a limited partner.the court noted that in general,the liability of a general partner to a limited partner is the same as his or her liability to another general partner.kazanjian,supra,d at,d.at the time,the obligations of a misappropriating partner were spelled out in former corporations code section,subdivision,as follows every partner must account to the partnership for any benefit,and hold as trustee for it any profits derived by him without the consent of the other partners former,as added by stats,ch,repealed by stats,ch,eff.observing that the misappropriating partner holds profits improperly derived as trustee,the court concluded that partnership law thus incorporated the fiduciary concepts of our trust law.kazanjian,supra,at,d.further,at the time of the transactions in question,civil code section provided a trustee is responsible for the wrongful acts of a to which he consented,or which,by his negligence,he enabled the latter to commit,but for no others.enacted in,repealed by stats,ch.from this the court concluded that cotrustees and copartners are not liable for loss caused by misdeeds of their cofiduciaries unless they are personally in some way at fault either by participating in the tort through consent or otherwise,or by negligence in permitting it to occur.kazanjian,supra,at,d.
as well,the kazanjian court underscored that a general partner exposure to liability to a limited partner is not as extensive as a general partner potential liability to partnership creditors.kazanjian,supra,d at,d.while stressing that a limited partner in the capacity of limited partner is not a creditor,the court was clear that all general partners,including innocent general partners,are jointly and severally liable to creditors for the tortious acts of a copartner done in connection with,or in the process of,the partnership business.id.at,d.further,although like a creditor,a limited partner has no control of the partnership business,the limited partner has made a business decision to relinquish control over business management in return for limiting her liability to her investment.historically,our limited partnership law was based on two assumptions first,that public policy did not require limited partners to be responsible for partnership obligations.second,persons in business should be able,while remaining themselves liable without limit for the obligations contracted in its conduct,to associate with others who contribute to the capital and acquire rights of ownership,provided that such contributors do not compete with creditors for the assets of the partnership.citations.id.at,d,italics omitted.
the legal question we must resolve is whether to treat haldir as an innocent third party or an innocent limited partner,for purposes of its assigned fraud in the inducement claim.haldir complaint is that it purchased the limited partnership in reasonable reliance on bisno representations,which in fact were false and bisno knew they were false.had it known the truth about the concealed facts,it would not have purchased the units or become a limited partner.further,haldir would not have paid what it did for the units since the units,under the circumstances,had no value.the jury specifically found that haldir reasonably relied on a concealment of bisno,haldir reliance on the concealment was a substantial factor in causing harm to it,and bisno was acting within the scope of his authority when he made the concealment.
bisno tortious concealment occurred before haldir paid money for the units,and induced haldir to purchase units it later deemed were worthless once it discovered the fraud.the diminishment in value occurred at the moment of purchase,notwithstanding that it was discovered later,after haldir had become a limited partner.at the moment of purchase,haldir is in the same shoes as any defrauded innocent third party purchasing a partnership asset.it had not yet retained any benefits from the partnership and had not yet begun operating under the lpa.the only difference at that moment between haldir and a generic innocent third party who pays more for a partnership asset than it is worth in a transaction wherein material information was concealed,is that haldir purchased limited partnership units and thereafter became a limited partner.
coxeter argument that we must view this through the lens of the innocent general partner analysis is based on the hypertechnical argument that the cause of action for fraud in the inducement did not accrue until haldir acted in reliance on bisno concealment and sustained damages as a result.see blickman turkus,lp mf downtown sunnyvale,llc th,d elements of action for fraud and deceit based on concealment are the defendant concealed a material fact the defendant had a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff the defendant intentionally concealed the fact with intent to defraud the plaintiff was unaware of the fact and would not have acted had she or he had knowledge of the concealed fact and the plaintiff sustained damages as a result of the concealment.
haldir relied on the flawed representations when it made the decision to purchase the partnership units.that reliance of course continued through the signing of the partnership agreement and payment of money at which precise moment haldir suffered damages,the units were worth less than the purchase price or perhaps nothing.coxeter position that the elements of reliance and injury did not occur until haldir became a limited partner exalts form over substance and may be technically true.however,haldir did not become an innocent limited partner within the meaning of kazanjian at that precise m
