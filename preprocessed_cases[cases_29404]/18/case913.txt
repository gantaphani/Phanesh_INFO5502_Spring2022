we must decide whether police officers may rely on unlawfully obtained evidence to defend themselves against a constitutional tort action for false arrest.
on the afternoon of june,lia lingo was engaged in an ongoing dispute with her neighbor,suzanne tegroen,regarding tegroen pet dog.in the course of the day,lingo and tegroen each contacted the salem,oregon,police department,and that night officer steven elmore was dispatched to tegroen residence to investigate.tegroen told elmore that she felt verbally abused by lingo and felt the need to tread lightly around her elmore responded that lingo conduct did not sound criminal,but that he would try to speak with lingo to ease tensions.
elmore walked to lingo house and noticed that its rear outside light was on.rather than go to the home front door,elmore walked through lingo carport and knocked on the rear door located within.stephanie moore,a visitor,answered the door and went to retrieve lingo to speak with elmore.elmore stated that as soon as moore opened the door,he smelled marijuana.
lingo came outside to speak with elmore,and he asked her about the marijuana odor.lingo explained that she was burning incense which she admitted smells like marijuana but insisted that she had no actual marijuana inside.skeptical,elmore asked for permission to search lingo house lingo refused.later,another officer,justin carney,arrived at lingo house to join elmore.carney stated that he also smelled marijuana coming from the house,and again the officers asked for permission to search the home.lingo again refused.
at some point during the course of elmore discussion with lingo,lingo child opened the back door and peered out.elmore asked lingo if there were children in her home,and she confirmed that she lived with her two minor children.eventually,after lingo repeated refusals to allow the officers to search her home,they placed her under arrest for endangering the welfare of a minor,in violation of or.stat.
after lingo was arrested,elmore went into the home and collected the two children so that they could be moved somewhere safer.while lingo sat in elmore police car,the children sat in the carport and eventually in the back of carney police car.at lingo direction,the children were brought to her great aunt house under oregon department of human services supervision,where they remained for eight days.
following lingo arrest,the police obtained a warrant to search lingo home for controlled substances,based upon an affidavit from elmore describing the marijuana odor he smelled at her house.pursuant to the warrant,salem police searched lingo home and found several glass bongs,grams of marijuana including packaging,small baggies commonly used as drug packaging materials,and a small amount of klonopin,which is a schedule iv prescription drug.
lingo was charged by the marion county district attorney with two counts of child endangerment under or.stat.before trial,lingo moved to suppress evidence the police obtained in their search of her home,arguing that officers elmore and carney violated the fourth amendment by entering her carport and approaching her home back door.lingo argued that any evidence collected by the police thereafter should be suppressed as the fruit of that initial unlawful search.the trial court agreed and granted lingo motion to suppress.the charges against lingo were later dropped.
lingo then filed suit under against elmore,carney,and the city of salem,alleging that the officers violated the first,fourth,and fourteenth amendments of the federal constitution by falsely arresting her without probable cause and by interfering with her and her children right to familial association by causing her children to be removed from her home.she sought both compensatory and punitive damages.
the officers and the city moved for summary judgment,and lingo moved for partial summary judgment.in her motion,lingo argued that the officers violated her fourth amendment rights by entering the curtilage of her home to approach the back door.lingo motion did not specify how that violation related to her claims for false arrest or wrongful separation from her children.perhaps anticipating that,if she prevailed on her motion,lingo would then attempt to prevent the officers from introducing evidence obtained in violation of the fourth amendment to defend themselves and to justify their decision to arrest her,the district court requested briefing on the issue of whether the exclusionary rule had any application in this case.
after receiving the supplemental briefing,the district court agreed with lingo that the officers had indeed violated the fourth amendment by entering her home curtilage,but concluded that the exclusionary rule does not apply to claims.the court thus held that the officer initial fourth amendment violation did not taint their ultimate arrest of lingo and found that,based on the marijuana they smelled at the house,the officers indeed had probable cause to arrest her.the court further held that the officers permissibly relocated lingo children to her aunt home,where they would be away from the suspected marijuana use and where they would not be left home alone.finally,the court concluded that lingo had not adequately demonstrated municipal liability.the court granted summary judgment for all defendants.
lingo timely appealed.
on appeal,lingo challenges only the district court ruling that her arrest was valid specifically,she contends that the district court erred in concluding that the officers had probable cause to arrest her.she argues that such conclusion was flawed because the officers may not establish probable cause through evidence they gathered as a result of their illegal entry into her carport and in any event,the undisputed facts at the scene did not support a finding of probable cause.
we address each argument in turn.
lingo primary argument on appeal is that the officers unlawful entry into her home curtilage necessarily tainted the arrest that followed.drawing from the exclusionary rule doctrine,she argues that,because the officers were not constitutionally permitted to stand at her house back door they did not have probable cause to arrest her on the basis of evidence they perceived from that unlawful vantage point.
we first consider lingo contention that the exclusionary rule itself should apply in a case 
of course,the government may not use evidence seized during an unlawful search as proof against the victim at criminal trial.see wong sun united states.the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine extends the exclusionary rule to require suppression of other evidence that is derived from and is thus tainted by the illegal search or seizure.see id.at.these rules are not constitutionally required,but instead are judicially created means of deterring illegal searches and seizures.bd.of prob.parole scott.and because the exclusionary rule is prudential rather than constitutionally mandated,courts apply it only where its deterrence benefits outweigh its substantial social costs.id.internal quotation marks omitted.suppression of evidence through the rule has always been our last resort,not our first impulse.hudson michigan.
the exclusionary rule is not a personal constitutional right of the party aggrieved.united states calandra.correspondingly,the rule does not proscribe the introduction of illegally seized evidence in all proceedings or against all persons.bd.of,at internal quotation marks omitted.indeed,the supreme court has repeatedly declined to extend the exclusionary rule to proceedings other than criminal trials.id.for example,the court has held that the rule does not apply to grand jury proceedings,civil tax proceedings,civil deportation proceedings,or parole revocation proceedings.see id.at.
critical here,standing to invoke the exclusionary rule has been confined to situations where the government seeks to use such evidence to incriminate the victim of the unlawful search.calandra,at emphasis added.this limitation makes sense the need to deter unlawful conduct is strongest when that conduct could result in criminal sanction for the victim of the search.id.moreover,preventing the gover
