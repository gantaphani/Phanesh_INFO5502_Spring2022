we must decide a case of first impression involving insider trading liability under the federal securities laws.
on august,donald johnson on behalf of himself and all other persons who purchased the common stock of daimlerchrysler ag daimlerchrysler on nine different dates between march,and june,brought this securities fraud class action against james aljian,kirk kerkorian,and tracinda corporation kerkorian is an executive and sole shareholder of tracinda aljian is an executive of tracinda and a member of the daimlerchrysler shareholder committee.
the amended complaint alleges illegal insider trading against all defendants in violation of section b of the exchange act of exchange act,and rules and promulgated thereunder control person liability against aljian and kerkorian based on section a of the exchange act and contemporaneous trading liability against all defendants based on section of the exchange act 
the amended complaint alleges that aljian attended a daimlerchrysler shareholder committee meeting,where he was given a board report entitled daimlerchrysler operative planning and marked strictly confidential.the report projected a significant decline in free cash flows.the amended complaint further claims that aljian placed the report in tracinda central files,which were readily accessible to kerkorian.the amended complaint does not allege that aljian informed kerkorian of the projected decline in free cash flows,but alleges that he knew that kerkorkian had unrestricted access to the report.
the amended complaint also alleges that,with the benefit of such insider information,tracinda sold approximately million shares of daimlerchrysler stock between march,and june.finally,the amended complaint alleges that when daimlerchrysler announced a decline in cash flows in july,the price of its shares dropped.
the defendants filed a motion to dismiss,arguing that the claims for violation of sections b and a were the amended complaint lacked the particularity required by.b and the private securities litigation reform act of,the amended complaint failed to establish the elements of insider trading,including scienter,materiality,loss causation,undisclosed inside information and the claim under section could not survive dismissal of the section b claim,which served as the sole predicate violation.the district court granted the motion to dismiss with prejudice the sections b and a claims as barred by the applicable statute of limitations,but denied the motion to dismiss the section claim.johnson aljian,d.
the district court certified the issue involving the section claim for interlocutory appeal pursuant to b,and we granted the defendants petition for permission to appeal.
the defendants argue on appeal that the district court erred by not dismissing the section claim.the defendants contend that section requires an actionable predicate violation of the exchange act.although the section claim was timely filed under its own period of limitations,the section b sole predicate violation of the exchange act in this not independently actionable because the claim has been dismissed as under its separate period of limitations.therefore,the defendants urge,the district court should have also dismissed the section claim.
our analysis must begin with the statutory language.united states trw rifle caliber,cir.when interpreting section,we must give words their ordinary or plain meaning.id.w e follow the common practice of consulting dictionary definitions to clarify their ordinary meaning and look to how the terms were defined at the time the statute was adopted.id.internal quotation marks omitted alterations in original.we also recognize the cardinal rule of statutory construction that significance and effect shall,if possible,be accorded to every word.market hoffman.but interpreting a statute is a holistic endeavor.united sav.ass of timbers of inwood forest,d.we therefore look not only to the language itself,but also to the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.robinson shell oil,d.
section provides a cause of action against a ny person who violates any provision of this chapter or the rules or regulations thereunder by purchasing or selling a security while in possession of material,nonpublic information.exchange act a section also includes an express statute of limitations which provides that n o action may be brought under this section more than years after the date of the last transaction that is the subject of the violation.exchange act b.
the term violates in section is crucial.claims under section are derivative and therefore require an independent violation of the exchange act.see lipton pathogenesis,cir see also in re advanta.sec,cir jackson life ins.merrill lynch,cir in re verifone sec,cir.the defendants claim that the statute is clear a viable predicate violation is required.but the defendants seek to introduce an additional requirement into the text.nowhere do we find in the statute such modifying or restricting terms as viable,actionable,or timely.
webster third new international dictionary,the edition in print when congress enacted section in,defines the verb violates to mean breaking or disregarding the law.webster third new int l dictionary ed see also black law dictionary ed defining violation to mean i njury infringement breach of right,duty,or law.when,for example,someone asks if a person violated the speeding law,she is ordinarily understood as inquiring whether that person disregarded the posted speed limit,not whether a timely action commenced or a successful prosecution resulted.we believe that the term violates ordinarily is understood to mean that a person has satisfied the essential elements of the proscribed act regardless of whether an action is commenced within the applicable statute of limitations or whether a traffic citation was issued.indeed,we have employed this common understanding of the term with respect to an action under section b,the predicate violation in this case.for example,in ambassador hotel,investment,cir,we explained 
t o prove violation of either section b or rule,the private plaintiff must demonstrate that the alleged fraud occurred in connection with the purchase or sale of a security.once this foundational requirement has been met,the plaintiff must prove five elements.misrepresentation or omission,where there exists some duty to disclose.materiality.scienter intent to defraud or deceive.reliance and.causation.the plaintiff must prove both actual cause transaction causation and proximate cause loss causation.
id.at citations omitted emphasis added accordingly,we are persuaded that the plain meaning of the term violates does not require that the predicate claim be filed within its own period of limitations.
that the predicate violation need not itself be actionable is further supported by the statutory language of other provisions of the exchange act.in particular,the statute of limitations applicable to section b,the predicate violation in this case,measures the period of limitations in relation to the violation.a section b claim must be commenced within one year after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation and within three years after such violation.lampf,at.emphasis added,superseded in part by statute,b a private right of action that involves a claim of fraud,deceit,manipulation,or contrivance in contravention of a regulatory requirement concerning the securities laws may be brought not later than the earlier of years after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation or years after such violation.see also exchange act,e no action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under this section,unless brought within one year after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation and within three years after such violation.because the period of limitations is measured from the point of violation,it challenges common sense to conclude that a person only violates section b if an action is commenced within that period.
finally,the defendants interpretation effectively treats section own statute of limitations unde
