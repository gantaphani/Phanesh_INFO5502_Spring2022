introduction 
this appeal is from an order of the trial court resolving a dispute between pv little italy,llc pv little italy and india street venture,llc india street,over their respective rights in a mixed office and retail condominium development in downtown san diego,known as metrowork.india street was the original owner and developer of metrowork,the centerpiece of which is the retail space that ultimately became the live music and dining venue called anthology.for india street,anthology was the most important feature of the development,and was the focal point of india street efforts in bringing the metrowork project to fruition.to protect its investment,and in particular,its interest in the retail space,india street drafted a declaration of covenants,conditions and restrictions cc rs that grants to the declarant defined as,initially,india street certain rights to control the development and management of the property.among those rights is a special membership in the metrowork condominium association association that entitles the declarant to exercise enhanced class b voting rights with respect to any units it owns.those enhanced voting rights are at the center of the parties dispute.
to finance metrowork,india street obtained a million construction loan from keybank,keybank.in connection with that loan,india street entered into a construction deed of trust,assignment of rents,security agreement and fixture filing trust deed with keybank,pursuant to which it conveyed to keybank a security interest in the entire metrowork project.the trust deed explicitly covered not only the real and personal property,but also india street rights as declarant under the cc rs,including the class b voting rights.
as construction neared completion,india street was able to repay a portion of the loan,with the assistance of another loan provided by pacific western bank pacific western.in exchange for india street satisfaction of a portion of its debt,keybank executed a substitution of trustee and deed of partial reconveyance reconveyance deed,releasing to india street keybank security interest in the retail units of metrowork,which housed anthology.by its terms,however,the reconveyance deed covered only the retail units themselves and the common areas and personal property associated with those units.unlike the original trust deed,the reconveyance deed did not mention the declarant rights associated with the retail units.
when india street defaulted on the balance of the keybank loan,the trustee under the trust deed conveyed the remaining unsold condominium units in metrowork to oreo oreo,an entity related to keybank,in a foreclosure sale.keybank specifically conveyed to oreo any and all interest that it had in the declarant rights.oreo subsequently conveyed the remaining condominium units to pv little italy.at the same time,oreo assigned to pv little italy all of the declarant rights,if any,that oreo possessed at that time,without representation or warranty of any kind as to the existence of same.
after acquiring the property and rights in metrowork,pv little italy informed the association by letter that it was now the declarant,and as such,held the right to exercise class b voting rights.in its letter,pv little italy nominated its own slate of candidates for election to the association board at the upcoming annual meeting.india street also claimed to hold declarant rights by virtue of the reconveyance from keybank,and in particular,maintained that it possessed the class b voting rights as to the retail units.the inspectors of election,llc inspectors,determined that in view of the dispute as to which entity held the class b voting rights,neither party would be permitted to exercise the enhanced class b voting rights in the upcoming election.instead,both would have to vote as regular class a members.in the election,two of pv little italy representatives were elected to the board,and india street representative lost his position as president of the board.
india street sued,in part under corporations code section section seeking,among other things,a judicial declaration that it holds class b voting rights as to the retail units.pv little italy intervened and,contending that india street had lost all of its declarant rights in the foreclosure,and seeking a declaration that pv little italy obtained those rights,including the class b voting rights,from oreo.after a section mandated hearing,the trial court ruled that india street held class b voting rights as to the retail units,by virtue of the reconveyance deed.the court also determined that pv little italy acquired no declarant rights upon its purchase of the remaining office units after india street default because pv little italy had not acquired any rights by direct assignment from india street,and instead,was an unaffiliated owner.based on these findings,the trial court voided the board election results,and directed that the former board of directors be reinstated and a new election be held.pv little italy appealed.
we are required in this appeal to interpret a number of different provisions in several written instruments,and how they interrelate,to determine which rights are held by whom,and in particular,which entity,if any,has the right to exercise class b voting rights as the declarant.hewing closely to basic tenets that govern the interpretation of written instruments,and based on a straightforward reading of the documents before us,we conclude that india street conveyed a security interest in all of its declarant rights,including its class b voting rights,to keybank in the trust deed,and that india street did not obtain release of keybank interest in any of those rights upon the partial reconveyance.additionally,each of the conveyances after india street default included all of the grantor right,title and interest in metrowork,including the declarant rights,as the cc rs expressly authorize.pv little italy thus simultaneously acquired the status of declarant as well as any declarant rights that were still in existence at the time of the conveyance from oreo to pv little italy,including the class b voting rights as to the remaining unsold condominium units.pv little italy therefore was not an unaffiliated owner within the meaning of the cc rs.
accordingly,we reverse the trial court order in its entirety.
factual and procedural backgrounda.the metrowork cc rs and india street rights thereunder 
metrowork is a commercial common interest condominium development located in downtown san diego.india street purchased the property on which metrowork was built in,and was the original developer of that property.berkson realty,llc berkson realty is the managing member of india street,and howard berkson berkson is the managing member of berkson realty.the metrowork building consists of retail and office condominiums.the first and second floors currently house anthology a dining and live music venue the retail units 
for india street,the anthology space represented the crown jewel of this development.to protect its planned substantial investment in the retail units,and to address the interrelationship between the retail units and the office units in the project,india street drafted the cc rs in for the association,a nonprofit corporation formed pursuant to california nonprofit mutual benefit corporation law.see et the association adopted an amended and restated version of the cc rs in.
under the cc rs,the declarant has a special status.the cc rs define declarant in full,as follows declarant shall initially mean india street venture,llc,its successors,and any person to which it shall have assigned its rights hereunder,in whole or in part,by an express written assignment.as the declarant,india street retained ownership of the retail units.it also initially reserved ownership of units on the ninth floor for uses related to anthology operations.in its capacity as declarant,india street was granted certain rights to control the development and management of metrowork,until such time as all of the units in the project were sold.for example,india street had the right to appoint and remove members of the development committee,which oversaw the plans,specifications and construction progress of metrowork,until such time as all of the units were sold.cc rs.it also reserved for itself certain rights of easement and entry which passed upon the last close of escrow for the sale of a unit from declarant.cc rs.finally,it possessed the right to develop the property only for as long as any condominium in the project remains unsold.cc rs.india street acknowledged in the trial court that pursuant to the scheme created by the cc rs,once all of the units in the building were sold,the declarant rights and privileges in the property would cease to exist,at least as to all units not owned by the declarant and it was anticipated that india street or a related entity would continue to own the retail units.
section of the cc rs defines an o wner of a unit as 
t he record owner,whether one or more persons or persons or entities,of a fee simple interest in a condominium,including declarant with respect to each condominium owned by declarant,and including sellers under executory contracts of sale,but excluding those persons holding title as security for the performance of an obligation.
every unit owner automatically becomes a member of the association,and remains a member until its ownership ceases.additionally,the cc rs specify that a ll memberships shall be appurtenant to the condominium conveyed.there shall be no severance by sale,conveyance,encumbrance or hypothecation of an interest in any unit from the concomitant membership in the association,as long as the cc rs remain in effect.
the cc rs divide membership in the association into different classes,the first two of which are relevant to this appeal.class a members include all owners,each of whom shall be entitled to one vote for each square feet of floor area in such owner unit,rounded to the nearest thousand.most significantly for present purposes,the cc rs provide for a special association membership with enhanced voting rights for the declarant.specifically,the cc rs state the class b member shall be declarant,who is entitled to ten votes for each square feet of floor area in any units owned by declarant.the declarant class b membership would terminate upon the date the declarant no longer owns any units in the property.additionally,the cc rs provided that u pon the sale of a unit owned by declarant to an unaffiliated third party,the class b membership for that unit shall be converted to a class a membership.
b the keybank loan and india street default 
construction began on the metrowork site in.during the early phases of the project,berkson negotiated with keybank to provide a construction loan to fund the project.india street provided keybank a copy of the cc rs and the association bylaws.the parties finalized the loan in january.keybank promptly recorded the trust deed,as well as a ucc financing statement detailing the personal property that was part of the collateral for the loan.as security for the million loan,india street made the following conveyance,in pertinent part,to keybank as beneficiary under the trust deed 
grant.for the purpose of securing payment and performance of the secured obligations defined in the deed of trust,india street hereby irrevocably and unconditionally grants,bargains,sells conveys,mortgages and warrants to trustee,in trust for the benefit of beneficiary,with power of sale and with right of entry and possession,all estate,right,title and interest which trustor now has or may later acquire in and to the following property all or any part of such property,or any interest in all or any part of it,as the context may require,the property 
a the real property the premises together with 
b all buildings,structures and improvements now located or later to be constructed on the premises the improvements together with 
g all of trustor rights,title,interest and privileges whatsoever,as developer declarant subdivider or similar position or title pursuant to any condominium declaration,declaration of covenants,conditions and restrictions,or similar document recorded in the official records of the county in which the premises is located 
the construction loan set forth the circumstances under which india street could obtain a partial reconveyance releasing from the lien of the deed of trust the applicable condominium units,defined elsewhere in the loan as a commercial condominium unit or units and all common areas associated therewith the loan specified as follows 
releases of condominium units shall not affect or t affect or impair the lien of trust deed and lender lien and security interests created by the other loan documents as to condominium units and other property encumbered by the trust deed and the other loan documents not previously released,and said liens and security interests shall continue in full force and effect as to the unreleased condominium units and other such property.
construction of the metrowork project was completed by june,when the notice of completion was recorded.the cc rs were recorded on july.india street had closed escrow on approximately half of the office condominium units by the end of.as the development neared completion,india street began to take steps to obtain release of the retail units from keybank security interest.to that end,india street negotiated the third modification agreement with keybank,dated september,which extended the maturity date of the loan upon satisfaction of several conditions,including various payments for the release of the retail units,and india street securing a small business administration sba loan in connection with the release of those units from the lien of the trust deed.india street successfully obtained that sba loan from pacific western.to perfect its new security interest in the retail units,pacific western recorded two deeds of trust and a ucc financing statement in october,none of which explicitly mentions the declarant rights,but all of which purport to cover,effectively,all of india street right,title and interest in the retail units,including its development rights.
india street successfully obtained release of the retail units from keybank security interest in december,and the reconveyance deed was recorded in february.that document substituted keybank as the trustee under the trust deed,and reconveyed without warranty to the persons legally entitled thereto a portion of the estate held by keybank,namely,units u and u the retail units,together with the common area use rights associated with those units.there is no mention of declarant rights or voting rights in that document.an amended ucc financing statement was also recorded at that time,and it,too,contained no mention of the declarant rights.
as of january,india street had defaulted on the balance of its loan from keybank.negotiations for a forbearance agreement were unsuccessful,and keybank ultimately directed the trustee to foreclose on the trust deed as to the remaining unsold units in the metrowork project.at the foreclosure sale in march,the trustee conveyed to oreo,an affiliate of keybank,all of its right,title and interest in and to the remaining office units and related common areas,t ogether with all of the property set forth on the attached exhibit c,which included a description of the declarant rights.oreo conveyed the foreclosed units to pv little italy on november.on that same day,oreo recorded an assignment and assumption of declarant rights the pvli assignment agreement,by which oreo conveyed to pv little italy,and the latter assumed,oreo right,title,and interest,if any,as the declarant under the cc rs and all other documents,agreements and materials creating or governing the metrowork project,effective from and after the date hereof,but without representation or warranty of any kind as to the existence of same.the grant deed to pv little italy,and the pvli assignment agreement,were both recorded on november,
c.the voting rights dispute and ensuing litigation 
at the annual association meeting scheduled for july,the association board of directors agreed to postpone the election of directors to january,in order to coordinate with the association budgeting activities.by letter dated november,pv little italy informed the association that it had obtained the declarant rights under the cc rs for the metrowork project,and that india street interest in those rights had been extinguished by the foreclosure sale.pv little italy announced its intention to seek the removal of the entire existing board of directors for the association and to nominate a new slate of directors at the january meeting.on january,the association informed its members that inspectors had been retained to conduct the recall election and that there was currently a dispute between two owners as to who is the declarant of the association project and therefore sic class b voting rights.the association also notified members that inspectors had determined that this dispute would have to be settled by arbitration or in the courts,and that to fulfill its statutory obligations,it would conduct the recall election on march,with all members being considered as class a members with the voting power attendant to that class.the march election,at which neither pv little italy nor india street was permitted to exercise the class b voting rights,resulted in the election of two of pv little italy representatives,and the removal of berkson as president of the association board.berkson remained a director.
india street filed its initial complaint in february,and unsuccessfully sought a temporary restraining order to block the march recall election.on april,it filed its verified first amended complaint alleging five causes of action and requesting various forms of relief,including,under section,a determination that india street retained the declarant voting rights under the cc rs.pv little italy intervened and promptly filed a,in which it also sought relief under section.
the trial court held the statutory section hearing on may.see,subd.c.on may,the court issued a minute order in which it concluded that india street retained its declarant class b voting rights,and conversely pv little italy never obtained such rights.with respect to the retail units,the essence of the trial court ruling was that the class b voting rights were an inherent component of ownership of those units.the trial court concluded that despite the fact that the reconveyance deed did not mention the class b voting rights,those rights were within the penumbra of assets that were conveyed back to india street once keybank security interest in those units was terminated.the court thus concluded that oreo obtained no such rights upon the foreclosure,and therefore,could have conveyed no such rights to pv little italy.specifically,with respect to the office units on which india street had defaulted,the trial court found that oreo had obtained those units through a nonjudicial foreclosure sale and had subsequently sold them to pv little italy.the court concluded that because pv little italy did not acquire its ownership rights via direct assignment from india street,pursuant to the cc rs,pv little italy was an unaffiliated owner with no class b voting rights.see cc rs,subd.b.consistent with this ruling,the trial court invalidated the march,election,ordered that a new election be held within days,and reinstated the officers and board that existed prior to the march,election.
discussiona.the trial court order is appealable as an injunction 
we first consider whether the trial court may,order which on its face is not a judgment and did not purport to resolve all issues between the parties is appealable.at our direction,the parties submitted supplemental briefing on this issue.we conclude that the order is appealable under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,in that it granted injunctive relief.
a trial court order is appealable when it is made it is made so by statute.griset fair political practices com.cal th,d,griset.the one final judgment rule,codified in code of civil procedure section,subdivision a allows appeals in a civil case to be taken not only from a judgment,but also from various types of orders,including orders granting or refusing to grant an injunction.whether a particular order constitutes an appealable injunction depends not on its title or the form of the order,but on the substance and effect of the adjudication.in re the clergy cases i th,d,citation omitted clergy cases i.an injunction is defined as a writ or order requiring a person to refrain from a particular act.code civ.injunctions also may command a person to perform a particular act.luckett panos th,d luckett.
in its may,order,after finding that india street retained the class b voting rights and that pv little italy had never acquired those rights,the trial court ruled that the march election was void,and entered the following order a new election must be forthcoming within days of the date of this order.the officers and board for the metrowork condominium association that existed immediately prior to the march,election will immediately retake interim control of the association pending the new election.the plain language of this order constitutes a mandatory injunction,since it required the immediate turnover of control of the association to the prior board and officers,and the holding of a new election.india street disingenuously argues that the order is not appealable as an injunction because it does not expressly grant an injunction.italics added.as noted,however,it is not the form,but the substance of an order that determines its appealability 
another key indicator of whether an order is final and appealable is that no issues in the action remain for further consideration.clergy cases i,supra,th at,d,citation omitted see also canandaigua wine,county of madera th,d a n order constitutes a final judgment despite other causes of action remaining if the order effectively disposes of the entire case.for example,an order is appealable if it resolves an allegation that is essential to all of the causes of action.the may,order resolved the core conflict between the parties by determining on the merits which party possesses the declarant rights,and in particular,the class b voting rights.india street complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief,specific performance,and reformation of the cc rs.the gist of the action was india street effort to have itself declared the party that held the right to exercise the class b voting rights attached to the retail units.pv little italy intervened for the express purpose of resolving whether it,and not india street,is the declarant and holds class b voting rights.pv little italy therefore sought a judicial determination of the voting rights of the parties and the related issues of the validity of the march board election.like india street,pv little italy requested relief under section to resolve these issues.
the order appealed from accomplished that goal,and neither party has indicated that anything more of substance remains to be done in the litigation,except entry of judgment.indeed,as india street acknowledges,it has since voluntarily dismissed its causes of action pertaining to issues other than those raised pursuant to section.see griset,supra,cal th at,d,a decree generally may be considered final where no issue is left for future consideration see also abatti imperial irrigation dist.th,d holding that appellate jurisdiction exists even where claims have been dismissed without prejudice to enable entry of judgment,unless the parties also have stipulated to facilitating future litigation of the dismissed claims.
for the foregoing reasons,the trial court may,order is appealable.we turn now to the merits of pv little italy appeal 
applicable standard of review 
this appeal presents two issues.first,did the reconveyance deed release keybank security interest not only in the retail units themselves,but also in all of the declarant rights,including the class b voting rights as to retail units second,did pv little italy become the declarant upon its purchase of the units from oreo,and thus gain class b voting rights as to those units the trial court determination of these questions turned primarily on the court review and interpretation of various written documents in particular,the cc rs,the trust deed,and the reconveyance deed.
the interpretation of a written instrument,even though it involves what might properly be called questions of fact is essentially a judicial function to be exercised according to the generally accepted canons of interpretation so that the purposes of the instrument may be given effect.parsons bristol development cal d,parsons.an appellate court reviews such instruments independently,unless the interpretation turns upon the credibility of extrinsic evidence.see also harvey v.the landing homeowners th,d harvey where,as here,the trial court interpretation of the cc rs does not turn on the credibility of extrinsic evidence,we independently interpret the meaning of the written instrument.
although india street submitted some extrinsic evidence to aid in the trial court interpretation of the relevant documents,the trial court did not rest its ruling on any of the extrinsic evidence.moreover,while pv little italy attempted to impeach the credibility of india street witnesses,it offered no directly conflicting extrinsic evidence of the parties intent or of their understand of the documents under consideration.instead,pv little italy argued that the documents speak for themselves.because the trial court did not rely on extrinsic evidence,and because the extrinsic evidence that the parties presented was not in conflict,in this appeal we must make an independent determination of the meaning of the written instruments before us.parsons,supra,cal d at,see also home federal savings loan ramos d.here,because the parties presented little relevant and no conflicting extrinsic evidence citation,the trial court properly refused to submit the interpretation of the written guaranty to the jury.citation.likewise,however,we as the reviewing court consider the evidence and interpret the guaranty de novo.
c.the trial court erred in finding that india street,as owner of the retail units,retained the declarant class b voting rights 
the plain language of the cc rs,the trust deed,and the reconveyance deed,all indicate that the class b voting rights associated with the retail units were not reconveyed to india street.
in determining whether the reconveyance deed released keybank security interest in india street declarant rights and the class b voting membership,we are guided by familiar rules that govern the interpretation of written instruments.the fundamental goal of contract interpretation is to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties as it existed at the time they entered into the contract.klein chevron,th,d klein.when a contract is reduced to writing,the intention of the parties is to be ascertained from the writing alone,if possible,klein,supra,at,d see also starlight ridge south homeowners hunter bloor th,d starlight ridge.we consider the contract as a whole and construe the language in context,rather than interpret a provision in isolation.starlight ridge,supra,at,d.when the language of the instrument is unambiguous,we determine the parties intent solely by reference to that language.klein,supra,th at,d see also,language of a contract is to govern the interpretation,if the language is clear and explicit,and does not involve an absurdity.
we begin our analysis with the cc rs,the key document that defines the scope of the declarant rights,the nature of class b association membership,the ability of the declarant to transfer its rights,and the consequences of doing so.at the time the cc rs were created,india street was the original declarant,and as such,initially possessed class b voting rights as to the entire metrowork project.see cc rs,stating declarant shall initially mean india street venture.in addition to the class b voting rights,as declarant,india street also possessed a number of rights under the cc rs that enabled it to control management of the project during development,and to protect its investment in anthology,including the enhanced class b voting rights.see cc rs.importantly,india street had the power to assign its rights under the cc rs to another person or entity.cc rs,section reads,in full declarant shall initially mean india street,its successors,and any person to which it shall have assigned its rights hereunder,in whole or in part,by an express written assignment.see also cc rs,providing that declarant rights may be assigned by declarant to any successor in interest to any portion of declarant interest in any portion of the property by a recorded written assignment.
there is no dispute that,pursuant to cc rs,section,india street assigned its declarant rights,including the class b voting rights,in their entirety,to keybank,as security for a construction loan to finance the metrowork project.the trust deed of which keybank is the beneficiary provided that,as security for the loan,india street,as trustor,hereby irrevocably and unconditionally grants,bargains,sells,conveys,mortgages and warrants to trustee,in trust for the benefit of keybank,with power of sale and with right of entry and possession,all estate,right,title and interest which india street now has or may later acquire to the metrowork property.trust deed.that grant explicitly included a ll of trustor rights,title,interest and privileges whatsoever,as developer,declarant,subdivider or similar position or title pursuant to any condominium declaration,declaration of covenants,conditions and restrictions,or similar document recorded in the official records of the county in which the premises is located.trust deed,subd.g,italics added.
the parties agree that the effect of this conveyance was to lodge with the trustee,for the benefit of keybank,legal title to the property transferred,but that the transfer did not alter india street ability to develop and manage the metrowork project,or to exercise its declarant rights including class b voting rights as to any units it owned,as long as there was no default.see witkin,summary of cal.law ed.security transactions in real property,with a deed of trust that includes the power of sale,title passes to the trustee,who holds it until default,then after sale,it goes from the trustee to the purchaser see also,deed of trust actually gives the trustee only the interest that is necessary to carry out the trust,taking legal title for security only,leaving a legal estate and the ordinary rights of ownership in the trustor.thus,up to the time of its default,india street was able to exercise all of its declarant rights,including voting rights 
in,india street successfully obtained release of the retail units from the lien of the trust deed.however,unlike the original deed of trust,the reconveyance deed made no reference to the declarant rights.india street contends that the language of the reconveyance deed completely released keybank security interest in the owner entire estate consisting of the retail units.however,that is not what the document says.rather,the reconveyance deed reconveyed only a portion of the estate now held by it under the deed of trust as specifically described on exhibit a attached hereto.capitalization in original,italics added.exhibit a describes only the retail units themselves,plus the associated common areas.there is no mention of the declarant rights.in its brief,india street concedes,albeit implicitly,that there is no express release of the declarant rights in the reconveyance deed.in depositions,berkson could recall no specific discussion about voting rights with keybank during negotiations over the reconveyance,and lorne polger polger,the attorney who negotiated the terms of the reconveyance on behalf of india street,acknowledged that there had been no such discussions.
our conclusion that there was no reconveyance of the declarant rights is further buttressed by the language of the original construction loan from keybank,which specifically provides that a partial reconveyance shall not affect or impair the lien of the deed of trust and lender lien and security interests created by the other loan documents as to the condominium units and other property encumbered by the trust deed and the other loan documents not previously released,and said liens and security interests shall continue in full force and effect as to the unreleased condominium units and such other property.additionally,the trustee deed that was recorded after the foreclosure sale evidences that the trustee conveyed to oreo not only the remaining real and personal property of metrowork,but also,explicitly,the declarant rights.it is thus clear that keybank knew how to reconvey the declarant rights to india street,if that had been what the parties intended.however,no language of reconveyance or release of the declarant rights,insofar as applicable to the retail units,appears in the reconveyance deed or in any other document filed in connection therewith.
the trial court acknowledged that the reconveyance deed contained no language releasing the declarant rights,but nonetheless held that the reconveyance included the declarant rights.in reaching this conclusion,the court observed that the rights including the class b voting rights granted to the declarant in the cc rs were designed to ensure that india street,as original owner and operator of the project,could exercise control over building management,particularly with respect to the retail units.the court reasoned that,it is to presume that these declarant rights including the voting rights could be separated from the ownership interest in the retail units.accordingly,the court held that although the reconveyance deed did not expressly list declarant rights,they are within the penumbra of assets that were conveyed back to india street.we disagree,and conclude that the trial court interpretation of the reconveyance deed is not supported by the express terms of that document,nor by any of the documents that were executed in connection with the keybank loan.
the trial court fundamental error lay in its misapprehension of the relationship between the declarant class b voting rights and ownership of the retail units.we agree with pv little italy that while membership in the association,in general,is appurtenant to ownership of any unit in metrowork,the declarant enhanced voting rights do not automatically attach to ownership of the retail units,nor to any other unit,nor are they inseparable therefrom.
it is true,as india street contends,that ownership of a unit automatically carries with it membership in the association,for as long as the unit is owned.section of the cc rs states as much,and further provides that all memberships shall be appurtenant to the condominium conveyed the cc rs also specify,in section,that t here shall be no severance by sale,conveyance,encumbrance or hypothecation of an interest in any unit from the concomitant membership in the association.however,these provisions merely illustrate that membership in the association is solely a function of unit ownership.see cc rs,ownership of a condominium shall be the sole qualification for membership in the association.
by contrast,class b membership is not determined solely by being an owner,but rather,by being a particular owner,the declarant.cc rs,subd.b.in other words,the unique status and rights of the declarant do not result from ownership of a condominium,but rather,from specific grants in the cc rs to the declarant.see,cc rs,art.vii,subd.b.the declarant is defined in the cc rs not in terms of ownership of a unit,but rather,as initially being india street,its successors,and assignees.cc rs.importantly,the declarant is not necessarily india street,because the cc rs permit the declarant to assign its rights to another,in whole or in part,to any number of assignees.cc rs see also the rights of declarant hereunder and elsewhere in these restrictions may be assigned by declarant to any successor in interest to any portion of declarant interest in any portion of the property by a recorded written instrument italics added.
contrary to india street contentions and the trial court conclusions,nothing in the cc rs binds the retail units irrevocably to the declarant whether declarant is india street or some other entity or to the declarant class b voting rights.those units are not defined as units owned by the declarant or units owned by india street.rather,the retail parcel is defined in the cc rs only as those units on floors as set forth on the condominium plan.even the declarant units are not defined as units owned by the declarant,or as units owned by india street,but rather,merely as those units comprising floors,and as described in the condominium plan.cc rs.india street identifies no language in the cc rs stating that the first and second floors of metrowork must always be owned by an entity deemed to be the declarant.absent such language,nothing in the cc rs prevents ownership of the retail units from being separated from the status of declarant and its concomitant voting rights.indeed,the very provision that grants the enhanced voting rights as to any unit owned by the declarant anticipates the possibility that those rights could be terminated upon sale of the unit to an unaffiliated entity.in that case,the special class b membership is converted to the standard class a membership cc rs.
for these reasons,the plain language of the cc rs belies the trial court conclusion that the class b voting rights can not be separated from the retail units.the combined effect of cc rs,sections,subd.b,and,summarized above,is that class b voting rights may not be separated from any units owned by the declarant but that merely begs the question which entity is the declarant when india street assigned a security interest in its declarant rights to keybank,and did not obtain a release of those rights as to the retail units in the reconveyance,upon india street default,the status of declarant,and the concomitant enhanced voting rights,became separated from ownership of the retail units.by operation of the cc rs,india street was no longer the declarant it had become just like any other owner,with class a membership in the retail units.
despite acknowledging that the declarant rights had not been expressly reconveyed to india street,the trial court reasoned that it was to presume that these declarant rights could be separated from the ownership interest in the retail units,since the cc rs had been drafted with the intention of allowing india street to maintain control over management of those units.the court concluded that those rights therefore must have been within the penumbra of assets reconveyed to india street.we do not disagree with the trial court interpretation of what india street subjectively intended in drafting the provisions in the cc rs pertaining to the declarant rights.the record appears to substantiate india street assertions that its focus,from the beginning,was to make anthology the crown jewel of metrowork.india street undoubtedly envisioned that only it,or a related entity or direct assignee,would be the owner of the retail units as declarant.india street structured the cc rs in a manner that would preserve india street ability to use the retail units for anthology or a similar purpose well into the future.thus,although many of the declarant powers would terminate once metrowork was fully developed and all other units of metrowork were sold,the declarant right to use the retail units for a restaurant or nightclub venue was protected in perpetuity,and all other owners purchased their units subject to those uses,for as long as the declarant owned the space.compare cc rs,protecting the right of declarant to develop metrowork as it deems advisable for so long as any condominium in the project remains unsold,with allowing declarant to use the declarant units for any use allowed by law,including restaurant and club uses.further,pursuant to cc rs,section,the enhanced class b membership survives for as long as declarant owns a unit.
that said,we are bound to interpret written instruments according to the parties intent as manifested in the written instrument,if that language is clear and explicit.see,parsons,supra,cal d at,starlight ridge,supra,th at,d.while it may have seemed to the trial court that keybank would release its security interest in the retail units without also releasing the declarant rights associated with those units,india street drafted the cc rs and negotiated the loan agreement and various deeds in a manner that did not foreclose that possibility.it is not for the trial court,or this court,to inject our own intuition into the analysis of the parties intent when the language of the instruments is clear.see,klein,supra,th at,d klein the contracting parties intent is interpreted according to objective,rather than subjective,criteria.
our conclusion that the reconveyance deed did not release keybank security interest in the declarant rights as to the retail units is based on the express and unambiguous language of the reconveyance deed itself,the cc rs,and other instruments.harvey,supra,th at,d the language of the cc rs governs if it is clear and explicit the parties intent is to be ascertained from the writing alone if possible.notwithstanding the manifest intention of the cc rs to protect india street investment in the retail units,the cc rs also expressly permit the declarant to assign all or a portion of its rights.this right of assignment,together with the original trust deed express conveyance of a security interest in the declarant rights to keybank,and the lack of any language releasing that interest in the reconveyance deed,all indicate,under the usual rules of interpretation,an intent to exclude the declarant rights from the reconveyance,white western title ins.cal d,fn,the familiar maxim,expressio unius est exclusio alterius the inclusion of one thing implies exclusion of others,applies to contract interpretation.
if the plain language of the instrument is unambiguous,a court may not read into the document additional terms in order to conform its meaning to what the court intuition tells it the parties must have intended.rather,the court is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein,not to insert what has been omitted,or to omit what has been inserted code civ,see klein,supra,th at,d.there are,of course,instances when the parties mutually intend one thing,but due to mistake or inadvertence,the written document does not reflect that intent.in that instance,the law permits the court to reform the document consistent with the parties intent.see,witkin,summary of cal.law ed.contracts,discussing reformation remedy generally,noting that a deed may be reformed,permitting revision of contract that does not truly express the intention of the parties.although india street initially included in its complaint a claim for reformation,it voluntarily dismissed that claim after the section hearing,and it makes no argument on appeal that the absence of an express release of the declarant rights in the reconveyance deed was due to mistake or inadvertence.
the other documents and extrinsic evidence on which india street relies are insufficient to demonstrate that keybank released the declarant rights as to the retail units by means of the reconveyance deed.
in determining the meaning of a written instrument,we are permitted to consider not only its language,but also the circumstances under which it was made and the matter to which it relates.starlight ridge,supra,th at,d,citation omitted.india street urges us to look at the broader context in which the reconveyance was accomplished,and to consider other evidence indicating that the intention underlying that conveyance was to restore to india street not only the retail units themselves,but all of the declarant rights associated with those units.in our view,however,these other documents and the extrinsic evidence of intent that india street proffers are unhelpful,and fail to demonstrate any intent other than that revealed by the plain language of the cc rs and the reconveyance deed.
for example,india street contends that the third modification to the original loan agreement,combined with other documents executed in anticipation of the reconveyance,released all of keybank interests in the lien on the retail units.by definition,this language covered only condominium units and themselves,and nothing else.india street points to no language in the third modification agreement that would indicate otherwise.
as an additional condition of the release of the retail units,india street agreed to execute a second deed of trust that encumbered only the retail units,but that was otherwise identical to the original trust deed.this second deed was additional consideration for the third modification agreement,was intended to be subordinate only to the lien of the deed or deeds of trust securing repayment of the pacific western sba loan,and was to be returned to india street upon the fulfillment of certain conditions,absent any default.in the trial court,india street maintained that this second deed,which was never recorded,would have been unnecessary if the release of the retail units was not intended to be a complete release of all of keybank interest.
the purpose of this second deed is unclear,and in any event,india street has not explained how the deed demonstrates that the keybank reconveyance released the declarant rights.nothing on the face of the second deed supports india street argument.on the contrary,the second deed serves merely to reinforce that keybank held a security interest in the declarant rights associated with the retail units.in our view,the absence of specific language in the reconveyance deed releasing that interest,notwithstanding the language of the second deed,only reaffirms that there was no release of the declarant rights as to the retail units by keybank in the reconveyance deed.
india street emphasized in the trial court,and does so again on appeal,the fact that before obtaining the reconveyance,it obtained a second loan on the retail units from pacific western,and in exchange for that loan,gave pacific western a security interest in those units and in any and all rights relating to the development or occupancy of the retail units.this presumably demonstrates,in india street view,that it was india street intention to regain the declarant rights as to the retail units,unencumbered by any keybank interest,so that it could convey a new security interest in those rights to pacific western.
there are several flaws in this argument.first,regardless of what india street may have intended in terms of a reconveyance of declarant rights,as we have explained,the language of the reconveyance does not manifest that intention.second,the pacific western deed makes no explicit reference to declarant rights,which are dealt with separately in the cc rs,and which,in the original trust deed,were listed separately from other developer rights that india street may have possessed.as such,the pacific western deed does not demonstrate that india street conveyed to that lender any security interest in the declarant rights.
third,even if the conveyance to pacific western of all of india street right,title,and interest in all other rights relating to the real property,including development rights,could be construed broadly to include the declarant rights,such a conveyance would not necessarily be inconsistent with keybank retaining its own security interest in the declarant rights,since two deeds of trust may cover the same property.see davidow corporation of america d,upholding validity of foreclosure sale on second deed of trust on property already covered by first deed of trust witkin,supra,noting that,because a deed of trust conveys only an interest sufficient to carry out the trust,and does not vest the trustee with the entire estate in the property,it is possible to have a second deed of trust covering the same property.india street can have conveyed to pacific western only whatever title it had,subject to the rights of keybank,which claimed an interest under the first deed of trust.davidow,supra,at.additionally,pacific western recorded its deeds of trust on october,before keybank had recorded or even executed the reconveyance on,and,respectively.pacific western thus presumably took its security interest subject to keybank interest,which was.see,trust deed,subd.b providing that all persons acquiring an interest in the property will be considered to have notice of,and will be bound by,the secured obligations created by the keybank loan and related documents.
india street also references a subordination agreement pursuant to which keybank subordinated the lien of the trust deed to the cc rs.however,india street fails to explain the relevance or significance of the subordination agreement to the issues before us.to the extent that india street is suggesting that this agreement essentially nullified the conveyance of a security interest in the declarant voting rights under the trust deed,we reject that assertion as without foundation and entirely contrary to the explicit intent to convey such an interest to keybank by means of that deed.to the extent that india street is suggesting only that this language required keybank to allow india street to continue to exercise rights as the declarant,including enhanced voting rights,notwithstanding the security interest created by the trust deed,the subordination language adds nothing to our analysis.as noted previously,a deed of trust does not prevent the trustor in this case,india street from continuing to exercise all of the ordinary rights of ownership see discussion,ante,at part.
contrary to the trial court conclusion,in our view,none of the ucc financing statements included in the record supports the trial court conclusion that the reconveyance necessarily included the class b voting rights.pv little italy contends that any mention of the declarant rights in these statements is surplusage,because ucc financing statements pertain only to personal property,and the provisions of the cc rs are deemed to create equitable servitudes,which are real property rights and obligations.see,cc rs,preamble,moreover,pv little italy argues,ucc financing statements do not,in themselves,convey security interests.rather,they provide notice of the collateral covered by a security agreement.compare cal,subd.a defining security agreement as an agreement that creates or provides for a security interest with cal,subd.a a financing statement must be filed to perfect all security interests.india street does not respond to these arguments.
in any event,the ucc financing statements are consistent with the plain language of the trust deed and the reconveyance deed,as we have interpreted that language.like the trust deed,the original ucc financing statement covered all buildings,goods,rents and materials located on the metrowork property,but also separately and explicitly mentioned all of debtor rights,title,interest and privileges,whatsoever,as developer,declarant,or other position pursuant to the cc rs.the amendment to that financing statement recorded at the time of the reconveyance,like the reconveyance deed itself,notably does not include that same language in the release of collateral.rather,it states only that portion of the real property described on attachment hereto a description of the retail units is hereby deleted from the definitions of improvements,premises and condominium units set forth in the initial financing statement and secured party interest therein is released.the declarant rights were not included either within the legal description included as attachment,or within the defined terms listed in the amendment.finally,as previously noted,upon the foreclosure sale,the trustee conveyed to oreo all of its remaining right,title and interest in unsold units of metrowork,as set forth not only in the legal description of the physical property attached to the trustee deed of sale,but also as set forth in the initial ucc financing statement annexed to that deed,which explicitly mentioned the declarant rights,and which was attached as an exhibit to the trustee deed upon sale.this evidences in plain language that the trustee still held a security interest in the declarant rights at the time of foreclosure,and,that it intended to include those rights in the conveyance to oreo after the foreclosure.
india street reliance on civil code section is misplaced.that statute provides that any conveyance of the owner entire estate also includes the owner membership interest in the association,subd.b.we agree with pv little italy that because india street did not raise this argument in the trial court,it may not properly raise it for the first time on appeal.eisenberg et,cal.practice guide civil appeals and writs the rutter group,and cases cited therein.in any event,the argument is unavailing.as we have explained,the cc rs were not written in a way that makes declarant enhanced voting rights appurtenant to ownership of the retail units.whether a transferee of a unit obtains class b membership of the declarant,or instead,the same class a membership as any other owner receives,depends solely on whether that transferee is the declarant.when keybank released its security interest in the retail units without simultaneously releasing its interest in the declarant rights,and india street subsequently defaulted,india street lost the status of declarant and thus could no longer exercise class b voting rights as to those units although it could exercise class a membership.the directive of civil code section is therefore observed india street ownership of the retail units includes membership rights in the association,albeit not the membership that india street had perhaps planned to possess.
because the language of the relevant instruments is clear and unambiguous,resort to extrinsic evidence of the parties intent is unnecessary and even inappropriate.parsons,supra,cal d at,see also,code civ,subd.b.the trial court thus erred in looking to the berkson and polger declarations to bolster its conclusion that india street possessed class b voting rights as a function of its ownership of the retail units.however,even if the reconveyance deed were susceptible to more than one interpretation,and we do not believe that it is,reliance on these declarations as evidence of the parties intent would be improper.see winet price th,d winet court may consider extrinsic evidence of the parties intent,as long as that evidence is relevant to prove a meaning to which the language is reasonably susceptible citation.the berkson and polger declarations merely confirm what the language of the cc rs already makes clear namely,that india street wanted to protect its crown jewel investment in the retail units.moreover,berkson avers only that it was his understanding that the release of the retail parcel from the lien of the deed of trust was to be a full release,and states that he would not have entered into the reconveyance if keybank had expressed an intention to reserve any rights related to the retail parcel.similarly,polger states that he understood that between the reconveyance deed and the amended ucc financing statement,all real and personal property collateral in the retail units would be released,including any declarant voting rights to the extent that such voting rights were attached to the realty or were deemed a personal property interest.
such subjective statements of understanding are irrelevant,however,particularly where there is no evidence that keybank had the same understanding.as pv little italy notes,the deposition testimony of both berkson and polger indicates that they never discussed the declarant rights with keybank in connection with the reconveyance.see,reigelsperger siller cal th,d,the uncommunicated subjective intent of one party can not be used to contradict the objective manifestation of the parties intent winet,supra,th at,fn,d evidence of the undisclosed subjective intent of the parties is irrelevant to determining the meaning of contractual language.
while it is fundamental that the court should avoid interpreting a writing in a manner that results in an absurdity see,language of instrument controls if it does not involve an absurdity see also starlight ridge,supra,th at,d,india street makes no argument that any interpretation other than the trial court would be absurd,and our interpretation does not lead to an absurd result.the cc rs were evidently drafted with the intention of giving india street a great deal of flexibility to exercise or assign its declarant rights as it saw fit,and as its business needs required,even if that meant conveying the status of declarant to another entity.it is not unreasonable to presume,as pv little italy contends,that keybank would want to retain its security interest in the declarant rights while the substantial balance of its loan to india street remained outstanding,so that in the event of a default,it would have the greatest possible degree of control over the project management pending the sale of the remaining units.polger,india street attorney,acknowledged as much during his deposition.
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that the reconveyance deed did not release keybank lien on the declarant rights,including the enhanced voting rights associated with the retail units.
oreo expressly conveyed to pv little italy any remaining declarant rights that it may have possessed at the time of the sale accordingly,pv little italy holds declarant rights,including class b voting rights,as to any units that it still owns 
after india street default,keybank foreclosed on the remaining unsold units in the metrowork project,and these units were promptly sold to oreo at the trustee sale.the trustee deed upon sale conveyed all the real and personal property covered by the trust deed with the exception of the retail units already reconveyed,and specifically identified the declarant rights as among the property conveyed to oreo.on november,oreo sold these units to pv little italy.on that same day,oreo entered into an assignment and assumption agreement pursuant to which it transferred to pv little italy its right,title and interest,if any,as the declarant under the cc rs,specifying that the transfer was without representation or warranty of any kind as to the existence of same.we now address whether,by virtue of this assignment,pv little italy became the declarant and obtained the declarant class b voting rights as to the units that it purchased from oreo.relying once again primarily on the plain language of each of the conveyances after india street default,we conclude that pv little italy did acquire those rights.accordingly,we reverse the trial court ruling to the contrary.
the terms of the trust deed granted to keybank the power,upon india street default,to enter and take possession of the property covered by the trust deed,to manage and operate all or any part of the property,and do any and all other things in connection with those actions that beneficiary may in its sole discretion consider necessary and appropriate to protect the security of the trust deed.trust deed,subd.c.as pv little italy contends,the express inclusion of the declarant rights in the conveyance in the trust deed demonstrates an intention that,upon any default by india street,keybank would be able to step into india street shoes as declarant and exercise the declarant rights to manage and protect the development,thereby maximizing its recovery on the loan at any future sale.india street does not dispute this.upon india street default,and by virtue of the express conveyance in the trust deed,title to all the tangible and intangible property covered by the trust deed excluding the retail units but including all declarant rights vested with the trustee,for the benefit of keybank.see cc rs,trust deed,subd.g.
we next consider whether the trustee had the authority under the cc rs to convey the declarant rights to oreo,and if so,whether oreo effectively passed those rights on to pv little italy.the trial court first found that,by virtue of keybank having reconveyed the declarant rights to india street,oreo had no such rights to convey to pv little italy after the foreclosure sale.the trial court did not expressly limit this finding only to those declarant rights associated with the retail units,but rather,appears to have concluded that oreo acquired no such rights even those associated with the units as to which india street had defaulted.however,as we have explained,the reconveyance deed did not transfer back to india street any of the declarant rights.thus,even under the trial court reasoning,at a minimum,the declarant rights as to the unsold units remained in play at the time of the foreclosure sale 
in its briefing in the trial court,india street acknowledged that upon the foreclosure sale,oreo acquired those rights because it is affiliated with keybank.according to india street,it was only upon the subsequent sale to pv little italy an unaffiliated third party that the class b voting rights associated with the foreclosed condominium units were terminated and converted to class a rights,pursuant to section,subdivision b of the cc rs.at the section hearing,however,india street shifted its position,arguing that because it was the trustee that held title to all of the property,and there had been no conveyance to keybank,the foreclosure sale to oreo was itself a sale to an unaffiliated third party,and thus,oreo acquired no declarant rights.the trial court adopted the unaffiliated third party approach in evaluating the nature of pv little italy rights,and concluded that because pv little italy did not acquire its ownership rights via a direct assignment from india street and was instead an unaffiliated owner,pv little italy acquired no declarant rights.not surprisingly,on appeal,india street agrees with the trial court,arguing both that oreo did not acquire india street class b membership and voting rights upon the foreclosure sale and thus had no rights to convey to pv little italy,and also that pv little italy,an entity neither affiliated with,nor a direct assignee of,india street,could not have acquired class b voting rights as a result of its purchase from oreo.
the analytical flaw in the trial court and india street reasoning is that it improperly conflates section of the cc rs with section,subdivision b.section defines the term declarant.the reference to pv little italy as an unaffiliated owner presumably stems from section,subdivision b of the cc rs,which provides for the conversion of class b voting rights to class a rights upon the sale of a unit owned by declarant to an unaffiliated third party.in order to determine whether the declarant rights including the class b voting rights in the foreclosed units were effectively transferred to oreo,and in turn to pv little italy,we must first determine,under section of the cc rs,who may become the declarant,and specifically,whether a declarant other than india street may effectively assign the status of declarant and the declarant rights to another person or entity.the answer to that question determines whether cc rs section treatment of the class b voting rights comes into play at all.
cc rs section provides that declarant shall initially mean india street its successors,and any person to which it shall have assigned its rights hereunder,in whole or in part,by an express written assignment.italics added.this sentence arguably may be interpreted in two different ways.consistent with the narrow interpretation adopted by the trial court and urged by india street,the definition may be construed to mean the following declarant shall initially mean india street,and thereafter only its direct successors or assigns.this approach construes the word initially as applying only to india street.however,there is another reasonable interpretation pursuant to which initially modifies the entire remainder of the sentence,such that the definition would have the following meaning declarant shall initially mean india street,its successors and assigns,but thereafter,declarant could be other entities as yet unnamed.this interpretation contemplates a potentially unlimited universe of declarants in the future,who could exercise the declarant rights as set forth in the cc rs for as long as metrowork remained in its developmental stages,and specifically with respect to the enhanced voting rights for as long as the person or entity that has the status of declarant owns units in the property.
to resolve the arguable ambiguity in this phrase,we consider not just the language of this provision,but the larger context in which it appears,as well as the apparent purposes underlying t
