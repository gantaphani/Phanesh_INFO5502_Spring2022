this case requires us to decide whether an allegedly misleading statement made in one of defendant american express regulatory disclosure documents is protected by the safe harbor provision of the private securities litigation reform act pslra.in the course of our analysis,we interpret congress provision that a defendant shall not be liable for a statement if it is identified as a statement,and accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the statement,or if the plaintiff fails to prove that the statement was made or approved by an executive officer with actual knowledge by that officer that the statement was false or misleading.c.
the plaintiffs appeal from the october,judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york pauley,dismissing their second amended complaint.we determine that the defendants are not entitled to safe harbor protection under the meaningful cautionary language prong of the safe harbor at this stage of the litigation because their cautionary language is vague.we conclude,however,that the defendants allegedly misleading statement is protected by the actual knowledge prong of the safe harbor because the plaintiffs did not plead facts demonstrating that the statement was made with actual knowledge that the statement was false or misleading,id.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
the plaintiffs are investors who purchased american express stock between july,and july,the defendants are american express company american express or the company harvey golub,chairman and ceo of american express until late kenneth chenault,president,coo and successor to golub as chairman and ceo at the company david hubers,president and chief executive of company subsidiary american express financial advisors aefa and james cracchiolo,chairman and ceo of aefa.
according to the plaintiffs second amended complaint sac,starting in the,american express began an in debt securities.these investments included junk bonds and collateralized debt obligations cdos.while peer companies limited debt investments to seven percent of their portfolios,ten to twelve percent of aefa portfolio was made up of these investments.ultimately,this overinvestment resulted in american express losing hundreds of millions of dollars in and.
this appeal regards a statement that american express made in a quarterly report filed with the securities and exchange commission sec in may.in that filing,the company stated,in essence,that while it had lost million from its debt investments in the first quarter of,it expected further losses from those investments to be substantially lower for the remainder of.the plaintiffs allege that the defendants violated the securities exchange act of when they made this statement because at the time they made it,the defendants knew it was misleading.
the source of the plaintiffs allegations is a wall street journal asia article that the plaintiffs attached to their sac,and the following account is taken from that article in early,after the company reported losses of million in from its debt investments,chenault belatedly ordered a very hard look at the company debt portfolio.by late february,defendant chenault and gary crittenden,then american express cfo,received an from aefa cfo stuart sedlacek that set a huge alarm ringing concerning the rapid deterioration of aefa debt portfolio.joint appendix at.on april,the company announced an additional million in first quarter.the company was quick to add,though,that the worst of the problem was behind it and that no further surprises were expected.id.a press release stated that t otal losses on these investments for the remainder of are expected to be substantially lower than in the first quarter.at.
according to the article,in early may,cracchiolo received a fax from sedlacek advising him that american express was facing additional losses on its debt investments beyond those already booked.at.chenault was advised of the situation the next day,during a visit to aefa minneapolis headquarters.there,he was told that the deterioration of the debt portfolio was so bad that even the cdos held by american express showed potential deterioration because defaults on the underlying bonds had risen so sharply.id.chenault asked,what are we talking about here id.cracchiolo replied,we really do know enough to even give you a range.id.did we look at this in the first quarter chenault queried,what happened id.hoping to find an answer,american express brought in walter berman,a former american express treasurer who had rejoined the firm at the start of that year.he and david yowan,the company senior vice president of risk management in new york,began crunching numbers.id.
in the meantime,on may,american express filed its quarterly report form for the first quarter of.in it,the company reported the million in first quarter losses from aefa debt portfolio.the company explained,t he high yield losses reflect the continued deterioration of the portfolio and losses associated with selling certain bonds.at.importantly,it added that t otal losses on these investments for the remainder of are expected to be substantially lower than in the first quarter.id.according to the sac,american express made this statement the may statement despite the fact that defendant chenault had been expressly informed in early may that the million first quarter did not reflect the true magnitude of the deterioration of aefa debt portfolio.at.the plaintiffs allege that the d efendants were aware that they had no reasonable basis upon which to continue to make this representation.at.
the form also contained a caution.several pages after the statement that losses for the remainder of were expected to be substantially lower,the form warned that it contain ed statements,which are subject to risks and uncertainties.it added that f actors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements include potential deterioration in the sector,which could result in further losses in aefa investment portfolio.at.
the wall street journal asia article reported that in early july,berman and yowan completed their review of aefa debt portfolio.american express had previously relied in large part on the reports generated by outside cdo managers to evaluate the health and performance of the cdos,and it was not until berman and yowan review that the company began to draw its own conclusions about all of the bonds that underpinned the securities.at.when chenault sat down in the conference room to hear the results,he had no idea what to expect and hoped that the situation would be manageable.he was stunned by berman and yowan estimate of million in losses,and began firing questions at his team.at.the million figure resulted from the fact that i nstead of adopting the optimistic view that defaults already were peaking,the company decided to use the current default rate of to,and assumed it would stay constant for the next months a very conservative assumption.at.
on july,american express issued a press release announcing that it would be taking an million loss due to additional in the debt portfolio at aefa and losses associated with rebalancing the portfolio towards securities.at.this amount included the million loss related to the cdos reported by berman and yowan,as well as other losses from planned sales of bonds and cdos.
on july,the plaintiffs filed this action,bringing claims under sections b and a of the securities exchange act of.the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint.the district court granted the motion on march,holding that two of the plaintiffs claims were and the remaining claims failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.in re am.express.secs,civ,wl.we vacated the decision,holding that the claims were not,and remanded for further consideration by the district court,expressing no view on the merits of any of the claims.see slayton am.express,cir.
on january,the plaintiffs filed the sac,alleging,among other things,that when the defendants made the may statement that losses for the remainder of were expected to be substantially lower,they knew that they had no reasonable basis upon which to make it.the defendants again moved to dismiss,and the district court granted the motion by memorandum and order dated september.in re am.express.secs,civ,wl september.with regard to the may statement at issue in this appeal,the district court found that 
the information cracchiolo and chenault received in may could support an inference of scienter because it suggests that they had access to information indicating that the may,statement was no longer accurate.however,in light of the fact that defendants immediately put together a team to analyze all of aefa high yield debt and then announced the results of the analysis in july,the more compelling inference is that defendants were not acting with an intent to deceive,but rather attempting to quantify the extent of the problem before disclosing it to the market.
id.at.the district court therefore held that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim with respect to the may statement.the plaintiffs appeal only this part of the district court that the defendants may statement that t otal losses on these investments for the remainder of are expected to be substantially lower than in the first quarter of violated the securities exchange act.
the plaintiffs bring their claims under sections b and a of the securities exchange act of,et.section b makes it unlawful to use or employ,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the commission may prescribe.b.sec rule states that it shall be unlawful for any person t o make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading.b.under the law of this circuit,to state a claim under rule,a plaintiff must allege that,in connection with the purchase or sale of securities,the defendant made material misstatements or omissions of material fact,with scienter,and that the plaintiff reliance on the defendant actions caused injury to the plaintiff.ganino citizens utils,cir.section a of the act establishes joint and several liability subject to a good faith exception for every person who,directly or indirectly,controls any person liable under any provision of the act.a.
the securities exchange act of was amended by the pslra in,stat.the pslra established a statutory for statements.with certain exceptions discussed further below,where a private action is based on an untrue statement of a material fact or omission of a material fact necessary to make the statement not misleading,a defendant shall not be liable with respect to any statement if and to the extent that 
a the statement is 
i identified as a statement,and is accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the statement or 
ii immaterial or 
b the plaintiff fails to prove that the statement 
ii if made by a business entity was 
i made by or with the approval of an executive officer of that entity and 
ii made or approved by such officer with actual knowledge by that officer that the statement was false or misleading.
c.the safe harbor is written in the disjunctive that is,a defendant is not liable if the statement is identified and accompanied by meaningful cautionary language or is immaterial or the plaintiff fails to prove that it was made with actual knowledge that it was false or misleading.see southland secs.inspire ins.solutions,cir.
we review a district court ruling on a motion to dismiss a complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b de novo.teamsters local freight div.pension fund dynex capital,cir.in considering a motion to dismiss a b action,we must accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true and must consider the complaint in its entirety.tellabs,makor issues rights,d.a complaint alleging securities fraud must satisfy the heightened pleading requirements of the pslra and federal rule of civil procedure b by stating with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud.see b see also eca local ibew joint pension trust of chicago jp morgan chase,cir.under the pslra,where proof of scienter is a required element,as it is in the actual knowledge prong of the statutory safe harbor,a complaint must state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b.
under this heightened pleading standard for scienter,a complaint will survive only if a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.tellabs,at.in determining whether a strong inference exists,the allegations are not to be reviewed independently or in isolation,but the facts alleged must be taken collectively.id.at.the strong inference standard is met when the inference of fraud is at least as likely as any explanations offered.id.at.
the parties dispute whether the statutory safe harbor applies in this case.the defendants assert that they are entitled to safe harbor protection because the may statement was a statement that was accompanied by meaningful cautionary language and because the plaintiffs have not alleged facts supporting a strong inference that the defendants actually knew that the may statement was misleading the plaintiffs respond that the may statement is statutorily excluded from the safe harbor,and that even if it is not,the statutory safe harbor does not protect it.we first address whether the may statement is statutorily excluded from the safe harbor,and after concluding that it is not,we turn to whether it is protected under either the meaningful cautionary language or the actual knowledge prong of the safe harbor.
as an initial matter,we conclude that the statement at issue in this case is a statement as defined by the pslra.the pslra includes several definitions of a statement,including a statement containing a projection of income including income loss,earnings including earnings loss per share,or other financial items and a statement of future economic performance,including any such statement contained in a discussion and analysis of financial condition by the management i a c.the defendants statement,that t otal losses on these investments for the remainder of are expected to be substantially lower than in the first quarter,in the managers discussion and analysis md a portion of its form,fits comfortably within both of these definitions.
a.the may statement was not included in a financial statement and therefore is not statutorily excluded from the safe harbor.
the parties first dispute whether the may statement is excluded from the statutory safe harbor,which excludes statements included in a financial statement prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap.b a.the statement at issue here was contained in american express may,form filed with the sec.the form contained several parts,including consolidated statements of income,consolidated balance sheets,consolidated statements of cash flows,notes to consolidated financial statements,and management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a.at.the statement was included in the md a part in a subsection titled american express financial advisors.id.at.
we conclude that the may statement,contained in the md a,was not included in a financial statement prepared in accordance with gaap.that congress understood financial statements and md as to be distinct is apparent from the text of the pslra.congress explicitly included a statement of future economic performance contained in a discussion and analysis of financial condition by the management in its definition of a statement,i c,and then excluded a statement that is included in a financial statement prepared in accordance with gaap.id.b a.the plaintiffs assert that the exclusion logically highlights the reasonable expectation that representations made in sec filings will be more closely scrutinized and more heavily relied upon by investors,and that it would be irrational to allow issuers to gain safe harbor protection merely by placing a statement in the md a portion of a filing.but the legislative history of this provision makes plain that a statement may receive safe harbor protection even where it is in an md a that is part of a required disclosure to the sec.see conf,at,as reprinted in,hereinafter conference report including in the definition of a statement certain statements made in sec required disclosures,including management discussion and analysis.moreover,drawing a distinction between the financial statement portion of the form and the md a section is not irrational,as the plaintiffs suggest.while the financial statement lays out the firm income,balance sheets and cash flows,the purpose of the md a is to present the company business as seen through the eyes of those who manage it.commission guidance regarding management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
our conclusion finds support in the sec different treatment of financial statements and md a sections.sec regulation sets forth the form and content of and requirements for financial statements,and requires interim financial statements in form to include interim balance sheets,statements of income,and statements of cash flow,see id.sec regulation sets forth the requirements applicable to the content of the statement portions of certain filings,including md as.id.emphasis added.that regulation requires the md a section of a form to d iscuss registrant financial condition,changes in financial condition and results of operations.id.these regulations suggest that the sec views the financial statement and the md a as wholly different there is no suggestion that the md a is viewed as a subset of a financial statement.this view also draws support from the form itself,which lists financial statements and management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results and operations as separate required items,see sec form,available at http,belying an assertion that the md a is included in the financial statement,and so excluded from the safe harbor,see b a 
accordingly,we conclude that statements contained in a separate md a discussion in a form,such as the may statement at issue here,are not excluded from the statutory safe harbor under b a.we next turn to whether the may statement is protected under either the meaningful cautionary language prong or actual knowledge prong of the safe harbor.
b.the may statement was not accompanied by meaningful cautionary language.
under the pslra,the defendants are not liable if the allegedly false or misleading statement is identified as a statement,and is accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the statement c a i.the parties dispute both whether the may statement was adequately identified as a statement and whether it was accompanied by meaningful cautionary language.
the may statement indicated that following aefa first quarter loss of million,t otal losses on aefa investments for the remainder of are expected to be substantially lower than in the first quarter.at.several pages later,the form warned that it contain ed statements,which are subject to risks and uncertainties.at.the company wrote,t he words believe,expect,anticipate,optimistic,intend,aim,will,should and similar expressions are intended to identify such statements.id.it added that f actors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements include potential deterioration in the sector,which could result in further losses in aefa investment portfolio.id.
the plaintiffs first contend that the defendants failed to adequately identify the may statement as.they argue that in order to be adequately identified as,statements must either be included in a discrete section clearly marked statements or specifically labeled as.the sec disagrees,asserting that the facts and circumstances of the language used in a particular report will determine whether a statement is adequately identified.it opines that t he use of linguistic cues like we expect or we believe,when combined with an explanatory description of the company intention to thereby designate a statement as,generally should be sufficient to put the reader on notice that the company is making a statement.the defendants join the sec argument on this point.we agree with the sec.
nothing in the statute indicates that to be adequately identified,a statement must be contained in a separate section or specifically labeled,and we decline to write in such a requirement.we agree with the sec that the facts and circumstances of the language used in a particular report will determine whether a statement is adequately identified as.the may statement is plainly projects results in the future.it is also accompanied by a statement of the proposition that words such as expect identify statements.see harris ivax,cir holding that the statement we expect reserves for returns and inventory writeoffs to be well above typical quarters,was a statement protected by the cautionary language prong of the statutory safe harbor.under these circumstances,we conclude that the may statement was adequately identified as a statement.see c a i.
to be protected under the first prong of the safe harbor,however,a statement must be both identified as such and accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the statement id.the sec asserts that the may statement was not accompanied by meaningful cautionary language because the cautionary language itself was misleading in light of historical fact.by historical fact,the sec means the facts that were established at the time the statement was made.looking to the facts alleged by the plaintiffs,the sec concludes that at the same time the defendants warned of potential deterioration in the sector,they knew of actual deterioration in that sector.the plaintiffs agree,and further point out that despite the additional knowledge gained by the defendants in early may,the cautionary language contained in the may,form did not differ from the cautionary language the company had used from at least january onwards.
the defendants respond that while they agree that misleading cautionary language is not meaningful,their cautionary language was not misleading.the defendants contend that the plaintiffs have not pleaded with the necessary particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that they knew that the market would deteriorate further in the second quarter of.instead,pointing to the wall street journal asia article statements that more losses could still be lurking,and that the investment grade cdos showed potential deterioration,the defendants contend that the plaintiffs have only shown that the defendants were aware of potential precise risk of which they cautioned.
we agree with the sec and the parties that cautionary language that is misleading in light of historical fact can not be meaningful but we do not think that proposition applies in this case.as the defendants correctly assert,the facts alleged by the plaintiffs and supported by the wall street journal asia article do not demonstrate that the defendants misstated a historical the risk of which they warned,deterioration in the market that could cause further losses in aefa portfolio beyond those projected,had already transpired.instead they demonstrate that the defendants knew that aefa portfolio would very likely deteriorate due to rising defaults on the bonds underlying the cdos,a future projection that was not a historical fact 
instead,we think this case presents a different challenge.what strikes us as the problem here is not that the defendants misstated a historical fact,but that they knew of the major and specific risk that rising defaults on the bonds underlying aefa cdos would cause deterioration in aefa portfolio at the time of the may statement,and yet did not warn of it.by directing us not to inquire into a defendants state of mind,however,congress may have foreclosed any inquiry into this problem.
the safe harbor protects statements that are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the statement.c a i.the question we face here is what congress meant by important.the statute itself does not define the term,and we find it ambiguous.thus,while our analysis begins with the statutory text itself,where we find ambiguity we may delve into other sources,including the legislative history,to discern congress meaning.sec dorozhko,cir.the conference report is generally the most reliable evidence in legislative history of congressional intent because it represents the final statement of the terms agreed to by both houses.auburn hous.auth.martinez,cir.
the conference report accompanying the pslra explains that u nder this first prong of the safe harbor,boilerplate warnings will not suffice the cautionary statements must convey substantive information about factors that realistically could cause results to differ materially from those projected in the statement,such as,for example,information about the issuer business.conference report at,at.while the conference committee expected that cautionary statements identify important factors that could cause results to differ materially,it did not expect them to identify all factors.id.at,at.importantly,the conference committee directed that t he use of the words meaningful and important factors are sic intended to provide a standard for the types of cautionary statements upon which a court may,where appropriate,decide a motion to dismiss,without examining the state of mind of the defendant.id.the conference committee explicitly advised that its requirement that the cautionary statement identify important facts is not intended to provide an opportunity for plaintiff counsel to conduct discovery on what factors were known to the issuer at the time the statement was made.id.it stressed that c ourts should not examine the state of mind of the person making the statement.id.
we find congress directions difficult to apply in this case.on the one hand,the conference report makes quite plain that it does not want courts to inquire into a defendant state of mind,a defendant knowledge of the risks at the time he made the statements at the same time,however,the conference report requires cautionary statements to convey substantive information about factors that realistically could cause results to differ materially from projections.in order to assess whether an issuer has identified the factors that realistically could cause results to differ,we must have some reference by which to judge what the realistic factors were at the time the statement was made.we think that the most sensible reference is the major factors that the defendants faced at the time the statement was made.but this requires an inquiry into what the defendants knew because in order to determine what risks the defendants faced,we must ask of what risks were they aware 
congress may wish to give further direction on how to resolve this tension,and in particular,the reference point by which we should judge whether an issuer has identified the factors that realistically could cause results to differ from projections.may an issuer be protected by the meaningful cautionary language prong of the safe harbor even where his cautionary statement omitted a major risk that he knew about at the time he made the statement in this case,however,we need not decide that thorny issue because we conclude that at any rate the cautionary statement the defendants point to here was vague.
to avail themselves of safe harbor protection under the meaningful cautionary language prong,defendants must demonstrate that their cautionary language was not boilerplate and conveyed substantive information.see conference report at,at.the third circuit has interpreted this direction to mean that 
cautionary language must be extensive and specific.a vague or blanket boilerplate disclaimer which merely warns the reader that the investment has risks will ordinarily be inadequate to prevent misinformation.to suffice,the cautionary statements must be substantive and tailored to the specific future projections,estimates or opinions in the prospectus which the plaintiffs challenge.
inst.investors group avaya,cir quotation marks,citations,and alterations omitted.similarly,the fifth circuit has held that t he requirement for meaningful cautions calls for substantive warnings based on a realistic description of the risks applicable to the particular circumstances,not merely a boilerplate litany of generally applicable risk factors.southland secs,at see also lormand unwired,cir concluding that cautionary language was not meaningful where the warning was very vague and general and did not disclose the specific risks and their magnitude.
here,all that the defendants point to in support of their argument that they are protected by the cautionary meaningful language prong is the statement in the form that potential deterioration in the sector could result in further losses in aefa portfolio.see at.the defendants argue that by including this language,they warned of the exact risk that caused their projection to miss the mark.but they did not.the defendants caution,referencing the deterioration in the sector generally,is vague,and the pleaded facts do not support the defendants assertion that this is the exact risk that materialized.instead,the pleaded facts support a conclusion that the risk that materialized was that rising defaults on the bonds underlying aefa own cdos would cause deterioration in aefa portfolio.moreover,even if we read the defendants caution to warn of potential deterioration in aefa own portfolio,it verges on the mere boilerplate,essentially warning that if our portfolio deteriorates,then there will be losses in our portfolio.
our conclusion is bolstered by the fact that the defendants cautionary language remained the same even while the problem changed.the same cautionary language that appeared in the may,form was included by the defendants in numerous reports as early as january,and appeared both before and after the defendants reported the million loss and received the early may communications.the consistency of the defendants language over time despite the new information they received in early may belies any contention that the cautionary language was tailored to the specific future projection,avaya,at.see asher,at moreover,the cautionary language remained fixed even as the risks changed.helwig vencor,cir en banc noting that as the budget act neared enactment and as the warning signs flared,vencor precautions grew more cursory and abstract and that s ubstantially similar language appeared in defendant filings over the course of several years,abrogated on other grounds by tellabs,d.
of course,the cautionary statement we focus on here was only one of many cautionary statements in the form.we recognize that the conference committee specifically stated that a defendant need not include the particular factor that ultimately causes its projection not to come true in order to be protected by the meaningful cautionary language prong of the safe harbor,conference report at,at,and we do not hold to the contrary.the defendants,however,carry the burden of demonstrating that they are protected by the meaningful cautionary language prong of the safe harbor,and they have not argued that the other factors they identified were important factors that could realistically cause results to differ materially.absent such argument,we have no way of knowing if they were.accordingly,we conclude that the defendants have failed to demonstrate that the may statement is protected by the cautionary meaningful language prong of the statutory safe harbor.
c.the plaintiffs have not shown that the may statement was made with actual knowledge that it was misleading.
the safe harbor provision also req
