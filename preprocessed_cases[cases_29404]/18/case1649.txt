crescent real estate funding ix,lp crescent funding is owned by crescent real estate equities,lp crescent equities,as the sole limited partner,and cre management ix,llc cre,as the general partner.cre is also wholly owned by crescent equities.on february,crescent equities formed crescent miami center,llc cmc,the petitioner in the present case.crescent equities then transferred percent of its interest in cmc to crescent funding and the remaining percent interest to cre.that same day,cre transferred this percent interest in cmc to crescent funding,so that crescent funding became the sole owner of cmc.
on february,crescent equities transferred a tract of real property,which is the subject of the present case,in fee simple to cmc.according to the deed,cmc paid ten dollars and other good and valuable consideration for the property.this transfer was made to separate the property from crescent equities other assets in order to facilitate future unsecured financing.the deed was recorded,and cmc paid in documentary stamp tax,which was comprised of the state documentary stamp tax and a dade county documentary surtax.
the documentary stamp tax as applied to deeds conveying real property is set out in section,florida statutes,which states 
on deeds,instruments,or writings whereby any lands,tenements,or other real property,or any interest therein,shall be granted,assigned,transferred,or otherwise conveyed to,or vested in,the purchaser or any other person by his or her direction,on each of the consideration therefor the tax shall be cents.when the full amount of the consideration for the execution,assignment,transfer,or conveyance is not shown in the face of such deed,instrument,document,or writing,the tax shall be at the rate of cents for each or fractional part thereof of the consideration therefor.for purposes of this section,consideration includes,but is not limited to,the money paid or agreed to be paid the discharge of an obligation and the amount of any mortgage,purchase money mortgage lien,or other encumbrance,whether or not the underlying indebtedness is assumed.if the consideration paid or given in exchange for real property or any interest therein includes property other than money,it is presumed that the consideration is equal to the fair market value of the real property or interest therein.
emphasis added.the underlined text was added by a amendment and was critical to the lower court analysis in the present case.see ch,at,laws of.
after paying this tax,cmc filed for a refund of the documentary stamp tax,but the florida department of revenue dor denied the application.cmc filed suit and asserted that it should not have been required to pay the tax because it was not a purchaser of real property under section.since beneficial ownership of the property did not actually change,cmc argued,the transfer was a mere book transaction and thus not subject to the documentary stamp tax.the dor argued that the plain language of the statute,including its amendment,required cmc to pay the documentary stamp tax.final summary judgment was entered in favor of the dor.
the third district court of appeal affirmed the summary judgment decision.crescent,so d at.the third district acknowledged that this court has previously held that transfers from a corporation to its shareholders were not subject to the tax because the shareholders were not purchasers within the meaning of the statute.state ex rel.green,so d.we later defined the term purchaser for purposes of the tax as one who obtains or acquires property by paying an equivalent in money or other exchange in value,and thus a transfer of an unencumbered interest in real property from a corporation to its sole shareholder was not taxable.florida dep t of revenue de maria,so d,quoting webster new twentieth century dictionary unab.ed.however,the third district asserted that these decisions were based on the statute as it existed prior to the amendment,before the addition of the final two sentences that,according to the court,specifie d four types of exchange mediums which constitute consideration.crescent,so d at.thus,according to the third district,the decisions in and de maria were valid before the amendment because the statute had not provided a means of determining consideration in those situations,so no consideration could exist when property was transferred to a wholly owned grantee.id.
the third district held that the deed in the present case was subject to the documentary stamp tax because there was consideration for the conveyance,and the value of that consideration was reasonably determinable as being equal to the fair market value of the property under the amendment to section.id.at.consideration existed in the transaction because crescent equities surrendered its interest in the property for an increase in the value of its interest in crescent funding as the value of cmc,wholly owned by crescent funding,increased with the conveyance of property.consideration follow ed as a natural consequence of the commercial transaction transferring intangible property with exchangeable value,and the transfer effectuated a complete change in both the legal title and the beneficial ownership of the property.id.the third district noted that this court in de maria had held that whenever there is consideration,there is a purchaser,and thus the statute purchaser requirement was also fulfilled in the present case.id 
the second district court of appeal came to a different conclusion under similar facts in kuro,where a father and son transferred condominiums which they solely owned to kuro,a corporation which they had formed and in which they were the sole shareholders.the transfer was made for the purpose of the kuros avoiding potential personal liability arising from the management of the condominiums.so d at.the deeds recited the nominal consideration amount of ten dollars,and kuro,paid the minimum documentary stamp tax.the dor argued that kuro,owed the tax in proportion to the fair market value of the property since the shareholders had received an increase in the value of their interest in kuro,by transferring property to the corporation.the second district,however,did not hold kuro,accountable for the documentary stamp tax because the company was not a purchaser under section.id.moreover,the grantors received no interest in the corporation or the property that they did not already have before the transfer thus,the second district held that the conveyance was a mere book transaction like the transfer in.the second district held that despite the conveyance,under de maria and,no documentary stamp tax was owed.id.we granted jurisdiction because of this express and direct conflict between crescent and kuro.
the issue to be resolved in the present case is whether the conveyance of property from a grantor to its wholly owned grantee is taxable under section,florida statutes.in order to assist in this analysis,a review follows of the case law and administrative rules under the and statute.
case law amendment 
prior to the amendment,this court had encountered similar issues to those presented in the instant case.in state ex rel.green,so d,a corporation delivered a deed to property it owned to its shareholders in proportion to their shares in the corporation.the corporation argued that the transfer should not be subject to the documentary stamp tax because the shareholders had given nothing in exchange for the property.id.at.we agreed and held that under the statute,the shareholders were not purchasers the transaction had not involved any form of consideration and thus the transaction was not subject to the documentary stamp tax.id.at.the transaction was termed a mere book transaction and was in no sense a sale to a purchaser as contemplated by the statute.id.
we again considered the application of section in florida department of revenue de maria,so d.in de maria,a corporation transferred property to its sole
