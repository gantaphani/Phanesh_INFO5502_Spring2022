background 
based on the procedural stage of the dismissal,we presume the facts alleged in the complaint to be true.in,flora orally agreed to supply services to firepond in exchange for stock options on firepond securities.flora agreed to accept stock options on shares of firepond stock in return for his first year of placement services.per the agreement,flora options were to vest immediately and no limitations were placed on his right to exercise the options.
after performing approximately sixty percent of the placements,in may,firepond asked flora to sign a document memorializing the agreement.although he disagreed with some of its terms,flora signed the document.in october of,flora signed a second agreement form that contained essentially the same terms as the first agreement.at this point flora held options on a value of per firepond stock.
in november,firepond officials informed flora that firepond was to become a company.flora was also informed a condition of going forward with the initial public offering ipo the underwriter required all existing shareholders and option holders to execute a agreement.robertson was the primary underwriter for the ipo.on november,flora executed a agreement that prevented him from exercising his options for a period of days after february,the date of the ipo.based on firepond representations,flora and all other stockholders faced the same conditions.
after skyrocketing to per share,the value of firepond stock fluctuated dramatically.by the end of the period the price of firepond stock had fallen to per the stock value continued to fall.flora did not exercise his options at the end of the period.instead,he waited until more than one year after the agreement had expired.by this time the stock value was less than per share.flora later learned,contrary to the representation of firepond,that not all shareholders and option holders had executed agreements.he also learned that some shareholders sold stock or exercised options at more favorable prices than the stock initial post value of per share.
syverson was employed by firepond and its predecessor clear with computers cwc.syverson received cwc and firepond stock in exchange for his employment services before the ipo.like flora,syverson was informed a part of the shareholders were required to execute agreements.when syverson objected to the terms of the agreement,christian misvaer,a staff attorney at firepond,told him that the agreement was mandatory and that time was of the essence.misvaer also stated that without executed agreements from every shareholder and option holder,the ipo might not go forward.misvaer also told syverson that if he did not sign the agreement he might have difficulty exchanging his cwc shares for firepond shares.
additionally,syverson received a letter from firepond general counsel,thomas carretta,announcing firepond plan to go public.included with the letter was a copy of the agreement and a return envelope and airbill.the letter reiterated robertson requirement that all shareholders execute the agreement before the ipo would go forward.syverson claims that he conditioned his execution of the agreement on misvaer assurance that syverson would be informed if the agreements were not required of every shareholder or if they could be modified.syverson contends that misvaer agreed to that condition.
like flora,syverson watched the value of his shares rise and then fall dramatically during the day period.like flora,the value of syverson shares had dropped to per share by the end of the period syverson did not sell at the close of the shares continued to drop in value to less than per share.also,like flora,syverson learned misvaer and carretta assurances to the all shareholders and option holders had executed agreements prior to the ipo.
syverson now asserts that some investors were allowed to sell their firepond interests immediately after the ipo,when the price was at its highest,while others were subjected to shorter periods.he brought substantially the same claims against firepond and robertson as did flora.

negligent misrepresentation and fraud 
first,syverson and flora argue that the district court erred in its dismissal of their negligent misrepresentation claims.the court found that the claims failed as a matter of law.in order to establish a claim for negligent misrepresentation,they were required to allege and ultimately prove a duty of reasonable care owed by the defendant in conveying information a breach of that duty by negligently supplying false information reasonable reliance on the alleged misrepresentations,which reliance is the proximate cause of plaintiff injury and damages.masepohl american tobacco.the district court found that the negligent misrepresentation claims failed because no duty of care existed,no duty of care was alleged,and that neither flora nor syverson could prove reasonable reliance.if the district court correctly found either absence of duty or absence of reliance its dismissal will be affirmed.
