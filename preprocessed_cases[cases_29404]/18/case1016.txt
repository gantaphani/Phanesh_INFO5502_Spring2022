defendants russell moore david irey and ron hall appeal the district court denial of summary judgment based on qualified immunity for their involvement in preparing,reviewing and executing two search warrants,one issued on january,and the other issued on january.defendants contend that although the two warrants lacked probable cause,their conduct was reasonable.we hold that moore,irey and hall are entitled to qualified immunity for the january warrant,but that hall is not entitled to qualified immunity for the january warrant.for this reason,we affirm in part,reverse in part and remand for further proceedings.
background 
this case originates from a criminal investigation into the removal and disposal of an underground gasoline storage tank located on property purchased by krl,a california general partnership.participants in the criminal investigation included moore,a california highway patrol officer irey,a deputy district attorney for san joaquin county who specializes in environmental prosecutions and hall,an investigator employed by the amador county district attorney office.in december,a grand jury indicted robert womack and others on counts,many of which concerned the storage,transportation and disposal of the underground gasoline storage tank.in september,the amador county district attorney office transferred the criminal prosecution to the california attorney general office,which dropped all charges.
on december,krl and members of the womack family plaintiffs filed this action,claiming several constitutional violations.before us on this appeal,eight years later,there remains just one alleged constitutional violation a fourth amendment claim arising from the defendants preparation,review and execution of search warrants issued on january,january warrant and january,january warrant for a krl property and womack home address the ridge road property.
moore prepared the january warrant and supporting affidavit.hall,who had conducted at least fifty interviews to investigate charges against robert womack,provided information for the affidavit.both hall and irey read the affidavit and warrant,and confirmed the accuracy of the information.
todd riebe,a district attorney for amador county,reviewed the january warrant and affidavit on january.after consulting with moore and irey on questions related to the warrant and affidavit,riebe gave his approval.moore obtained a magistrate approval on january.
in the supporting affidavit,moore stated that,from the totality of the circumstances,he understood there to be a pattern and practice on the part of the sic robert womack and the womack controlled businesses,which shows malice towards many,if not most,laws.he said that the documents to be seized under the warrant would help determine the entire scope of the krl business activities that are permeated with fraud.
the january warrant,with moore supporting affidavit incorporated by reference,authorized a search of the ridge road property and seizure of all 
partnership reports,paidouts,check books,registers,accounting paperwork,any and all insurance,memos,correspondence,or other documents relating to the control and operation of krl corporation partnership,and articles of personal property tending to establish and identify the identity of persons in control of the premises,and other containers that may house aforementioned records,video tapes audio tapes since january,to the present.
the search pursuant to the january warrant took place early in the day on january.moore conducted the briefing,and both moore and hall participated in the search.during the search,officers discovered a ledger for the krl partnership and several checks.because these documents exceeded the scope of the january warrant,the officers stopped the search while moore and irey went to court to seek a new warrant that would permit seizure of the ledger,checks and other documents dating back to.in an oral affidavit,moore stated,i believe that going back to the ledger will show how the funds from krl partnership are being divided between the parties moore also stated his belief that the bank account from which the checks were written was being used to divert funds from krl partnership for the purposes of hiding the funds.
the magistrate approved the january search warrant that afternoon.the warrant authorized a search of the ridge road property and seizure of the same documents as those listed in the january warrant.the january warrant,however,changed the temporal scope of the documents to be seized from january,to the present to january,to december.both the oral affidavit and moore affidavit from the january warrant were relied upon in their application to the magistrate for the january warrant.the search pursuant to this warrant took place in the afternoon and evening of january.
these facts were before us in krl moore,cir.in krl,we concluded that defendants are entitled to absolute immunity to the extent that their conduct was prosecutorial rather than investigative.id.at.absolute immunity is not at issue in this appeal.for defendants investigative conduct,we applied the test from saucier katz,d,to determine whether riebe and hall were entitled to qualified immunity.under the first step,we affirmed the district court conclusion that a constitutional violation occurred because the warrants lacked probable cause.krl,at.more specifically,we agreed that the january and january warrants lacked particularity as the warrants authorized a seizure of krl documents.we acknowledged that t he uniformly applied rule is that a search conducted pursuant to a warrant that fails to conform to the particularity requirement of the fourth amendment is unconstitutional.id.at quoting massachusetts sheppard,d.however,we noted that the ninth circuit has recognized an exception to the particularity requirement where probable cause exists to believe that a business is permeated with fraud.id.citing united states offices known as state distrib,cir.probable cause exists where the entire business is merely a scheme to defraud or that all of the business records are likely to evidence criminal activity.id.quoting united states kow,cir.we agreed with the district court that,in this case,the supporting affidavits did not establish sufficient probable cause.
under the second step,we disagreed with the district court and concluded that riebe acted reasonably under the circumstances.but we agreed that hall did not act reasonably.we said 
riebe approved the second search warrant on january,when it was limited to.at that time,although the warrant still lacked probable cause,it had a more reasonable temporal limit it alleged fraudulent activity and tax evasion dating to it alleged hazardous waste violations in and at the bosse road property,as well as with the storage tank and it alleged that womack withdrew funds from krl for personal expenses and illegal activities.we conclude that the warrant,as it stood on january,was not so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence unreasonable.riebe approval of the second search warrant was reasonable,and,to the extent it was investigative rather than prosecutorial,he is entitled to qualified immunity.
the district court properly denied qualified immunity to hall on plaintiffs claim that he unreasonably relied on the search warrant and that he seized documents predating during the january search.assuming he was the lead investigator,hall would have greater responsibility for ensuring that the warrant was not defective.even if probable cause existed to believe krl was permeated with fraud since,no reasonable officer could conclude that the discovery of a ledger and several checks showed that krl had been primarily engaged in fraudulent activity since.the fact that a judge and a prosecutor had approved the warrant does not make hall reliance on it reasonable.
id.at citations omitted.
on remand,moore,irey and hall moved for summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds.on march,the district court denied summary judgment for defendants involvement with the january warrant.first,the court found that moore was a lead investigator,and thus had a greater responsibility for ensuring that the january warrant was not defective under ramirez bow county,cir.second,the court found a disputed issue of material fact as to whether irey and hall were lead investigators,precluding summary judgment on the january warrant claims.the district court also denied summary judgment for defendants involvement with the january warrant,relying on our conclusion that no reasonable officer could have believed that probable cause existed for a search of documents going back to.on june,the district court denied defendants motion for reconsideration.
this appeal of the district court order and denial of reconsideration followed.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
although a denial of summary judgment is ordinarily not an appealable interlocutory order,we have jurisdiction in this case because the motion for summary judgment is based on qualified immunity.lee gregory,cir.we review the district court denial of summary judgment de novo.id.our jurisdiction is limited to questions of law,and does not extend to qualified immunity claims involving disputed issues of material fact.jeffers gomez,cir.where disputed facts exist,we assume that the version of the material facts asserted by plaintiffs,as the party,is correct.id.
discussion 
when a constitutional violation occurs,law enforcement officers nonetheless are entitled to qualified immunity if they act reasonably under the circumstances.wilson layne,d.the supreme court outlined a qualified immunity analysis in saucier,at.first,t aken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,do the facts alleged show the officer conduct violated a constitutional right id.at.if yes,the next,sequential step is to ask whether the right was clearly established.id.the relevant,dispositive inquiry under this second step is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.id.at.
we previously held that the january and january warrants lacked probable cause,violating plaintiffs fourth amendment rights.see krl,at.only the second step of the saucier analysis is relevant here whether moore,irey and hall acted reasonably under the circumstances when they prepared,reviewed and executed the january warrant,and whether hall acted reasonably for performing the same actions with respect to the january warrant 
qualified immunity protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.lee,at quoting malley briggs,d.in united states leon,d,the supreme court recognized that r easonable minds frequently may differ on the question whether a particular affidavit establishes probable cause id.at.inadequate probable cause for a warrant does not necessarily render an officer reliance unreasonable because the existence of probable cause is often a difficult determination.ortiz van auken,cir.rather,the preference for warrants is most appropriately effectuated by according great deference to a magistrate determination.leon,at.
when reasonable minds could differ as to the existence of probable cause,approval of a warrant by a government attorney and ratification by a neutral and detached magistrate usually establishes objectively reasonable reliance.ortiz,at.courts treat magistrates as more qualified than police officers to make determinations of probable cause.see,malley,at.as a general matter,the constitution does not require officers to the legal assessments of trained lawyers.arnsberg united states,cir see also leon,at.in the ordinary case,an officer can not be expected to question the magistrate determination or his judgment that the form of the warrant is technically sufficient.
officers lose their shield of qualified immunity o nly where the warrant application is so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence unreasonable.malley,at.citing leon,at.in other words,an officer who prepares or executes a warrant lacking probable cause is entitled to qualified immunity unless no officer of reasonable competence would have requested the warrant.id.at.when a warrant is so bereft of probable cause that official reliance is unreasonable,the officer executing the warrant can not excuse his own default by pointing to the greater incompetence of the magistrate.id.
our cases repeatedly emphasize this distinction between warrants with disputable probable cause and warrants so lacking in probable cause that no reasonable officer would view them as valid.see,ortiz,at.for example,in ortiz we held that it was reasonable for an officer to rely on a search warrant that was not so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable.id.at.in that case,the officer properly sought to have his belief that there was probable cause reviewed by the tulare county district attorney office and then by a judge.id.this was sufficient to establish objectively reasonable behavior.id.quoting united states freitas,cir.
by comparison,in united states kow,cir,we held that no reasonable agent could rely on a warrant that encompassed essentially all documents on the premises absent exceptional circumstances.id.at emphasis added.in that case,approval by an attorney and a magistrate did not amount to exceptional circumstances justifying reasonable reliance by the officers,because the lack of probable cause was so obvious that any reasonable officer would conclude that the warrant was facially invalid.id.similarly,in united states stubbs,cir,we analyzed a warrant that contained no reference to criminal activity,and merely described broad classes of documents.id.at.we held that the warrant facial invalidity was obvious enough to preclude reasonable reliance.id.
even if a warrant is so lacking in probable cause that official reliance is unreasonable,not all officers executing the search are liable for the constitutional deficiency.for example,in ramirez,we recognized that officers roles can vary widely and w hat reasonable for a particular officer depends on his role in the search.at.officers who plan and lead a search must actually read the warrant and satisfy themselves that they understand its scope and limitations,and that it is not defective in some obvious way.id.citing leon,at.line officers,however,do not have to actually read or even see the warrant they may accept the word of their superiors that they have a warrant and that it is valid.id.at citing guerra sutton,cir.thus,even if a warrant is so lacking in probable cause that official reliance is unreasonable,line officers who do not read the warrant are still entitled to qualified immunity if they inquire as to the nature and scope of the warrant,and rely on representations made by their superiors.see id.at.
with these principles in mind,we analyze defendants conduct pursuant to the january and january warrants.
january warrant 
moore,irey and hall contend that the district court erred in denying them qualified immunity for their reliance on the january warrant,which authorized a search of the ridge road property for krl documents since january,to the present.defendants argue that it was reasonable to believe that probable cause supported the warrant,given that our prior opinion concluded that the january warrant was not so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official reliance unreasonable.we agree.
we previously granted riebe qualified immunity for his approval of the january warrant because it had a more reasonable temporal limit limiting the search to documents dating back to,it alleged fraudulent activity and tax evasion dating to,it alleged hazardous waste violations in and,and it alleged that womack withdrew funds from krl for personal expenses and illegal activities.krl,at.in contrast to the warrants in kow and stubbs,we concluded that the january warrant was not so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence unreasonable.id.at quoting malley,at.in doing so,we implicitly recognized that reasonable minds could disagree as to whether probable cause supported the january warrant.
although our prior decision granted riebe qualifi
