in conjunction with a merger,telecommunications company world access issued million in debt instruments,referred to by the parties as senior notes the notes in,world access filed multiple statements with the securities and exchange commission sec acknowledging that,as a result of an april sale of assets,it was obligated under the terms of the notes indenture to make a tender offer by january,to repurchase approximately million of the notes.during the same period,world access filed an expedited declaratory judgment action in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia asking the court to declare that world access was in fact not obligated to make the tender offer.the district court refused to issue the declaratory judgment on december,and world access made the required tender offer on january.
the tender offer stated,in relevant part,that if holders tender at least aggregate principal amount of notes,world access will pay total consideration of approximately million,provided that under the terms of the indenture world access may only accept for tender notes in a principal amount of or integral multiples thereof.the tender offer further stated that note holders had until march,to tender the notes for world access to repurchase and that world access would repurchase the notes on a pro rata basis by dividing the total amount of notes tendered for repurchase by million.at the time world access made its tender offer,had acquired notes with a face value totaling.
on january,a week after making its tender offer,world access announced that it would not complete a previously anticipated acquisition of star communications star.in a press release,world access stated that the financial liabilities of star are such that we do feel we can close the transaction without the million net cash infusion anticipated in a form filed with the sec the following day,world access stated that it had terminated its agreement to acquire star and that,as a result,the company previously announced financial projections for and future periods were no longer an indication of world access anticipated financial performance.the company further stated that it was reviewing its business plan,taking into consideration these recent developments.
between january and february,acquired additional notes with a face value totaling.
world access announced on february,that it had reached an agreement with certain note holders to redeem only million of the notes rather than the million originally announced.was unaware of and did not participate in the negotiation of this agreement.in an effort to convince to consent to the reduced tender amount,world access permitted to conduct a forensic investigation,including reviewing certain financial information and an interview with executive yokley.ultimately refused to agree to the reduced amount.world access filed for bankruptcy protection in april.
filed suit,alleging,in addition to state law claims,that the defendants violated sections b and a of the securities exchange act of the act by making material misstatements or omissions with respect to both world access sec filings acknowledging its obligation to make the tender offer and the tender offer itself.the district court dismissed section b claim pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim.because liability under section a may not be imposed absent an underlying violation of the act the district court likewise dismissed claims under that section.see dennis imaging,cir.having dismissed the federal securities claims,the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims.see parker parsley petroleum dresser,cir our general rule is to dismiss state claims when the federal claims to which they are pendant are dismissed.
in order to state a claim under section b and rule promulgated to enforce section b,a plaintiff must allege,in connection with the purchase or sale of securities,a misstatement or an omission of material fact made with scienter on which plaintiff relied that proximately caused the plaintiff injury.nathenson,at quoting tuchman dsc communications,cir.persons asserting claims under section b and rule must also satisfy the enhanced pleading requirements imposed by the private securities litigation reform act of pslra and federal rule of civil procedure b.in relevant part,the pslra provides that where the plaintiff alleges a material misstatement or omission,the complaint must specify each statement alleged to have been misleading,the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading,and,if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief,the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.b.further,the complaint shall,with respect to each act or omission alleged to violate this chapter,state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b.rule b states that i n all averments of fraud or mistake,the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity.fed.civ.b.to satisfy rule b pleading requirements,the plaintiffs must specify the statements contended to be fraudulent,identify the speaker,state when and where the statements were made,and explain why the statements were fraudulent.southland sec.inspire ins.solutions,cir quoting williams wmx,cir.

complaint alleges that in multiple sec filings signed by at least one of the defendants world access stated that b ased on the sale of telco systems in april,world access is currently obligated to tender for approximately million of its senior notes by january.also cites statements in sec filings that world access will be obligated to tender for all or a portion of the senior notes at a purchase price equal to of principal,plus accrued and unpaid interest the tender offer must be made within days of the qualified asset sale s.finally,the complaint refers to statements in sec filings that b ased on the net cash received to date from the sale of telco systems world access is currently obligated to utilize approximately million to retire unsubordinated indebtedness or make a tender offer for its senior notes by january.argues these statements were misleading because they were made without ever disclosing the fact that world access either did not have the cash to make the payments required or was relying on risky contingencies to supply sufficient cash for the payments.
the district court held that,even taking as true factual allegations regarding world access financial position and defendants knowledge thereof,failed to allege actionable misstatements or omissions for purposes of section b and rule with respect to world access sec filings.we agree.rule makes it unlawful for any person,directly or indirectly,to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.b c.as the district court correctly noted,t he fact that world access may not be able to complete the tender offer on time does not make the statement that world access has an obligation to repurchase the senior notes untrue or misleading.emphasis added.mcdonald,cir finding failure to state a claim where the omitted information adds nothing to the truthfulness or accuracy of the fact stated brody transitional hosps,cir holding that the plaintiff must plead not only why the statement at issue is incomplete but why that incompleteness makes the statement misleading or untrue.further,as discussed in subpart c,infra,has not alleged facts raising a strong inference that,in the months leading up to the tender offer,any of the defendants acted with the scienter necessary for to state a fraud claim under section b and rule.
complaint contains a separate allegation that the defendants participated in the issuance of the tender offer for the senior notes at a time when world access did not have the cash to follow through with the promises made in that tender offer.claims that the defendants thus made statements that were false when made or misleading because of material omissions,in violation of rule and that various defendants knew that these statements were false or misleading when made,while others learned about their falsity after the fact but failed to correct the prior false statements or disclose the material changes in world access financial condition.
the district court dismissed claims of misstatement or omission with respect to the tender offer because it found that the tender offer did not constitute an actionable misstatement did not allege any actionable omissions failed to satisfy its duty of due diligence failed to allege facts sufficient to support a strong inference of intent to defraud and failed to allege what the defendants gained by virtue of the alleged misstatements and omissions.with respect to the scienter element,the district court found that a t best,allegations support the inference that the individual defendants were struggling to find a way to fulfill the financial obligations of world access to and other investors.
we have defined scienter as an intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud or that severe recklessness in which the danger of misleading buyers or sellers is either known to the defendant or is so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it.southland,at internal citations,quotations and ellipsis omitted.severe recklessness is limited to those highly unreasonable omissions or misrepresentations that involve not merely simple or even inexcusable negligence,but an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care.broad rockwell int l,cir.must allege facts sufficient to raise a strong inference of scienter with respect to each individual defendant.see southland,at holding that plaintiffs claiming securities fraud against multiple defendants must distinguish among those they sue and enlighten each defendant as to his or her particular part in the alleged fraud emphasis in the original.in determining whether has alleged facts sufficient to give rise to a strong inference of scienter,we consider the factual allegations contained in the complaint in toto.see barrie,cir.
after reviewing the factual allegations contained in complaint,we find that has not alleged facts sufficient to raise a strong inference of scienter.allegations in support of its claim that the defendants acted with scienter consist in large part of contentions that certain defendants knew but did not disclose that world access cash on hand at the end of was insufficient to permit world access to complete the tender offer and continue operation.alleges that prior to the tender offer mies sent burmeister a cash forecast estimating that world access would have only million on hand at the end of.speculates that because mies and yokley provided weekly updates on working capital,cash flow,and finances to various persons,including defendants phillips and chmar mies would have told phillips,chmar and yokley of his cash forecast.we note,however,that the million figure appears to be a worst case estimate,and that the letter accompanying the forecast specifically notes that it does not include a likely scenario.also alleges that phillips and chmar were aware before the tender offer of a growing liquidity crisis and that yokley admitted that he knew as of the end of that world access had only million in cash.yokley statement appears to have been taken from forensic report,which states that yokley claimed to have believed that world access would be capable of meeting all of its future financial obligations given its current cash position and the additional cash resources he believed would soon be available from a variety of sources including the star acquisition and several sources of credit.also alleges that lyon was aware that world access did not have enough cash on hand to complete the tender offer because he was copied on an email from a world access employee ordering cash transfers from european subsidiaries so that our company can meet legal obligations by year end.these legal obligations take first priority over any other payables that we have as a company,no matter who and how urgent,and are.mies subsequently canceled the order,noting that we do have to pay until the end of february.consequently,we will cancel the instructions to transfer the money from europe.
even assuming that characterization of world access financial situation is accurate and that the alleged omission was material,we find that has not alleged facts supporting a strong inference that the defendants acted with scienter in failing to make additional disclosures.knowledge of an omission does not itself necessarily raise a strong inference of scienter.see shivangi dean witter reynolds,cir sec southwest coal energy,cir.where,as here,the plaintiff has not alleged a clear motive for the alleged misstatements or omissions,the strength of its circumstantial evidence of scienter must be correspondingly greater.see tuchman dsc communications,cir noting that while motive is not necessary to prove scienter,w here a defendant motive is not apparent,a plaintiff may adequately plead scienter by identifying circumstances that indicate conscious behavior on the part of the defendant,but the strength of the circumstantial allegations must be correspondingly greater.emphasis added.see also nathenson,at characterizing allegations of motive and opportunity as providing an analytical device for assessing the logical strength of the inferences arising from particularized facts pleaded by a plaintiff to establish the necessary mental state.factual allegations suggest only that some of the defendants were aware of a worst case estimate of million for world access end of year cash position,that phillips and chmar were aware that certain credit lines would not be renewed,and that yokley expected world access to be able to meet its future financial obligations through a combination of cash on hand and various sources of credit.the email ordering a transfer of cash from european subsidiaries does not raise a strong inference that any of the defendants knew or suspected world access would not follow through with the note repurchase.rather,it suggests just the opposite that at least some of the defendants were aware of contingency plans to ensure that world access would complete note repurchase allegations are simply not sufficient,given world access expectation of a variety of outside funding sources and absent any allegation of motive,to raise a strong inference that in making the tender offer any of the defendants acted with an intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud or that severe recklessness in which the danger of misleading buyers or sellers is either known to the defendant or is
