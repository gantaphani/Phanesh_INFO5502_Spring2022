background 
a corporation held a board of directors meeting on february.at that meeting,appellant john doe,the corporation senior vice president for business development,recommended that the corporation participate in certain planned political activities.the board expressly adopted a political action plan providing that corporate money would be contributed in specific amounts to named federal political candidates.subsequently,in the summer of,the corporation conducted an internal investigation of whether its past actions had violated federal campaign finance laws.this internal investigation was undertaken by the corporation law firm hereinafter the law firm,and in particular one of the law firm partners hereinafter corporate counsel.in september a report resulting from that internal investigation,alleging possible federal election law violations,was submitted by the corporation to the department of justice hereinafter doj or government.
after receiving the report the doj commenced an investigation into allegations of election fraud at the corporation and on the part of several of the corporation employees.pursuant to its investigation,the doj issued a subpoena to the corporation requesting documents related to,among other things,political contributions made by the corporation or any of its officers,directors,or employees.the corporation continued to be represented by the law firm.appellant doe in his capacity as an executive of the corporation was also represented by the law firm but in addition retained his own personal attorney.after the doj issued its subpoena,the corporation and its corporate counsel entered into a joint defense agreement jda with doe and his personal attorney hereinafter collectively appellants.the jda provided for the exchange of communications and documents between the parties to the jda and that such communications and documents would remain protected by the privilege.corporate counsel also served as the corporation custodian of record and the principal point of contact with the government.
in response to the doj subpoena,the corporation produced,inter alia,an unsigned copy of the minutes of the february,board of directors meeting.these minutes appeared to show that the political activities plan doe put forth at the meeting included illegal corporate contributions to federal political candidates.the doj then requested additional information from the corporation regarding the board of directors meeting.in response to this request,corporate counsel sent a letter on december,to doe personal attorney with a copy of the february unsigned board minutes attached,asking that doe provide a ny recollections or information that he may have in order to address the doj concerns.in reply doe personal attorney sent corporate counsel a fax which stated that enclosed was a signed copy of the february,minutes with doe recommendations attached.these recommendations were typed on a document which read at the top board meeting,february,and assignment recommendation.this assignment recommendation seemingly indicated that,contrary to the board minutes,there were no approved recommendations.therefore it was exculpatory as to doe.according to an affidavit filed by corporate counsel in the district court,after corporate counsel received the fax he on three occasions had conversations with doe concerning the assignment recommendation.the first conversation occurred after corporate counsel contacted doe and stated that the doj would want to know why the signed copy of the board minutes and the assignment recommendation had not been previously identified and produced as responsive to the grand jury subpoena.doe replied that only recently had he instructed his assistant to look at his personal copies of corporate minutes,which apparently had not been searched previously.corporate counsel subsequently submitted the signed board minutes and the assignment recommendation to the doj.
the doj then arranged to interview doe.in the interim corporate counsel had his second conversation with doe when he met with doe and his personal attorney and informed doe that during the interview the doj was likely to inquire as to why the assignment recommendation was produced so late.in reply doe reiterated his prior explanation.several days later,the doj informed corporate counsel that it believed that the assignment recommendation was not,as it had been represented to be,a contemporaneous record of the events that it described,and was therefore fraudulent.corporate counsel then had his third conversation with doe,at which time doe stated that he could not remember the exact date of the document preparation.soon thereafter,doe personal attorney informed corporate counsel by telephone that the assignment recommendation was not made contemporaneously with the february,board meeting but in fact had been prepared sometime in december,the same time period when doe stated that his assistant had conducted a search of his personal files.
corporate counsel subsequently notified the doj that the assignment recommendation should not be considered a contemporaneous record of the february,board meeting.in response,the doj sought from corporate counsel the circumstances under which the document was obtained as well as all conversations corporate counsel had with the persons who had provided the document to him.corporate counsel initially claimed privilege but later relented after the government stated that under the circumstances it was its position that the exception to the privilege was applicable.the doj then interviewed doe,in his personal attorney presence,regarding the assignment recommendation,at which time doe told the doj that the document had been created in december to replicate notes that he had made around the time of the board meeting.doe also acknowledged that he knew that the assignment recommendation would be provided to the grand jury in connection with its investigation.when confronted by the doj with his conflicting statements concerning the manner in which the document had been provided and represented to the government,doe personal attorney raised the privilege,interjecting that any communications between doe and corporate counsel were protected by the jda and privileged.soon thereafter the doj began an investigation into the matter and served corporate counsel with a grand jury subpoena seeking information concerning his conversations with doe on the assignment recommendation.
corporate counsel filed a motion in district court seeking an order to quash the subpoena or in the alternative directing him to testify.attached to the motion was corporate counsel affidavit containing the substance of his conversations with doe concerning the assignment recommendation.the motion sought a ruling on whether these conversations between corporate counsel and doe were privileged.doe and his personal attorney intervened,filing a memorandum in support of the motion to quash in which they requested that the court,on grounds of privilege,not only suppress the subpoena but also exclude from discovery the assignment recommendation.after review of the parties briefs,including a government ex parte affidavit,the district court held a hearing on the motion.the attorneys presented arguments but no testimony was taken.at the conclusion of the hearing the district court ruled that the assignment recommendation was a corporate document responsive to the grand jury subpoena and was not protected from disclosure by the privilege.the court ruled further that the conversations between the appel
