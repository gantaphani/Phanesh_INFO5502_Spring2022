united states cellular investment company of los angeles,appeals the district court summary judgment in favor of its partners in a limited partnership and their corporate parents.cellular core allegation is that one of the partners breached the partnership agreement by transferring or assigning its general and limited partnership interests.we agree with the district court that the agreement was not violated,and we therefore affirm.
background 
this case involves the interpretation of an agreement for a limited partnership created in to provide cellular telephone service in the los angeles area.the limited partnership,known as the los angeles smsa limited partnership los angeles partnership has three partners cellular,airtouch cellular,and gte wireless incorporated gte.cellular,the,owns a limited partner interest.airtouch cellular,a,owns a general partner interest and a limited partner interest.gte,a,owns a limited partner interest.cellular was an original partner of the los angeles partnership.airtouch cellular and gte acquired their partnership interests after a series of transactions with other original partners.
the los angeles partnership agreement is based on a form agreement that was developed for structuring cellular telephone partnerships throughout the country the form partnership agreement.included in the form partnership agreement and therefore in the los angeles partnership agreement are two sections restricting the transfer of partnership interests.these sections are the focus of the appeal in this case.section provides that the general partner may transfer or assign its general partner interest only with the consent of all other partners section grants each limited partner a right of first refusal before any other partner transfers its limited partnership interest 
the current dispute began with the formation of a partnership called cellco.cellco is a joint venture between bell atlantic corporation and vodafone airtouch plc vodafone,the ultimate parent of los angeles partner airtouch cellular.airtouch communications,which owned all of the stock of airtouch cellular when airtouch cellular acquired its partnership interest,is a wholly owned subsidiary of vodafone.in,bell atlantic and vodafone announced that they would enter into an alliance agreement to provide a wireless communications network throughout the united states.under the alliance agreement,vodafone would transfer all its united states wireless interests to cellco.the alliance agreement required vodafone to use reasonable efforts to transfer to cellco direct ownership of its assets,partnership interests,or wholly owned limited liability companies.however,airtouch communications did not directly transfer airtouch cellular partnership interests in the los angeles partnership.instead,in april,it transferred all of its airtouch cellular stock to cellco.thus,airtouch cellular remains the general partner of the los angeles partnership and it retains its limited partnership interest,but all of its stock is now owned by cellco.
cellular sued to enjoin the stock sale,alleging that airtouch cellular was a shell entity and that the substance of the underlying transaction was an asset transfer that triggered the agreement provisions.during discovery,airtouch cellular officials testified in depositions that airtouch cellular remained a bona fide operating company,with thousands of employees,substantial assets,interests in wireless systems throughout california,and general partnership interests in other communities in addition to los angeles.the district court denied cellular motion for a temporary restraining order,holding that under the plain language of the partnership agreement,the provisions applied only to direct transfers of the partnership interest itself,not to the transfer of stock in the company owning the partnership interest.after unsuccessfully appealing the denial of the tro,cellular amended its complaint to seek damages.under the amended complaint,it no longer asserts that airtouch cellular is a shell,but it continues to claim that the change of ownership of the stock of the general partner requires consent and first refusal under the provisions.it also alleges that airtouch cellular withdrew as general partner by abdicating in favor of cellco.this withdrawal,it argues,triggered section of the agreement,which states that withdrawal causes the dissolution and termination of the partnership and requires that the withdrawing general partner provide the other partners an opportunity to designate a substitute general partner prior to its withdrawal 
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the,holding that the agreement was not subject to the construction urged by cellular.we agree with the district court.

iii.discussion 
the key issue in this case is the proper construction of the provisions in the los angeles partnership agreement.cellular argues these provisions are broad enough to encompass the transfer of airtouch cellular stock to cellco.specifically,it argues that the district court erred in a granting summary judgment based on its conclusion that the agreement would not support the construction set forth by the plaintiff b striking declarations submitted by cellular purporting to provide extrinsic evidence of the parties intent and c denying cellular rule f application to take additional discovery that it claimed would support its construction of the provisions.we consider each argument in turn.
no genuine issue of material fact as to contract construction 
the los angeles partnership agreement provides that california law governs the contract.applying california law,we hold that the district court correctly found that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to the proper construction of the contract provisions because the intent of the parties,as expressed in the plain language of the agreement,was not to restrict the legitimate sale of the stock of a corporate partner.
under california law,the fundamental goal of contract interpretation is to give effect to the mutual intent of the parties as it existed at the time of contracting.cal.city of atascadero merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,th,d.when a contract is reduced to writing,this intent is to be ascertained from the writing alone,if possible.cal.see also brinton bankers pension,th,d.under the plain language of the agreement,the provisions are triggered by the transfer of a partnership interest,either that of a general or that of a limited partner.section restricts the transfer or assignment of a general partner interest,and section restricts the sale of a partnership interest.nothing in either section restricts the sale of stock of an owner of a general or limited partnership interest.
cellular asserts that the parties intended that sections and restrict indirect transfers of the partnership interest,and that the sale of stock constitutes such an indirect transfer.california courts have already held that the transfer of stock is not the same thing as a transfer of the assets of that corporation.see richardson la rancherita,d.markets,d.cellular seeks to distinguish these cases on the ground that the assets at issue were leases,not partnership interests as in this case.because the assignment and transfer of a lease implicate legal restrictions unique to the law of real property,it argues,these cases can not be read as establishing any general principle that a stock transfer does not constitute an asset transfer.
we disagree.the analysis in and richardson hinges not on the nature of the specific assets involved in the transfer,but on the nature of the entity owning the assets and with whom the contract was made.that is,the california courts in these cases recognized that when a party enters into an agreement with a corporation,it is presumed to do so with an understanding of the nature of the corporate form.in effectuating the reasonable expectation of the parties,the law presumes that if the parties intend to limit the corporation ability to engage in a legitimate and normal corporate transaction,such a limitation will be specified.
the court held that w hen it was covenanted that the lessee should not assign the leasehold estate,the lease as an entirety was meant,and not merely shares of stock in the lessee corporation.d at,internal citation omitted.in so concluding,the court emphasized that 
h ad the parties to the lease intended that the sale and transfer by one or more stockholders in the lessee corporation to other persons of one or more of their shares of stock therein was deemed to be an assignment or attempted assignment of the lease itself,such fact should have been expressed in the lease in clear and unequivocal language.
in richardson,the plaintiff corporation,breg,leased premises for a restaurant from la rancherita.d at.when breg sought to sell its restaurant assets and to assign the lease,la rancherita objected,pointing to a provision in the lease that gave it the right to consent or refuse consent to any such assignment.id.breg and the purchaser then decided to revise their agreement to the need for la rancherita consent to the assignment.id.
the new deal called for the sale of all of breg capital stock to the purchaser.la rancherita claimed that consent was still required because the stock sale was merely a change of form to circumvent the consent provision.id.at.breg and its shareholders sued seeking a declaratory judgment permitting the stock transfer to proceed,and prevailed in the trial court.the california appellate court affirmed,noting that the trial court had been asked to bar the transfer of shares of common stock in a valid corporation,permissible under corporate law,solely because of a lease provision prohibiting assignment of the lease,but containing no restraints on transfer of stock ownership.id.at.the trial court,it held,had properly recogniz ed the separateness of the corporate form.id.like the court in,the richardson court emphasized that t he parties,at the time of their negotiations,were apparently satisfied with a corporation as lessee,and thus could not be presumed to have intended that the transfer of that corporation stock be restricted.id.
similarly,when cellular entered into its partnership agreement with airtouch cellular,it did so with full awareness that airtouch cellular was a corporation.nothing in the partnership agreement restricts the sale of the corporate stock of the partners.as the district court correctly observed,the parties here were highly sophisticated corporations represented by experienced counsel.had the partners intended that the sale of stock of a corporate partner be restricted,such intent could easily have been stated.given the clear california law distinguishing a transfer of assets from a sale of stock,the los angeles partners could not have intended provisions restricting the sale of assets to restrict the sale of stock.the district court was correct in so holding.
in support of its argument that sections and were intended to restrict stock sales,cellular asserts that o ther courts considering the provisions of the cellular form partnership agreement have had little difficulty finding a reasonable construction that extends those provisions to transactions designed to evade their reach.it relies on two cases for this proposition.see oregon rsa,castle rock cellular,aff in part and rev in part,cir,and boise city telephone data systems.superior,unpublished opinion letter.these two cases did,indeed,hold that sale of stock in corporate partners was restricted by the provisions of the form partnership agreement.in oregon rsa,the court held that the sale of the stock of a limited partner without offering the right of first refusal violated the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied in the partnership agreement.see.at.in boise city msa,the court held that a stock sale was designed as a subterfuge to avoid the provisions and was therefore a violation of the partnership agreement.see boise city msa,at.
oregon rsa applied oregon law.oregon rsa,at.it is not clear whether the washington court in boise msa applied washington law or some other law.however,even if we were to assume that oregon rsa and boise msa accurately reflect california law,these cases would not support cellular position in this case.the facts of oregon rsa and boise msa were different from the facts in this case in one crucial respect the stock transfers in those cases were made using one or more shell entities.the shells were corporations created purely for the purposes of the subterfuge.they owned no significant assets aside from the partnership interest,and they had no purpose except to serve as mechanisms to avoid the restrictions of the provisions.oregon rsa.at boise city msa,at.that is not the case here.airtouch cellular,whose stock was sold,existed as a corporation prior to the stock sale and continues to have a genuine corporate existence after the sale.indeed,cellular has now abandoned its argument that airtouch cellular is a shell.cellco,which acquired the airtouch cellular stock,is a bona fide ongoing corporate partnership between vodafone and bell atlantic.cellular has never alleged that cellco is a shell.
this distinction is important,as both oregon rsa and boise city msa acknowledged.far from being broad condemnations of the use of stock sales to avoid the provisions,these cases both emphasize that the use of a shell entity as the stock purchaser is the linchpin of their holdings that the partnership agreements were violated.two full pages of the district court opinion in oregon rsa are devoted to a discussion of the legal prohibition on using the corporate structure to avoid contractual obligations and frustrate the legitimate expectations of other parties.see.at.had defendants contracted to sell the partnership interest to ptci directly,this transaction would unquestionably have triggered the refusal clause in the partnership agreement.however,defendants have sought to circumvent that restriction by conveying not just the partnership interest but also the holding companies that cellular,created as repositories for that partnership interest.boise city msa states that a s a general proposition,the owner of a corporate partner may sell the stock of that partner without triggering first refusal rights,but the court held the general rule inapplicable because the shell entity that purchased the stock was created purely for the purpose of providing the vehicle by which the partnership interest could be purchased.boise city msa,at.
had the stock sale in this case been a sale to or by a shell entity,we would have a very different case.but cellco,the purchaser,is not a shell,and airtouch cellular,whose stock it purchased,is not a shell.the sale of airtouch cellular stock to cellco was no shell game.rather,it was a rather standard cor
