ii.discussion 
as mentioned,california statutory unfair competition law et hereafter the ucl previously authorized any person acting for the interests of itself,its members or the general public former to file a civil action for relief.standing to bring such an action did not depend on a showing of injury or damage.see committee on children television,general foods,supra,cal d,stop youth addiction,lucky stores,supra,cal th,d.
in proposition,as stated in the measure preamble,the voters found and declared that the ucl broad grant of standing had encouraged f rivolous unfair competition lawsuits that clog our courts,cost taxpayers and threaten the survival of small businesses,subd.c findings and declarations of purpose.the former law,the voters determined,had been misused by some private attorneys who f ile frivolous lawsuits as a means of generating attorneys fees without creating a corresponding public benefit,f ile lawsuits where no client has been injured in fact,f ile lawsuits for clients who have not used the defendant product or service,viewed the defendant advertising,or had any other business dealing with the defendant,and f ile lawsuits on behalf of the general public without any accountability to the public and without adequate court supervision,subd.b.t he intent of california voters in enacting proposition was to limit such abuses by prohibit ing private attorneys from filing lawsuits for unfair competition where they have no client who has been injured in fact,subd.e and by providing that only the california attorney general and local public officials be authorized to file and prosecute actions on behalf of the general public,subd.f.
proposition accomplishes its goals in relatively few words.the measure amends section,which prescribes who may sue to enforce the ucl,by deleting the language that had formerly authorized suits by any person acting for the interests of itself,its members or the general public,and by replacing it with the phrase,who has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of unfair competition.the measure also amends section,which authorizes courts to enjoin unfair competition,by adding the following words any person may pursue representative claims or relief on behalf of others only if the claimant meets the standing requirements of section and complies with section of the code of civil procedure,but these limitations do not apply to claims brought under this chapter by the attorney general,or any district attorney,county counsel,city attorney,or city prosecutor in this state.
proposition does not expressly declare whether the new standing provisions it adds to the ucl apply to pending cases.mervyn argument that the measure does so declare is unconvincing.according to mervyn,the electorate expressed its understanding that the new standing provisions apply to pending cases by stating in section that suits under the unfair competition laws shall be prosecuted exclusively italics added by the persons therein given standing.mervyn argues the word prosecuted is broad enough to describe the continued prosecution of actions filed before the measure took effect.melancon superior court cal d,describing the term prosecution in a different context as sufficiently comprehensive to include every step in an action from its commencement to its final determination.mervyn would find similar indications of the voters intent in the measure preamble,which declares that the intent of california voters was to eliminate frivolous unfair competition lawsuits,subd.d,italics added and to ensure that only the california attorney general and local public officials be authorized to file and prosecute actions on behalf of the general public,subd.f,italics added.mervyn also relies on the ballot argument favoring the measure,which urged the voters to c lose the frivolous shakedown lawsuit loophole.ballot,argument in favor of.
certainly the foregoing statements would be consistent with an assumed intention to apply proposition standing provisions to pending cases.the language is not,however,sufficiently clear to compel the inference that the voters did intend the provisions so to apply.the ucl reference to the prosecution of actions appears in a part of section that proposition did not change.moreover,at least in modern times,we have been cautious not to infer the voters or the legislature intent on the subject of prospective versus retrospective operation from vague phrases myers philip morris companies,cal th,d,myers and broad,general language evangelatos superior court cal d,fn.evangelatos in statutes,initiative measures and ballot pamphlets.we have also disapproved statements to the contrary in certain older cases.see evangelatos,at,disapproving language in re marriage of bouquet cal d,mannheim superior court cal d,and in re estrada cal d.accordingly,we will not attempt to infer from the ambiguous general language of proposition whether the voters intended the measure to apply to pending cases.instead,we will employ the ordinary presumptions and rules of statutory construction commonly used to decide such matters when a statute is silent.
cdr,arguing the new standing provisions do not apply to pending cases,relies on the presumption that statutes apply prospectively in the absence of a clearly expressed contrary intent evangelatos,supra,cal d,see also aetna cas.surety.acc.com.cal d,aetna casualty.in response,and assuming for the sake of argument the cited presumption governs this case,mervyn contends the application of proposition standing provisions to pending cases is not retroactive,as we have defined the term,because such application does not change the legal consequences of past conduct by imposing new or different liabilities based upon such conduct.see elsner uveges cal th,d,elsner tapia superior court cal d,tapia aetna casualty,supra,at.
when a statute application to a given case is challenged as impermissibly retroactive,we typically begin our analysis by reiterating the presumption that statutes operate prospectively absent a clear indication the voters or the legislature intended otherwise,elsner,supra,cal th,d,myers,supra,cal th,d,tapia,su
