this is the third chapter of silicon valley litigation spanning more than years involving a microchip company,zf micro devices,zf devices,and its successor,zf micro solutions,zf solutions the successor company sued national semiconductor corporation nsc zf devices foundry and obtained a million settlement in.afterwards,venture capital firms that had invested in zf devices,including tat capital partners,tat,sued zf solutions and others for fraudulent transfer of the nsc settlement proceeds.the investors prevailed at trial in and this court affirmed the judgment on appeal.
in the instant third lawsuit,the zf entities alleged in a complaint that mark putney,a tat representative who was a zf devices board member,breached fiduciary duties owed to zf devices.the zf entities also alleged in a separate originally filed in the second lawsuit but later severed and consolidated in this third suit that tat breached its fiduciary duties to zf devices.this third lawsuit went to trial in december.tat and putney prevailed,and the zf entities appealed.
at trial,tat argued that zf claim accruing in february was barred by the applicable statute of limitations because zf was not filed until march.zf contended that the was timely because the statute of limitations was tolled by the filing of tat lawsuit in february.tat replied that this tolling doctrine applied only to compulsory because the zf was permissive unrelated to the claims alleged in tat complaint,its filing did not relate back to the date the complaint was filed.the trial court,acknowledging that authors of major california treatises had expressed conflicting views on the subject and aptly recognizing the issue was ripe for appeal,held the tolling doctrine applied only to compulsory.because the court also found that zf was permissive,it allowed tat to submit its statute of limitations defense at trial.the jury found that zf was.
we agree that zf was permissive but conclude the tolling doctrine applies to both permissive and compulsory.although more recent intermediate appellate court decisions have suggested the tolling doctrine applies only to related compulsory,there is controlling supreme court authority from and that the tolling doctrine applies to the defendant related and unrelated against the plaintiff.
because the tolling doctrine applied to zf permissive,its filing related back to the date tat filed its complaint february.the having been timely filed,the court erred in submitting tat statute of limitations defense to the jury.accordingly,we will reverse the judgment entered on zf against tat and remand to the court below for further proceedings 
procedural background 
introduction 
given the factual and procedural complexity concerning this matter,we provide a brief summary at the outset.
david feldman founded zf devices in july.he was at all times its chief executive officer.zf devices was in the business of designing and selling embedded microchips.the company contracted in with nsc to design and manufacture zf devices microchip.
tat is a swiss private equity firm that invests in startup high technology companies.between and,tat infused zf devices with significant capital by investing approximately million into the company which resulted in tat holding percent of the outstanding shares of zf devices.tat held a seat on the board of directors of zf devices,and tat representatives on the board were thomas egolf and,later,mark putney.putney resigned from the board in november.
sands brothers venture capital sands venture and sb new paradigm associates llc sb were additional investors of zf devices collectively,sands venture and sb hereafter,collectively,sands owned percent of zf devices stock.sands representative on zf devices board of directors was gary kennedy,who resigned that position in november.
on february,kennedy who had provided a million secured bridge loan to zf devices in on which the company later defaulted foreclosed on the assets of zf devices.this marked the end of zf devices operations.at or about the same time,feldman formed zf solutions for the purpose of acquiring zf devices assets.feldman and his sister,marsha armstrong,lent zf solutions approximately for it to acquire from kennedy the assets of zf devices he had obtained by foreclosing on his loan.included among the assets zf solutions acquired was zf devices microchip production agreement with nsc.
ii.the nsc lawsuit 
on april,zf solutions sued nsc for damages,as santa clara county superior court case number the nsc lawsuit.the lawsuit was based upon claims that,among other things,nsc failed to produce zf devices microchips as agreed under their contract.while the case was ongoing,nsc contended that zf solutions had no standing to assert tort claims against nsc because those claims belonged to the shareholders of zf devices.in responding to this contention,feldman produced a document entitled assignment of assets,purporting to assign zf devices intellectual property,including any claims against nsc,from zf devices to zf solutions the document bore no date of signature but reflected march,as its effective date.nsc challenged the legal effectiveness of the assignment.in april while the nsc lawsuit was still pending and the issue of zf solutions standing was still outstanding feldman solicited and obtained tat execution of an april consent agreement discussed,post.
the case proceeded to trial,and a jury awarded zf solutions damages of million.the trial judge vacated the verdict,but the case was later settled in or about december for million.
iii.the tat lawsuit 
on february,two zf devices investors,tat and sands venture,brought suit against the zf entities and feldman,as santa clara county superior court case number the tat lawsuit.tat and sands venture alleged jointly claims for dissolution of zf devices,breach of fiduciary duty against feldman,fraudulent transfer,and for an accounting.two separate complaints were later filed by tat and sands.a number of individuals who were zf solutions shareholders including feldman and his sister,armstrong,identified collectively as the transferee defendants,were named in the separate complaints.
generally speaking,tat and sands claims arose out of their respective contentions that,as zf devices shareholders,they were entitled to receive pro rata distributions of the proceeds of the million settlement of the nsc lawsuit.tat and sands based their claims substantially upon the april consent agreement,which had been solicited by feldman in response to nsc assertion during the nsc lawsuit that zf solutions had no standing to assert zf devices tort claims.under the consent agreement,tat and sands ratified feldman transfer of zf devices legal rights against nsc to zf solutions.tat and sands claimed that,in exchange for signing the consent agreement,they were promised that,as zf devices shareholders,they would receive distributions of any recovery obtained in the nsc lawsuit.tat and sands alleged that zf solutions breached the consent agreement by distributing all net nsc lawsuit settlement proceeds to itself and to the transferee defendants zf solutions shareholders.tat and sands alleged further that the disposition of the settlement proceeds constituted a fraudulent transfer of assets.
on march,the court granted zf motion for leave to file a against tat.zf filed that on march,the zf alleging that tat through its partners and agents,egolf and putney,as tat designated members of zf devices board of directors,breached fiduciary duties owed to the zf entities.
the tat lawsuit was tried in late.the trial judge considered various pretrial matters,including tat motion to sever the zf.on december,the court granted that motion,ordering the zf severed and consolidated with another pending superior court action that had been filed by the zf entities against tat,putney,and egolf,namely,the instant case case number hereafter,the zf lawsuit.
the tat lawsuit proceeded to a trial.in the first phase,the court found that there were contracts that existed between tat and zf solutions and sands and zf solutions,and that they were sufficiently definite to be enforceable.in the second phase,a jury found in favor of tat and sands on their respective breach of contract claims,and it awarded damages to them.in the third phase,after hearing additional testimony,the court found in favor of tat and sands on their fraudulent transfer claims against the transferring defendants.a judgment was entered that included awards of damages including interest of to tat and to sands.substantial monetary judgments of varying amounts were also entered against the transferee defendants,including feldman,against whom the judgment amount was.zf solutions and of the transferee defendants appealed from the judgment.in an unpublished decision filed july,we affirmed the judgment.
iv.the zf lawsuit 
the zf lawsuit was filed on february.in their complaint,the zf entities alleged claims against tat,putney,and egolf for breach of fiduciary duty among other claims.after being granted leave in the tat lawsuit to file a against tat,zf amended the complaint in the zf lawsuit,removing tat as a defendant.but as stated,ante,that was subsequently ordered severed and consolidated with the zf lawsuit.zf later amended the complaint again to remove egolf as a defendant.
the zf lawsuit proceeded to trial in november before a different judge than the trial judge in the tat lawsuit.the operative pleadings were the second amended complaint for breach of fiduciary duty against putney,and the first amended for breach of fiduciary duty against tat.during in limine motions,the trial court dismissed zf devices as plaintiff and,concluding that all of its rights had been assigned to zf solutions also during pretrial proceedings,tat and putney made a motion to bifurcate the trial and to first try their statute of limitations affirmative defenses.as a parallel motion,zf sought an order in limine precluding tat and putney from asserting a statute of limitations defense.zf asserted,among other things,that the breach of fiduciary duty claim was timely,even disregarding their position that accrual was delayed because they did not discover the facts supporting the claim for a number of years.zf argued that the claim was governed by a statute,the tat complaint in the tat lawsuit was filed within that period on february,and the statute of limitations for filing the zf was tolled upon the filing of the tat complaint.
the trial court denied zf motion in limine and granted tat motion to bifurcate.in later pretrial proceedings,the court tentatively ruled that the statute of limitations was not tolled by the filing of the tat complaint on february,and,thus,the operative date to determine whether the zf was was its filing date on march.the trial court confirmed those conclusions later during the bifurcated trial 
the trial court ordered that tat and putney initially present evidence supporting their statute of limitations defense,followed by zf presenting evidence of delayed accrual of the statute.the parties stipulated that for purposes of the statute of limitations,the harm to zf devices occurred on february,the date that kennedy,as secured lender,foreclosed on zf devices assets and the company ceased doing business.and the trial court determined that zf breach of fiduciary duty claim was subject to a statute of limitations.see code civ,thomson canyon th.
accordingly,in the first phase of the bifurcated trial as it pertained to the,the jury was required to determine whether the zf on its face was because it was filed on march,more than four years after zf breach of fiduciary duty claim accrued and if so,whether zf claim was nonetheless timely because of the delayed accrual of the statute of limitations.to establish delayed accrual,zf had to show that it did not discover,and did not know of the facts that would have caused a reasonable person to suspect,the facts supporting its claim against tat at the time the statute otherwise commenced running,and the discovery date was on or after march,less than four years before the was filed.see jolly eli lilly cal d.
on december,the jury returned a verdict in favor of tat and putney.in separate special verdict forms,the jury found that the zf entities or either of them had knowledge of any breaches of fiduciary duty committed by tat before march,more than four years before the filing of zf and the zf entities or either of them had knowledge of any breaches of fiduciary duty committed by putney before february,more than four years before the filing of zf complaint.a judgment was entered on the verdict on january.the court concluded,based upon the jury findings,that zf claims were and that tat and putney were therefore entitled to judgment in their favor on the first amended and second amended complaint,respectively.
discussion 
applicability of tolling doctrine to zf 
zf contends the trial court erred in concluding that the claims in zf were unrelated to those asserted by tat in its complaint and the was therefore permissive,and the filing of the tat complaint,therefore,did not toll the statute of limitations for the zf because the tolling doctrine applies only to compulsory.therefore,we determine first whether the zf was permissive as concluded by the trial court.concluding that the trial court correctly so held,we then address whether the tolling doctrine applies to permissive.the application of the statute of limitations on undisputed facts is a purely legal question citation accordingly,we review the lower courts rulings de novo.aryeh canon business solutions,cal th.
a.the zf was permissive 
issue was not previously decided 
citing to different parts of the record,the parties argue that there was a prior,binding determination that the zf was compulsory as argued by zf or permissive as argued by tat.we address their respective positions in turn.
zf compulsory position 
zf contends that when the court in the tat lawsuit granted the zf entities leave to file their,it adjudicated that the pleading was compulsory.on march,the court granted zf motion,concluding that t he proposed arises out of the transactions,circumstances,and occurrences that are at issue in the related actions and is a mandatory cross complaint.in its opening brief,zf argues in a heading that t he has been ruled mandatory initial capitalization and emphasis omitted.under that heading,beyond stating that there was never a subsequent order nullifying the court march,order,zf offers little argument in support of its position that this order constitutes a conclusive adjudication that the zf was compulsory.and it does not address the subject in its reply brief at all.
notwithstanding zf failure to develop its argument,we surmise that its position is that,based upon the court order of march,tat is barred by collateral estoppel from asserting that the zf was permissive.collateral estoppel precludes relitigation of issues argued and decided in prior proceedings.citation.pacific lumber state water resources control bd.cal th,pacific lumber.there are five threshold requirements for collateral estoppel.first,the issue sought to be precluded from relitigation must be identical to that decided in a former proceeding.second,this issue must have been actually litigated in the former proceeding.third,it must have been necessarily decided in the former proceeding.fourth,the decision in the former proceeding must be final and on the merits.finally,the party against whom preclusion is sought must be the same as,or in privity with,the party to the former proceeding.citations.ibid.the burden of proving each of these elements of collateral estoppel rests with the party asserting it.see also santa clara valley transp.authority rea th.
as noted,zf has not explained,either with argument or legal authority,the basis for its contention that the march,order granting leave to file the zf conclusively adjudicated that the was compulsory.and zf does not even mention,let alone address and meet its burden of establishing,that the five requisite elements of collateral estoppel apply in this instance.see pacific lumber,supra,cal th at.an appellate court has no obligation to develop the appellants arguments for them.dills redwoods associates,th,fn.see also benach county of los angeles th,conclusory argument presentation in brief was inadequate and appellate court deemed issue abandoned.
zf argues further that tat is judicially estopped from asserting that the zf is permissive.it argues that on october,tat served a document captioned notice of related cases in the instant zf lawsuit,claiming that the zf lawsuit was related to the tat lawsuit.the doctrine of judicial estoppel applies when the same party has taken two positions the positions were taken in judicial or administrative proceedings the party was successful in asserting the first position the two positions are totally inconsistent and the first position was not taken as a result of ignorance,fraud,or mistake.citation.mercury interactive klein th,quoting jackson county of los angeles th.here,in the notice of related cases,tat expressly stated that it disputed the zf was compulsory zf solutions has argued and tat disputes that its filed in the tat lawsuit was compulsory.italics added.thus,because tat did not take two positions,it did not previously assert that the zf was compulsory,it is not judicially estopped from claiming the is permissive.
tat permissive position 
tat makes the parallel contention that zf is collaterally estopped from asserting that its was compulsory.tat asserts that the trial court december,order severing the zf and consolidating it with the zf lawsuit,coupled with this court subsequent affirmance of the judgment in the tat lawsuit,constituted a conclusive determination that the was permissive.in making its order,the trial court held that the claim asserted in the zf and the claims alleged in the tat lawsuit were not related at all.and tat correctly noted that in the prior appeal in the tat lawsuit,the appellants zf solutions and the individual transferring defendants challenged unsuccessfully the trial court order severing the zf and consolidating it in the within action.
clearly,the trial judge in the tat lawsuit expressed the view that the respective claims in the tat complaint and the zf were unrelated.what is less clear is whether this issue of the relatedness of the claims was actually litigated.further,it is unclear whether a determination that the claims were not related in the context of establishing whether the was compulsory or permissive was necessary to the court decision.see creative ventures,llc jim ward associates th,rejecting collateral estoppel contention concerning finding by administrative law judge,concluding the supposed finding was not necessary to the alj decision.here,the trial court determined whether separate trials of tat claims and zf claim would be in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice,or would be conducive to expedition and economy,subd.b.the court may have resolved that issue without having necessarily found that the was permissive,that zf claims were unrelated to tat claims.moreover,in affirming the judgment,we did not specifically address whether the zf was compulsory or permissive.rather,we held simply that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling,under section,subdivision b,that the zf should be severed and tried separately from tat claims.we therefore conclude that tat,like zf,has failed to meet its burden of proving each of the five requisite elements of collateral estoppel.see pacific lumber,supra,cal th at.
the claims were not logically related 
under california compulsory statute,a party is prohibited from asserting a claim if,at the time the party answered a complaint in a prior suit,it failed to allege in a any related cause of action against the plaintiff,subd.a a.the phrase related cause of action is defined as a cause of action which arises out of the same transaction,occurrence,or series of transactions or occurrences as the cause of action which the plaintiff alleges in his complaint,subd.c.additionally,in order for a to be compulsory,the related cause of action must have existed when the answer was served.a.if it was not,the failure to assert it is not a bar under the statute.crocker nat.bank emerald d,crocker nat.bank.
few california courts have interpreted the relatedness requirement of the compulsory statute but this court relying on an opinion from our colleagues of the fourth district court of appeal see currie medical specialties,bowen d currie medical has held there must be a logical relationship between the prior complaint and the.as we explained the currie medical court,finding guidance in federal decisions construing the compulsory counterclaim statute,federal rules of civil procedure,rule a,held that the relatedness standard requires not an absolute identity of factual backgrounds for the two claims,but only a logical relationship between them.citation.this logical relationship approach is the majority rule among the federal courts citation.align technology,tran th,align technology,quoting currie medical,supra,at.in currie medical,the court emphasized that,in concluding there was a logical relationship between the claims that required assertion of the later claim as a compulsory,the claims involve d common issues of law and fact,an overlap of issues,and a common transaction.currie medical,at.
zf alleged in the that tat,through its partners and agents,putney and egolf both of whom were at times members of zf devices board,breached its fiduciary duties to zf devices.generally,it was alleged that tat communicated to potential zf devices investors a lack of confidence in the company management in an attempt to manipulate the potential investors and thereby advance tat personal agenda attempted to effect a sale of zf devices without the board knowledge or approval,thereby communicating that the company was in a weak position and offered zf devices shares to potential investors at a discounted price,without board approval,in exchange for the potential investors assistance in tat taking control of the board.more specifically,zf alleged breaches of fiduciary duty in connection with matters spanning from involving a switzerland presentation by feldman in which he disclosed zf devices confidential information to investors of tat and to walter furter,who,unbeknownst to feldman,was an executive of a zf devices competitor,through involving tat contacts with a potential investor,thomas wiesel partners.zf alleged that zf devices sustained resulting damages,because it was unable to secure necessary financing,suffered from internal dissension,and was ultimately unable to succeed and defaulted on its loan to kennedy in february.
the zf concerned the management and operation of zf devices,including alleged actions by putney and egolf,as directors of zf devices,taken on behalf of tat between and that materially impacted the success of the company.in contrast,the claims in the tat complaint were against the successor entity,zf solutions,not zf devices,concerning matters that occurred in or after,more than two years after zf devices failure namely,the consent agreement entered into in,the settlement of the nsc lawsuit in december,and the breach of the consent agreement through disbursement of the nsc settlement proceeds thereafter.tat claims in no way concerned the operation of zf devices alleged attempts to oust its management the solicitation of potential investors for zf devices the reasons that such potential investors chose not to invest in the company or the circumstances surrounding the demise of zf devices in february.thus,although claims were loosely related in the sense that they involved some of the same parties and concerned,directly or indirectly,the failure of zf devices zf was not logically related to tat claim the trial of the claims did not involve a duplication of time and effort based upon there being factual or legal issues relevant to both claims.align technology,supra,th at.
our conclusion that the zf is not logically related to tat claims is underscored by contrasting the circumstances presented here with those found in cases in which courts determined the were compulsory.for example,in currie medical,supra,d,the plaintiff currie and the defendant bowen entered into an oral contract in which currie agreed to cease its competing business and to act as a distributor for bowen in selling labels to hospitals.id.at.in a federal action,bowen sued currie for unfair competition and violations of the lanham act et,claiming that currie had obtained bowen trade secrets while the distribution contract existed,and,after its termination,unfairly competed with bowen.currie medical,at.after that case was dismissed,currie sued bowen in state court claiming that bowen breached the distributorship contract and fraudulently induced currie to enter into it.ibid.the appellate court affirmed the granting of bowen summary judgment motion.ibid.it agreed with the trial court that currie claims were barred under the compulsory statute because they were logically related to bowen federal claims,in that both claims concerned the parties relationship under,and performance of,the distributorship contract.id.at.
in contrast to currie medical,the claims in the tat complaint and the claims in the zf neither involved the same relationship nor the operation of the same enterprise.stated broadly,the claims in the zf concerned the operation of,and alleged fiduciary duty breaches of,a director of zf devices tat in or prior to.in contrast,tat claims concerned a different entity zf solutions prosecution of a lawsuit against nsc and the distribution of the settlement proceeds of that lawsuit in alleged breach of a agreement between tat and zf solutions.align technology,supra,th at,plaintiff breach of contract and conversion claims against former employee were logically related to latter in prior wrongful termination action saunders new capital for small businesses,d,counterclaim held compulsory because it and prior claim arose out of same fiduciary relationship between the parties.
therefore,although we construe the relatedness requirement of section a broadly to effectuate its purpose to avoid a multiplicity of actions align technology,supra,th at,we conclude that zf is permissive because the claim is not one that arises out of the same transaction,occurrence,or series of transactions or occurrences as the cause of action which tat allege d in its complaint,subd.c.
b.the zf was not 
introduction 
having concluded that the zf was permissive,we address whether the trial court properly held that the tolling doctrine was inapplicable and that therefore,the filing date did not relate back to the date tat filed its complaint.if the tolling doctrine applied to zf,then it would be deemed filed when tat filed its complaint february.in that case,the was asserted less than four years after the claim arose,because the alleged conduct resulting in harm occurred prior to february,when zf devices ceased operations.see thomson,supra,th at.accordingly,if the tolling doctrine applied to the zf,the court erred by ordering a bifurcated trial on tat statute of limitations defense to that.
the applicability of the tolling doctrine to permissive is not free of doubt.the author of one treatise states that the tolling doctrine applies broadly to all the statute is a bar to the defendant affirmative claim only if the period has already run when the complaint is filed.the filing of the complaint suspends the statute during the pendency of the action,and the defendant may set up his or her claim by appropriate pleading at any time.citations.witkin,cal.procedure ed.actions.but authors from two practice guides state that the tolling doctrine is limited to compulsory a that is related to the plaintiff complaint,a compulsory relates back to when the action was commenced for statute of limitations purposes.citations.weil and brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group,original italics weil and brown see also rylaarsdam and turner,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial statutes of limitations the rutter group,rylaarsdam and turner the filing of the original complaint tolls or suspends the statute of limitations as to any against plaintiff arising out of the same contract,transaction,matter,happening or accident upon which plaintiff action is brought,a compulsory.and the authors of the latter practice guide have noted that whether the tolling doctrine applies to permissive is an open question.see rylaarsdam and turner,supra,at.
the parties have failed to identify any published decisions and we are unaware of any in which an appellate court has affirmatively held that the tolling doctrine either does or does not apply to permissive.prior to,the statutory scheme provided for two,rather distinct,pleadings,the counterclaim and the.the was previously more narrowly defined and the compulsory statute did not exist.because the tolling doctrine originated in case law,we necessarily make a brief detour to outline prior law concerning counterclaims and to place these cases in context with the present statute.
former counterclaim and statutes 
under former section,the counterclaim was a claim by the defendant against the plaintiff that tended to diminish or defeat the plaintiff recovery.terry trading barsky cal,terry trading.the statute originally provided that the counterclaim was restricted to claims arising out of the contract or transaction set forth in the complaint.howell,counterclaims and in california,howell.but the statute was amended in to broaden the scope of relief.stats,ch,see howell,supra,at.after,as long as the counterclaim fulfilled the requirements of tending to diminish or defeat the plaintiff recovery and involving only parties to the action,it was allowable,regardless of whether the claim related to the plaintiff cause of action.terry trading,at.the legislative intent of the amendment to avoid multiplicity of suits and to have all conflicting claims between the parties settled in a single action was most clearly manifested.id.at.a defendant could seek affirmative relief by way of counterclaim,which might not only defeat plaintiff recovery but could result in an affirmative judgment for defendant on his counterclaim.id.at.the counterclaim was restricted to mutual and reciprocal the counterclaim could be set up only by a defendant and against a plaintiff between whom a several judgment might be rendered.clark lesher cal d.and former section the precursor to the compulsory statute at issue here required that a counterclaim arising out of the transaction alleged in the complaint be pleaded in the action if it were not set up,it was barred.brunswig drug springer d.
the,in its former version as stated in former section,was intended to allow claims related to the complaint to be asserted by a defendant against any party unlike the counterclaim,which was restricted to a defendant claims against the plaintiff.after the statute was amended in see stats,ch,the former could be asserted against any third party.see carey cusack d.under the old statute,there was a very shadowy line of distinction between a and a counterclaim and a considerable area in which they overlap ped.schrader neville cal d.
in,significant changes to california statutes,recommended by the law revision commission cal.law com.report,et,were enacted by the legislature see stats,ch,see et the counterclaim was abolished,and any claim heretofore asserted by counterclaim would be asserted by.under the new statute,the defendant or could assert in the any cause of action against any of the parties who filed the complaint or against him or her,regardless of whether such claims were related to those upon which the suit was brought,subd.a.where the was brought against any other person,the cause of action had to be one that ar o se out of the same transaction,occurrence,or series of transactions or occurrences as the cause brought against him or her or assert ed a claim,right,or interest in the property or controversy which was the subject of the cause brought against him or her,subd.b.the prior compulsory counterclaim rule see former was eliminated with the abolition of that form of pleading,and the new law created a compulsory statute,providing that the failure of a party sued to allege in a any related cause of action which at the time of serving his or her answer to the complaint he or she ha d against the plaintiff would result in the preclusion of that claim in any other action,subd.a.
tolling cases 
in an early case under the former statutory scheme,the california supreme court enunciated and applied the tolling doctrine to permit a counterclaim where the limitations period would have otherwise run after the filing of the complaint but before the filing of the counterclaim.see whittier visscher cal.whittier.there,in the defendants answer to a suit to recover on a promissory note,a was alleged against the plaintiff assignor based upon stockholder liability for indebtedness of the corporation.id.at.the trial court rejected that counterclaim,inter alia,on the basis that it was.in addressing the defendants challenge to that decision,the supreme court held it is conceded that the counterclaim was not so barred when the original action was begun,and the authorities in this state seem to be agreed that,if the right of action relied on was alive at the commencement of the suit,the statute does not run against it,when,as in this case,the full statutory period has expired thereafter during the pendency of the action and before the claim is pleaded as a.citations if a counterclaim or is not barred at the commencement of the action in which it is pleaded,it does not become so barred afterward during the pendency of that action,and in pleading the statute of limitations to a counterclaim it must be shown that the bar of the statute had matured when the original action was commenced,and it is not sufficient to aver a bar when the counterclaim was filed.id.at see also perkins west coast lumber cal,perkins the filing of the complaint suspends the running of the statute of limitations on a counterclaim not when the action was commenced.
likewise,in jones mortimer cal d jones one of the main cases relied on by zf the high court considered whether a counterclaim,which was unrelated to the claim alleged in the complaint,was barred by the statute of limitations.the plaintiff had sued an insolvent financial institution,california mutual building and loan association,and the state building and loan commissioner for services rendered to.id.at.the plaintiff obtained a judgment,and the commissioner approved his claim in liquidation with a reduction by the amount of an unliquidated assessment due from plaintiff because,as a shareholder,he was obligated to pay a pro rata share of indebtedness.ibid.the plaintiff refused to accept the reduced amount,and filed a proceeding to obtain a writ of execution to enforce the judgment.ibid.the plaintiff appealed from an order denying his petition to enforce the judgment.
at the outset,the supreme court in jones rejected the plaintiff contention that the commissioner failure to file the counterclaim prior to the plaintiff obtaining a judgment barred the counterclaim under the compulsory counterclaim statute former section.it concluded that the plaintiff claim and the counterclaim did not arise out of the same transaction,even giving the broadest meaning to that term.jones,supra,cal d at.the court then addressed whether the counterclaim was.it reiterated tolling doctrine principles,concluding that t he statute of limitations is not available to plaintiff as to defendants counterclaim if the period has not run on it at the time of commencement of plaintiff action even though it has run when the counterclaim is pleaded.citations.jones,supra,cal d at see also union sugar hollister estate cal d,union sugar defendant counterclaim and setoff for breach of farming contract not because filing of the complaint operated to suspend the running of the statute of limitations as to any counterclaim holtzendorff housing authority of the city of los angeles d,holtzendorff employer counterclaim for monies paid to reimburse employee for defense costs in case arising out of actions taken during employment not under jones,it was deemed filed on filing date of complaint goodwin alston d,goodwin citing jones,holding that counterclaim based upon usurious loan was not barred by statute of limitations,where statute had not run at time complaint to foreclose on loan was filed.
tolling cases 
we are unaware of any case that has specifically held that the tolling doctrine applies to permissive,as well as compulsory,as are defined under section et.in,the supreme court in a footnote,citing whittier,supra,cal.at page,described the tolling doctrine broadly ordinarily the statute of limitations will bar a in the same fashion as if the defendant had brought an independent action,unless the original complaint was filed before the statute of limitations on the had elapsed.citations.liberty mut.ins.fales cal d,fn.see also id.at dis,sullivan,a is not barred if the period of limitation has not already run on the cause of action by the time the complaint is filed.and while jones,supra,cal d,has been cited by intermediate appellate courts in several decisions,those courts,for the most part,have recited the rule stated in jones with a significant,unexplained,revision limiting the tolling doctrine to with claims related to those alleged in the complaint.
tat chiefly relies on trindade superior court d trindade in support of its position that the tolling doctrine applies only to compulsory in that accident case,jacolink,the driver of one car,timely sued trindade,the driver of the second car,for personal injuries.id.at.more than two years after the accident and after receiving leave of court,trindade filed a for personal injuries against jacolink.ibid.the trial court sustained jacolink demurrer to the without leave to amend,concluding that trindade claim was barred by the statute of limitations.id.at.the appellate court granted trindade petition for writ of mandate,concluding the trial court had erred.it reasoned it has consistently been held that the commencement of an action tolls the statute of limitations as to a defendant then unbarred cause of action against the plaintiff,relating to or depending upon the contract,transaction,matter,happening or accident upon which the action is brought,see code civ.id.at,italics added.
we conclude for several reasons that it is inappropriate to rely on trindade for the proposition that the tolling doctrine applies only to compulsory.first,although one might potentially read trindade as supporting that proposition,the underlying facts make it clear that it was concerned with what is now a compulsory.any purported holding in trindade that the tolling doctrine is inapplicable to permissive was merely dictum.an opinion is not authority for propositions not considered.citation.kinsman unocal cal th,kinsman.second,the passage of trindade quoted above purportedly limiting the tolling doctrine to related was from former section.that statute defined under the version of the code of civil procedure.as noted above,before,were permissible only if they related to the underlying action,while counterclaims after had no such relatedness requirement.see royal,supra,d at.the quoted passage in trindade may thus be viewed as describing the characteristics of the under former section,rather than as a statement that the tolling doctrine does not apply to unrelated.third,although the trindade court noted that the statutory changes were inapplicable because they became effective for cases filed on or after july,and the complaint was filed before that date trindade,supra,at see stats,ch,this begs the question of whether trindade pleading was in fact a.since the pleading was governed by the former code,it was,in fact,a counterclaim,because it was one against the plaintiff that tended to diminish plaintiff claim accordingly,trindade was governed by former section,including the jones court enunciation of the tolling doctrine applicable to counterclaims.
subsequent cases following trindade contain similar language and are relied upon by tat for the proposition that the tolling doctrine does not apply to permissive.they,like trindade,are equally unpersuasive.for example,in sidney superior court d,sidney,after the plaintiff sued sidney for personal injuries and property damage and sidney against the plaintiff and his employer,the trial court denied sidney later motion to amend his to allege a personal injury claim arising out of the same automobile accident,concluding
