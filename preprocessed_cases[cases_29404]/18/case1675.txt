two minor children,who reside in connecticut,own of the stock of a delaware corporation.the father of those minor children voted that stock to gain operational control of that corporation without having first been appointed as guardian of his children estate property.a connecticut statute requires the appointment of a guardian of a minor estate where a parent receives or uses property of the minor child having a value exceeding the value of the minor children shares exceeds.the sole question of substance on this appeal is whether the father voting of the minor children shares constituted a use of those shares within the meaning of the connecticut guardianship statute,thus requiring the appointment of a guardian of the minor children estate to vote the shares.we hold that the father voting of those shares constituted a use of the shares within the meaning of that statute.as a consequence,the voting of the children shares by anyone other than a guardian was invalid,with the result that less than a majority of the corporation shares were validly voted and the written consent action had no legal force.because the court of chancery reached a contrary result,we reverse and remand.
the plaintiff,rich,rich,is a minority stockholder of rich realty,realty,a corporation that is the subject of the control fight in this action.the court of chancery determined that richard gray gray,his adult daughter,carson gray and his brother,david gray properly voted a majority of realty outstanding shares,thereby validly electing themselves as the de jure directors and officers of realty on or about december,realty was served with an action by consent of the shareholders of rich realty,in which gray,and carson gray were elected as the new directors of realty the shareholder consent.realty was also served with an action by unanimous consent of the directors of rich realty,whereby gray,carson gray,david gray and another person were appointed as realty new officers.in both written consents,gray,voted his minor children shares,which represented of realty outstanding stock.
thereafter,rich,as a realty stockholder,brought this action under.in the court of chancery.rich sought a declaratory judgment that gray,consent action to remove realty incumbent directors and officers,and to elect himself and his relatives as realty sole directors and officers,was invalid.the basis for rich claim was that under connecticut law,only a guardian of the property of gray,minor children could lawfully vote the children stock for that purpose.on november,after a trial,the court of chancery issued a memorandum opinion determining that gray had properly voted his minor children shares,that the written consents were legally effective,and that gray,his daughter,and his brother were properly elected as realty de jure directors and officers 
rich appeals from the judgment implementing that opinion.upon reviewing the record and the applicable authorities,we conclude that in ruling that no guardian was required,the court of chancery reversibly erred.
the parties 
rich,whose principal place of business is newark,delaware,is a manufacturer and distributor of custom vinyl windows and aluminum storm products for the remodeling and new construction markets.rich owns shares,or,of realty outstanding shares,for which rich paid million.rich also leases space from realty in newark.until the date that gray,purported to remove them by the written consents,rich two officers,richard rebmann and george simmons,were the officers of realty as well.
realty,the other corporate party,was formed on july,for the sole purpose of facilitating the acquisition of the newark,delaware property upon which rich constructed the building that it now leases from realty.that property and the lease revenue it earns represent realty only assets.
as noted above,rich owns shares of realty.gray,owns no stock in realty and never has.realty other shareholders are jepsco,adelia and richard gray,who are gray minor children by gray former wife,sabele foster josslyn gray,who is gray niece and the minor daughter of david gray and carson gray,who is gray,adult daughter by a previous marriage.the chart below sets forth realty shareholders other than rich and their respective shareholdings 
the shares of the minor children,adelia and richard gray,have been at all times owned outright and held in the children own names the issuance of those shares to the minor children was not a gift under the connecticut or any other uniform transfers to minors act.
gray,the other principal actor,is a new york resident,and was an attorney and a member of the new york state bar until his disbarment in.in an unrelated proceeding,gray,served two years in prison as a result of being held in contempt by the supreme court of new york.he also pled guilty to bankruptcy and tax fraud in the united states district court for the eastern district of missouri.and,in,the united states district court for delaware,per court now third circuit court of appeals judge kent jordan,held gray,liable for approximately million for acts of corporate malfeasance 
gray efforts in to vote his minor children realty shares 
as noted,the dispute here concerns whether,at the time he executed the shareholder consent,gray,was lawfully authorized to vote his minor children realty shares.although the shares owned by gray two minor children did not represent an absolute majority interest in realty,those shares were indispensable to anyone seeking to obtain voting control hence,starting in,gray made various attempts to obtain and exercise the power to vote his minor children realty shares.
first,in august,gray,notified rich by letter that he had exercised,on behalf of his minor children,a written consent by holders of in excess of of the outstanding capital stock in lieu of meeting.that consent was also signed by carson gray in her individual capacity.in the shareholder consent,the minor children through gray and carson gray purported to remove the existing directors of realty,and to replace them with gray,david gray,and carson gray,as realty new directors.those persons also executed a written action and consent of directors in lieu of a meeting of the board of directors,wherein they purported to discharge the current slate of officers and elect themselves respectively as realty president,secretary,and treasurer.gray,then instructed the allegedly removed directors and officers to turn over certain company books and records in their possession.
in response,rich,through its officers,rebmann and simmons,questioned the validity of the shareholder consent,noting that none of the signatures on that consent had been verified or separately corroborated.rich requested corroboration of the authenticity of the signatures.correspondence between gray,and rich then ensued.in a letter dated september,on realty letterhead on which gray,signed as the president of realty,gray,promised to provide evidence verifying the signatures appearing on the shareholder consent.thereafter,gray,provided what he represented were notarized certificates of the shareholders confirming and verifying their respective signatures.the certificate that was signed by gray and dated october,stated 
as the father of both adelia gray and richard gray,i have full legal right and authority to take various actions on their respective behalves,including,without limitation,the execution and delivery to all parties whom i deem necessary appropriate,of all such legal and other documents as i may deem necessary appropriate to protect their respective legal rights and interests in respect of all property owned by each of them.
on or about october,rich responded by letter,rejecting gray,claim that he had authority to speak for his minor children,and inviting gray,to provide additional evidence of his authority to act on their behalf in this matter.gray,never responded.instead,he abandoned his efforts to take control of realty in reliance upon the shareholder consent,and sought to achieve that goal in a different way.
gray,effort to be appointed as the guardian of his minor children estates 
during,gray,was involved in a contested divorce proceeding with his,sabele foster,in the connecticut superior court.the divorce proceeding was not resolved until december,under circumstances that are later described.
while the divorce proceeding was ongoing,gray,attempted a second strategy to obtain the right to vote his minor children realty shares.in july,he filed in the probate court for the state of connecticut a petition seeking his appointment as guardian of his minor children estates,specifically their realty shares.a guardian ad litem on behalf of the minor children the guardian was then appointed.on august,the guardian filed with the connecticut probate court a report the report responding to the petition on behalf of the minor children.in her report,the guardian stated 
i have also spoken with sabele foster,gray.foster expressed serious concerns regarding gray being given control of their children money she reports that their marital settlement is still being negotiated in middlesex superior court and that one of the issues being discussed in superior court is the same issue as petitioned for here.she also reports that gray is currently suing her in new york state regarding the property that was awarded her in middlesex superior court.she reports that both she and her elderly parents currently have to contest this action at great cost and that the money being used in that lawsuit to fight over this property in new york is also money that would be better used toward the children college costs.
foster also expressed concerns regarding gray daughter carson due to events that have occurred in the past.she believes that carson will essentially work solely for gray interests and that gray brother david would not be a neutral party either.she has concerns that having gray,his daughter carson a stockholder and his brother david the father of another stockholder appointed as directors of realty would give them the ability to do anything they wish with adelia and teddy money.she suspects that choices might be made that would not be in the children best interests.she believes that gray,carson,and david have significant conflicts of interest in this matter.essentially,foster does not wish for gray to control their children money.
the guardian also discussed in some detail her concerns regarding gray,ability to discharge faithfully his fiduciary duties as guardian of his minor children property 
the undersigned has obtained a copy of judge elaine gordon decision at the dissolution hearing on august.judge gordon found gray to be less than forthcoming in his financial disclosure,in fact she found there to be almost no disclosure even after thirteen months of notice.the only evidence before the court that date was an unsworn financial affidavit filed by gray,hence the court financial findings were all estimates based on what little evidence was before it according to his unsworn financial affidavit,gray claimed to be making per year,yet the expenses he had paid that year,not counting legal costs for his dissolution attorney,criminal defense attorney,and business attorneys,were.hence the court assigned him a higher earning capacity.one of gray financial affidavits in the dissolution file showed an outstanding debt of approximately million dollars.
the guardian concluded her report thusly 
gray maintains that he simply wishes to protect his children interests via this petition if what he is alleging is indeed true,then it makes sense for him to wish to gain control of this corporation to protect his children interests.unfortunately however,there is evidence in the dissolution file that gray has been less than truthful in the past,particularly as pertaining to business matters the undersigned does not feel therefore,that she can formulate what is in the children best interests by simply relying on gray statements.and although i have no doubt that gray is an accomplished business person,there is evidence in the dissolution file that his choices regarding business deals in the past apparently led to incarceration however,i have been appointed to represent the children interests,and must do so with whatever evidence is before me.gray has provided no evidence other than verbal allegations.in light of the history and circumstances of this case,i would need more as a representative for the children best interests i am hesitant to recommend that gray be made guardian of his children estate,especially when these estates may involve significant assets and gray shows evidence of significant personal debt 
shortly after the guardian report was submitted,gray,withdrew his application to be appointed as guardian of his minor children estates.that,however,did not deter his effort to obtain the right to vote his children realty shares.gray,merely adopted a different strategy,which gave rise to this lawsuit.
gray.negotiates a stipulation with his former wife as the basis to assert his power to vote his minor children shares 
as the guardian reported to the connecticut superior court,gray,was suing his former wife,foster,in new york over property she had been awarded in the divorce proceeding.according to the report,foster and her elderly parents were contesting that lawsuit at considerable personable expense.ultimately,gray,and foster negotiated a settlement that was embodied in a formal stipulation executed on september,the stipulation.in that stipulation,gray,dismissed the new york litigation and conferred other benefits upon foster in exchange for which foster agreed not to oppose or object to any effort by gray,to pursue the minor children rights in their realty shares,including the right to vote those shares.the critical portion of that stipulation provides that 
gray,will have the right to pursue,and will pursue without any active involvement on the part of foster,the rights of the minor children adelia and teddy richard gray,by virtue of their respective ownerships of the capital stock of rich realty.at foster request,gray,shall keep foster or a representative designated by foster periodically advised as to the status of his efforts on the children behalf.foster will not oppose any motions or other court proceedings initiated by gray,on behalf of the children,for the purpose of pursuing the aforementioned rights on behalf of the minor children and will execute any documents necessary to such pursuit with respect thereto as requested by gray,or his representatives.gray,will indemnify and hold foster harmless from and against any liability or other obligations relating to his efforts on behalf of the minor children and any document execution sic by foster.
the shareholder consents and the purported change of control 
three months later,on or about december,the shareholder consent executed on november,by gray,on behalf of his minor children,was served on the registered agent of realty.the shareholder signed by david gray on behalf of his minor child,josslyn gray and by carson gray in her individual to oust realty current directors and to elect gray,and carson gray as the new realty board.
realty was also served with an action by unanimous consent of the directors of rich realty,dated november,in which gray,and carson gray purported to terminate the incumbent officers of realty and among other things to appoint gray,as president and treasurer and carson gray as vice president.by letter dated december,counsel for carson gray informed richard rebmann and george simmons that they were terminated as officers of,and were no longer authorized to speak for,realty.
in response,rich again demanded proof of gray,authority to act on behalf of his minor children.gray,then furnished rich with a redacted copy of the stipulation.it is undisputed,and the court of chancery found,that the connecticut superior stipulation is the sole basis of gray,claim of authority to exercise the right to vote his minor children realty stock 
the action and the court of chancery rulings 
after receiving service of the shareholder consent,on january,rich brought this action under,seeking a declaration that the consent was invalid,and a determination of the de jure directors and officers of realty.rich principal claim was that the written consents were invalid because gray,lacked the authority under connecticut law to vote his children shares.rich advanced several arguments in support of that claim.specifically,rich contended that a foster had no right under connecticut law to assign or transfer her children voting rights to gray,in the stipulation b the order approving the stipulation exceeded the connecticut superior court jurisdiction,for which reason that order was not entitled to full faith and credit c the stipulation did not appoint gray,as guardian for the estate of his minor children and d in all events,the voting of the minor children stock by gray,constituted a use of their stock that triggered the connecticut statutory requirement that gray,first be appointed as guardian of his children estate 
the court of chancery rejected all these arguments.holding that both written consents were valid,the court ruled that as a stranger to the divorce proceedings and having no legally protected interest adversely affected,rich had no standing under connecticut law and,therefore,no standing in this case collaterally to challenge the validity of the stipulation even if rich had standing,the connecticut superior court did not exceed its jurisdiction by entering the order approving the stipulation which,therefore,was entitled to full faith and credit the stipulation neither transferred nor assigned to gray,the voting rights in his children shares.because gray,and foster,as parents of the minor children,could lawfully have voted the shares on their children behalf,the only effect of the stipulation was to bind foster contractually to her decision not to exercise her right to vote those shares or oppose gray,exercising that voting right on their children behalf and gray voting his minor children realty shares did not constitute a use of a valuable asset of the children that triggered the requirement,under the connecticut guardianship statute,that a guardian of the children estate be appointed.
this appeal followed.
analysis of the claims of error 
on appeal,rich claims that the vice chancellor committed reversible error by determining that i rich lacked standing to collaterally attack the stipulation ii the connecticut superior court did not exceed its jurisdiction when entering the order approving the stipulation iii that order was entitled to full faith and credit iv the stipulation did not confer upon gray,any voting rights that he,as the minor children parent,did not already have and v gray,voting of his minor children shares was not a use of his children property that required the prior appointment of a guardian of the children estate under connecticut law.because the facts material to these claims are uncontroverted,the issues presented are all essentially questions of law that this court reviews de novo 
having considered the issues raised on this appeal,we conclude that only the fifth presents an issue of substance.the substantive issue is whether the connecticut guardianship statute,as applied to these facts,required the appointment of a guardian of the estates of the minor children before their realty stock could be voted in the manner set forth in the shareholder consent.rich other four claims are procedural,in that they involve a collateral attack upon the connecticut superior court order approving the stipulation.those procedural claims are readily disposed of,because they rest on an incorrect premise.for that reason we first address the collateral attack issues and then turn separately to the remaining issue of substance.
preliminarily,we note that the basis of this action is,a statute that empowers the court of chancery to determine the validity of any election,appointment,removal or resignation of any director or officer of a delaware corporation,and the right of any person to hold or continue to hold such office section also authorizes inquiry into the validity of actions taken by written consent the scope of a section action,however,is not unlimited,and embraces only issues that are pertinent to determining the validity of the election in this case,the validity of the written consents themselves.
the collateral attack issues 
rich first contests the court of chancery determination that rich lacked standing to attack collaterally the stipulation and the connecticut superior court order approving it.the vice chancellor held that rich had no standing to attack that order under connecticut law,because rich was not a party to,and had no cognizable interest in,that proceeding.consequently,rich also lacked standing to mount that collateral attack in a section chancery proceeding.that ruling is correct as a matter of both connecticut and delaware law.
as the vice chancellor correctly held,i n connecticut a person not a party to prior divorce proceedings has no standing to attack collaterally the divorce decree where the person has no legally protected interest adversely affected by the decree itself at the time it was rendered.noting that the delaware law on standing is similar the vice chancellor concluded that in this case 
rich failed to identify any legally protected interest it had in the stipulation between foster and gray when the connecticut superior court granted it rich was a stranger to the divorce proceedings and had no interest in the divorce or standing to participate in those proceedings.furthermore rich challenge to the stipulation is not based on a wrong committed against it 
in the alternative,the court of chancery ruled that even if rich had standing to attack collaterally the superior court order approving the stipulation,the attack had no merit.that alternative ruling is also correct.
rich claims that,in approving the stipulation,the connecticut superior court exceeded its jurisdiction.the stipulation,therefore,was not entitled to full faith and credit,and the court of chancery erred in holding otherwise.rich argument runs as follows the stipulation was ultra vires,because it conferred upon gray,the power to vote their minor children realty power that neither gray,nor foster could exercise without first being appointed guardian s of their children estate.by approving the stipulation,the connecticut superior court implicitly validated gray,and foster status as guardians.the superior court had no power to do that,because only the connecticut probate court is empowered to appoint a guardian of a minor estate.the connecticut superior court having had no jurisdiction to approve the stipulation,the vice chancellor erred by according the stipulation legal force and effect in this section action.
this argument fails for two separate,though interrelated,reasons.first,it rests on the erroneous premise that the stipulation transferred or assigned to gray.foster power to vote the minor children realty shares.in fact,the stipulation did no such thing.it merely documented and rendered enforceable foster promise not to interfere with,or oppose,any efforts by gray,to pursue their minor children rights including voting rights in the realty shares.as the vice chancellor pointed out,both parents already possessed the right to vote the realty shares on their minor children behalf,subject only to the connecticut guardianship statute,if applicable.thus,the premise that the stipulation transferred or assigned to gray,the children voting rights in the stock is unfounded.
second,rich collateral attack argument rests upon the premise that the connecticut superior court order approving the stipulation operated as a sub silentio appointment of gray,as guardian of his minor children estate.that premise is also unfounded,because it mischaracterizes the order.the only effect of that order was to approve a negotiated settlement of the connecticut divorce proceeding.that any court having jurisdiction over a dispute is empowered to approve a binding settlement of that dispute,is a proposition so basic as to require no citation.no party disputes that the connecticut superior court possessed jurisdiction to adjudicate issues relating to the divorce of gray,and foster,and the vice chancellor correctly so recognized 
for the above reasons,the court of chancery properly rejected rich collateral attack upon the stipulation and the connecticut superior court order approving it,and accorded the stipulation the full faith and credit to which it was entitled under connecticut law.the vice chancellor also correctly determined that neither the stipulation nor the order created or vested in gray,any voting rights that he,as the minor children parent,did not already possess.as a consequence,only one substantive legal issue remained for decision whether in these specific circumstances,connecticut statutory law required that gray,be appointed as guardian for his minor children estate s before he could lawfully exercise his parental right to vote their realty shares in the manner set forth in the shareholder consent.the court of chancery answered that question in the negative.therefore,the only issue left for us to decide is whether in so ruling the court of chancery erred.that issue being one of statutory construction,our review is de novo 
the merits of rich guardianship claim 
we first pause to place rich guardianship claim into its proper legal context.connecticut law distinguishes between two types of guardianship for minors a guardian of a minor person and a guardian of a minor estate.a guardian of the person has the right to custody and responsibility for the care of the minor.under section of the connecticut statute,the father and mother of a minor child are automatically recognized as joint guardians of the person of the minor.a guardian of the estate manages the property of the minor,other than property managed under the uniform transfers to minors act.the statutory sections that govern guardianships of a minor estate,however,contain no provision parallel to section that would recognize the father and mother as the default joint guardians of a minor estate 
the basis for rich only a guardian may lawfully vote the minor children realty shares as set forth in the shareholder connecticut general statutes section a section a.that statute pertinently provides 
a parent of a minor,guardian of the person of a minor or spouse of a minor shall not receive or use any property belonging to the minor in an amount exceeding ten thousand dollars in value unless appointed guardian of the estate of the minor,except that such parent,guardian or spouse may hold property as a custodian under the provisions of the uniform transfers to minors act without being so appointed 
it is undisputed that the value of the property at issue the minor children realty shares exceeds,and that gray,minor children have never held their realty shares subject to the uniform transfers to minors act.thus,the legal issue narrows to whether gray,voting his minor children shares to oust realty incumbent directors,and to elect himself and his adult daughter as realty directors and officers,constituted a use of the minor children realty shares under section a.we hold that it was.
first,we agree with the court of chancery construction of the term use in section a.the vice chancellor correctly noted that v ery few cases have interpreted this section,and in particular,the phrase receive or use,but 
in each of those cases,however,a court appointed a guardian of the estate of the minor where a minor was entitled to financial or real property through the court system and where underlying policy required procedural protections to ensure proper oversight.connecticut courts have held,for example,that a parent must obtain court approval to settle a personal injury claim by a minor if the amount of that claim exceeds.similarly,a court must appoint a guardian of the estate when a minor receives monetary damages resulting from a personal injury claim.though a minor is entitled to full enjoyment and immediate possession,the use of the injury recovery must be exercised by a guardian of the estate.the probate court will appoint a guardian of the estate when a minor child obtains a tort recovery to ensure that the award is conserved for its proper purposes or receives monies through probate.connecticut courts do not apply to child support because they treat that as a payment to the mother and not as the minor child property.
as the vice chancellor recognized,connecticut cases distinguish between the parent right to i bring or prosecute a money damages action on a minor child behalf and ii to receive or use the monetary recovery resulting from that action.thus,in lametta connecticut light power the connecticut court,construing an earlier version of section a,rejected the argument that the potential recovery was sufficiently high as to require that a father be appointed as guardian of his minor child estate in order to prosecute a lawsuit on the child behalf.observing that the statute did not preclude an action by a next friend under common law,and that the powers and responsibilities of a next friend and those of a guardian of the estate were the same,the connecticut court upheld the father standing to pursue his minor child claims.thus,the vice chancellor concluded,under lametta,i t is only upon the date of a judgment in the minor favor that the rights must be exercised by an appointed guardian of the estate.
doe city of waterbury also addressed by the court of chancery,further illuminates the distinction between prosecuting a lawsuit on a minor behalf which does not require appointment of a guardian of the minor estate and receiving or using the proceeds of that lawsuit which does.doe was a tort action filed in federal court by jane doe and susan roe on behalf of their respective minor children.thereafter,the connecticut superior court appointed the commissioner of the department of children and their families as legal guardian of the person of the children.the commissioner,as guardian,sought to intervene in the federal court action and to be substituted for doe and roe,claiming that the parents would wrongfully obtain or misuse any recovery.denying the motion,the federal court concluded that section a afforded sufficient protection against any misuse of funds by the parents,since a guardian of the minor estate would have to be appointed before the receipt of any recovery.
summarizing the teaching of these cases,and of an earlier case,ryle reedy the vice chancellor accurately concluded that the case law reflected the connecticut courts concern that in certain situations there is a greater risk that the holder of a minor property will fail to use it for its proper purpose.accordingly,the connecticut courts have required the appointment of a guardian for the estate of a minor when a liquid asset,such as cash,is received.
applying this teaching to the facts at bar would have been had this case involved gray,bringing a lawsuit seeking a monetary recovery on behalf of his minor children.but,it does not.rather,this case involves a father effort to vote his minor children stock to place himself and his close relatives in control of a corporation,of whose shares are owned by the minor children.neither the parties nor the court of chancery could identify any connecticut case addressing the applicability of section a to voting rights in corporate stock.the question to reiterate is whether the voting of the children shares in these circumstances was a use by the father of the minor children property for purposes of section a 
the court of chancery analogized gray,voting the shares to his bringing a suit on behalf of his minor children as next friend.reasoning from that analogical premise,the vice chancellor held that the same policy that justifies allowing a next friend suit to proceed without appointing a guardian for the minor estate warrants the conclusion that gray ability to vote the stock in realty of his minor children does not represent a use of a valuable asset of theirs under section a.the court of chancery reasoned that 
unlike many of the connecticut cases,gray,situation does not contemplate the transfer of a liquid asset from an outside or third party to a minor,such as was involved in the ryle case here,the stocks and the economic interest in them have always been and remain in the children names rich primary concern seems to be that gray,will misuse the children voting rights to benefit hims
