gregory agnew sought habeas corpus relief from his conviction for armed robbery in illinois state court twelve years ago.in addition to a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel,agnew maintained that the illinois trial court should have granted him a mistrial when the state called as a substantive witness of his guilt the bailiff who had been in charge of the jury throughout the first part of his trial.the district court found that agnew could not show that he was prejudiced by the bailiff testimony,and that his attorney decisions were reasonable under the circumstances,and thus the court denied habeas relief.because the prejudice of the bailiff testimony is inherent under relevant supreme court precedent,we reverse and remand.
agnew was charged with armed robbery for allegedly hitting a man over the head with a garden hoe,and taking a dollar from him in an altercation at a gas station.agnew intended to admit at trial that he was involved in an altercation with the victim,carlos duarte,but planned to testify that the fight concerned who had the right to use a prepaid gas pump,and that duarte delivered the first blow.agnew denied that he took any money from duarte or that he intended to take any money from him.the state challenge was to show that agnew was motivated by robbery and that he,not duarte,was the attacker.in order to prove all of the elements of robbery as opposed to battery,the state also was required to show that agnew in fact took money from duarte.
the trial began on june,after hearing motions in limine,the trial court asked the bailiff,deputy fred house,to direct the prospective jurors into their seats in the courtroom.the court began conducting voir dire,but before all the jurors were selected,the court called a recess at noon for lunch.at,the court reconvened and completed jury selection.after another brief recess,the trial commenced at approximately.the state presented three witnesses that afternoon in support of the charge.throughout this portion of the trial,deputy house performed all the duties of a bailiff,including ushering the jury in and out of the courtroom.
the first witness,sandra hill,testified that she,tommy miller,derrick lovelace,bay walls and agnew were all at the home of haakeem adu on the night in question.everyone present was drinking beer and wine,and although the record does not reveal whether they were intoxicated,that would be a reasonable inference to draw from their behavior that night.in the wee hours of the morning,agnew began arguing with miller,and they went outside to fight.after the fight,miller noticed he was missing in cash and some heroin.hill,miller,walls and agnew searched unsuccessfully for the missing items,and walls then left the party.shortly thereafter,the remaining revelers began to suspect that walls was the thief and hill,miller,lovelace and agnew went out in lovelace car to look for him.for reasons not revealed in the record,miller placed a garden hoe in the back seat of the car next to agnew.after driving around for some time,and unable to find walls,they stopped at a gas station for snacks at approximately hill testified that at the gas station,agnew said he saw a mexican man coming out of the station with a large amount of cash in his hands,and asked the others in the car if anyone wanted to be in on it.because the other passengers wanted no part of this kind of trouble,they declined,and when agnew got out of the car,they drove away from the station.as they drove away,hill heard a man yell,and she turned and saw agnew hitting a man with the garden hoe.
that man,carlos duarte,was the state next witness.he testified that he stopped for gas on his way to work,and that he went into the station to for five dollars worth of gas with a fifty dollar bill.he placed his change in his shirt pocket as he went outside to pump the gas,but he was hit on the head from behind and fell to the ground.he testified that agnew grabbed him by the collar and demanded money.agnew searched duarte coat pocket,pants pockets and wallet and took a dollar that he found in a pants pocket.he did not find the in duarte shirt pocket.duarte required eight stitches for his injuries.
the last witness in the state was officer herbert browne.he testified that agnew called the police that night to report that lovelace had threatened him with a garden hoe and then had stolen his jacket.browne met with agnew at,and after agnew lodged his complaint,he asked the officer if anyone had reported a robbery in the vicinity of the gas station that night.the officer did not record this inquiry in his official report,presumably because he did not consider it significant at the time.officer browne testimony concluded at on the first day of agnew trial,and the court decided to recess for the day.the jury was sent home for the evening.
the assistant state attorney then informed the court that the bailiff who had been attending the jury,deputy fred house,had come forward to report that on the day agnew was arrested some four months earlier,the deputy had a material conversation with agnew.deputy house had apparently been stationed at the local jail at the time of agnew arrest.the state attorney informed the trial court that agnew told deputy house that he had taken a dollar on the night in question.the state wished to reserve the right to call deputy house as a rebuttal witness if agnew decided to testify in his own defense.acknowledging that a special relationship is engendered by the bailiff caring for the jury,the state requested that the court appoint a different bailiff to attend to the jury for the remainder of the trial.agnew counsel immediately moved for a mistrial.the state opposed the motion,arguing that a mistrial was premature because the state was not certain it would call the deputy to testify.the state also contended that there was no evidence that the jury was improperly influenced,and that no irreparable harm had been done in the mere two hours of testimony that had been taken at that time.agnew counsel maintained that whether or not the deputy had discussed the case with the jury was irrelevant,and that the prejudice was inherent when the person charged with caring for the jury becomes a witness against the accused.
the court agreed that a different bailiff should be appointed to take charge of the jury for the remainder of the trial.agnew counsel declined the court invitation to question the deputy about any conversations he had with the jurors,and the court commented that the deputy contact with the jury at that point was extremely brief.tr.at.finding that there was no long term involvement with the jury as would occur during sequestration,the court denied the motion for a mistrial.tr.at.no one inquired whether the deputy had accompanied the jurors to lunch,or to what extent he had conversed with them about any matter,including the trial.on the next day,the state rested,and agnew took the stand in his own defense.he told a decidedly different story.he testified that he was a passenger in a car with lovelace,miller and hill on the night in question.he claimed he was simply seeking a ride home,but others in the car decided to drive around town looking for places to buy drugs.according to agnew,the group stopped for gas,and lovelace asked him to pump the gas and get rid of the hoe.as lovelace went in to pay,agnew tossed the hoe towards a garbage can but missed.agnew testified that duarte then walked up and attempted to use the pump.they began to argue over who had the right to use the pump,and after duarte kicked agnew in the groin,agnew picked up the hoe and fought back.agnew denied taking any money from duarte.as he fought with duarte,agnew saw lovelace get back in the car and drive away with agnew coat,which was still in the car.agnew then reported the theft of his coat to the police,but did not mention the fight because he feared expulsion from an alcohol rehabilitation program he had voluntarily joined.
the defense rested and the state called deputy house in rebuttal.he testified that he had been working at the lake county jail on the day agnew was arrested.he stated he met agnew during the shift change,and asked agnew,what the fuck are you doing here deputy house testified that agnew replied,it over a dollar.fucked up.this is over one dollar.someone should beat my ass and let me go home.deputy house conceded that he did not write a report of the conversation,and that he did not realize the incident was important until he sat through the first day of trial.at that time,he informed his supervisor and the state attorney about the conversation.
during closing arguments,the state attorney drove home the significance of this jail house conversation,characterizing it as an admission and mentioning it no fewer than six times.tr.at t here no doubt that gregory agnew did it because he admitted to doing it.tr.at fred house just took the stand and told you that he told him that down there in that bullpen on the in the afternoon,he asked him what the heck are you in here for,what are you back for i robbed him.it was over a buck.it was over a fucking dollar.you ought to whip my fucking ass and send me home for a dollar.that what he told him.tr.at and you know he did it because he admitted to it to fred house.tr.at you had the defendant own statement that he took money from duarte.tr.at who is the next person we hear that is talking about a robbery that deputy house and again it a situation where a very general comment was made by deputy house,what are you doing here and what are the defendant words i fucked up at that point he knew he had done something wrong and he says this is over a dollar,but he says more than that,he says all i got was a dollar.you should take me outside and whip me for a dollar.tr.at a nd then finally you got fred house who says the defendant made the comment that all he got was a dollar.after deliberating for minutes,the jury returned a verdict of guilty of the offense of armed robbery.the trial court sentenced agnew to years of imprisonment.
agnew appealed,complaining that the court should have granted a mistrial when the bailiff who attended to the jury was allowed to testify as the sole witness to his alleged confession.agnew further objected to the fact that this witness was not revealed until the middle of the trial.agnew relied mainly on turner louisiana,d,a case we will consider in depth shortly.the illinois appellate court deferred to the trial court statement that the contact between deputy house and the jury was quite limited,and thus the deputy dual role in the courtroom was not prejudicial to agnew.people agnew,d.the appellate court noted that although there was some contact between the bailiff and the jurors,it was nowhere near the continuous and intimate association present in the turner case.id.the court remarked that the record does not indicate what deputy house duties were before and after the jury was impaneled,and that testimony lasted a mere two hours on the first day of trial.moreover,the court commented that t here is no indication that he provided them lunch,provided personal services or had conversations with any of the jurors.the trial judge was closer to the events of the day and a direct observer of the activities in the courtroom.id the court also rejected any argument about prejudice arising from the late identification of deputy house as a witness because the deputy assignment to the courtroom was accidental,and the court took steps to minimize the prejudice to agnew once the situation came to light.the appellate court therefore affirmed the trial court order denying the motion for a mistrial.finally,the court rejected agnew challenges to his sentence,and because he does not raise those issues in his request for habeas corpus review,we will not discuss those issues further.the illinois supreme court subsequently twice denied agnew petitions for leave to appeal to that court.see people agnew,people agnew.agnew therefore exhausted all of his state court remedies before applying for habeas corpus relief in the federal court.
in the district court,agnew filed a petition raising six main issues.see united states ex rel.agnew detella,wl.according to the district court,he procedurally defaulted two of these by failing to raise them in the state courts when he had the opportunity.four claims remained the trial court erred when it denied his motion for a mistrial based on deputy house testimony the prosecutor closing argument was so unfairly prejudicial as to deprive him of a fair trial his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to accept the trial court invitation to question the jurors to determine whether they had been improperly influenced by anything deputy house said or did while they were in his charge and his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to call or interview lovelace and miller,who apparently would have recanted their statements to the police that agnew had invited them to participate in the robbery of duarte.id.the district court rejected the first claim,finding that the situation with deputy house did not deny agnew a fair trial,and that the probative value of the deputy testimony outweighed any prejudice.deferring to the trial court finding that the contact between the deputy and the jury was quite limited,the district court cited the illinois appellate court for the proposition that the deputy did not appear to have conversed with the jurors or provided them with lunch or personal services.wl at.the district court found that because of the limited nature of the contact,agnew case was distinguishable from turner and gonzales beto,d,the two supreme court cases on which agnew relied.the court also found that deputy house was simply one of a number of witnesses who testified against agnew,and that his testimony was by no means a smoking gun that alone indicated his guilt.thus,even if the admission of the deputy testimony was error,the district court found that it was harmless,and did not result in the denial of fundamental fairness.wl at.the district court similarly rejected agnew three other claims,and therefore denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.agnew appeals.
agnew filed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus prior to april,the effective date of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa.because the amendments to the habeas corpus statute contained in that act do not apply,we will analyze agnew claim under the prior law.see lindh murphy,d abrams barnett,cir.prior to the aedpa,federal courts disregarded the state court legal conclusions and reached independent judgments on the issues presented to them,but deferred to the state court findings of fact.koo mcbride,cir.under the standards,the petitioner is entitled to plenary review of his claims.this court may rely on its own jurisprudence as well as the supreme court case law in determining whether the state court conviction of the petitioner is contrary to clearly established federal law.abrams,at.under the scheme,we may look only to the supreme court holdings for that inquiry.
in his appeal,agnew contends that the state trial court should have granted his motion for a mistrial because the trial bailiff was allowed to provide substantive testimony regarding his guilt,contrary to gonzales beto,d and turner louisiana,d.he maintains that all of the courts to review this question erred when they required him to prove he was prejudiced by the bailiff relationship with the jury rather than assume inherent prejudice.he faults the trial court for failing to develop a fact record regarding the bailiff contacts with the jury,and complains that his attorney failure to develop such a record constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.finally,agnew argues that admission of the bailiff testimony was reversible error.he seeks a reversal of the district court refusal to grant the writ of habeas corpus.
more than one hundred years ago,the supreme court recognized and warned against the prejudicial effect of communications between jurors and third parties such as witnesses or court officers.see mattox united states.in that case,clyde mattox faced murder charges in a kansas court.the evidence was entirely circumstantial,but as the jury deliberated,the bailiff,referring to the defendant,told them,this is the third fellow he has killed.at.not surprisingly,the jury returned a verdict of guilty,and mattox was sentenced to death 
the supreme court granted mattox a new trial.after noting the importance in capital cases that the jury should pass upon the case free from external causes tending to disturb the exercise of deliberate and unbiased judgment,the court held 
private communications,possibly prejudicial,between jurors and third persons,or witnesses,or the officer in charge,are absolutely forbidden,and invalidate the verdict,at least unless their harmlessness is made to appear.
at.the court noted a number of cases litigated in the state courts in which the presence of a bailiff in the jury room during deliberations was held fatal to the verdict even without a showing of prejudice or improper influence on the jury.in analyzing the effect of the communication with the bailiff in mattox case,the court stated,nor can it be legitimately contended that the misconduct of the bailiff could have been otherwise than prejudicial.information that this was the third person clyde mattox had killed,coming from the officer in charge,precludes any other conclusion.at.the court thus recognized that the bailiff,an officer of the court,held special sway with the jury.the court found this fact alone sufficient to overturn the verdict,but also ordered a new trial on other grounds as well.
of course,the bailiff in the instant case did not communicate with the jury about agnew guilt during deliberations,but rather testified under oath at trial.the record here reflects no misconduct on the part of deputy house.on the contrary,as soon as he realized the import of his prior conversation with agnew,he spoke to his supervisor and in formed the state attorney about the alleged confession.but even in the absence of misconduct on the part of the testifying deputy,the supreme court has noted the prejudice inherent when a bailiff attending the jury also testifies against the defendant on a substantive matter relating to his guilt.see turner louisiana,d gonzales beto,d.the court set the standards for the analysis in turner.
turner was charged with murder committed during the course of a robbery.after a trial,he was convicted and sentenced to death.the two principal witnesses for the prosecution were the deputies who investigated the murder,arrested and questioned turner,and took his written confession.the jury was sequestered throughout the trial,and was placed in the charge of the sheriff office.as a practical matter,this meant that the jury was continuously in contact with the sheriff deputies,including the two deputies who provided the most damning testimony against turner.these deputies drove the jurors to a restaurant for their meals,transported them to their lodgings each evening,ate with them,conversed with them and ran errands for them.at.there was no evidence regarding what the deputies said to the jurors,except that the deputies themselves testified that they had not discussed the case with any of the jurors.nevertheless,the supreme court held that turner was entitled to a new trial.at.
noting that the right to a jury trial included the right to trial by a panel of impartial,indifferent jurors,the court commented that,in a constitutional sense,trial by jury implies that all of the evidence against the accused will come from the witness stand in a public courtroom where there is full judicial protection of the defendant rights of confrontation,and counsel.at.that evidence necessarily includes the credibility of the witnesses against the defendant.in turner case,the deputies testimony was not confined to some uncontroverted or merely formal aspect of the case,and turner guilt turned on their credibility.although their credibility was challenged in the courtroom,the potentialities of what went on outside the courtroom during the three days of the trial may well have made these courtroom proceedings little more than a hollow formality.at.the court explained that,even assuming the deputies did not discuss the case with jurors,
it would be blinking reality not to recognize the extreme prejudice inherent in this continual association throughout the trial between the jurors and these two key witnesses for the prosecution.we deal here not with a brief encounter,but with a continuous and intimate association throughout a association which gave these witnesses an opportunity to renew old friendships,and make new acquaintances among the members of the jury.
at.indeed,the court found it sufficient reason to overturn the verdict that any two key prosecution witnesses had engaged in this kind of contact with the jury,but the fact that they were deputy sheriffs made the association even more prejudicial.at.t he relationship was one which could not but foster the jurors confidence in those who were their official guardians during the entire period of the trial.id.see also parker gladden,d the official character of the an officer of the court as well as the question carries great weight with a jury which he had been shepherding.the court noted that turner fate depended upon how much confidence the jury placed in these two witnesses,and reversed the judgment.
turner was followed seven years later by a case that even more closely resembles the circumstances of agnew trial.in gonzales beto,gonzales was charged with murder,and the primary witness against him was the county sheriff who wrote up the confession of the illiterate defendant.only one other witness connected gonzales to the crime,a person who corroborated part of the sheriff testimony.at.as in turner,the sheriff played a dual role at trial.not only was he the key witness for the prosecution,but he was also the bailiff in charge of the jury.during the trial,the sheriff conducted the jury in and out of the courtroom,once even stepping down from the witness stand where he was undergoing in order to retire the jury at the court request.at.he walked with the jurors to a restaurant for lunch,conversing with them along the way.he also ate with them in a private dining room at the restaurant.as the jurors deliberated late in the afternoon,they asked the to bring them soft drinks,which he did.at.the jury returned a verdict of guilty,and gonzales eventually sought habeas relief in federal court based on turner.both the district court and the court of appeals found turner distinguishable on the grounds that the bailiff association with the jurors was less extensive and less intense than the association among the deputies and the jurors in turner,where the jurors were sequestered for three days.at.
the supreme court took a different view,reversing the judgment of the district court and the court of appeals in a summary fashion,citing turner.three justices filed a concurring opinion,characterizing this contact between the sheriff and the jury as substantial and continuing over the course of the one day trial at.acknowledging that turner did not set down a rigid per se rule requiring reversal of a conviction whenever a jury came into contact with a witness,the plurality noted a number of circumstances where such an encounter would not present a constitutional problem.for example,association between a jury and a witness whose testimony was confined to some uncontroverted or merely formal aspect of the case would not pose a problem.at.similarly,most brief encounters that occurred by chance would not require reversal,and indeed accidental meetings in the hallway or on a courthouse elevator were described by the court as often inevitable.at.
the distinction drawn by the plurality was that,in turner,the court was faced with crucial witnesses against the defendant,who associated with the jury as their official guardians throughout the trial at the heart of our holding in turner lay a recognition of the great prejudice inherent in the dual role of jury bailiff and key prosecution witness.at.the plurality explained that the adversary system demands that the roles of the prosecution,the defense and the court be kept separate and distinct in a criminal trial 
when a key witness against a defendant doubles as the officer of the court specifically charged with
