petitioner appellee julio alvarez was sentenced in to years imprisonment for shooting and killing daniel colon and wounding two others.at trial,alvarez defense strategy was to show that the new york city police department investigation had been incomplete in ways that created reasonable doubt that the government had proved its case against him.in support of this argument,alvarez sought to the lead detective to show that the police had not investigated leads provided by a witness,edwin vasquez,whose tips were memorialized in a detective notes and an investigative report.the trial court prohibited alvarez from pursuing this line of questioning,ruling that it would lead to the introduction of impermissible hearsay.but alvarez sought to the detective about the vasquez report in order to show that the police had not pursued known leads,and not to show that the content of the vasquez report was true.hence,the trial court ruling was error.moreover,by further cutting off this line of questioning through an alternate clear link ruling,the trial court effectively denied alvarez the opportunity to develop his only defense.taken together,the trial court evidentiary rulings unreasonably applied clearly established sixth amendment law and drastically impaired alvarez ability to present that defense.
this error was by no means harmless because as the district court observed t here was no forensic evidence tying alvarez to the ballistics,no dna,no fingerprints the eyewitnesses differed as to the color,make,and features of the car from which the killers fired one victim failed to identify alvarez until the police told him we got the guy and took him to a and the prosecutor,on summation,called criticism of the police investigation speculation and submit ted to the jury that the detectives did a good job on this case and followed up on leads.
we therefore affirm the judgment of the district judge mcmahon,granting alvarez habeas petition under.
background 
homicide in hunts point,new york 
around on saturday,april,margie rodriguez heard gunshots from the street below her hunts point,bronx apartment and called.from her sixth floor window,rodriguez saw two men drive off in a gray car with a distinctive sunroof.daniel dapper dan colon,a local drug dealer,had been shot twice and lay dying in the street.
moments earlier,dan colon had met with two crack dealers manny colon no relation to dan and aramis fournier dan,manny,and fournier had discussed a recent police raid on their stash house at bryant avenue.as dan,manny,and fournier walked down bryant avenue,a car pulled up one of its two occupants hopped out,said,what up now,dap and then opened fire.despite gunshot wounds to his leg,manny fled on foot while fournier,who was also hit,played dead.both of the teenagers survived.dan,however,died en route to the hospital.
nypd officers questioned manny and fournier within hours of the shooting,but neither identified the shooter or the driver.fournier said that the car was possibly a toyota,and manny described it as a small gold or silver car.that same day,nypd detective donnelly interviewed ariel roche,a car mechanic working on bryant avenue.donnelly jotted notes during the interview,which he turned into a investigation report.according to donnelly notes and the,roche told donnelly that,at the sound of gunfire,he had run to the shop door,facing onto bryant avenue.roche saw an hispanic male in his twenties get into the back of a gold or gray maxima or altima type vehicle.roche said the man was carrying a gun.donnelly notes include roche description of watching the gold or gray car back down bryant avenue a street,make a turn,and then head northwest on hunts point avenue.the car,roche said,had new york plates.
the day after the shooting,a sunday,manny told police that he remembered the shooter name was julio.on monday,april,detective desalvo in the precinct called detective monaco in the who was investigating dan homicide.desalvo had detained edwin vasquez,a computer technician who claimed to have information about dan murder.detective monaco interviewed vasquez,taking notes which he later turned into a investigative report.according to the report,vasquez told monaco that either late on the night of dan murder,or early the following morning,vasquez longtime acquaintance julio told vasquez that he took care of his problem with a man who had argued with julio wife,vianchi.in the report words,vasquez told the detectives that the guy who was killed had insulted both julio and vianchi,a slight that julio could not let lie.the report also included vasquez description of julio as a dominican man in his thirties who used the nickname chan or chang,drove a gray or acura legend,and hung around a man known as the general.
the shows that vasquez also gave the detective a phone number for julio.monaco notes from this interview include information additional to the report,like his notation rips drug on a page with julio nicknames,physical description,phone number,and what appear to be directions to julio home in hunt point,near the shooting.below the directions,monaco also jotted borrowed mm and included several possible nicknames for julio wife his wom a n is chena,china,or cheena.another page of monaco notes adds that julio partner,herniniel general in spanish,according to monaco lives in yonkers.the report states that monaco ran a nitro database search using the nicknames that vasquez gave for julio.the database produced two potential suspects.but when monaco showed vasquez photo arrays containing pictures of these suspects,vasquez denied recognizing any as julio.
on april,three days after the shooting detective alfred showed fournier a photo array that included respondent appellee julio alvarez image.fournier did not identify anyone.on april,alfred showed manny a photo spread,again including alvarez photo,whom manny identified as the shooter.on april,almost a week after the shooting,alfred again showed fournier a photo spread including alvarez picture.fournier said that alvarez looked like the shooter but he was not sure,and failed to definitively identify anyone.learning that the police were looking for him,alvarez turned himself in and was arrested on april.detective alfred told fournier and manny,we got the guy,and asked them to view an lineup,which included alvarez.both shooting victims identified alvarez police searched alvarez car pursuant to a warrant and found a box of millimeter bullets in the trunk.the nypd firearms analysis unit could not link these bullets to any gun used in the shooting.
over a year before trial,the bronx district attorney gave alvarez redacted copies of the reports and notes from roche and vasquez interviews.the redacted versions blacked out roche name and both witnesses birthdates and contact information.vasquez report included his unredacted,full name in one location as well as the phone number that vasquez attributed to julio.the police apparently never called julio number,nor did they use the directions to locate julio home.soon after receiving the vasquez report,defense counsel used the number vasquez attributed to julio to identify julio guerrero,who lived near the shooting on bryant avenue,was married to a woman named bianchi,and drove a silver acura.the state court had a bench warrant out for guerrero arrest on a minor traffic offense,but guerrero was never apprehended,and defense counsel could not locate him.
defense counsel also sent a private investigator to roche garage address.but the investigator,not knowing roche name,hit a wall when each of the employees denied having talked to the police.despite alvarez continued request for the redacted contact information for vasquez and roche,the bronx district attorney refused to disclose it until after jury selection for alvarez trial.by that time,vasquez had moved and changed his phone number,and roche had relocated to puerto rico.
state court proceedings 
alvarez proceeded to a jury trial before bronx county supreme court judge edward davidowitz.to testify to the police investigation into dan homicide,the state called lead detective alfred detective monaco had retired,and the state did not call him.when defense counsel asked alfred to explain the investigating officers reaction to the leads generated by vasquez and included in the report,the government objected that the question called for impermissible hearsay.defense counsel argued that two avenues permitted the questioning as a remedy for the state brady violation in not disclosing the witness contact information until trial and as evidence of the shoddy police investigation,by showing that the police had not tried to track down vasquez julio.judge davidowitz rejected alvarez brady claim and agreed with the district attorney that the called for impermissible hearsay.the state court explained,the ultimate conclusion that defense counsel want s the jury to reach is that had detective alfred pursued this investigation further,it would have resulted in an arrest of someone else,and that is bringing out hearsay.plus,the state court ruled,such questioning was barred by a state evidentiary rule requiring a clear link between evidence implicating a culpable third party and the defendant charged crime.see people primo.as it happens,the case cited by the state judge eliminated any heightened clear link evidentiary standard,choosing instead the general balancing analysis that governs the admissibility of all evidence.see id.
similarly,the state court prevented alvarez from alfred about roche.judge davidowitz again rejected alvarez argument that the roche report should be admitted to remedy the state alleged brady violation.the state court denied any brady violation had occurred.moreover,judge davidowitz doubted the ultimate value of roche.as the appellate division observed,roche description of the shooter car was somewhat equivocal and and cumulative of margie rodriguez testimony people alvarez,dep t.
the jury acquitted alvarez of murder but convicted him of manslaughter and two counts of assault.judge davidowitz sentenced alvarez to years imprisonment a year term for manslaughter and two year terms for his assault convictions,each to run consecutively.
proceeding 
the appellate division affirmed alvarez conviction,people alvarez,at,and chief judge judith kaye of the new york court of appeals denied alvarez request for leave to appeal,people alvarez.alvarez then filed a habeas petition in the southern district of new york under,arguing that the government delayed disclosure of information for roche and vasquez violated brady maryland,that the trial court violated alvarez sixth amendment confrontation clause right when it barred all of detective alfred on the roche and vasquez reports and the trial court instruction on transferred intent violated his right to due process under the fourteenth amendment.
district judge mcmahon granted alvarez habeas petition,holding that the trial court decision to bar all questioning of detective alfred regarding the vasquez was an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent interpreting the confrontation clause,and that this error prevented alvarez from receiving a fair trial.the district court rejected alvarez remaining arguments including his brady claim and his alleged confrontation clause violation based on the roche because they did not meet the high threshold of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa.
the government appealed alvarez did not.accordingly,neither the brady nor the roche confrontation issues are before us.we agree with the district court that the trial court decision to prohibit alvarez from questioning detective alfred about the vasquez was neither a reasonable limit on nor harmless error.delaware van arsdall.we,therefore,affirm the district court.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review a district court decision to grant a writ of habeas corpus under de novo.hawkins costello,cir.section,as amended by aedpa provides 
an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states 
d.an unreasonable application occurs when the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.williams taylor.we assess unreasonableness objectively.see brinson walker,cir.a n unreasonable application of supreme court law must be objectively unreasonable,and not merely wrong.white woodall,internal quotation marks omitted.yet,the trial court decision need not teeter on judicial incompetence to warrant relief under d.francis stone,cir.
clearly established right to confrontation 
supreme court law clearly establishes that,under the sixth amendment confrontation clause,a criminal defendant must have a meaningful opportunity to witnesses against him.brinson,at citing pennsylvania ritchie.see also davis alaska,holding that this confrontation right is applicable to state and federal defendants alike citing pointer texas.the confrontation clause does not,however,guarantee unfettered.see delaware fensterer,per curiam.the trial court has broad discretion to impose reasonable limits on cross examination based on concerns about harassment,prejudice,confusion of the issues,or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.brinson,at quoting van arsdall,at.
combining the standard for restricting with the aedpa standard,in order to grant a habeas petition we would have to conclude not only that the trial court abused its broad discretion by precluding but also that the state appellate court could not reasonably have determined that the evidence would have been excludable had the trial court properly applied standard rules of evidence watson greene,cir quoting wade mantello,cir.on habeas corpus,we do not sit to review the trial judge exercise of discretion,but rather to assess whether the state court denial of the defendant confrontation clause claim was reasonable.id.at.moreover,for habeas to be warranted,the trial court denial must not have been harmless,that is,it must have had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict.brinson,at quoting brecht abrahamson,internal quotation marks omitted.
we start with the propriety of the trial court evidentiary ruling.hawkins,at internal quotation marks omitted.the bronx county supreme court prohibited alvarez from detective alfred about the vasquez report on the ground that the questions solicited inadmissible hearsay.in this respect,the trial court abused its discretion.
the state court conclusion that the vasquez contained multiple layers of hearsay,and depended,for its relevancy,on at least some level being true would have been correct had alvarez offered the report as a means of establishing the truth of its content,that the problem that vasquez friend julio had t aken care of was the murdered dan colon and that when julio called vasquez soon after the shooting,he was confessing to dan murder.see people alvarez,at.but that was not the object of alvarez.alvarez sought to demonstrate that the nypd had failed to take even obvious,preliminary steps to investigate the leads that were generated by vasquez interview summarized in the vasquez.alvarez strategy,which defense counsel heralded during opening and emphasized in closing,was to show that the nypd incomplete investigation indicated that the nypd had prematurely concluded that alvarez was the guilty party,and in that way to raise a reasonable doubt that alvarez was in fact responsible.this defense theory did not depend on the veracity of any of vasquez or,for that matter,julio statements.
in a later ruling,the state trial court justified its decision to restrict alvarez inquiry into the vasquez by citing a new york evidentiary rule governing admission of evidence implicating a third party.in people primo,the new york court of appeals recently clarified that this rule formerly known as the clear link rule requir
