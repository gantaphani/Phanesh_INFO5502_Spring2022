the case before us originated in,when lummie sanders was convicted of two firearm offenses and sentenced to months imprisonment.seven years later,following two direct appeals and one appeal of a motion under,this court determined that sanders should be sentenced to the minimum mandated by the armed career criminal act acca,e.by this time,however,sanders had been released from custody because the sentence the district court imposed in granting the motion,the same sentence imposed in sanders first sentencing,had been completed.four more years passed before the district court issued a warrant for sanders arrest and imposed the longer sentence.sanders claims that this delay violated his constitutional right to due process.as we find no due process violation,we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court.
sanders was indicted for being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of g and for making a false statement in acquiring a firearm in violation of a.the jury found sanders guilty on all counts,and the government requested the minimum sentence mandated by the acca,as sanders had three previous convictions for violent felonies a conviction for robbery a conviction for assault with a dangerous weapon and a conviction for involuntary manslaughter.
before sentencing,sanders challenged the constitutionality of his and convictions.the district court ruled that the conviction was constitutionally infirm.this ruling made the acca inapplicable to sanders and the court sentenced him to months imprisonment in december.on appeal,a panel of this court upheld the convictions but remanded for reconsideration of the sentence.united states sanders,wl,at cir,per curiam.the court ruled that under custis united states,d,the district court should have considered the assault conviction in its determination of whether to sentence under the acca however,the court asked for a further ruling on whether the involuntary manslaughter conviction counted as a predicate felony under the acca.id.at.
on remand,the district court determined that involuntary manslaughter was a violent felony for the purposes of the acca,and thus,the statutory minimum sentence must be imposed.after applying a guidelines enhancement,the court sentenced sanders to months in prison.sanders appealed,and a panel of this court agreed with the determination that the acca applied.united states sanders,cir.the panel disagreed,however,with the district court ruling that it lacked authority to grant a downward departure under the sentencing guidelines,and the case was remanded once again for resentencing.id.at.
in july,the district court resentenced sanders to the minimum permitted by the months imprisonment.sanders then filed a motion to vacate under,arguing that custis did not foreclose him from attacking his predicate convictions and that his assault conviction was constitutionally infirm.the district court accepted both of these arguments and resentenced sanders to the original term of months in april.as sanders had already served months,he was released from custody.
the government once again appealed,and in,this court reversed the grant of habeas relief,ruling that custis prevented sanders from using to attack a state court conviction.sanders united states,wl,at cir.july.sanders petition for rehearing was denied in january and the supreme court denied certiorari in march.sanders united states,d.the sixth circuit issued its order in april,which was received and docketed by the district court.that same month,sanders completed his supervised release period under the original sentence.
the district court took no action following the sixth circuit order.after waiting for a supreme court decision on a related topic the government made its first request that the case be advanced for resentencing in june.sanders attorney successfully moved to be reappointed to the case in july and filed a response to the government resentencing motion in october.the response argued that resentencing would violate sanders sixth and eighth amendment rights and requested a stay so that sanders could be located.in november,the government replied to the constitutional claims and requested a warrant for sanders arrest to avoid a charge that the government failed to exercise due diligence in locating the defendant,and to facilitate his resentencing.the district court did not issue the stay,took no action on the briefs,and did not issue an arrest warrant.
the government alleges that in july,the chief of the criminal division of the attorney office for the northern district of ohio wrote a letter to the district court,expressing concern over the delay and renewing the government request for an arrest warrant.the district court,though,has no recollection of having received this letter,and it does not appear on the court docket sheet.the district court took no action during this period.
one year later,in june,the government again moved for the district court to advance the case.this motion also appears not to have been docketed by the district court,but sanders concedes that this motion was filed.the district court responded six months later,issuing a warrant for sanders arrest in december.sanders was located within eight days of the issuance of the warrant and arrested without incident.he then was released on bond without objection.
in january,the court granted sanders request to file a supplemental brief in opposition to the motion for resentencing.the brief was filed in february and the government responded in march.again,the district court took no action.finally,the government filed a petition for a writ of mandamus with this court in october.in november,the district court issued a ruling,denying sanders constitutional claims and reimposing the sentence required by the acca on the same day,the district court submitted a response to the petition for a writ of mandamus,taking responsibility for the delay in resentencing and stating that its action in imposing the sentence rendered the mandamus action moot.sanders then filed this timely appeal,arguing that resentencing after such a lengthy delay violated his constitutional right to due process.
a due process claim raising a mixed question of law and fact is reviewed de novo.williams coyle,cir.sanders claims that the delay of over four years,from the issuance of a mandate by this court in april to his resentencing in november,violated his constitutional right to due process 
we must first address the proper framework for analyzing sanders claim.sanders primary argument is that the delay violated his right to substantive due process.relying on language in united states lundien,cir,hawkins freeman,cir en banc,and county of sacramento lewis,d,he argues that it violates due process for a court to correct a sentence,even an illegal one,after so much time has passed that a defendant expectations as to its finality have crystallized.we believe that sanders has misconstrued his claim.unlike the cases cited by sanders,the situation before us does not involve an increase in the severity of a sentence following an administrative or other governmental error.in lundien,the court stated its intent to sentence the defendant to a prison term.when the court handed down the sentence,however,the total term of imprisonment was only ten years.five days later,upon motion of the government,the court corrected its error.lundien,at.the defendant in hawkins was mistakenly granted parole.twenty months later,the state noticed the error,revoked the parole and rearrested the defendant.hawkins,at.in both cases,the fourth circuit used a substantive due process framework to evaluate the claims.as neither defendant had reason to believe an error had occurred,the court analyzed whether their expectations as to the finality of their sentences had crystallized so that it would be fundamentally unfair to defeat those expectations.in both cases,the court held that resentencing would not be unfair and that the changes in sentence did not violate the defendant constitutional rights.lundien,at hawkins,at.see also dewitt ventetoulo,cir finding a due process violation when,after a delay of six years,the state attempted to reimpose a life sentence that had been suspended in violation of state law.
the relevant actions in the cited cases did not occur in the context presented here.in all three cases,the defendants had been sentenced,had begun to serve the sentence,and had no knowledge that a mistake had been made.in contrast,sanders has persistently argued for over ten years that he should receive a lower sentence.his release was not due to a clerical error or other negligent act of which sanders was not aware the district court ordered him released based on a conclusion of law later deemed to be in error.however,sanders knew that the district court ruling on the motion was being appealed and was not yet final.thus,he had no expectation of finality as to his sentence indeed,sanders does not claim that the completion of his sentence,his release from jail,or the completion of his supervised release triggered a due process violation.rather,he contends that the district court delay in resentencing after remand of his motion violated his right to due process and that the completion of the sentence first imposed by the district court after conviction is a factor in the analysis.this question is one of procedure.
a defendant maintains a right to due process in a criminal proceeding until the entry of final judgment.this right guarantees not only that the required process will be afforded,but that it will be afforded without oppressive delay.united states lovasco,d see also united states smith,cir.
at first glance,this right seems related to the sixth amendment speedy trial guarantee.const.amend.vi.while sanders does not make a sixth amendment claim,he argues that his due process claim can be adjudicated using the same framework established for analyzing speedy trial violations.see barker wingo,d.the barker test balances four length of the delay,the reason for the delay,the defendant assertion of his right,and prejudice to the determine if the right to a speedy trial has been violated.id.at.the supreme court has applied this framework in cases analyzing delays between a forfeiture action and trial,united states in currency,d,and delays between indictment and arrest,doggett united states,d.although the court has never directly ruled on the test applicability to delays between trial and sentencing,see pollard united states,d assuming arguendo that the test could be applied to such a delay,the majority of circuits,including this one,use it for these claims.see,united states reese,cir burkett cunningham,cir collecting cases united states campbell,cir.no court has previously addressed the question of whether barker is the appropriate framework for analyzing a delay after a conviction and sentence have been affirmed on direct appeal.we hold that it is not.
the court stated aim in barker was to develop a test for a right that is generically different from any of the other rights enshrined in the constitution for the protection of the accused.at.the court noted the many interests society has in the speedy adjudication of criminal matters,as well as the unique characteristics of the as its vagueness and the possibility of its harming,as well as helping,defendants.id.at.the court developed the test in light of these characteristics and to protect the purposes underlying the right to prevent undue and oppressive incarceration prior to trial,to minimize anxiety and concern accompanying public accusation and to limit the possibilities that long delay will impair the ability of the accused to defend himself.id.at.
the supreme court has also applied this framework to claims brought under the due process clause,but only when the same fundamental interests are implicated.in united states in currency,the defendant had over eight thousand dollars confiscated by border officials for failing to make an adequate declaration.the government then waited months before filing a civil forfeiture action.at.the court used the barker framework in analyzing whether this delay violated due process.id.at.the court recognized that the sixth amendment did not apply,as the defendant had not been indicted,arrested,or otherwise deprived of her liberty.however,the defendant had been entirely deprived of the use of her property,and thus,like in the sixth amendment context,a prompt adjudication of the case was necessary to minimize the burden imposed on an individual whose rights had not yet been determined.see also doggett,at.thomas,dissenting a pplication of barker presupposes that an accused has been subjected to the evils against which the speedy trial clause is directed.
this court followed a similar approach in applying a modified barker test to determine whether a delay during a direct criminal appeal violated the defendant right to due process.smith,at.the court in smith recognized that the due process clause places some limit on the appellate process,even if the right to appeal is not guaranteed.the court noted that a speedy appeal was necessary for similar reasons underlying the right to a speedy trial prevention of oppressive incarceration pending appeal minimization of anxiety and concern of those convicted awaiting the outcome of their appeals and limitation of the possibility that a convicted person grounds for appeal,and his or her defenses in case of reversal and retrial,might be impaired.id.at citing harris champion,cir.due to these similarities,the court found the barker test appropriate for analyzing the constitutional question.id.at accord harris,at simmons reynolds,cir.
the supreme court has not used the barker framework,however,when the case implicates neither the sixth amendment nor the interests protected by the test.in united states marion,d,the court held that the speedy trial clause does not apply until an individual is arrested or indicted,regardless of whether the person is under investigation.the court reasoned that the inquiry is not the passage of time but whether the purposes behind the speedy trial guarantee are implicated.
passage of time,whether before or after arrest,may impair memories,cause evidence to be lost,deprive the defendant of witnesses,and otherwise interfere with his ability to defend himself.but this possibility of prejudice at trial is not itself sufficient reason to wrench the sixth amendment from its proper context.
marion,at.footnote omitted.protection against oppressive delay,the court held,is provided by the due process clause.id.at.reaffirming this holding in united states lovasco,the court developed a new test,rather than using the barker factors,to determine when a delay outside the speedy trial context violates a defendant right to due process.at.citing marion,at.the court looked to the government proffered reasons for the delay and the prejudice suffered by the defendant in determining whether a delay in bringing a pretrial indictment violated due process.id.at.
in united states macdonald,d,the court again implicitly limited barker reach.the defendant in that case was accused of committing a murder on a military base.the military brought charges,which were eventually dropped,and the defendant was honorably discharged.four years later,the government obtained an indictment in federal district court charging the defendant with the crime.he claimed that the delay violated his sixth amendment right to a speedy trial.the fourth circuit agreed,applying the barker factors,cir.the supreme court reversed.at.the court stated that the protections afforded by the speedy trial guarantee did not apply to the time period after the dismissal of the military charges and before the civil indictment.during that time,the court reasoned,there was no pretrial incarceration,no impairment of liberty associated with being released on bail,and no disruption of life caused by arrest and the presence of unresolved criminal charges.id.at.while the defendant perhaps suffered stress or anxiety,it was no greater than any other person under criminal investigation.id.at.thus,the due process clause,rather than the sixth amendment,provided the appropriate framework for analyzing the delay.the sixth amendment right to a speedy trial is not primarily intended to prevent prejudice to the defense caused by passage of time that interest is protected primarily by the due process clause id.at.thus,a ny undue delay before and after the period protected by the sixth amendment must be scrutinized under the due process clause id.at.on remand,the fourth circuit applied the lovasco framework to the defendant claim,cir,cert.denied,d.
just as the right to a speedy trial does not attach until a criminal proceeding has been initiated and a defendant faces a real and immediate threat of conviction,so too does it cease to apply when the conviction becomes definitive.this occurs when the conviction is affirmed on direct appeal,if not sooner.the situation faced by sanders falls outside the sixth amendment protections and thus,a ny undue delay must be scrutinized under the due process clause.macdonald,at.moreover,a delay in resentencing following an unsuccessful collateral attack does not implicate any of the interests protected by the barker test.sanders has been afforded both a trial and an appeal to challenge the deprivation of his liberty and his sentence.although the collateral attack may change the sentence,the outcome of the case will not change,reducing the threat of undue or oppressive incarceration.the finality of the original proceeding also eliminates the concern that the defendant will suffer any anxiety from public accusation or the pendency of the direct appeal.any remaining anxiety is simply that of an individual who faces punishment following the exhaustion of all possible appeals.finally,when all that remains of a case is the imposition of a sentence,the danger of losing witnesses or other evidence needed to mount an adequate defense is minimized,if not eliminated completely.the supreme court has never extended barker beyond the protection of these interests,and we decline to do so today.the barker test is not applicable to the case at hand 
a delay in resentencing,however,can still run afoul of due process guarantees.just as the government can not unduly prolong an investigation before bringing an indictment,lovasco,at,due process also imposes an outer limit on the government window of opportunity to resentence a defendant following an appeal.though the lovasco line of cases addresses pretrial delays,we find it equally applicable to the present case.as in the time period before the sixth amendment right to a speedy trial attaches,the primary concern after the right ceases to apply is oppressive delay.the lovasco framework is to analyze whether such a delay has occurred.thus,we hold that after a conviction has been affirmed on appeal,and a case is remanded solely for resentencing,the question of whether any delay in imposing the sentence violates the defendant right to due process can be answered by looking to the reasons for the delay and what prejudice the defendant has suffered as a result of the delay.like the court in lovasco,we emphasize the limited role of the judiciary in this inquiry.judges are not free,in defining due process,to impose on law enforcement officials our personal and private notions of fairness id.at.quoting rochin california.courts are to determine only whether the action complained of violates those fundamental conceptions of justice which lie at the base of our civil and political institutions,and which define the community sense of fair play and decency.id.internal citations omitted.
sanders bears a heavy burden in showing that he has been the victim of a fundamentally unfair process.a defendant in his situation has already been afforded due process in the form of a fair and speedy trial,a timely conviction and sentence,and appellate review.thus,while the protections of the due process clause still apply,a strong showing is required to invoke the remedy that results from finding a due process of the remainder of the sentence.our analysis of the two lovasco factors leads us to conclude that sanders has not met this burden 
we look first to the reasons for the delay.this court has emphasized that the government motive for the delay plays an important role in determining whether a due process violation has occurred.see,united states greene,cir finding no due process violation because the government did not delay to gain a tactical advantage.a showing that the government made little or no effort to seek a timely resentencing by the district court may create a presumption of a due process violation.dewitt,at finding a due process violation based in large part on the government taking no action to correct a sentencing error.moreover,any evidence that the delay was purposeful or due to bad faith would provide strong evidence of a due process violation.bad faith requires an affirmative showing by the defendant it can not be implied from circumstantial evidence.see united states brown,cir.on the other hand,a showing by the government that the delay was intended to benefit the defendant counsels against a due process violation.
in this case,sanders has put forth no evidence of malice or bad faith on the part of the government.rather,the record indicates that the government made a effort to sentence sanders in a timely fashion.after waiting for the outcome of a related supreme court only could have benefitted government made three separate requests to the district court for resentencing.the attorneys working the case likely could have made more frequent requests for a timely disposition,but their stated rationale for not doing maintain a good rapport with a judge before whom they appear justifiable 
finally,we look to what role sanders played in creating or augmenting the delay.the defendant does not have a duty to petition the court for resentencing the onus falls on the government.however,if the defendant exercises his right to make motions or other filings with the court that delay the court from issuing its final ruling,the defendant can not then argue that this period of time creates a due process violation.moreover,any finding that the defendant deliberately caused the,by failing to cooperate with the government investigation,see margroff anderson,wl,at cir,or by making numerous frivolous against finding a due process violation.this does not in any way limit the right of sanders or any other defendant from mounting a vigorous defense.our duty simply is to take into account the amount of the delay resulting from the defendant own actions and weigh this against the delay caused by the government or the court.
in this case,the government does not allege that sanders acted deliberately to delay the government case or that he made excessive or frivolous filings.sanders did file two motions opposing resentencing,both of which required responses and rulings by the court,but this action did not greatly contribute to the delay.nevertheless,when viewed in conjunction with the government rational explanations for its actions,it can not be said that the reasons for the delay violated sanders constitutional right to due process.
sanders has also failed to make any showing of prejudice that would give rise to a due process violation.as noted above,he already has been convicted in a fair and speedy trial,been sentenced in a timely fashion,and had his conviction and sentence upheld on appeal.sanders also has had an opportunity to challenge his sentence further via collateral attack.the delay will in no way affect his ability to raise a defense or present evidence,because the only procedure presently at issue is imposition of the minimum sentence under the acca.moreover,sanders arguably derived some benefit from his early release from prison.he was able to reunite with his children and provide a strong role model for them he was able to meet and marry his current wife and form a relationship with her children and he was able to play a more active role in his community.throughout the entire process,sanders was on notice that his sentence had been challenged and that he could potentially be returned to prison.reimprisonment unquestionably will impose a burden on sanders,but this is attributable to the underlying offense for which he was convicted,not the delay in resentencing.thus,he has not met his burden of showing prejudice suffered as a result of the delay.
sanders has failed to show either that the delay was the result of bad faith or an attempt to gain a tactical advantage on the part of the government,or that he suffered any prejudice as a result of the delay.although four years is a long period of time between remand and sentencing,we can not say that the delay in this case violate d fundamental conceptions of justice or offended the community sense of fair play and decency.lovasco,at.we find no due process violation.
the dissent argues that we should follow the test set forth by the first circuit in dewitt ventetoulo,at,and later used by a panel of this court in united states mayes,wl cir,unpublished.neither of these cases is binding upon us,and we decline to follow them because we are not persuaded by the dewitt framework.to begin with,the court in dewitt does not seem to be establishing a legal rule so much as fashioning a remedy for the very unusual situation faced when the state seeks to reimprison a defendant who had no knowledge whatsoever that his release from prison was in error and that he could be returned to jail.dewitt,at.the court relies on a number of factors but explicitly states that no formula exists for deciding such an issue.id.at.moreover,the dewitt test applied by mayes and the dissent is itself problematic.the test does not focus on whether the delay violated a substantive right of the defendant or whether it resulted in the defendant being denied an adequate procedure to protect his rights.rather,it seems to conflate the procedural due process factors delineated in barker with the substantive due process right discussed in hawkins and lundien to create a sort of hybrid right not to be returned to prison.as we have determined that neither nor barker provides a proper framework for this case,we find dewitt attempt to combine the two unpersuasive.for the reasons discussed above,sanders claim is properly analyzed under the lovasco test.
apart from its legal analysis,the dissent devotes much attention to its perception of the equities of this case.despite the dissent extensive narration about sanders conduct,there is no evidence in the record about sanders present situation.the dissent and the district court accepted sanders assertions about his current life without question or an evidentiary hearing.we have no way of knowing if these assertions are true or if there are other facts not presented to the court which would call these claims into question.whatever his present lifestyle,we do know that sanders has a serious criminal past,resulting in his designation as an armed career criminal.thus,however disconnected this offense may have been from other violent conduct,this defendant is one whom the legislature and the government have selected for significant punishment.our role is not to their decision.
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court.
in the district court own words,t he history of this case is indelibly etched in the court memory.this case too will forever be etched in my mind as one of the most fundamentally unfair results that i have ever witnessed in years as a judge.
lummie sanders was arrested and charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm.the presentence report states that 
on november,the defendant personally pawned the shotgun described in the indictment at silver hardware and loan.since he had prior felony convictions,his actions constituted an illegal possession of the firearm.on november,he regained physical possession of the shotgun by paying off the loan but,in the process of recovering the shotgun,he falsely indicated on atf form that he had no previous felony record.then,on december,the defendant once again pawned the same shotgun at the same store,constituting a second occasion of illegal possession of the firearm 
sanders was arrested and entered a plea of not guilty.following the plea of not guilty,the government filed a notice of its intent to seek an enhanced sentence under the armed career criminal act,e,which provides for a fifteen year mandatory minimum sentence.
the jury found sanders guilty,and at sentencing,sanders challenged the validity of his prior convictions.the district court found a prior assault conviction to be constitutionally invalid and refused to impose the mandatory minimum fifteen year sentence.instead,the district court sentenced sanders to months imprisonment.the district court took note of the defendant family situation as described in the presentence report.the report stated that the defendant had nine children,three of whom were adults and had moved out of the home,but six of whom the defendant was currently raising.the report stated that sanders did not know who will care for his children if he is incarcerated.he said that their mother is in no condition to care for them.the district court found that sanders was living with and providing for his minor children,which was totally out of the mainstream.on appeal,this court reversed and held that the prior assault conviction should have been counted by the district court.united states sanders,wl cir unpublished.we remanded,however,for consideration as to whether sanders prior conviction for involuntary manslaughter ought to be considered an acca predicate conviction.
on remand,the district court determined that sanders prior conviction for involuntary manslaughter was a violent felony for purposes of the enhanced sentence and therefore sentenced sanders to months imprisonment.on appeal,this court again reversed,holding that the district court erred by not considering a downward departure to the minimum sentence of months.united states sanders,cir.the district court then reduced sanders sentence to months imprisonment.
on august,sanders filed a motion to vacate his conviction and sentence under,once again attacking his prior assault conviction.on april,the district court agreed with sanders and vacated the fifteen year sentence.sanders united states,d.the court then resentenced sanders to the original term of imprisonment of months and ordered him released from custody on april.
this is where things got interesting.although he was released from prison,sanders began a reporting requirement with the probation department for the northern district of ohio.during this time,the department made regular home and job visits to monitor sanders progress.also during this time,sanders had regular drugs of of which were negative.two years later this court reversed the district court grant of habeas relief.sanders united states,wl cir unpublished.the supreme court denied certiorari on march.
on april,however,the probation department sent sanders a notice of discharge letter which informed him that inasmuch as you completed service of your sentence you are hereby discharged from supervision of this office on the above sentence.the department obviously had knowledge of sanders home address and place of employment.
for the next fourteen months the government did nothing to advance resentencing.it was not until june,that the government sought to advance the case for resentencing pursuant to this court mandate.counsel was appointed for sanders on october.on october,counsel argued that it would be unconstitutional to resentence sanders and also informed the court that he had been unable to locate his client.thus,sanders had not been informed of this court reversal or of the government delay in advancing the case.a month later,the government replied and respectfully requested that a warrant be issued to locate sanders.no further action was taken by anyone for about the next nineteen months or approximately five hundred and fifty days.then,on june,the government renewed its request that the district court issue a warrant for sanders arrest.by this point,sanders had been out of prison for five years and two months with the belief that he was a free man and with no remaining debt to society and no information to the contrary.
after june,nothing happened again for more than six months.it was not until december,that the district court issued a warrant and sanders was taken into custody on december.on the,sanders was released on bond after it was clarified that he had been living openly at a fixed residence in the cleveland area,had no violations of probation or the law,had been discharged by the probation department,and informed that he had completed service of his sentence.
on february,sanders filed a response to the government motion for sentencing and requested an evidentiary hearing and oral argument.the government filed a response on march.the district court did not take any action.on october,nearly a year since sanders,the government filed a mandamus action in this court seeking to compel the district court to return sanders to prison,six years after his release,to complete the remainder of the sentence.approximately eleven years remained on the sentence.one month later,the district court entered an order rejecting sanders arguments and directing sanders to for the purpose of completing the balance of the sentence.
the district court also filed,on the same date,its answer of david dowd,in the pending mandamus action.in his response,judge dowd recounted the history of the case,which he stated is indelibly etched in the court memory.judge dowd conceded his reluctance to address the issue because of my strong belief that the sending of the defendant back to prison under all the circumstances of this case is unwarranted.judge dowd further commented that his belief that the prior conviction should not count,coupled with the defendant commitment to his five children back in,gives rise to my disagreement with the exercise of the prosecutorial discretion to seek a sentence of months where the weapon was not used in the commission of a separate crime.judge dowd stated that he is a strong believer in prosecutorial discretion,but suggested that the decision to seek an enhanced sentence in this case was made only 
after the defendant was arraigned and entered a plea of not guilty.the provisions of the statute give the prosecutor enormous bargaining power.the power seems to be exercised with respect to defendants who do not immediately enter pleas of guilty so my concern about the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in this case rests primarily upon the obvious,enormous disparity in the sentencing consequences of sanders s decision to contest the charges.
judge dowd stated that he accepted t he stark reality that i am required to order sanders to return to prison i have concluded that i am left with no alternative,short of retirement or recusal,other than to direct lummie sanders to return to prison.judge dowd,a respected jurist,further stated that a lthough i have seriously considered the alternatives of both retirement and recusal as a way of escaping the incredibly distasteful task of telling the defendant that he must return to prison,these alternatives would simply transfer the onerous task to another judge of this court.the court has too much respect and admiration for the difficult tasks the other judges of this court face to shift the responsibility to another judge.judge dowd then explained his strong support for a presidential pardon for lummie sanders and opined that sanders case is an exceptional one justifying such relief.to further that process,judge dowd decided to forward a copy of this answer,with its appendices,to the office of the president of the united states and also senators mike dewine and george voinovich,and to congresswoman stephanie tubbs jones for their information and for whatever course of action,if any,they may wish to take separately or collectively in this case.
now on appeal,sanders argues that reimposing the sentence more than six years or nearly days of freedom and operating under the he was told as much by the he was a free man,would violate his rights under the due process clause.there is case law strongly supporting his position.
dewitt ventetoulo,cir is the leading case in this area of due process questions.the question in the case was whether the state of rhode island had acted unconstitutionally in increasing dewitt sentence and reimprisoning him after his release on parole.id.at.dewitt had been sentenced to life imprisonment in.in,however,dewitt came to the aid of a prison guard who was being assaulted by an inmate.id.at.the state court then suspended all but fifteen years of dewitt life sentence and dewitt served six more years before his parole application was granted.id.prior to dewitt release,however,in,the rhode island supreme court held,in a different case,that a superior court could not suspend a sentence once the defendant began serving it.see id.between this time and when dewitt was paroled,the state made no effort to have the superior court correct its error in dewitt case.id.despite the ruling,dewitt was paroled in as if the order suspending his sentence in part was still in force.id.
during the eight months following his release in january,dewitt obtained work,beginning a painting business and then a siding business.he resumed his relationship with family members and his girlfriend.id.in september,however,dewitt was involved in an altercation which led to criminal charges,the result of which was the superior court decision to vacate its ruling,leaving dewitt life sentence in place.id.dewitt was reincarcerated and sought relief in federal court.the district court,relying on breest helgemoe,granted dewitt relief finding that the state decision to reimpose the life sentence violated dewitt due process rights.
the first circuit affirmed following a lengthy analysis.first,the court noted that t he constitution contains no general rule that prohibits a court from increasing an earlier sentence where the court finds that it was erroneous and that a higher sentence was required by law.id.at.but,according to the court,in law what is true for the usual case is often not true in the extreme case.id.noting that e ven the state conceded at oral argument that due process must impose some outer limit on the power to revise sentences upward after the fact.citing breest,the court noted that a convicted defendant does not automatically acquire a vested interest in a mistakenly low sentence.only in the extreme case can a court properly say that the later upward revision of a sentence,made to correct an earlier mistake,is so unfair that it must be deemed inconsistent with fundamental notions of fairness embodied in the due process clause.id.at.
recognizing that there is no single touchstone for making this judgment,nor any formula,the court determined that 
attention must be given to the lapse of time between the mistake and the attempted increase in sentence,to whether or not the defendant contributed to the mistake and the reasonableness of his intervening expectations,to the prejudice worked by a later change,and to the diligence exercised by the state in seeking the change.
id.here,the court found that the state was not diligent in seeking to correct the error of the suspended sentence.id.moreover,the court found that circumstances changed substantially.id.specifically,the court found that dewitt spent six years in prison with the belief that he was near parole and more importantly,found that dewitt was actually released from prison.id.additionally,the court found that dewitt had spent eight months released in society,had laid down new roots,acquired a job and reestablished family ties.id.the court found that this lengthy delay and change of circumstances are not decisive but they contribute to the judgment.id.
the court then held that due process must in principle impose an outer limit on the ability to correct a sentence after the event.id.at.realizing,as i do here,that the problem is one of deciding how much is too much,the court concluded that dewitt circumstances crossed the line into the unconstitutional by focusing on a range of considerations.id.the court focused on 
the period between the suspension and the reimposition of sentence,the reasonableness of dewitt reliance,his release from prison and formation of new roots,the unusual tardiness of the state in failing to correct the error from onward,and the existence of an alternative parole revocation remedy.these elements can not be calibrated precisely,nor can they be taken in isolation.the outcome here is the result of the combined weight of the elements.
id.in conclusion,the court stated 
we reach our conclusion here with diffidence because federal judges have no monopoly on wisdom in decision what is unfair,and even harsh decisions by state authorities usually raise no constitutional issue.but we are confident that this case is very unusual and that our decision imposes no serious constraint on state authorities who,unlike federal judges,have the direct responsibility for and prosecutorial tasks at hand.in sum,this case is the very rare exception to the general rule that courts can,after sentence,revise sentences upward to correct errors.
likewise,the fourth circuit has held that due process may also be denied when a sentence is enhanced after the defendant has served so much of his sentence that his expectations as to its finality have crystallized and it would be fundamentally unfair to defeat them.united states lundien,cir.the third circuit has also recognized this principle.united states davis,cir quoting lundien and stating that a due process violation will be found in an extreme case that a later upward revision of a sentence is so unfair that it is inconsistent with the fundamental notions of fairness.so has the eleventh circuit.united states davis,cir a defendant due process rights may be violated when a sentence is enhanced after the defendant has served so much of his sentence that his expectations as to finality have crystallized and it would be fundamentally unfair to defeat them.the majority fails to distinguish dewitt,which i believe should dictate a finding in favor of sanders in this case.
even more unfortunate is the fact that the majority does not cite or consider this court prior unpublished decision wherein we adopted dewitt as the standard for reviewing this type of claim.the unpublished disposition from this court,if followed,would also lead to a finding in favor of sanders.in united states mayes,cir unpublished,a unanimous panel held that it was a due process violation to reimpose a sentence five years after it was erroneously recorded as suspended.mayes had pleaded guilty to criminal charges leading to a sentencing guideline range of months.id.at.mayes,however,provided substantial assistance to the authorities and the government moved for a downward departure and agreed on a recommended sentence of six months in a halfway house followed by two years of supervised release.id.when the judgment was filed in,it erroneously stated imposition of sentence suspended and also stated that mayes was to as notified by the clerk office.id.the clerk office never notified mayes and he never went to the halfway house.as this court noted,it was well established at the time of mayes sentence that a district court had no authority to suspend a sentence,as the term is commonly understood.id.citation omitted.
at any rate,mayes sat pretty,undisturbed by the law.after two years,mayes moved to florida where he began working in the business.mayes then returned to memphis and began his own business.he has been extremely successful and his company now employs scores of people.while mayes partner runs the business day to day,mayes is in charge of sales and marketing,a job that entails extensive travel to trade shows.mayes claims that he is presently the only person in the company qualified to perform this function.
id.at.in the sentencing judge retired and the case was assigned to another judge,who,in reviewing the records,noticed the error in the judgment.id.the district court then issued a sua sponte order removing the suspension language resulting in the reiteration of the sentence of six months in the halfway house.id.
on appeal,mayes claimed that the reimposition of the sentence violated his due process rights and this court agreed.we stated this leaves the core question was it too late for the district court to reiterate mayes sentence,such that doing so was fundamentally unfair id.at.after citing and discussing dewitt,this court stated that a lthough we do not purport to establish a rigid test,since this is a inquiry that requires a nuanced and analysis,the dewitt factors are useful for analyzing mayes case.id.in its analysis the court stated first,the span between iteration and reiteration of mayes sentence is problematic.second,mayes did not contribute at all to the original error here.id.we found that mayes expectations were not wholly reasonable,but they were still reasonable enough.id.third,the court found,the prejudice faced by mayes is harsh,though not as harsh as if he were being sent to prison or,a fortiori,being sent back to prison like dewitt.id.at emphasis in original finally,the court found that the government has displayed a total lack of diligence in pursuing this matter.id.in sum,a ll of these factors work to some degree in mayes favor.we hold that the district court action produced a fundamentally unfair result,and that mayes rights were violated by the district court actions.id.
the court continued discussing the issues and noted that the multiplicity of fact patterns and considerations convinces us that there are no ready rules that we can use to solve this case.id.in so concluding,this court rejected the circuit view in people materne,cir that there can be no reasonable expectation of finality as to sentences that are illegal.this court concluded that 
u nder this view,the fact that there was no basis for the original district court to suspend mayes sentence would mean that mayes could have no expectation of finality.we are unable to agree with such a rule,and even if we did agree,this expectation of finality would have to be balanced against other factors.we agree,however,that in ordinary circumstances the illegality of a sentence is a weighty factor to consider,and that this makes us reluctant to eliminate mayes sentence altogether.
id.the court,therefore,remanded the case for the district court to consider whether some sort of intermediate sentence or mitigated arrangement is appropriate.id.at.
the basic principle,it seems,is that the power of a sentencing court to correct even a statutorily invalid sentence must be subject to some temporal limit.breest helgemoe,cir.thus,a fter a substantial period of time,therefore,it might be fundamentally unfair,and thus violative of due process for a court to alter even an illegal sentence in a way which frustrates the prisoner expectations.see also lundien,at d ue process may also be denied when a sentence is enhanced after the defendant has served so much of his sentence that his expectations as to its finality have crystallized and it would be fundamentally unfair to defeat them.and,the first and fourth circuits were discussing prisoners still currently incarcerated when their sentences are enhanced lummie sanders had been living as a free man for six and a half years.
in any event,i would follow the lead of the first circuit and this court in mayes and look at all of the facts and circumstances and also loosely apply the test.i find it troubling that the majority did not cite or consider our decision in mayes.although the case is an unpublished disposition,it was issued by a unanimous panel adopting an analysis that would be directly applicable here.in any event,once again,the first circuit in dewitt found that attention must be given to the lapse of time between the mistake and the attempted increase in sentence,to whether or not the defendant contributed to the mistake and the reasonableness of his intervening expectations,to the prejudice worked by a later change,and to the diligence exercised by the state in seeking the change.dewitt,at.likewise,in mayes,this court,in answering the core question was it too late for the district court to reiterate the defendant s sentence,such that doing so was fundamentally unfair,we found the dewitt factors to be useful.
the first factor is the lapse of time between the mistake and the attempted increase in sentence.dewitt,at finding the delay from when dewitt was released from prison in january to september when he was rearrested,a delay of six mon
