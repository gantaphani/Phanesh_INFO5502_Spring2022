after conviction by a jury,clark appealed to the tennessee court of criminal appeals,claiming that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of murder his appeal was denied.id.at.he filed a petition for relief with the county criminal court,contending that he had been denied effective assistance when his trial counsel failed to call felix lockett as a defense witness.according to the opinion of the court of criminal appeals on review of the proceeding,clark state,wl,clark testified in that proceeding that lockett was the only other person present in the room when he shot cathey.he testified that lockett had been unexpectedly admitted to the hospital roughly three weeks before start of trial,and subsequently died.he claimed that his counsel failed to secure lockett testimony,even though clark had informed him that the testimony would support his defense.he sought to introduce a typewritten document that purported to be an affidavit made by lockett,offering an account supporting clark theory,and at odds in a number of details with the account offered by other witnesses at trial.the court refused to admit the document,on the grounds that a proper foundation for its authenticity had not been established.
clark trial counsel testified that he had attempted to locate and interview lockett,along with all others who had been present at the house at the time of the shooting.he testified that his unsuccessful efforts included two visits to lockett house,sending investigators to the house,speaking to individuals of lockett acquaintance,and twice issuing subpoenas for him.he testified that he believed the state had also subpoenaed lockett.during the course of his investigations,he learned that lockett was elderly,and possibly experiencing some problem with his mental thinking.he had been informed that lockett had suffered a head injury that put him in the hospital,and claimed to have concluded that lockett would not make a good defense witness.he testified that he kept clark informed of the lockett situation,and that clark chose not to seek a continuance.
clark petition for relief was denied after an evidentiary hearing.on appeal of this denial to the tennessee court of criminal appeals,clark raised for the first time his contention that trial counsel had also been ineffective for his failure to call jack wafford,clark cousin,who he claimed would have testified that cathey had showed him a gun at some point before the shooting,intimating that it was meant for clark.the trial court had ruled that wafford could testify for the limited purpose of establishing cathey as the initial aggressor.before he was called to the stand,however,the state objected,indicating that it had asked clark counsel for a recording of a defense interview with wafford who had claimed that the interview had been taped,but that counsel had been unable to find it.trial counsel responded by claiming that his investigator said the interview had not in fact been taped,but that he would nevertheless not be calling the witness to testify.clark claimed on appeal that his counsel had withdrawn wafford as a witness because of his deficiency in failing to provide the required materials.the court of criminal appeals held that the claim had been waived by his failure to present it in his petition,and further observed that,even if it had not been waived,it would have failed on the merits because clark had made no showing of a likelihood of a different outcome had wafford been permitted to testify.the court of criminal appeals affirmed the court denial of relief.clark state,wl at.permission to appeal to the state supreme court was denied.
in his pro se federal habeas petition,clark alleged that the evidence used to convict him was insufficient in particular,that there was insufficient evidence of the deliberation element necessary for a murder conviction,and that the evidence instead pointed to,that his trial counsel and counsel were ineffective trial counsel for failing to call lockett and wafford,and counsel for failing to raise trial counsel ineffectiveness with respect to wafford,and that he had exhausted his state remedies for these claims.in an accompanying memorandum,he stated the purported factual basis for his claims.the district court summarily dismissed clark petition,without ordering the state to respond,and,as far as the record indicates,without directly examining the records of the state court proceedings.in its order,the district court also denied clark requests for a certificate of appealability and leave to proceed in forma pauperis.an order of this court granted a certificate of appealability and pauper status,and sua sponte ordered counsel appointed for clark.clark now appeals the denial of his ineffective assistance claims,and argues that the district court erred by summarily dismissing his petition he explicitly abandons his insufficiency of the evidence claim.
whether the district court erred in summarily dismissing clark petition is a question of law that we review de novo.martin overton,cir.clark concedes that state court factual findings are presumed to be correct in a federal habeas proceeding,and that this presumption can only be overcome with clear and convincing evidence.e.he argues,however,that the procedural rules of and rule of the rules governing cases require a more probing inquiry than the district court conducted.
provides that a court entertaining an application for a writ of habeas corpus shall forthwith award the writ or issue an order directing the respondent to show cause why the writ should not be granted,unless it appears from the application that the applicant or person detained is not entitled thereto.clark argues that his application was not facially defective,and that the district court was thus required to order a response.similarly,rule of the rules governing cases states that i f it plainly appears from the petition and any attached exhibits that the petitioner is not entitled to relief in the district court,the judge must dismiss the petition if not,the rule instructs the district court to order the respondent to file an answer,motion,or other response or to take other action the judge may order.clark again concludes from that his petition,insofar as it is not facially defective,could not be summarily dismissed.
clark argument,essentially,is that if the district court needs to go outsid
