the opinion in this case filed on june,is withdrawn and the following opinion is substituted therefor.
petitioner humberto leal garcia leal appeals from the district court finding that it was without jurisdiction to consider his second petition for habeas corpus relief because leal failed to first seek authorization from this court pursuant to.leal contends that because his petition is not successive within the meaning of the and effective death penalty act aedpa,he was not required to obtain authorization and the district court had jurisdiction to hear his petition.we agree,but we nevertheless affirm the dismissal on the basis of the intervening supreme court decision in medellín texas 
facts and proceedings 
leal was convicted of murder in a texas court in for killing a girl during the course of an aggravated sexual assault.on a jury recommendation,leal was sentenced to death.we assume the parties are well familiar with the facts of the case so we will not repeat them here it goes without saying that the details of the crime are graphic and brutal.
procedural history 
this is leal second attempt at federal habeas relief aedpa requires that a petitioner filing a second or successive petition first obtain authorization to do so from the appropriate federal appellate court.leal did not do so,claiming that his petition was not successive.the district court disagreed,holding that it was successive and that,because leal failed to obtain authorization pursuant to b a,the court was without jurisdiction to hear the petition.the district court dismissed leal petition without prejudice.he now appeals the holding of no jurisdiction

ii.analysis 
standard of review 
in a petition for habeas corpus,we review de novo the district court determination that it was without jurisdiction to consider the petitioner claim 
b.the vienna convention and the avena decision 
before delving into the specifics of this case,we must outline the singular international and domestic legal background from which leal petition arises.the vienna convention,to which the united states has been a signatory since,requires member nations to permit detained foreign nationals access to their consular officers the united states also signed the optional protocol concerning the compulsory settlement of disputes to the vienna convention,which established the icj and made its decisions binding on the parties before it 
alleging that the united states had violated the right to consular access established in article of the vienna convention,mexico took a dispute to the icj for review the case the avena decision concerned named mexican citizens convicted of capital crimes and imprisoned in the united states leal was one of the named individuals in,the icj held that the united states had violated the vienna convention guarantee of consular access and must review the convictions and sentences of those individuals whose rights were so violated in its decision,the icj stated that procedural as state law procedural default reviewing the cases of the individuals should be suspended to permit review to obtain state compliance with the icj edict,president george bush then issued a memorandum the bush declaration in february,ordering states to review the cases identified in the avena decision 
as a result of this series of events,others of the named a petition for habeas corpus under texas law seeking the review outlined in the avena decision.after the texas court of criminal appeals denied his petition,leal filed his second habeas petition in the western district of texas seeking the state of texas compliance with the avena decision and the bush declaration.a year after leal filed his second federal petition,the supreme court,in medellín texas,considered the issue of texas refusal to conduct a review pursuant to avena.the court held that although the icj avena decision creates an international obligation binding on the united states,the decision can not automatically create enforceable domestic law and the president,acting without legislative or constitutional authority,could not state law to make it binding in short,the court held that the several states are not bound to conduct the review ordered by the icj in the avena decision.the court then affirmed the texas court of criminal appeals rejection of medellín successive habeas petition as an abuse of the writ under state law 
the claim on which leal federal petition is based has been foreclosed by the supreme court decision in medellín texas we proceed with our analysis,however,because the issue before us is whether the district court properly determined that it was without jurisdiction,a question not mooted by the supreme court decision in medellín.
applicability of to leal petition 
aedpa requires a prisoner to obtain authorization from the federal appellate court in his circuit before he may file a second or successive petition for relief in federal district court without such authorization,the district court has no jurisdiction to entertain a successive petition leal asserts,however,that his petition is not successive because it is based on a claim that was not available to him at the time of his prior petition.if he is correct,the stringent requirements of for obtaining authorization would not apply 
leal filed his first federal habeas petition in,long before the avena decision and the bush declaration.in march,when the icj decided avena,leal first petition was still pending the district court for the western district of texas did not deny him relief until seven months later.the state asserts that this gap between the avena decision and the district court denial afforded leal the opportunity and ample time to amend his first petition to include the claim on which he now bases this later petition.as such,according to the state,leal claim was previously available and required,but did not merit,authorization from this court.
leal counters that his claim did not arise until the bush declaration attempted to make the avena decision binding on the states and the texas courts refused to afford review as a result,he insists,the claim on which this petition is based was not previously available to him and so,although it is numerically second,it is not second or successive within the meaning of aedpa.
second or successive petition 
aedpa was enacted in part to bring finality to state court judgments section lays out the requirements for filing successive petitions,serving as by preventing the repeated filing of habeas petitions that attack the prisoner underlying conviction the statute does not define second or successive,however,and we have made clear that a petition is not second or successive merely because it is numerically second in in re cain,we defined a second or successive petition as one that raises a claim challenging the petitioner conviction or sentence that was or could have been raised in an earlier petition or otherwise constitutes an abuse of the writ.section specifies when a petition will be heard.despite its strictures,the case law clarifies that there is a category of petitions that,even though later in time,are outside the confines of and will be heard because they are not second or successive within the meaning of aedpa 
leal relies on the cain definition to assert that his petition falls into the exceptional is,it is it is based on a claim unavailable to him at the time of his first habeas petition.according to leal,cain sole requirement for a permissible petition is that the claim on which it was based had been unavailable at the time of a first petition.we agree with leal that his petition is,but we can not embrace the full scope of the rule he advocates.broadly understood,such an expansive interpretation of cain would run foul of the plain language of aedpa and be incorrect.we must therefore consider the contours of cain.
statutory and jurisprudential context 
cain can not be read in isolation,but must be considered in the context of aedpa,the statute that it interprets the cain definition of successive is broadly worded while aedpa treatment of successive is narrow and herein lies the logical flaw in leal broadly stated understanding of cain and the reason why we can not simply apply cain without further consideration.to read cain as does leal would require us to hold that a petition is if it rests on a rule of constitutional law decided after the petitioner first habeas proceeding because such a claim would not have been previously available.but b prohibits such a result.newly available claims based on new rules of constitutional law made retroactive by the supreme court are successive under b a indeed,this is the reason why authorization is needed to obtain review of a successive petition.leal view of cain would permit an around.the new rule of constitutional law would be because it was previously unavailable,so no authorization would be required.were leal correct,b would be rendered surplusage 
a second petition based on newly discovered evidence presents a similar,although less pristine,example of the problem created by leal proffered interpretation.leal view of cain would permit petitioners filing later habeas petitions to assert that,because the evidence was not previously discovered or discoverable,the claim was unavailable therefore,the later petition is.again,aedpa forbids such a reading section b b i states that claims based on a factual predicate not previously discoverable are successive.
cain itself is not so broad as leal contends his argument ignores the context in which the decision definition of successive was provided.in cain,we contrasted permissible successive petitions with those in which prisoners repeatedly attack the validity of their convictions and sentences.it is these repeated attacks,which often take on new forms as the legal landscape shifts,that are the evil against which aedpa is directed and the counterpoint to the rule laid out in cain 
if aedpa is aimed at minimizing repeated attacks on an underlying judgment and,to that end,permits second or successive petitions to be heard only via,then the small subset of permissible petitions must fit within these boundaries.when we look to the jurisprudence we find that contrasting petitions typically deemed with those typically deemed successive illuminates this middle ground.later habeas petitions attacking the same judgment that was attacked in a prior petition tend to be labeled successive and must meet the standards for authorization under in contrast,later habeas petitions attacking distinct judgments administration of an inmate sentence a defective habeas proceeding itself or some other species of legal the error arises after the underlying tend to be deemed in essence,if the purported defect existed,or the claim was ripe,at the time of the prior petition,the later petition is likely to be held successive even if the legal basis for the attack was not.if,however,the purported defect did not arise,or the claim did not ripen,until after the conclusion of the previous petition,the later petition based on that defect may be.
we need look no farther than cain itself for illustration.we held that cain petition was because it attacked the administration of his sentence,not his underlying conviction.cain contended that the prison board had deprived him of his credit without due process of law the disciplinary proceeding by the prison board did not occur until after proceedings in cain first habeas petition concluded we noted that not only could cain challenge to those proceedings not have been included in his first habeas petition,but that the challenge was essentially independent of cain underlying conviction as cain illustrates,we may deem a later petition based on a newly available claim and outside the confines of if the defect that it attacks did not arise until after the prior habeas proceeding.
with the framework within which we determine whether a petition is successive or thus established,we now consider whether leal second petition was successive or when filed in march.
application 
the state claims that leal could have amended his prior federal petition to include the claim once the icj judgment was rendered in march.at that point,leal first petition had been pending for four years.there may be room for debate as to whether,while a petitioner is this far along in his initial petition and awaiting a decision,he should be required to add a freshly minted claim to it,but we are satisfied that in this case the state argument misses the mark remember,leal does not contend that avena was immediately enforceable on the states he claims that it was the bush declaration implementing the avena decision and texas refusal to comply with the presidential order that has denied him rightful he filed his second federal petition one week after the texas court of criminal appeals denied him relief as the bush declaration was not issued until after leal first petition was denied the basis for his refusal to conduct the review of his not occur until well after proceedings on his first petition had concluded.
as we have explained,when determining whether a later petition is,we consider the defect that the later petition attacks and when that defect arose.here,leal does not rely on some novel legal basis to again attack his conviction,an undertaking we would likely deem successive.rather,he alleges a defect that arose,he insists,after his conviction although the ultimate goal of leal petition is to obtain court review of his conviction,he is actually attacking the state failure to comply with the avena decision as implemented by the bush declaration.and,we will not require courts to divine a petitioner underlying ulterior motives.texas did not deny leal claim based on avena and the bush declaration until march,well after the resolution of leal first habeas petition.as a result,the declaration claim was not previously available to him,making leal petition.
the effect of medellín texas 
as it was,leal second habeas petition did not require authorization,so it follows that the district court did have jurisdiction.the legal ground has shifted once again,however,and although the district court was incorrect in finding that it was without jurisdiction,leal will get no further.in the unusual posture of this case,leal once had a newly available claim,but no longer has it.as we have said,leal petition attacked texas refusal to comply with avena and the bush declaration,but that refusal can no longer serve as the basis for a petition for habeas corpus.the supreme court decision in medellín texas,has deprived the avena decision and the bush declaration of whatever legal force leal might claim they ever had leal can not now argue that texas was required to review his case because medellín texas foreclosed this contention by holding that neither the icj nor president bush had authority to order the state to conduct such a review 
iii.conclusion 
leal second habeas petition was,so it did not require authorization from us to be considered by the district court.therefore,we reverse the district court holding that it lacked jurisdiction to consider leal petition.that said,however,for the reasons last stated,we affirm the dismissal of his habeas petition,albeit with prejudice we also vacate the district court determination based on its erroneous assumption of hypothetical jurisdiction.

to be clear,leal argument is not that his right to consular access was violated although it is from this vienna convention right that his claim ultimately derives.rather,it is that the avena decision via the bush declaration entitle him to review.
