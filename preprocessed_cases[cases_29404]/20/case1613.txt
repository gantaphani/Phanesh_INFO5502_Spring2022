kenny roy miller miller is currently serving a life sentence after a state conviction for intentional murder,criminal attempt to commit murder,burglary,and being a persistent felony offender.miller appeals from the district court denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to.in his habeas petition,miller alleges that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge a biased juror during voir dire.miller argues that the kentucky court of appeals denial of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim was contrary to,and an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the district court order and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
on november,a grand jury in warren county,kentucky indicted miller for intentional murder,criminal attempt to commit murder,burglary,and being a persistent felony offender.the indictment charged miller for shooting and killing leon gray and shooting and seriously wounding linda cline in their bed at an apartment in bowling green,kentucky.
on august,a jury trial commenced against miller in the warren circuit court.during voir dire,one prospective juror,yvonne bell juror bell,in response to the prosecutor voir dire question,stated that she was a minister and that she had known linda cline for two or three years through bible study.linda cline,the woman who was shot and seriously wounded,was one of the prosecution key witnesses and the only eyewitness to the crime.at this point of the voir dire,miller trial counsel,william skaggs skaggs,did not ask juror bell any questions.towards the end of the voir dire,however,the trial court asked the members of the jury panel if they wanted to reveal further information.the following dialogue took place 
judge okay,one final thing d uring the course of this proceeding there may have been something that was asked that you let go by.something that you thought you were sure but now its bothering you.anybody have anything they need,feel like they need to bring up with the court,i be happy to take it up here at the bench,that you would feel would in any way would cause you any difficulty in sitting as a juror in this case.yes,come on up.
bench conference 
bell i yvonne bell.
judge yes,bell.
bell i feel like i would kind of be partial to linda cline because,when she was in my classes inaudible she seemed like she really wanted to do better and i kind of have sympathy for her in this case,with her being the victim.
judge do you believe the fact that you had her,you indicated,in bible studies,and will appear as a witness in this case and is alleged to be one of the victims in this case,do you believe that would influence your thinking here and cause you to be more sympathetic for her side as such as you could sit and be fair and impartial 
bell i think i could be fair.i think i could be fair.i ministered in the women section for about four years.she was kind of in and out,but she seemed like she wanted to do better,but i believe i could be fair and whether she guilty or not guilty i believe i could be fair about it all.but i do have some feelings about her.
judge okay.i going to go back and take your seat,i going to hear from the lawyers.
skaggs judge,may i ask her a question 
judge yes,you may.
skaggs the women section.the women section of what 
bell the warren county jail.
skaggs okay,and how many years ago was this,or was it recent 
bell from about four years,up until last year.
skaggs okay,and so you have seen her since this happened 
bell no,i have.i have been coming to the inaudible for about a year now.
skaggs well,this happened months ago.
bell well,i do know.i do remember.i never ask any of them about why they in for or any of their business.my whole concern was the word of god.i never talk to them about their cases or any of their personal business.
skaggs i see.that all.
judge okay,you may step down.just take your seat back.juror departs.do either of you want me to consider striking this woman,this juror for cause 
wilson well.she said she could be fair.she does know the person but she did answer the question that she could be fair.
skaggs i have no motion.
in addition to not challenging juror bell for cause,miller trial counsel did not use a peremptory challenge to remove the prospective juror.therefore,juror bell remained on the jury.
on august,the jury,which included juror bell,convicted miller on all charges of the indictment.on september,the trial court sentenced miller to life and to two terms of imprisonment,to run consecutively.miller filed a direct appeal to the kentucky supreme court concerning the judgment of conviction and sentence.on september,the kentucky supreme court affirmed the conviction,but remanded the case for and directed the trial court to run miller life sentence concurrently with his sentence.on november,the trial court miller in accordance with the kentucky supreme court order.
on october,with new counsel,miller filed a motion to vacate the judgment based upon ineffective assistance of counsel.among his allegations,miller argued that his trial counsel was ineffective when he allowed juror bell,a biased juror,to remain on the jury.on september,the warren circuit court held an evidentiary hearing.the warren circuit court heard testimony from miller and his trial counsel,skaggs.skaggs testified that he did not seek to exclude juror bell from the jury because 
most people do not understand the world of extreme hard core drug addicts and this case involved hard core drug addicts it is a different reality.regular jurors do not understand that hard core drug addicts will lie.they will only tell the truth if they have no other opportunity.and,since this lady knew linda cline,knew she was completely unworthy of belief,i left her up anyone who knew linda cline,knew that she could not be trusted,that was my thinking at the time.
on february,the warren circuit court denied miller motion.miller appealed to the kentucky court of appeals.on january,the kentucky court of appeals affirmed the warren circuit court decision holding that miller failed to rebut the presumption that trial counsel decision to not exclude the juror was sound trial strategy and,therefore,not deficient performance pursuant to strickland washington,d.miller filed a motion for discretionary review with the kentucky supreme court.on october,the kentucky supreme court denied miller motion.
after exhausting his remedies in the kentucky state courts,on november,miller filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus,pro se,pursuant to in the united states district court for the western district of kentucky.miller raised five claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.miller argued that his attorney failed to seek to exclude juror bell,who knew and admired the state primary witness his attorney failed to investigate and subpoena witnesses to directly contradict the state chief witness his attorney attempted to establish an alibi defense,which he knew he could not support by credible witnesses his attorney failed to move for a mistrial after a juror had prejudicial exposure to a spectator at trial and the cumulative effect of his counsel errors constituted ineffective assistance.
on january,the district court referred the matter to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendation.on may,the magistrate judge entered findings of fact and conclusions of law,recommending that the district court deny the petition on the merits and issue a certificate of appealability on the first issue only,because reasonable jurists could find the assessment of the constitutional claim debatable or wrong.on june,miller filed objections to the findings of fact.on june,the district court entered an order adopting the magistrate judge report and recommendation.in denying the habeas petition on the first issue,the district court held that miller failed to overcome the presumption that trial counsel reason for allowing juror bell to remain on the jury was sound trial strategy.in addition,the district court held that miller failed to show that juror bell was actually biased against him.therefore,the district court ruled that miller failed to show that the decision of the kentucky court of appeals,which denied his ineffective assistance of counsel claim,was contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law.
on july,miller filed a notice of appeal for the district court denial of his habeas petition based on his first claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,which the district court certified.on july,miller also appealed the district court order denying a certificate of appealability on miller remaining four claims.on january,this court denied miller application for a partial certificate of appealability holding that miller failed to make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.this court determined that miller appeal should proceed on the claim that the district court certified whether miller was denied the effective assistance of counsel when his trial counsel failed to seek to exclude juror bell.on may,patti webb,warden,waived the opportunity to respond to miller appeal.
ii.discussion 
this court reviews a district court legal conclusions in a habeas petition de novo.lucas,cir.this court usually reviews findings of fact for clear error,but when the district court decision in a habeas case is based on a transcript from the petitioner state court trial,and the district court thus makes no credibility determination or other apparent findings of fact,the district court factual findings are reviewed de novo.wolfe brigano,cir quoting moore carlton,cir.
in determining whether to issue a writ of habeas corpus,the provisions of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa govern the district court review of a state court decision.pursuant to the aedpa,
a n application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
the supreme court explained these requirements for habeas relief under d in williams taylor,d.in williams,the court held that,in order to justify a grant of habeas relief,a federal court must find a violation of law that is clearly established from the holdings,as opposed to the dicta,of the supreme court decisions as of the time of the relevant decision.id.at.the court held that a state court legal decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than the supreme court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.id.at.furthermore,the court held that a state court legal decision will be deemed an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.id.
a federal court,however,may not find a state adjudication to be unreasonable simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.rather,that application must also be unreasonable.id.at.moreover,a federal court making the unreasonable application inquiry should not transform the inquiry into a subjective one by inquiring whether all reasonable jurists would agree that the application by the state court was unreasonable.rather,the issue is whether the state court application of clearly established federal law is objectively unreasonable.id.at.
under the aedpa,therefore,the threshold inquiry is whether miller seeks to apply a rule of law that was clearly established at the time of his conviction in the state court.see id.at.miller seeks to apply the supreme court holding in strickland washington,d,which the supreme court had clearly established at the time of miller conviction,to show ineffective assistance of counsel.the court in strickland established a test to evaluate claims of ineffective assistance of counsel pursuant to the sixth amendment.first,the petitioner must show that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.judicial scrutiny of counsel performance must be highly deferential,and a fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight,to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel challenged conduct,and to evaluate the conduct from counsel perspective at the time.id.at.a court considering a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must indulge a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.id.second,the petitioner must show that counsel performance prejudiced the petitioner.that is,the petitioner must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.when a biased juror is impaneled,however,prejudice under strickland is presumed,and a new trial is required.hughes united states,cir.
miller argues that it was ineffective assistance of counsel for his trial counsel to keep juror bell,a biased juror,on the jury.pursuant to the sixth and fourteenth amendments,a criminal defendant is guaranteed the right to an impartial and unbiased jury.morgan illinois,d.among the most essential responsibilities of defense counsel is to protect his client constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury by using voir dire to identify and ferret out jurors who are biased against the defense.miller francis,cir see united states blount,cir the primary purpose of the voir dire of jurors is to make possible the empanelling of an impartial jury through questions that permit the intelligent exercise of challenges by counsel.see also virginia,d stating that voir dire serves the dual purposes of enabling the court to select an impartial jury and assisting counsel in exercising peremptory challenges united states,d voir dire plays a critical function in assuring the criminal defendant that his sixth amendment right to an impartial jury will be honored.
counsel,however,is granted deference when conducting voir dire.hughes,at.an attorney actions during voir dire are considered to be matters of trial strategy a strategic decision can not be the basis for a claim of ineffective assistance unless counsel decision is shown to be so that it permeates the entire trial with obvious unfairness.id.citation omitted.despite this strong presumption that counsel decisions are based on sound trial strategy,it is insufficient for counsel to simply articulate a reason for an omission or act alleged to constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.the trial strategy itself must be objectively reasonable.miller,at citing strickland,at.
a trial court management of voir dire is granted similar deference.the supreme court has acknowledged the traditionally broad discretion accorded to the trial judge in conducting voir dire,at.a trial court management of voir dire,however,is subject to essential demands of fairness.hughes,at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.because a petitioner sixth amendment right to an impartial jury is at stake,a defendant may obtain a new trial if an impaneled juror honest responses to questions on voir dire would have given rise to a valid challenge for cause.id.citing mcdonough power,greenwood,d.challenges for cause are subject to approval by the court and must be based on a finding of actual or implied bias.id.quoting virgin islands felix,cir.
pursuant to the sixth amendment,for a finding of juror impartiality when a juror is challenged for cause,the relevant question is did the juror swear that he could set aside any opinion he might hold and decide the case on the evidence,and should the juror protestation of impartiality have been believed.patton yount,d.a qualified juror need not be totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved.murphy florida,d.rather,i t is sufficient if the juror can lay aside his impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.id.quoting irvin dowd,d.in irvin,the supreme court stated 
in these days of swift,widespread and diverse methods of communication,an important case can be expected to arouse the interest of the public in the vicinity,and scarcely any of those best qualified to serve as jurors will not have formed some impression or opinion as to the merits of the case.this is particularly true in criminal cases.to hold that the mere existence of any preconceived notion as to the guilt or innocence of an accused,without more,is sufficient to rebut the presumption of a prospective juror impartiality would be to establish an impossible standard.it is sufficient if the juror can lay aside his impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.
if actual bias is discovered during voir dire,the trial court must excuse the prospective juror.hughes,at.actual bias is bias in fact the existence of a state of mind that leads to an inference that the person will not act with entire impartiality.id.at quoting united states torres,cir citing united states wood.although bias can be revealed through a prospective juror express admission,more frequently,jurors are reluctant to admit actual bias and the trial court must discover their biased attitudes through circumstantial evidence.id.at citing united states allsup,cir.
because miller claim for ineffective assistance of counsel is based on his trial counsel failure to strike a biased juror,miller must show that the juror was actually biased against him.id.at citing goeders hundley,cir citing smith phillips,d.a juror express doubt as to her own impartiality on voir dire does not necessarily entail a finding of actual bias.the supreme court has upheld the impaneling of jurors who had doubted,or disclaimed outright,their own impartiality on voir dire.see also patton,at.holding that trial court did not commit manifest error when finding jury members to be impartial despite admitting that they formed an opinion as to the defendant guilt due to pretrial publicity.
this court in hughes,however,found actual bias when a juror made an unequivocal statement of partiality and there was neither a subsequent assurance of impartiality nor rehabilitation by counsel or the court through questions.hughes,at.in hughes,the government charged the defendant with theft of government property and wrongful possession of a firearm in connection with the robbing of a deputy united states marshall.during voir dire,the judge asked potential jurors if they could be fair.in response,the following exchange occurred 
juror jeanne orman i have a nephew on the police force in wyandotte,and i know a couple of detectives,and i quite close to em.
the court anything in that relationship that would prevent you from being fair in this case 
juror i do think i could be fair.
the court you do think you could be fair 
the court okay.anybody else okay.where did we leave off 
id.at.neither the judge nor counsel asked any questions.in addition,counsel never attempted to remove the juror for cause or by peremptory strike.this court held that,while a juror express doubt as to her ability to be impartial on voir dire does not necessarily result in a finding of actual bias,actual bias was present because neither counsel nor the trial court responded to the juror express statement that she could not be fair.there was no subsequent assurance of impartiality and no rehabilitation by counsel or the court through questions.this court held that,when left with only a statement of partiality without a subsequent assurance of impartiality or rehabilitation through questions,juror bias can always be presumed from such unequivocal statements.id.at.as a result of finding actual bias,this court held that the state court denial of the defendant ineffective assistance of counsel claim was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.
our present case is similar to hughes.as in hughes,juror bell did not unequivocally swear that she could set aside her opinion and decide the case on the evidence.when the trial judge asked the jury panel whether any individual had anything else to add,juror bell stated,i feel like i would kind of be partial to linda cline because,when she was in my classes inaudible she seemed like she really wanted to do better and i kind of have sympathy for her in this case,with her being the victim.juror bell indicated that she was partial to the government key witness.the trial judge asked only one question regarding whether she could be fair and impartial.in response,juror bell stated,i think i could be fair,however,she immediately qualified her statement by stating,b ut i do have some feelings about her.although defense counsel questioned her further,he only inquired about the women section and the jail.neither counsel nor the judge on her statement of partiality.they did not ask whether she could lay aside her feelings and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.irvin,at.in this context,when a juror makes a statement that she thinks she can be fair,but immediately qualifies it with a statement of partiality,actual bias is presumed when proper juror rehabilitation and juror assurances of impartiality are absent,as in hughes.
this court acknowledges that,when asked whether a particular juror can be fair,statements such as i think i could be fair are not necessarily construed as equivocation.miller francis,at.in miller francis,we stated,venire members commonly couch their responses to questions concerning bias in terms of i think.therefore,the use of such language can not necessarily be construed as equivocation.id.for a juror to say,i think i could be fair,but,without more,however,must be construed as a statement of equivocation.it is essential that a juror swear that she could set aside any opinion she might hold and decide the case on the evidence.patton,at.if a juror does not make such an unequivocal statement,then a trial court can not believe the protestation of impartiality.see id.accordingly,when the trial court is ultimately left with a statement of partiality,as in this case,that is coupled with a lack of juror rehabilitation or juror assurances of impartiality,we are left to find actual bias.
when a trial court is confronted with a biased juror,as in this case,the judge must,either sua sponte or upon a motion,dismiss the prospective juror for cause.frazier united states.because the trial court failed to respond to juror bell statement of bias on voir dire,we find that,as in hughes,counsel failure to respond in turn was objectively unreasonable pursuant to strickland.when a venireperson expressly admits bias on voir dire,without a court response or,for counsel not to respond to the statement of partiality in turn is simply a failure to exercise the customary skill and diligence that a reasonably competent attorney would provide.hughes,at quoting johnson armontrout,cir.
the kentucky court of appeals held that miller was not denied effective assistance of counsel because miller failed to show that his trial counsel decision to leave juror bell on the jury was not the result of reasonable professional judgment.miller trial counsel,skaggs,stated that he kept juror bell on the jury because the case was about hard core drug addicts and juror bell knew linda cline and a nyone who knew linda cline,knew that she could not be trusted.the kentucky court of appeals noted that any error in trial strategy regarding the selection of jurors does not generally rise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel.
contrary to the kentucky court of appeals decision,the decision whether to seat a biased juror can not be a discretionary or strategic decision.id.at citing united states,d holding that the seating of a biased juror who should have been dismissed for cause requires reversal of the conviction.as we previously held,there is no sound trial strategy that could support what is essentially a waiver of a defendant basic sixth amendment right to trial by an impartial jury.id.if,however,there could be such a strategic decision,this case does not present such a situation because skaggs articulated trial strategy was objectively unreasonable.first,skaggs reasoning that anyone who knew linda cline,knew that she could not be trusted was completely baseless.juror bell never gave counsel nor the court an indication that she did not trust linda cline.on the contrary,juror bell believed that linda cline wanted to do better and juror bell had sympathy for her in this case,with her being the victim.it was clear that juror bell was not an individual who did not trust linda cline.rather,juror bell was involved in ministry with linda cline and believed in her.
second,skaggs reasoning that this case was about hard core drug addicts and its dependent implication that juror bell knew about this subject was also baseless.although juror bell was a minister at the warren county jail,she specifically stated that she never ask ed any of them about why they in for or any of their business.her whole concern was the word of god.she never talk ed to them about their cases or any of their personal business.in addition,during voir dire,skaggs never questioned juror bell about her knowledge of hard core drug addicts.skaggs made an unreasonable assumption that juror bell had such knowledge considering that juror bell stated that she never discussed personal business with the ladies.accordingly,skaggs trial strategy was objectively unreasonable.it was illogical to keep juror bell on the jury when she was partial to linda cline,the government key witness and victim.no competent attorney would have employed such a strategy.
the presence of a biased juror can not be harmless the error requires a new trial without a showing of actual prejudice.hughes,at quoting united states gonzalez,cir citations omitted.therefore,because miller trial counsel impaneled a biased juror,prejudice under strickland is presumed,and a new trial is required.id.
this court has decided two other notable cases regarding impartial jurors.in wolfe brigano,cir,the trial court denied the defense challenges for cause of four prospective jurors in a murder trial.the first two prospective jurors were close friends of the victim parents.one of these jurors did not think he could be fair and impartial.the other stated that she could be fair and impartial,but conceded that it was hard to say whether her relationship with the victim parents would influence her.id.at.the third prospective juror admitted she read and saw news accounts of the crime and expressed doubt as to whether she could put aside those reports and decide the case solely on the evidence presented at trial.id.at.the fourth prospective juror doubted he would require the prosecution to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.this court held that i n the absence of an affirmative and believable statement that these jurors could set aside their opinions and decide the case on the evidence and in accordance with the law,the failure to dismiss them was unreasonable.id.citing patton,at.this court further stated that it appears that the trial judge based his findings of impartiality exclusively upon each juror tentative statements that they would try to decide this case on the evidence presented at trial.such statements,without more,are insufficient the sixth amendment guarantees wolfe the right to a jury that will hear his case impartially,not one that tentatively promises to try.id.therefore,this court granted habeas relief because the denial of a challenge for cause violated the petitioner sixth amendment right to an impartial jury.
as in wolfe,when juror bell stated,i think i can be fair.but,there was an absence of an affirmative and believable statement that juror bell could set aside her opinion and decide the case on the evidence and in accordance with the law such statements of partiality,without more,are insufficient.see id.
another case in this circuit that involved juror impartiality is miller francis,cir.in miller francis,this court declined to grant habeas relief for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.the defendant was charged and convicted for gross sexual imposition and rape of a minor under the age of thirteen.during voir dire,one juror,patricia furrow furrow,stated that she had knowledge of the case,but could not discuss the case in open court because of privacy concerns.during an in camera examination,furrow indicated that she was a welfare caseworker to the victim mother.furrow stated that she knew what happened,but the victim mother did not use any names and did not discuss the details of the rape or the criminal investigation.furrow expressed concern about participating on the jury.she thought it would be uncomfortable for both herself and the victim mother.in addition,she was worried that the victim mother would try to telephone her during the trial to talk about the case.when the prosecutor asked her whether she could be fair,she replied,tough.i think i could be fair.id.at.when defense counsel later asked whether her professional relationship with the victim mother lent more credence to the charges against his client,furrow answered,no,i do really think that i would be biased.just uncomfortable.id.furrow stated that if a problem arose as a result of her participation as a juror,the victim mother could be reassigned to a new caseworker.defense counsel declined to challenge furrow for cause or use a peremptory challenge to remove the potential juror.the defendant was then convicted for the charged crimes.
the defendant,in his habeas petition,argued that his defense counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge a biased juror and,therefore,the ohio court of appeals unreasonably determined that he was not denied the effective assistance of counsel.this court,however,declined to grant habeas relief,holding that the defendant failed to meet his burden of showing actual bias.this court stated 
because miller claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is founded upon a claim that counsel failed to strike a biased juror,miller must show that the juror was actually biased against him.hughes,at.miller has failed to meet his burden.furrow prior knowledge of the case was not extensive or detailed.furrow indicated during voir dire that the victim mother told her over the phone that her son had been raped,but did not disclose the name of the suspect or any details of the event or the investigation.furrow agreed that she would not necessarily assume that what the victim mother told her was true and that she could base her judgment on the evidence presented at trial.jurors need not be totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved in the case.irvin,at.
miller francis,at.in denying habeas relief,this court distinguished miller francis from hughes by stating that,unlike hughes,the trial court held a separate in camera examination of the juror when she indicated she had some prior knowledge of the case.during the in camera examination,the trial court,the prosecutor,and defense counsel questioned her regarding her knowledge,her relationship with the victim mother,and whether she could be fair and impartial.unlike the juror in hughes,furrow never stated that she could not be fair.while furrow expressed some discomfort about sitting on the jury,she consistently answered that she could be fair.id.at.therefore,the court was not constrained to make a finding of actual bias based upon an undisputed statement of a juror that she could not be fair in deciding the case.id.
unlike miller francis,where there was no statement of partiality,juror bell specifically stated she would be partial to linda cline.juror bell stated that she had sympathy for her and believed she was the victim.juror bell never unequivocally stated that she could be fair.on the contrary,juror bell gave a qualified statement of impartiality.moreover,unlike miller francis,where there was sufficient questioning regarding the relationship between the juror and the victim mother,when juror bell stated,i believe i could be fair about it all.but i do have some feelings about her,neither the trial court nor counsel inquired further regarding whether she could be fair and impartial.without proper questions directed toward rehabilitating the juror or obtaining an assurance of impartiality,we are left with a situation as in hughes in which we found actual bias.although defense counsel asked juror bell about the women section at the warren county jail,he never inquired about whether she could be fair and impartial despite her feelings.he never inquired whether she could determine the case based on the evidence and the trial court instructions.consequently,the present case is distinguishable from miller francis.
iii.conclusion 
because we find counsel performance to have been objectively unreasonable and we find that impaneling a biased juror prejudiced miller,the kentucky court of appeals determination that miller trial counsel performance was not constitutionally deficient was an unreasonable application of strickland,which is clearly established federal law.we,therefore,reverse the district court order denying miller petition,and remand the case with instructions that the district court order petitioner released from custody unless the state commences a new trial within days.
bell statements during voir dire do not demonstrate that she was actually biased against miller,and the majority errs in concluding otherwise.therefore,i respectfully dissent.
as an initial matter,some clarification is in order with respect to the posture of miller ineffective assistance claim.no state court addressed the issue of whether miller counsel performance prejudiced him.consequently,we are not constrained under aedpa by any state court ruling on this matter,and we confront it de novo.see wiggins smith,d maples stegall,cir.more specifically,no state court determined that bell either was or was not actually biased against miller,which is a question of fact.fields woodford,cir see also patton yount,d characterizing the question of a particular juror impartiality as one of historical fact.and while the district court found that bell was not actually biased against miller,it reached this conclusion solely on the basis of transcripts from state court proceedings hence,we review the conclusion de novo rather than for clear error.miller straub,cir.
a defendant may prove that his counsel failure to strike a juror prejudiced him only by showing that the juror was actually biased against him.miller francis,cir emphasis added see also hughes united states,cir petitioner claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is grounded in the claim that counsel failed to strike a biased juror.to maintain a claim that a biased juror prejudiced him,however,petitioner must show that the juror was actually biased against him.emphasis added and alteration in original quoting goeders hundley,cir.actual bias is bias in fact the existence of a state of mind that leads to an inference that the person will not act with entire impartiality.hughes,at quotation omitted see also murphy florida,d explaining that a juror is not impartial if there actually exists an opinion in the mind of the juror as will raise the presumption of partiality quotation omitted.it is distinct from implied bias,which has been described as arising only in extreme situations where the relationship between a prospective juror and some aspect of the litigation is such that it is highly unlikely that the average person could remain impartial in his deliberations under the circumstances.person miller,cir see also united states wood.defining implied bias as a bias attributable in law to the prospective juror regardless of actual partiality.
a juror is impartial if she can disregard her preconceptions and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.united states angel,cir quoting irvin dowd,d.a juror express assurance that she can do so,although not necessarily conclusive,wolfe brigano,cir a court refusal to excuse a juror will not be upheld simply because the court ultimately elicits from the prospective juror a promise that he will be fair and impartial.quotation omitted,indicates that she is impartial.see angel,at miller,at hughes,at stating that juror assurances of impartiality may be relied upon in deciding whether a defendant has satisfied his burden of proving actual prejudice.if a juror makes such an assurance,the defendant must demonstrate that it is not to be credited since he bears the burden of proof on actual bias.see murphy,at.t he juror assurances that he is equal to the task of deciding a case impartially can not be dispositive of the accused rights,and it remains open to the defendant to demonstrate the actual existence of such an opinion in the mind of the juror as will raise the presumption of partiality.quotation omitted see also miller,at noting that it is a defendant burden to show actual bias to succeed on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on failure to strike a biased juror and finding that the defendant did not meet this burden because the juror at issue expressly indicated that she could decide the case impartially and because there was no reason given to doubt this assurance.a juror close and ongoing relationship with a person involved in the case may undermine the reliability of her assurance of impartiality.wolfe,at see also miller,at crediting a juror assurance of impartiality despite her acquaintance with the victim mother because there is no indication from the record that they shared a close personal relationship.but merely being acquainted with someone involved in the case does not.see mcqueen scroggy,cir there is no constitutional prohibition against jurors simply knowing the parties involved the constitution does not require ignorant or uninformed jurors it requires impartial jurors.
miller does not succeed in demonstrating that bell was actually biased against him.bell made numerous express assurances during voir dire that she could decide miller case fairly.specifically,in response to the trial court question as to whether she could be fair and impartial despite her familiarity with and feelings for cline,bell replied,i think i could be fair.i think i could be fair i believe i could be fair and whether she guilty or not guilty.i believe i could be fair about it all.these statements are not so equivocal in and of themselves as to be untenable.see miller,at crediting statements by juror that i think i could be fair and i do really think that i would be biased.indeed,venire members commonly couch their responses to questions concerning bias in terms of i think such that the use of such language can not necessarily be construed as equivocation.id.
furthermore,miller provides no reason to doubt the validity of bell assurances.as evidenced by the fact that bell had not seen cline in at least a year at the time of voir dire,the two did not share a close and ongoing relationship.nor is there any reason to believe that bell sympathy for cline was so strong as to undermine the reliability of her assurance that she could evaluate the case fairly and impartially.expressions of sympathy for a victim,without more,do not demonstrate actual bias where the juror has assured the court that she may decide the case fairly.for example,in ainsworth calderon,cir,a juror indicated during voir dire that she was unsure whether she could disregard the information she had gathered from news sources and decide the case based only on the evidence presented at trial.the defendant sought a change of venue,which was denied.id.at.on habeas review,he claimed that this denial was erroneous because the juror in question was actually prejudiced against him.id.at.the court rejected this assertion,noting that there was no indication that the juror had the opinion that the defendant was the murderer,and she repeatedly stated she could set aside her feelings of sympathy for the victim in order to judge the case fairly.id.at see also celestine blackburn,cir holding that state court did
