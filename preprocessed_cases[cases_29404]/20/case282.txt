frank dibenedetto appeals the district court denial of his habeas corpus petition challenging the constitutionality of his state conviction for a double homicide more than a decade ago.see commonwealth dibenedetto.he is serving a life sentence.
dibenedetto presents two claims,arguing that the determination of the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc on these issues is in error on de novo review and,additionally,that it was contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established supreme court rulings of constitutional law.d supp.ii.dibenedetto first claim is that the trial court refusal to allow him to present evidence that he believed would undermine the key witness for the prosecution violated his rights under the sixth amendment of the united states constitution.his second claim is that the prosecution testing,resulting in the destruction,of physical evidence that may have been exculpatory violated his rights under the sixth and fourteenth amendments.in addition,his case raises questions about the standards by which federal courts ruling on state prisoners habeas petitions review state court decisions that do not,apparently,decide the federal constitutional claims raised.
we affirm the denial of habeas relief,aided by the very helpful decision of the district judge,and,in light of an intervening decision of this court,clarify the standard of review to be applied to state court decisions under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat,when the state court does not decide the federal constitutional claim.
the petitioner dibenedetto was charged with the murders of frank chiuchiolo and joseph bottari.all reportedly had connections to the la cosa nostra organized crime group.the bodies of the two victims were found in a park in boston north end.chiuchiolo had been shot seven times,including five shots to the head,and bottari had been shot sixteen times,including six shots to the head.each had been shot by three separate guns.dibenedetto was tried jointly with codefendant louis costa,while a third individual,paul tanso,was tried separately.the jury found dibenedetto guilty of two counts of first degree murder on charges of deliberate premeditation and extreme atrocity and cruelty.costa was also convicted of first degree murder,while tanso was acquitted.
the prosecution evidence against dibenedetto consisted primarily of the testimony of richard storella,a fully immunized witness who claimed to have been present at the shooting and involved in luring the victims to the scene the testimony of joseph schindler,a lawyer,who observed the shootings from the window of his third floor apartment overlooking the park and dibenedetto sneakers,one of which had trace amounts of something that may have been human blood.dibenedetto arguments on this appeal relate to the first and third pieces of evidence.
storella testimony was key to the prosecution case.storella testified that he and the victims had agreed to rob dibenedetto,a drug dealer and one of storella best friends,of cocaine.the plan was for storella to arrange a buy,and the two others to show up and rob dibenedetto.storella says he later decided to inform dibenedetto of the planned robbery and dibenedetto instructed him to set up the buy as planned.when the victims arrived at the park intending to rob dibenedetto,dibenedetto and his accomplices were armed and waiting to gun them down.prior to the trial,storella had given various inconsistent statements to the police,in depositions,and to the grand jury,including one statement where he confessed to being the killer himself.however,in all storella versions except his initial denial of any knowledge of the shootings,dibenedetto was one of the shooters.
dibenedetto claim is that he was unconstitutionally precluded from introducing evidence of the defense theory that he was being set up by storella to take the fall for a mob hit,and that storella,despite being immunized,was lying in order to curry favor with lead players in the la cosa nostra,whom storella had previously angered.more specifically,dibenedetto theory was that these killings were fallout from the murder of vincent limoli,three and a half months prior to the killings at issue here.limoli,like the victims here,was shot during what was set up as a drug purchase in the same section of the north end.see united states barone,cir describing limoli murder.he argues that the limoli murder was retribution for storella and limoli robbery of a made mob member in and that the two victims in this case had angered the la cosa nostra leadership over their actions in connection with the limoli murder bottari by refusing to act as limoli executioner,and chiuchiolo by breaking the code of silence to tell his sister limoli girlfriend details of the killing.dibenedetto claims that the two victims were killed by the la cosa nostra in retaliation for their disobedience,and that storella,fearing for his own life due to his involvement in the robbery that precipitated all this,was under mob orders to cover up the real story behind the killings.he argues that the trial judge violated his constitutional rights by not allowing him to present evidence of,or storella regarding,the limoli murder fallout theory.
the sneakers,along with the claimed evidence of blood,form the basis of dibenedetto second habeas claim.the witness schindler had identified the shoes as the ones dibenedetto was wearing at the shooting.for years following the arrest,the commonwealth maintained that there was no evidence of blood on the sneakers,and so the prosecution would not use them as evidence.this was the prosecution position in the pretrial conference report.less than a week before the second trial was scheduled to begin,on new year eve day,the prosecution conducted its first swab test on the sneakers,which resulted in a positive result on the left sneaker,indicating a small spot of what was either the blood of a human or some other animal or perhaps certain plant peroxidases.dibenedetto,at.in the process of testing,the sneaker was cleaned of any trace of blood.dibenedetto experts were unable to replicate the test on the left sneaker,but did obtain a positive swab result on the other shoe,where the prosecution swab test had found nothing.the challenge to the sneaker evidence has two components.first,dibenedetto argues that the test,conducted in violation of the pretrial conference report,violated his due process rights.second,he argues that the sneakers were exculpatory evidence which the prosecution did not take sufficient steps to prevent from becoming contaminated and destroyed in the process of testing.
this case has been to the sjc twice.on dibenedetto first appeal,the sjc reversed the murder conviction because the witness storella had been unavailable to testify and the trial judge erroneously admitted his recorded testimony as evidence against dibenedettto.commonwealth dibenedetto.at dibenedetto second trial,storella did testify and dibenedetto was again convicted of murder in the first degree.dibenedetto again appealed to the sjc,presenting the claims that he presents here on habeas,as well as many additional claims not argued here.the sjc affirmed the conviction,albeit apparently without considering either claim as a federal constitutional claim.dibenedetto.
on the exclusion of evidence concerning the limoli murder,the sjc affirmed the trial court conclusions that,as a matter of state law,the limoli killing was too remote to be relevant and that the evidence was too complicated and would divert the jury attention.the sjc concluded that dibenedetto had proffered no evidence,other than speculation,that anyone else had a motive to kill chiuchiolo and bottari,or to show that the murders were sufficiently similar.similarly,the sjc concluded that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in barring of storella regarding the limoli murder and his alleged fear of retribution from the la cosa nostra.the sjc did not discuss the sixth amendment implications of these decisions.
with regard to the admission of the evidence indicating the possible presence of blood on one of dibenedetto sneakers,the sjc relied on its precedent in commonwealth willie,which held that when potentially exculpatory evidence is lost or destroyed,a balancing test is employed the courts must weigh the culpability of the commonwealth,the materiality of the evidence and the potential prejudice to the defendant.at.based on this balancing test,the sjc held that there was no doubt that the commonwealth failed to comply with the pretrial conference report,but that dibenedetto failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the testing of the sneakers for blood.dibenedetto,at.again,the sjc decision cited only massachusetts judicial decisions and did not discuss the federal constitutional claims that were raised.
under the standard established in aedpa,a habeas petition may not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d supp.ii.a state court findings on factual issues shall be presumed to be correct and the petitioner bears the burden of disproving factual findings by clear and convincing evidence.e.
in this case,the proper application of the aedpa standard warrants further discussion.in the district court,dibenedetto argued that,because the sjc decision does not discuss dibenedetto constitutional claims or federal constitutional case law,these claims should be reviewed de novo by the federal courts.the district court rejected this argument.
the district court cited to d stressing the words resulted in and involved to support its conclusion that the state court ultimate holding,not its rationalization process,is what matters under aedpa.dibenedetto hall,slip op.at.it is correct that when the state court has addressed the federal constitutional issue,it is its ultimate outcome,and not its rationalization,which is the focus.see hurtado tucker,cir,cert.denied,d.but that does not mean the deferential standard applies where the state court has not addressed the constitutional issue.
in our view,the critical point is the preceding clause in the statute,which states that the deferential standard used applies to claims that were adjudicated on the merits in the state courts.d.if the state court has not decided the federal constitutional claim even by reference to state court decisions dealing with federal constitutional issues,then we can not say that the constitutional claim was adjudicated on the merits within the meaning of and therefore entitled to the deferential review prescribed in subsection d.this was the holding of our recent decision in fortini murphy,which forecloses the district court approach here,cir w e can hardly defer to the state court on an issue that the state court did not address.accord hameen delaware,cir applying independent review of constitutional claim where state court decision rested on state statutory construction,cert.denied,d.
faced with state court opinions that do not decide constitutional claims raised by the defendant,the fortini approach requires that federal courts apply de novo review to the federal constitutional claims raised in habeas petitions.
because the sjc chose to decide both issues on state law grounds,we review both de novo as to the first claim,we particularly note that the commonwealth,arguing that the sjc findings that the limoli murder was too remote and not sufficiently similar are state law determinations has taken the position that the state rule is an independent rule to which we must give deference.taken to its logical conclusion,this argument confirms that the sjc discussion of the evidentiary claim does not address the federal rule,even implicitly.
the first question is whether the trial court decision to exclude evidence supporting a defense theory was in error as a matter of federal constitutional law.
limoli murder fallout theory 
dibenedetto argues that his right to present a defense was severely compromised by the trial court refusal to allow evidence or concerning the alleged mob murder of limoli and the ensuing fallout.he maintains that this was crucial on two fronts both to showing that others had motive to kill the victims and were the most likely killers,and to showing that the immunized witness storella was biased,in that he feared retaliation from the la cosa nostra if he did not testify against dibenedetto.dibenedetto argues,as he must in a habeas petition,that this refusal rises to the level of violating his constitutional rights,including his sixth amendment right to present a defense and confront witnesses against him and his fourteenth amendment due process rights.
compulsory process claim 
dibenedetto claims that his sixth amendment right to compulsory process was violated by the trial judge refusal to allow him to present any evidence regarding the limoli murder,some three and a half months prior to the murders at issue in this case,and the connection of the victims and key prosecution witness to limoli murder.
we start with a statement of the federal rule.under the sixth amendment compulsory process clause,criminal defendants generally have the right to present competent,reliable exculpatory evidence.crane kentucky,d state rule excluding evidence concerning means by which a voluntary confession was obtained violated sixth amendment see also chambers mississippi,d application of state hearsay rule to bar testimony regarding third party repeated confession of crime violated defendant sixth amendment rights.nonetheless,as we pointed out in fortini,the supreme court cases undoing state court convictions based on exclusion of evidence involve egregious situations and the more recent decisions of the court create serious doubts that the court is interested in carrying the doctrine beyond egregious cases.at.
in one of its more recent cases,the supreme court held that a defendant right to present relevant evidence is not unlimited,but rather is subject to reasonable restrictions,including the state legitimate interest in ensuring that reliable evidence is presented,and evidentiary exclusions will not violate the constitution so long as they are not arbitrary or disproportionate to the purposes they are designed to serve.united states scheffer,d quoting rock arkansas,d.
dibenedetto first offered the mob fallout theory on the basis that it tended to show that culprits,not dibenedetto and his codefendant,were guilty.evidence that tends to prove a person other than the defendant committed a crime is relevant,but there must be evidence that there is a connection between the other perpetrators and the crime,not mere speculation on the part of the defendant.united states patrick,cir.the trial judge found the connection too attenuated,holding that the evidence tended to show the limoli murder was committed by two men who were not in massachusetts on the date of the murders and there was no evidence to show the two were involved.the defense then further refined its theory,arguing that the reason limoli was from a mob just as well to storella,whose life was spared,but who was left in the unenviable position of owing a favor to the mob.both victims here had defied the la cosa nostra leadership,like limoli,giving the mob reason to execute them.the trial court considered this to be a different motive than the one provided by storella for the murder,but one that did not exclude dibenedetto as the executioner.further,the trial judge found,assuming that limoli had been ordered executed,that there was no evidence of any such order as to these victims.and the trial judge viewed this as raising an issue that would divert the jury from the central issue.
whether evidence is too speculative involves a subset of other questions.here,the state courts said the two crimes were too remote and dissimilar and so the connection was speculative we are doubtful the crimes were only three and a half months apart,showed certain commonalities of modus operandi,had one overlapping m
