anitra coomer,a michigan state prisoner,appeals the dismissal of her petition for a writ of habeas corpus.coomer challenges the district court determination that two of her confessions to murder were not obtained in violation of miranda.for the following reasons,we affirm the district court denial of habeas relief.
kidnaping,murder,and police investigation 
on may,deborah iverson,opthamologist and mother of two,was kidnapped and murdered in her car after she left her psychiatrist office in birmingham,michigan.iverson vehicle was found the next day,parked in a rural area of macomb county.inside was iverson body.an autopsy revealed that she had been strangled to death,and further investigation revealed that two of iverson checks had been cashed at two banks on the morning of her disappearance.over seven months later,on december,police officers received a tip that anitra coomer and mcconnell adams were behind the crime.
the evidence at trial established the following circumstances of the case.coomer and adams lived together with their son in an apartment in clawson,michigan.on may,their rent was overdue and they owed to their provider.at,coomer and adams dropped their son off with their provider and proceeded to birmingham,a town about twenty miles outside of detroit.meanwhile,iverson left her psychiatrist office at,but never returned home.nearly hours later,the police found iverson toyota land cruiser on the side of a highway.
inside the car,the police found iverson lying face down on the floor of the back seat.they found blood on the right side of her face and a line mark on her neck.her jacket was missing a large square piece and some spots on it were faded.iverson was clutching in her hand a picture of one of her sons.the medical examiner performed an autopsy the next day and later testified that iverson had been dead for at least hours at the time that her remains were discovered.the cause of death was ligature strangulation,which involved the use of some kind of noose around her neck,such as a belt.the medical examiner also testified that the ligature pattern indicated that there might have been a struggle,that the strangulation was not quick,and that it might have been agonizing.
police did not discover any new leads until december.the day prior,coomer telephoned her friend mark dawson,telling him that adams had beaten her.at the time,coomer was at the home of another friend,anita krawczyk.dawson went to krawczyk home that afternoon,and coomer told him about the iverson murder.coomer told dawson that she and adams had originally planned to rob iverson,but after cashing two checks,adams strangled iverson with coomer belt.coomer and adams then sprayed iverson body and the inside of the car with bleach.coomer told dawson that she had not reported adams assault because he was holding the murder over her.dawson later testified that krawczyk later called the police to report the assault.when the police arrived,coomer told them that adams had beaten her and left in a stolen truck.
as coomer and krawczyk were driving to the police station to report the domestic assault,coomer told her that she was worried about being arrested for the iverson murder,and that she and adams had agreed that if they were ever caught,he would take all the blame so that she could remain free to raise their son.shortly thereafter,adams was arrested for domestic assault.
on december,dawson attorney contacted the sheriff department with information that coomer was involved in the iverson murder.dawson later met with two officers from the sheriff department and told them what coomer had told him.police officers left for coomer apartment later that night.
police arrive at coomer apartment 
the facts surrounding coomer confessions at her apartment were explored in considerable detail during an evidentiary hearing conducted by the michigan trial court.the court summarized the testimony as follows 
the evidence here showed that approximately nine to eleven officers were at the scene of defendant coomer apartment on december,at about defendant coomer testified that two marked cars were parked in a manner that she could observe them blocking her vehicle,while all other witnesses testified that no police vehicles were parked in a manner that defendant coomer could observe them out any of her apartment windows.
defendant coomer testified that she had never had any prior experience with police officers and had had a friend over one to one and a half hours earlier in the evening with whom she used alcohol and marijuana.the evidence is not clear as to w h ether she was told that she was under arrest.sergeant kucyk indicated that she had been told that she was not.defendant indicated that no one told her whether she was or not.defendant coomer was years of age,had graduated from high school and had a grade point average.
there was extensive testimony offered by the people to establish where each officer stood,what role each officer played and where each officer parked.the testimony given by numerous officers was consistent as to overall locations and roles with minor variations as to the exact location of a fellow officer vehicle or position.
defendant testified that when she opened her door,she saw at least three uniformed officers at her door,while two plain clothes officers stepped from behind a wall.defendant further testified that three officers entered her apartment while two remained outside her door on detective kucyk instruction.the people elicited consistent testimony from the officers that placed only three officers at her door with only two plain plain clothes officers entering the apartment.coomer testified that one police officer came inside only momentarily and left within minutes thereafter leaving only kucyk and sergeant sanborn inside the apartment when coomer first confession was made.
defendant testified that an officer accompanied her through the apartment while she searched for cigarettes during her confession.the officers testified this did not occur and defendant had had the opportunity to walk throughout her apartment freely at all times.finally,defendant testified that she felt that she was in custody the moment she saw sergeant kucyk at her door because she had seen him on the news and knew him to be the lead detective in the iverson homicide investigation.
the evidence further showed that defendant coomer invited the officers into her apartment upon their request by intercom and shortly commenced telling them her version of what she knew about deborah iverson.while she was not advised of her rights until about four hours later,there was no physical or mental abuse of any nature exercised by the police.while defendant testified that she had used alcohol and marijuana earlier,at least one to one and hours had passed since consumption and there was no apparent signs of intoxication n or was defendant in ill health or deprived of sleep.
when asked by the court if she felt coerced in any way,defendant replied no.in fact,she gave her verbal statements to officers while weeping,suggesting remorse but clearly without any signs of threats or coercion appearing from the testimony on the record.
ja at.in addition,patrolman hannah of the clawson police department,who first called coomer on her intercom before proceeding to her apartment,had previous contact with coomer on matters related to domestic assault.kucyk testified that he told coomer,when in her apartment,that he and sanborn were present to talk with her,that she was not under arrest,and importantly,that if she asked them to leave,they would go.kucyk also stated that he told coomer several times during their discussion that she was not under arrest.
coomer confessions 
once the officers were in the apartment,coomer asked them to be quiet because her old son was asleep and offered them refreshments.they all sat at the kitchen table,and kucyk indicated that he wanted to speak about iverson.kucyk testified that,at that point,coomer became shaken,concerned,and hysterical.coomer asked if she could get her cigarettes from her bedroom,which she did,and proceeded to tell the officers the whole story.ja at.coomer then confessed her involvement in the iverson murder.few questions were asked of her most of her oral statements were offered in a continuous narrative over the next thirty minutes.coomer testified that while she cried at various points during her statements,she had otherwise calmed down once she began to speak.she also conceded at trial that the oral statement was voluntary,and not compelled or coerced.
after giving this oral statement,coomer prepared a written statement for the police.this written statement was later excluded by the state trial court and is not the subject of this appeal.after writing down her statement,sergeant kucyk asked if coomer would accompany him to the sheriff department.coomer agreed and was allowed to arrange for a babysitter for her son.coomer was transported by sergeants sanborn and roberts and was provided with cigarettes and a soda on the way to the station,arriving at approximately 
at the station,coomer was escorted to an interview room,where kucyk joined them.kucyk had last seen coomer about an hour earlier in her apartment.kucyk told coomer that the circumstances had changed,that she was now in custody,and that he was required to read her miranda rights.coomer was given miranda warnings at and was offered a waiver of rights form dated december.coomer declined an offer of food.kucyk then intimated that he wished to question her some more.coomer agreed and repeated her story,adding some minor details of the crime.this statement lasted about thirty to minutes,and coomer acknowledged at the trial court hearing that she waived her rights and spoke freely with the officers.
coomer trial testimony 
coomer testified at trial on her own behalf.she said that while she and adams planned to rob a woman,she did not expect anyone to get hurt and that adams made all the decisions.she stated that adams noticed the land cruiser,checked its parking meter,looked inside,and saw certain items likely to be in a woman possession.when iverson approached her car,adams placed a bb gun to iverson back and forced her into her car.according to coomer,when adams asked for coomer belt,he said that he was just going to tie up iverson.after giving him the belt,coomer went into the arbor drug store.when she returned,she resumed driving and did not look in the back seat.when she stopped at a stop sign,coomer looked in the rearview mirror and saw that adams was no longer kneeling over iverson on the floor,but was sitting in the back seat.anitra,adams said,it done.it over.coomer testified that she then began to cry.
according to coomer,adams told her to drive home,where adams picked up another vehicle.they then drove out to macomb county and left iverson lifeless body in her car on the side of a highway.on december,police officers executed a search warrant at coomer apartment and found her black leather coat with belt loops,but no belt,and a spray bottle of bleach under the sink.
procedural background 
coomer was tried jointly with adams but before separate juries in michigan circuit court for the county of oakland.the trial court excluded coomer written confession made in her apartment on the ground that it violated miranda.however,the trial court permitted the admission of her two oral confessions the first at her apartment,the other at the police station.the jury found coomer guilty of two counts of murder,and one count of kidnaping.the trial court sentenced coomer to life imprisonment for the murder and fifteen to sixty years for the kidnaping.the michigan court of appeals vacated coomer kidnaping conviction on double jeopardy grounds and affirmed coomer murder conviction coomer appealed to the michigan supreme court but was denied leave to appeal.see people coomer,table.
coomer filed her federal habeas corpus petition in the eastern district of michigan on june,among other arguments,coomer contended that her first oral confession in her apartment was taken in violation of miranda,and that her confession at the police station was insufficiently removed from the taint of the miranda violation arising from her written confession in her apartment.the district court denied coomer petition,finding that the state courts conclusions were not entirely unreasonable inasmuch as they held that coomer oral confessions were lawfully obtained.ja at emphasis added.the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to,and this court exercises jurisdiction under.
standard of review 
the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,placed a new constraint on the power of a federal habeas court to grant a state prisoner application for a writ of habeas corpus with respect to claims adjudicated on the merits in state court.williams taylor,d.coomer petition for a writ of habeas corpus may be granted only if she can show that the state court adjudication of her claims on the merits 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
under the contrary to clause,a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by th e supreme court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than th e supreme court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.williams,at.conversely,u nder the unreasonable application clause,a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from th e supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.id.at.a state court need not cite supreme court cases on point or even be aware of such cases,so long as neither the reasoning nor the result of the decision contradicts them.early packer,d per curiam.furthermore,state findings of fact are presumed to be correct unless the defendant can rebut the presumption by clear and convincing evidence.baze parker,cir citing e.this review is conducted in light of the law as it existed at the time of the final state court decision,teague lane,d,unless an intervening decision of constitutional import announces a watershed rule of criminal law with implications for the fundamental fairness of the trial proceeding,caspari bohlen,d.this court reviews the district court legal conclusions de novo.greer mitchell,cir.
coomer made three confessions to the police.while the state trial court excluded coomer written confession made at her apartment,the court admitted coomer oral statements made at her apartment and at the police station.we will thus examine only the admission of coomer two oral statements because the exclusion of her written confession in her apartment is not raised in this appeal.
b.the oral confession at coomer apartment 
state court decisions 
the state trial court permitted coomer oral confession at her apartment to be admitted at trial.it reasoned that coomer was in her own apartment in the presence of another individual known to her,and that the questioning was minimal and brief.ja at.it concluded that a reasonable person would not have felt like he or she was in custody,and thus,the police were not required to issue a miranda warning.the michigan court of appeals reached the same conclusion 
the evidence showed that defendant permitted the police officers to enter her apartment building and permitted them to enter her apartment the officers did not display weapons,and kucyk indicated that he informed defendant several times that she was not under arrest.kucyk also told defendant that if she wanted them to leave,they would go defendant proceeded to give a statement,largely in narrative form,with little police questioning.she fully acknowledged that she was not compelled or coerced to give a statement.
ja at.thus,the court held that the totality of the circumstances indicates that coomer was not in custody at her apartment.ja at.
supreme court precedent 
we begin by determining the relevant,clearly established law.we must ascertain,de novo,whether the state court decisions concerning coomer first oral statement were contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,supreme court precedent.for purposes of d,clearly established law as determined by the supreme court of the united states refers to the holdings,as opposed to the dicta,of this court decisions as of the time of the relevant decision.williams,at.
the fifth amendment to the constitution states that n o person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.const.amend.v.in the seminal case of miranda arizona,the court held that warnings are required in the context of custodial interrogations given the compulsion inherent in custodial surroundings,d.the court defined custodial interrogation to include any circumstance where a suspect deprived of his freedom by the authorities in any significant way and is subjected to questioning.id.at.however,the court did not have occasion to apply that test to a set of facts.
in succeeding cases,the court has fleshed out the relevant law concerning the circumstances under which a suspect may be considered in custody.in berkemer mccarty,the court instructed that the only relevant inquiry is how a reasonable man in the suspect position would have understood his situation,d.a policeman unarticulated plan has no bearing on the question of whether a suspect was in custody at a particular time.id.the court elaborated further in stansbury california,which was cited and relied upon by the michigan court of appeals in this case,d.in stansbury,the supreme court explained that the initial determination of custody depends on the objective circumstances of the interrogation,not on the subjective views harbored by either the interrogating officers or the person being questioned.id.at.
subsequent to stansbury,the supreme court framed the proper inquiry as involving two essential questions f irst,what were the circumstances surrounding the interrogation and second,given those circumstances,would a reasonable person have felt he or she was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave.thompson keohane,d.the court directed that o nce the scene is set and the players lines and actions are reconstructed,the court must apply an objective test to resolve the ultimate inquiry was there a formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.id.
the sixth circuit added further guidance on the custody determination in united states salvo,where this court explained that courts should consider the following factors 
the purpose of the questioning whether the place of the questioning was hostile or coercive the length of the questioning and other indicia of custody such as whether the suspect was informed at the time that the questioning was voluntary or that the suspect was free to leave or to request the officers to do so whether the suspect possessed unrestrained freedom of movement during questioning and whether the suspect initiated contact with the police or voluntarily admitted the officers to the residence and acquiesced to their requests to answer some questions.
for the following reasons,we conclude that the state court decisions were not unreasonable,and that coomer oral confession in her apartment was properly admitted.examining the totality of the circumstances,and mindful of the salvo factors,the evidence at trial showed that a reasonable person would not have ultimately felt that his or her freedom was restrained in a manner associated with a formal arrest.at the outset,we recognize that some facts could support a custodial determination.for instance,coomer testified that the police arrived at a late hour that police cars blocked her vehicle on her driveway that up to eleven officers,uniformed and,came to coomer building and that the purpose of the police questioning was,as coomer alleges,to focus the investigation on coomer herself.however,that the police did not already have probable cause to arrest coomer is immaterial to our analysis here,because any inquiry into whether the interrogating officers have focused their suspicions upon the individual being questioned assuming those suspicions remain undisclosed is not relevant for purposes of miranda.stansbury,at.more importantly,no one factor is dispositive of the custody issue.id.at.
other material facts support the state courts decisions.first,coomer voluntarily allowed the police into her apartment building and was questioned in her own home.while an interrogation in one home is not determinative alone of the custodial inquiry,it is usually indicative of the absence of the isolation inherent in custodial interrogations.see beckwith united states,d finding that the suspect,who was questioned in his home,hardly found himself in the custodial situation described by the miranda court as the basis for its holding,because miranda concerned the principal psychological factor of isolating the suspect in unfamiliar surroundings for no purpose other than to subjugate the individual to the will of his examiner quoting miranda,at.
second,coomer confession lasted only thirty minutes,taking the form primarily of a narrative and prompted by little police questioning.this fact suggests that coomer was relieved to discuss her role in a murder after more than six months of avoiding the authorities.the trial court also noted that coomer teary demeanor reinforced the impression that coomer exuded remorse,and we add that the merely intermittent police questioning and coomer narrative confession suggest an act born of free will,not an act born of coercion.in other words,if coomer was coerced,it was not by the police,but by her conscience.
third,and perhaps most significantly,kucyk testified that he told coomer several times that she was not under arrest and that the police would leave if asked.see salvo,at acknowledging that one of the most important factors in the custody inquiry is whether an officer explicitly informs a suspect that he or she is not under arrest.the state court adjudication can not be unreasonable where no governing precedent of the supreme court or court of appeals decision that can be located holds that a person was in custody after being clearly advised of his freedom to leave or terminate questioning.united states czichray,cir see also united states brown,cir a dvising a defendant that he is free to leave and is not in custody is a powerful factor in the mix,and generally will lead to the conclusion that the defendant is not in custody.emphasis in original salvo,at recognizing that a statement by an officer to a suspect that he was free to leave at any time is an important factor in finding that the suspect was not in custody.
to be sure,coomer testified that her subjective belief was that she was not free to leave,but the supreme court has repeatedly instructed courts to dismiss a suspect subjective thoughts.see,stansbury,at.at the same time,coomer conceded at trial that her confession was not coerced or compelled.ja at.coomer moved freely around her apartment,offered the officers refreshments,and told the officers to stay quiet out of respect for her sleeping son.these facts imply that coomer exercised control over her surroundings in her own home,not that she was controlled by her interrogators,as was the concern in miranda.see miranda,at.viewing the totality of the circumstances,we find that the state courts decisions that a reasonable person would not have felt in custody in coomer situation were not unreasonable applications of the relevant,clearly established law.
coomer argues that this court should proceed directly to a harmless error analysis because she presupposes that she was in custody prior to her first confession.she contends that the district court held that coomer was in custody at the time of the first half of her initial confession,and therefore in violation of miranda,but that despite this violation,the court found the error harmless because,in the district court words,it did not have a substantial and injurious effect on the jury verdict.appellant br.at quoting ja at.
coomer profoundly misconstrues the district court holding.the
