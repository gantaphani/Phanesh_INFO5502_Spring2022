joseph gardner,convicted of murder and kidnapping and sentenced to death by a south carolina court,appeals the district court denial of his petition for federal habeas relief.we granted a certificate of appealability on four issues did gardner suffer a violation of his right to a fair trial before an impartial jury and was gardner denied effective assistance of counsel by the failure of his trial attorneys to exercise a peremptory challenge to remove a juror present his mitigation evidence in a more accurate and compelling manner during sentencing or object to,rather than facilitate,the admission of highly inflammatory testimony that racial animus motivated gardner crimes.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court denial of habeas relief.
on the basis of strong evidence,including the detailed testimony of,a south carolina jury convicted gardner,an man,of the december,kidnapping and brutal murder of melissa mclaughlan,a caucasian woman.the jury also found the aggravating circumstances of criminal sexual conduct,kidnapping,and physical torture and recommended that gardner receive a death sentence,which the state court then imposed.following gardner unsuccessful direct appeal,state gardner,the supreme court denied certiorari,gardner south carolina,d.gardner next petitioned for relief in state court.the state relief court pcr court denied his claims for relief,as did the supreme court of south carolina.gardner then filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court,pursuant to west supp.the district court denied relief without ruling on gardner application for a certificate of appealability.we granted gardner a certificate of appealability on the four issues enumerated above.
the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,d,requires a federal court to defer to a state court judgment on the merits when considering a petition for habeas relief.thus,a federal court can not grant habeas relief on any claim adjudicated on the merits by the state court unless the state decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.id.
gardner contends initially that the seating of a juror,who he claims knowingly withheld disqualifying information,violated his right to a fair trial before an impartial jury,as guaranteed by the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution.gardner asserts that during voir dire the juror intentionally withheld her belief that her son had been murdered,because she knew that disclosure of that belief might have established cause for her removal from the jury.
the sixth amendment provides that i n all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial,by an impartial jury.const.amend.vi see irvin dowd,d holding that the fourteenth amendment requires that states guarantee a fair trial by a panel of impartial jurors.the supreme court has interpreted this text to mean that a criminal defendant has a constitutional right to a jury free from prejudice and capable and willing to decide the case solely on the evidence before it.smith phillips,d.to protect that right,a trial judge must be ever watchful to prevent prejudicial occurrences,and therefore must conduct voir dire in a manner that adequately identifies unqualified or potentially biased jurors,see morgan illinois,d.
to establish entitlement to a new trial because of alleged juror dishonesty during voir dire,a defendant must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question and then further show that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.mcdonough power,greenwood,d.this test applies equally to deliberate concealment and to innocent.conner polk,cir.
the pcr court rejected gardner claim of juror deceit.the court found that defense counsel could have questioned the juror about the impact of violent crimes on her life,but did not do so thus,the juror never failed to answer honestly a material question,as required by mcdonough,at.moreover,relying on the juror affirmation during voir dire that she could grant a fair trial to both sides,the pcr court found her not to be biased against any party.at the pcr hearing,the juror also testified regarding her earlier statement to defense investigators that if she had told the court about her son killing she would not have been allowed on the jury.based on her subsequent testimony at the relief hearing and the context of her earlier statement,the pcr court found that her statement did not reflect bias or intentional concealment,but only surprise that defense counsel did not question her on this point.the pcr court found that the juror truthful demeanor supported this conclusion.the pcr court also noted that the juror credibly testified at the pcr hearing that,if asked,she would have disclosed her views regarding her son death at voir dire,but she did not volunteer them because she did not believe them important,as she had no proof to back them up.on the basis of these findings,the pcr court concluded that gardner failed to satisfy the first prong of the mcdonough test and so denied gardner request for a new trial.
we can not conclude that,in rejecting gardner claim,the pcr court acted contrary to,or unreasonably applied,clearly established supreme court precedent.see d.like the state court,we do not believe that the record demonstrates that the juror failed to answer honestly any voir dire question.see mcdonough,at.nor does the record suggest that the juror held any actual or implied bias against any party such that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.see also phillips,at,concurring explaining that the doctrine of implied bias should be applied only in limited and extreme circumstances united states fulks,cir rejecting a claim of implied bias when a juror inadvertently failed to disclose her husband murder.
thus,we must reject gardner contention that the state court unreasonably applied or acted contrary to established federal law in concluding that gardner failed to demonstrate juror bias or partiality.
gardner remaining claims all rest on an asserted denial of his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.
to prove a sixth amendment violation and succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance,a defendant must first demonstrate that counsel performance was deficient in that it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.strickland washington,d.the defendant must next establish that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.id.at.to demonstrate prejudice,he must show that there is a reasonable probability that,absent the alleged deficiency,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.at.
gardner raises three ineffective assistance contentions.he challenges the conduct of his lawyers during voir dire,their preparation of mitigation evidence during the sentencing phase of his trial,and their handling of the testimony of two prosecution witnesses who stated that racial animus motivated gardner crimes.the state pcr court adjudicated each of these claims on the merits and determined in each instance that gardner had failed to establish ineffective assistance.we consider each of these ineffective assistance claims in turn.
the first claim concerns the alleged bias of a second juror.gardner contends that defense counsel rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance by failing to exercise a peremptory strike to remove this juror after the juror twice admitted during voir dire that she could not be completely impartial.brief of appellant at.he characterizes the juror ultimate assertion that she could decide the case impartially as mere acquiescence to the demands of the court and trial counsel that she issue a firm statement of impartiality.id.at.
although this juror admitted early in voir dire that she had,to a certain extent,formed an opinion about the case based on television coverage,after apparent hesitation,she also averred that she could lay aside any opinion she had formed and decide this case based solely on the evidence and testimony presented in this courtroom.when questioned by defense counsel regarding her initial hesitation,the juror answered,i can tell you i would try and i feel like that i could be,but as far as percent,i ca.defense counsel asked once more whether the juror could render a fair and impartial verdict based on only the evidence presented in court,to which the juror then replied,i feel that for certain that i could.following this exchange,defense counsel challenged that juror for cause,but the trial judge denied the challenge and held the juror qualified to serve.defense counsel did not exercise a peremptory challenge the juror therefore served on the jury that convicted gardner and recommended the death penalty.
the pcr court examined gardner allegations of counsel deficiency for failure to exercise a peremptory challenge to strike the juror and concluded that gardner had not made the showing required by strickland.the court found that counsel decision not to use a peremptory challenge was a tactical decision,which neither demonstrated counsel deficiency nor prejudiced gardner.the court noted that only two jurors had been seated when defense counsel had to decide whether to exercise a peremptory challenge with respect to this juror,and the defense already had used three of its ten allotted peremptory challenges.the pcr court concluded that counsel could reasonably have decided to forego the peremptory challenge of this juror and reserve its remaining peremptory challenges for other,potentially more problematic,jurors.
on habeas review,federal courts generally accord particular deference to the judgment of trial counsel during voir dire.hughes united states,cir.the record in this case well supports the state pcr court determination that gardner did not satisfy the performance prong of strickland.we find entirely plausible the state court characterization of defense counsel choice as tactical.defense counsel conduct easily falls within an objective standard of reasonableness and conforms with prevailing professional norms.strickland,at.
the pcr court also determined that removal of this juror would not have changed the outcome of the case.the record provides equally strong support for this finding.the trial transcript offers no evidence that counsel actions resulted in the seating of a juror biased or otherwise prejudiced against gardner.the juror in question unequivocally told the trial judge at voir dire that she could decide the case based solely on the evidence presented in court,that she held no bias for or against either party,and that she would give both sides a fair and impartial trial.moreover,in the hearing,gardner failed to offer any evidence of asserted prejudice resulting from the juror service.he simply averred then,as he does before us now,that the participation of a biased juror is presumptively prejudicial because we hold that the state court did not err in concluding that the juror was not biased,gardner presumptive prejudice argument must fail.
in sum,we agree with the state court that counsel conduct in not exercising a peremptory strike to prevent service by this juror neither constituted deficient representation nor resulted in prejudice to gardner.the state court neither unreasonably applied nor acted contrary to clearly established supreme court precedent.d.therefore,this claim too fails.
gardner next contends that his attorneys presented inadequate mitigation evidence during the sentencing phase of his trial and that this asserted failure constituted constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel.he argues that his attorneys presented vague and inconsistent mitigation evidence and expert testimony that inadequately and inaccurately described his mental condition.he also maintains that defense counsel failed to present evidence that would have provided a more accurate and compelling account of his background and mental state.
criminal defendants have a constitutionally protected right to provide the jury with mitigating evidence that may affect the jury assessment of whether a sentence is just and appropriate.see williams taylor,d.for this reason,defense counsel have an obligation to conduct a thorough investigation of the defendant background in order to identify and produce mitigation evidence failure to do so renders an attorney performance deficient.id.at.but when determining whether counsel has delivered a constitutionally deficient performance,a state court also may consider a defendant own degree of cooperation,even in a capital case.see frye lee,cir.
the pcr court rejected gardner contention that his counsel did not adequately investigate and present evidence of his background for mitigation purposes.the court found that despite gardner lack of cooperation,counsel made diligent attempts to obtain mitigating information.the court further determined that virtually all of the evidence that gardner contends counsel should have presented to the jury,counsel did in fact present.for example,the court found that the additional experts who testified at the pcr hearing offered essentially the same evidence as those who testified at trial,albeit in a more compelling form.
the state court holding that defense counsel investigated and presented mitigation evidence in an objectively reasonable manner is not unreasonable or contrary to clearly established supreme court precedent.both defense attorneys testified before the pcr court,without contradiction,that gardner advised his family members not to cooperate with counsel efforts to develop mitigating evidence.they also testified that gardner refused,until shortly before the beginning of his trial,to provide medical releases that might have aided counsel in developing mitigation evidence.nevertheless,defense counsel continued to seek mitigating information from gardner family,even traveling to gardner home in detroit to obtain that information.they also consulted with two medical experts regarding gardner mental condition.in sum,the record reveals that,although burdened by an uncooperative client,defense counsel made significant efforts to develop and present mitigation evidence.given these facts,we can not say that the state court acted unreasonably in concluding that counsel actions did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness.strickland,at.
the pcr court also concluded that even if gardner had established that defense counsel presented a constitutionally deficient mitigation case,he still could not demonstrate that this deficiency prejudiced him.in support of this conclusion,the court found that the abundant evidence introduced during the liability phase strongly indicated gardner guilt,and since the sentence in a death penalty trial depends in large part on what occurred in the guilt phase,the strength of this evidence likely provided the critical reason for the jury conclusion that gardner conduct warranted a death sentence.the court also reiterated its prior conclusion that,during the penalty phase,the defense presented the jury virtually the same evidence that gardner believes essential to his mitigation case,although counsel did so in a less dramatic form than gardner now claims was required.the court further found that even if the defense had offered marginally more persuasive mitigating evidence,for example,testimony of physicians who could provide a more dire and detailed portrait of gardner mental state,such evidence would not have materially helped gardner mitigation case.finally,the pcr court observed that during the sentencing phase,the jury found three aggravating,criminal sexual conduct,and physical the court concluded that the very substantial evidence establishing these factors would have outweighed even the more detailed mitigation evidence now proposed by gardner.
on the basis of these findings,the state court held that there was no reasonable probability that,if the jury had heard the additional,more detailed mitigating evidence now proposed by gardner,the jury would have determined tha
