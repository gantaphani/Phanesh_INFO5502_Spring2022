on may,kumal burton,was convicted of murder in violation of.comp.laws and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony in violation of.comp.laws on june,burton was sentenced to life imprisonment for his murder conviction and two years imprisonment for the firearm charge.burton now appeals the district court decision denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.we affirm.
background 
burton convictions arise from the june,shooting death of sherman mcclayton in the parking lot of the black and tan bar in lansing,michigan.at some time before on june,burton and mcclayton had a disagreement at the black and tan bar,with mcclayton apparently telling burton a detroit resident that he did not like people from detroit.later,at around,burton arrived at the west lapeer street residence of markita robinson.markita robinson and her sister,nikita robinson,testified that burton retrieved a firearm from the residence and said he was going to kill mcclayton.burton then left the residence and drove back to the black and tan bar.when burton arrived,several people were standing in the parking lot near a food truck selling chicken.burton parked his car and stepped out of the vehicle.burton and mcclayton frowned or scowled at one another,and then burton fired several shots at mcclayton,got in his car,and drove away.burton returned to the west lapeer residence around,told the robinson sisters that he had killed mcclayton,and asked the robinsons to take the gun,which was hot and smelled of smoke.
several months later,in september,burton and an acquaintance,jackie robinson harris,were watching television when a news broadcaster announced that burton was the shooter in the mcclayton incident.upon hearing the announcement,burton grabbed his keys and left,saying,i out of here.later that evening,burton said he was returning to detroit.burton was subsequently arrested in detroit in december,and on january,the state of michigan filed an information charging burton with murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.
following burton arrest,george zulakis,a attorney,was assigned to represent burton.on january,ingham county circuit court judge carolyn stell set the case for trial on february.burton family collected the funds necessary to retain private counsel for burton,and on january,thomas warshaw filed with the ingham county circuit court a notice of his substitution as counsel in place of zulakis.
in early to mid february,warshaw filed a motion with the ingham county circuit court to adjourn trial.warshaw,apparently unaware of the court procedural rules,failed to contact the court clerk to set a hearing date for the motion,and the motion was not heard until february,which was only five days before burton scheduled trial date and was the last day when motions would be heard.during the hearing on the motion to adjourn,warshaw stated that he would need additional time to prepare,particularly in light of discovery materials he had only recently received from zulakis.although the prosecution stipulated to the adjournment,judge stell denied warshaw motion.warshaw then moved to withdraw from the case,and judge stell granted his motion.burton was not in attendance at the motion hearing.
for unknown reasons,burton trial did not commence on february,as scheduled.rather,on march,judge stell recused herself,and the case was reassigned to judge william collette.on may,judge collette heard the prosecution motion to clarify defendant representation.at the hearing,judge collette offered to adjourn trial so burton could retain other counsel.burton declined,however,stating that he liked his current counsel,joseph brehler,and that warshaw was no longer available because burton lacked the funds to retain warshaw and because a disagreement with warshaw had since developed.
burton trial commenced on may.burton did not take the stand.a jury convicted burton on both counts,and he was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder and two years imprisonment for possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.
burton appealed his conviction to the michigan court of appeals,alleging that judge stell refusal to grant a continuance violated his right to counsel under the michigan and constitutions the trial court erred in not instructing the jury regarding the offense of voluntary manslaughter he had been deprived of his constitutional right to a jury drawn from a fair of the community the prosecution deprived him of his right to a fair trial by using false and perjured testimony and the cumulative effect of the aforementioned trial errors deprived him of his right to a fair trial the michigan court of appeals denied burton appeal and affirmed his conviction on august.the michigan supreme court denied burton delayed pro.per.application for leave to appeal,stating in its order that the court was not persuaded that the questions presented should be reviewed by this court.joint appendix at.order july.
burton next sought relief in the michigan courts,filing a motion for relief from judgment in the ingham county circuit court.burton asserted several new bases for relief that he had been denied a fair trial based on the admission of evidence regarding guns stored at a safe house and possible intimidation of prosecution witnesses that the prosecutor had engaged in misconduct by telling the jury they had a duty to convict and by commenting on defense counsel failure to say that burton was not guilty that the trial court erred in instructing the jury regarding flight that the trial court provided an erroneous instruction to the jury regarding the elements for establishing murder that the prosecutor erred in introducing evidence that burton had been in jail with one of the prosecution witnesses and that his sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment under the michigan constitution and violated michigan statutory law.the ingham county circuit court denied burton motion on november,stating that 
each of the grounds claimed by the defendant could have easily been raised in the prior appeal filed on behalf of this defendant.to merely state that prior counsel failure to raise the points claimed somehow creates good cause would,in and of itself,obviate mcr d.
in addition,the court finds no merit to the claims as asserted by this defendant.this court,after a careful review of the brief of the defendant and the response filed by the prosecution,does not find that there are any grounds for relief from judgment and,accordingly,the motion is denied.
at ingham county cir.op.and order.burton filed a delayed application for leave to appeal with the michigan court of appeals,which denied relief for failure to meet the burden of establishing entitlement to relief under mcr d.at.order.the michigan court of appeals denied burton motions for rehearing and leave to file amended delayed application for leave to appeal on march.burton then filed with the michigan supreme court a delayed application for leave to appeal from the michigan court of appeals january,decision,which the michigan supreme court denied on the basis that burton failed to meet the burden of establishing entitlement to relief under mcr d.at.order july.
burton then turned to the federal courts,filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus with the district court for the eastern district of michigan on august.burton petition asserted several grounds for relief that he had been denied the right to retain counsel of choice that the trial court improperly admitted evidence that the trial judge improperly admitted testimony regarding his incarceration that the trial court gave irrelevant and prejudicial jury instructions regarding flight that the trial judge omitted from the jury instructions an element of the crime of murder that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by arguing to the jury that they had a duty to convict and commenting during closing arguments that defense counsel failed to state that burton was not guilty and that his counsel on direct appeal had been constitutionally ineffective.the district court denied burton right to counsel of choice claim on the merits,concluding that burton right to counsel of choice was preserved when judge collette offered to adjourn trial so that burton could engage new retained counsel.the district court also denied burton remaining claims on the basis that burton had procedurally defaulted such claims by failing to raise them on direct appeal.because burton failed to establish cause and prejudice or actual innocence,the district court concluded that burton procedural default in the state courts barred habeas corpus relief in the federal courts.
the district court granted a certificate of appealability with respect to the issue of whether burton stated a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal,and if so,whether such ineffective assistance of appellate counsel furnished the cause and prejudice necessary to overcome procedural default.this court then granted a certificate of appealability regarding the merits of burton right to counsel of choice claim.

pursuant to c,the district court and this court have jurisdiction to certify for appeal issues relating to the denial of a petition for habeas corpus.this court has jurisdiction to hear such appeals,and we review de novo district court judgments granting or denying petitions for a writ of habeas corpus.see mcclendon sherman,cir.because the district court did not conduct an evidentiary hearing but rather relied on the trial transcript in making its fact findings,we must review the district court factual findings de novo.bugh mitchell,cir,cert.denied,d.

right to counsel of choice 
attendant in the sixth amendment right to counsel is the right to secure counsel of one choice.linton perini,cir,cert.denied,d it is axiomatic that in all criminal prosecutions the accused enjoys the right to have assistance of counsel for his defense,and implicit in this guarantee is the right to be represented by counsel of one own choice.citing powell alabama.the right to counsel of choice is not absolute,however,and may not be used to unreasonably delay trial.id.at.
the michigan court of appeals on direct appeal determined that,while judge stell abused her discretion in denying burton request for a continuance,burton sixth amendment rights had not been violated because judge collette offered to adjourn trial so that burton could secure retained counsel 
defendant first claims his convictions must be reversed because the trial court refusal to grant a continuance to permit his retained counsel to prepare a defense for trial violated his right to counsel under both the federal and michigan constitutions.us const,am vi const,art.although we agree the trial court abused its discretion in failing to grant defendant request for a continuance,people wilson,reversal is not mandated in this case.generally,prejudice need not be demonstrated where a defendant is denied the sixth amendment right to counsel of the defendant choice.see people johnson,and cases cited therein.however,here,shortly after denying the continuance,the trial judge disqualified herself and the matter was assigned to a different judge who provided defendant the option of adjourning trial to allow him the opportunity to obtain other retained counsel.defendant declined the offer and stated his satisfaction with his appointed counsel.thus defendant declined to exercise the very right he now claims he was denied.no reversal is required.
supreme court precedent does not dictate a finding that the michigan court of appeals decision was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as the court noted in powell alabama,a defendant has a right to a fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice.emphasis added.the michigan court of appeals was reasonable in concluding that judge collette offer to adjourn burton trial so that burton could arrange for representation by his prior retained counsel provided burton the fair opportunity to secure counsel of choice required by powell.the record indicates that,ultimately,burton was not represented by his original choice for retained counsel,thomas warshaw,because a personal disagreement developed between the two and because burton financial circumstances were such that he could no longer afford privately retained counsel.at mot.to clarify def.representation at test.of thomas warshaw at mot.to clarify def.representation at test.of kumal burton see caplin drysdale,chartered united states,d petitioner does not,nor could it defensibly do so,assert that impecunious defendants have a sixth amendment right to choose their counsel.the amendment guarantees defendants in criminal cases the right to adequate representation,but those who do not have the means to hire their own lawyers have no cognizable complaint so long as they are adequately represented by attorneys appointed by the courts.because the michigan court of appeals denial of burton claim was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent regarding the sixth amendment right to counsel of choice,federal habeas corpus review affords burton no relief.
even if burton claim is viewed as a constitutional challenge to the denial of his motion for a continuance,it can not be said that the michigan court of appeals decision was contrary to or an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent.denial of a continuance rises to the level of a constitutional violation only when there is an unreasoning and arbitrary insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay morris slappy,d quoting ungar sarafite,d see ungar,at.these matters are,of course,arguable,and other judges in other courts might well grant a continuance in these circumstances.but the fact that something is arguable does not make it unconstitutional.the circumstances of a particular case determine whether the denial of a continuance is so arbitrary as to violate due process.ungar,at.there are no mechanical tests for deciding when a denial of a continuance is so arbitrary as to violate due process.the answer must be found in the circumstances present in every case,particularly in the reasons presented to the trial judge at the time the request is denied.a defendant must also show that the denial of a continuance actually prejudiced his or her defense.powell collins,cir actual prejudice may be demonstrated by showing that additional time would have made relevant witnesses available or otherwise benefit t ed the defense.while the michigan court of appeals did find that judge stell abused her discretion in denying burton motion for a continuance,his trial date was in fact pushed back approximately three months as a result of the case being transferred to judge collette.after viewing the totality of the circumstances in this case,it can not be said that judge stell denial of burton motion for a continuance resulted in burton being deprived of his constitutional rights,so the michigan court of appeals denial of relief on this score was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent.
ineffective assistance of appellate counsel 
in denying burton petition for a writ of habeas corpus,the district court determined that all of burton claims,with the exception of his right to counsel of choice argument,are not subject to federal habeas corpus review because burton procedurally defaulted such claims.burton contends that his procedural default should be excused because the default was caused by his counsel ineffective assistance on direct appeal and because he has suffered actual prejudice as a result of such ineffective assistance.we conclude that burton counsel on direct appeal was not so ineffective as to give rise to a constitutional violation and therefore affirm the district court ruling that burton procedural default bars federal habeas relief.
when a criminal defendant has procedurally defaulted his or her ability to obtain federal habeas relief by failing to comply with a state procedural rule,the defendant must show cause and prejudice or actual innocence in order to overcome the procedural default.see murray carrier,d explaining that in an extraordinary case,where a constitutional violation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent,a federal habeas court may grant the writ even in the absence of a showing of cause for the procedural default wainwright sykes,d setting forth cause and prejudice test for overcoming procedural default maupin smith,cir noting application of cause and prejudice test in cases of procedural default and setting forth guidelines for actual prejudice inquiry.as burton has not sought relief under the actual innocence exception to procedural default,we must determine whether burton has demonstrated cause to excuse his procedural default and,assuming his constitutional rights have been violated,whether such violations resulted in actual prejudice.
ineffective assistance of appellate counsel,if it rises to the level of a constitutional violation,can serve as cause to excuse the procedural default of claims brought in a habeas corpus proceeding.buell mitchell,cir the petitioner ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claims can serve as cause for the procedural default of his other claims only if the petitioner can demonstrate that his appellate counsel was constitutionally ineffective.to do so,a defendant must show that his counsel performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.citing edwards carpenter,d strickland washington,d.under strickland,a petitioner must show that the performance of counsel fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.maples stegall,cir quoting strickland,at.
counsel decision not to raise an issue on appeal does not violate the constitution unless such a decision is so suspect as to indicate that the petitioner effectively was without counsel 
in order to succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel,a petitioner must show errors so serious that counsel was scarcely functioning as counsel at all and that those errors undermine the reliability of the defendant convictions.strategic choices by counsel,while not necessarily those a federal judge in hindsight might make,do not rise to the level of a sixth amendment violation.

admission of evidence 
burton first asserts that the trial court erred in admitting evidence in the form of suggestions by the prosecutor that witnesses had been threatened and that a residence connected to burton was a safe house.for the admission of evidence to violate constitutional due process,it must be shown that admitting the evidence violates fundamental fairness,that it violates those fundamental conceptions of justice which lie at the base of our civil and political institutions and which define the community sense of fair play and decency.dowling united states,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted see coleman mitchell,cir,cert.denied,d stating in reference to habeas corpus challenge to admission of evidence that s tate court evidentiary rulings do not rise to the level of due process violations unless they offend some principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also seymour walker,cir,cert.denied,d errors in the application of state law,especially rulings regarding the admission or exclusion of evidence,are usually not to be questioned in a federal habeas corpus proceeding.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
reference to threatening of witnesses 
burton asserts that the following exchange between the prosecutor and markita robinson on redirect examination was in error because the prosecutor elicited testimony suggesting that robinson had been threatened 
q.what was the reason that you did contact the police before october 
cause i was scared.
scared of what.
something happening to me.
for what reason.
threats.through threats.i was just scared that something might happen to me and fear of my life.
at br.in support of pet.for habeas corpus at quoting trial tr.vol.iii at.however,the prosecutor line of questioning was in response to by defense counsel suggesting that the witness had not contacted the police at the time of the events in question 
now,prior to october,you did not contact the police,is that correct 
and neither you nor your sister,as far as you know,contacted the police.
trial tr.vol.iii at.it does not appear that the prosecutor violated michigan rule of evidence b,much less constitutional due process,because the prosecutor elicited the challenged testimony,not to prove burton character in order to show action in conformity therewith,but rather to explore more fully the issue,first raised by defense counsel,as to why the witness did not report burton conduct to the police.evid.b see pennington lazaroff,wl,cir,stating that if properly before the court,we could only conclude that the introduction of the prior misconduct did not violate fundamental fairness.the prior misconduct,coupled with the evidence of the defendant threats and the victims fear and guilt,helped explain the victims reasons for not exposing the defendant transgressions.hence,the evidence of other misconduct was more probative than prejudicial,and its admission did not violate the due process clause.
given the difficulties in establishing that the admission of evidence regarding possible threats against witnesses was fundamentally unfair in this case,an objectively reasonable lawyer could have chosen not to raise this issue on appeal.because the substance of burton claim lacks merit,burton has failed to show a reasonable probability that his conviction would have been reversed on direct appeal even if appellate counsel had raised the issue.thus,burton has not demonstrated that his counsel on direct appeal was constitutionally ineffective,and in turn has failed to establish the requisite cause for excusing his procedural default of this claim.
prosecutorial use of the term safe house 
burton also alleges that his counsel on direct appeal was constitutionally ineffective in failing to challenge the prosecutor repeated reference to a residence linked to burton as a safe house where firearms were kept.burton contends that the prosecutor used the term safe house for the purpose of impermissibly characterizing burton as a person with a propensity to commit illegal acts,citing as an example the prosecutor statement during closing argument why do i keep a mm in the safe house these are all the acts,ladies and gentlemen,of a very innocent person,are they it all evidence on this record.at.br.in support of pet.for habeas corpus quoting trial tr.vol.iv at.
burton contention that the prosecutor references to a safe house where firearms were kept constituted inadmissible evidence is undermined by the fact that the prosecution seems to have intended to use such testimony to establish that burton had access to a handgun like the one used to kill the victim because the murder weapon itself does not appear to have been introduced in evidence at trial,evidence of burton connections to the west lapeer residence and the presence at that location of the particular type of weapon used to kill mcclayton did have probative value with respect to a material issue other than burton character.see people vandervliet,noting that r elevant other acts evidence does not violate rule b unless it is offered solely to show the criminal propensity of an individual to establish that he acted in conformity therewith,and establishing that,for evidence to be admissible,the prosecutor must offer the other acts evidence under something other than a character to conduct theory,the evidence must be relevant under rule,as enforced through rule b,to an issue or fact of consequence at trial,and the danger of undue prejudice must substantially outweigh the probative value of the evidence internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also waters kassulke,cir finding that due process was not violated by the admission of evidence because the evidence was relevant to the case central issues of knowledge and intent and the evidence probative value outweighed its prejudicial effect.
although the use of the term safe house might have been somewhat prejudicial,it can not be said that the term was so prejudicial as to render burton trial fundamentally unfair.moreover,the prosecutor use of the term safe house without objection by burton trial counsel may have factored in the decision of burton counsel not to raise this issue on direct appeal.see people bullock,rejecting argument that trial court erred by admitting evidence because the defendant failed to raise any timely objection at trial on the basis of mre b see also people buck,appellate review of prosecutorial misconduct is foreclosed where the defendant fails to object or request a curative instruction,unless the misconduct was so egregious that no objection or curative instruction could have removed the prejudice to the defendant or if manifest injustice would result from our failure to review the claims of misconduct.hence,burton counsel on direct appeal was not constitutionally defective for failing to raise this claim,and there is not a reasonable probability that burton conviction would have been reversed on appeal.because burton has failed to demonstrate ineffective assistance of appellate counsel,this claim remains procedurally defaulted.
testimony regarding burton incarceration 
burton second procedurally defaulted claim is that his constitutional due process rights were violated when a witness for the prosecution stated on direct examination that he had been incarcerated with burton.during the course of direct examination of jackie robinson harris,the prosecutor asked harris whether he had received any threats from burton,to which harris replied,well,i was in the bull pen with him over to the.trial tr.vol.ii at test.of jackie robinson harris.defense counsel raised an objection,the court held a bench conference,and the prosecutor then questioned harris outside the presence of the jury.at the end of the questioning,the prosecutor and defense counsel determined that they did not wish to present any of the testimony elicited to the jury.trial tr.vol.ii at.before the jury returned to the courtroom,the prosecutor made the following statement 
and just so the witness knows and the court knows and brehler defense counsel knows,i will be asking harris about two felony convictions that he pled to that he under sentence for.and they both of the type that fall under the court rule,because they are in the court rule category and those are the only two that he has on his record.
trial tr.vol.ii at.defense counsel entered no objection,and the prosecutor concluded his questioning by establishing harris convictions for felony larceny and attempted armed robbery.trial tr.vol.ii at.
in support of his claim,burton cites estelle williams,d,in which the supreme court held that compelling prisoners to wear prison clothing during jury trials violated prisoners due process rights because of the impact on defendants presumption of innocence.however,the conduct in this case does not rise to the level of a due process violation as described in estelle.first,the effect of harris passing use of the euphemism bull pen on burton presumption of innocence is considerably less than the negative impact of a defendant being dressed in prison attire throughout the entirety of his or her trial.even assuming the jurors understood the meaning of the term bull pen,any negative effect was mitigated by harris testimony being halted as soon as he used the term,and the court and counsel repeated instructions to the jury regarding the prosecution burden of proof and burton presumption of innocence.furthermore,harris testimony did not refer specifically to burton being previously convicted of a crime,and indeed probably related to burton confinement prior to conviction.see black law dictionary ed defining bullpen as.an area in a prison where inmates are kept in close confinement.a detention cell where prisoners are held until they are brought into court.the record indicates that the jury would have been aware of burton being held in police custody as a result of the testimony of dennis michael shaw to which defense counsel did not object that shaw took custody of burton in detroit.tr.trans.vol.iii at test.of dennis michael shaw.jurors in a criminal case,even in the absence of a statement regarding the defendant custodial detention during trial,are likely to presume that a criminal defendant,irrespective of his or her guilt or innocence,has spent at least some time in custody as a result of being charged with a crime,particularly one such as murder.thus,it does not appear that the prosecution eliciting of a passing reference to burton incarceration impacted burton right to a presumption of innocence or was so fundamentally unfair as to require reversal of burton conviction.because an objectively reasonable attorney could decide not to press this issue on appeal,and burton has not shown a reasonable probability that his conviction would have been overturned if the issue had been raised,burton has failed to demonstrate that his counsel on direct appeal was so constitutionally ineffective as to establish cause for excusing procedural default.
jury instruction regarding flight 
burton third procedurally defaulted claim is that his counsel on direct appeal was constitutionally ineffective in failing to appeal the trial judge instruction to the jury regarding flight 
now,there been some evidence that this defendant tried to run away or tried to hide or did run away or did hide after these alleged events.and even after he was accused of this crime and in this case.now,this evidence does not prove guilt.a person may run or hide for innocent reasons such as panic,mistake or fear.however,a person may also run or hide because of a consciousness of guilt.you must decide whether the evidence is true.and if true,whether it shows that this defendant had a guilty state of mind.
trial tr.vol iv.at because the jury instruction directed jurors to make their own determinations as to whether burton did in fact flee and if so,what state of mind such flight evinced,the trial judge instruction regarding flight was not so prejudicial as to render the entire trial fundamentally unfair.see mitzel tate,cir,cert.denied,d t o warrant habeas relief,to state a constitutional due process claim because of incorrect jury instructions,petitioner must show that the instructions,as a whole,were so infirm that they rendered the entire trial fundamentally unfair.allegations of trial error raised in challenges to jury instructions are also reviewed under brecht harmless error standard.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.moreover,the trial judge decision to include an instruction regarding flight does seem to be based on evidence adduced at trial.trial tr.vol.ii at test.of jackie robinson harris noting burton statement that he planned to leave lansing after a television news report identified burton as a suspect in mcclayton murder.thus,burton counsel on appeal could have reasoned that this argument lacked merit,and burton has failed to show a reasonable probability that his conviction would have been reversed if this argument had been raised on direct appeal.as a result,burton has not demonstrated constitutionally ineffective assistance of appellate counsel as cause to excuse procedural default.
jury instruction omitting element of murder 
burton fourth procedurally defaulted claim is that his conviction should be reversed on the basis that the trial judge omitted an element of the crime of murder in his instructions to the jury.specifically,burton challenges the omission of an instruction that,in order to prove that burton committed murder,the prosecution must show beyond a reasonable doubt the absence of justification or excuse.see gall parker,cir,cert.denied,d noting the complexity of cases where an ingredient can arguably be both an element of a charged crime and of a defense,or the presence of a defense can arguably negate a required element.
michigan case law at the time of burton trial did list absence of mitigation or justification as one of the elements of murder.see people bailey,the elements of,or,murder are absent circumstances of justification,excuse,or mitigation quoting people dykhouse.however,the michigan supreme court had also stated that t he absence of mitigating circumstances need not be established in order to convict one of first or murder in ruling that voluntary manslaughter which required a showing of provocation was not automatically a lesser included offense of murder people van wyck,see also berrier egeler,cir,cert.denied,d ruling that failure to include in jury instruction that burden of proof is upon the prosecution to disprove theory asserted by defendant violated defendant federal due process rights,explaining that,i n michigan an element of proof of murder is evidence which negates,in any case where is claimed and evidence is offered thereon emphasis added.indeed,the michigan pattern jury instructions for and murder at the time of burton trial specifically noted that an instruction regarding the element of absence of justification or mitigation was not required if no such evidence had been proffered during trial.see.jury instructions premeditated murder commentary ed.supp.paragraph,that the killing was not justified,excused,or done under circumstances that reduce it to a lesser crime may be omitted if there is no evidence of justification or excuse,and the jury is not being instructed on manslaughter or any offense less than manslaughter using traditional state of mind formulations based on malice aforethought,some cases had implied that justification,excuse,and mitigation were negative elements of murder,which the prosecutor had to disprove.however,the weight of michigan authority is that justification,excuse,and mitigation need not be disproved by the prosecutor in every case.the absence of mitigating circumstances need not be established in order to convict one of first or murder.with this in mind,the committee bracketed paragraphs on justification,excuse,and mitigation for use in appropriate cases.of course,when a defense of,accident,or provocation is raised by the evidence,the prosecutor is required to disprove the defense beyond a reasonable doubt and the trial court is obliged to give the appropriate bracketed language.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.jury instructions murder ed.supp.jury instructions element premeditated and murder ed,supp.
burton principal defense at trial was that he had been mistakenly identified as the person who shot mcclayton.because burton claimed not to have shot mcclayton,the issue of justification or mitigation simply did not apply,and an instruction on these issues was not required under michigan law.trial tr.vol.iv at.furthermore,because justification or mitigation do not seem to have been at issue during the trial,any error on this point did not render burton trial so fundamentally unfair as to state a constitutional due process claim cognizable on habeas corpus review.in sum,a constitutional claim based on the absence of an instruction regarding mitigation or justification in this case lacks merit,so it can not be said that failure to raise such an objection on appeal constituted ineffective assistance of appellate counsel that overcomes procedural default.
prosecutorial statements regarding jury duty to convict and defense counsel failure to state that defendant is not guilty 
burton fifth procedurally defaulted claim is that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by making statements undermining burton presumption of innocence.prosecutorial misconduct,in order to rise to the level of a constitutional due process violation,must be so severe that the defendant did not have a fair trial.as we explained in bowling parker,for prosecutorial misconduct to rise to the level of a constitutional violation cognizable on habeas review 
the misconduct must have so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.even if the prosecutor conduct was improper or even universally condemned,we can provide relief only if the statements were so flagrant as to render the entire trial fundamentally unfair.once we find that a statement is improper,four factors are considered in determining whether the impropriety is flagrant the likelihood that the remarks would mislead the jury or prejudice the accused,whether the remarks were isolated or extensive,whether the remarks were deliberately or accidentally presented to the jury,and whether other evidence against the defendant was substantial.
cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
duty to convict 
burton first challenges statements of the prosecutor during voir dire on the basis that such statements impermissibly instructed jurors that they had a duty to convict burton that is,that the prosecutor,in effect,directed the jury to enter a verdict against burton.however,a review of the prosecutor statements reveals that they were not improper because they did not amount to an instruction to the jury that it must convict burton irrespective of its own assessment of the evidence presented during trial.rather,the prosecutor statements were part of a line of questioning directed at determining whether jurors understood that,if the jurors determined that the prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that burton had committed murder,then they would be under a duty to convict burton 
d o you understand at the conclusion of the case,if the evidence shows that the defendant is guilty of the crime of murder,it be your duty as jurors to come back with a guilty verdict.do you understand that 
if the proofs show you beyond a reasonable doubt that this man,kumal burton,committed murder,it be your duty to convict him.do you unders
