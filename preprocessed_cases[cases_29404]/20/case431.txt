the united states appeals and william woodrow wilson wilson from a november,judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york wood,granting habeas relief to wilson and remanding the case to the bureau of immigration appeals bia for further consideration regarding wilson eligibility for relief under the repealed c of the immigration and nationality act ina,c.
for the reasons stated below,wilson is required to make an individualized showing that he decided to forgo the opportunity to affirmatively file for c relief in reliance on his ability to file for such relief at a later date.therefore,the case is remanded to the bia for further remand so that relevant findings of fact on the issue of such individualized reliance can be made.however,wilson regarding the district court ruling on his eligibility to apply for naturalization is dismissed for failure to exhaust his administrative remedies.
background 
wilson relevant history 
on november,at four years old,wilson,a native and citizen of jamaica,was admitted into the united states as a lawful permanent resident.as a young man,in new york state supreme court,queens county,on october,wilson was convicted by a jury of robbery in the second degree and criminal possession of stolen property in the third degree.on november,he was sentenced to concurrent prison terms of two to six years for the robbery count and one year for the possession count.wilson served months imprisonment.the parties agree that,under applicable law at the time of these convictions,neither crime was considered an aggravated felony therefore,wilson was not considered deportable.
on february,also in new york state supreme court,queens county,wilson pleaded guilty to assault in the first degree.neither wilson nor the government elaborates on the underlying facts of this crime.for the assault conviction,wilson was sentenced to a term of months to seven years imprisonment.the term ran concurrently with the sentence wilson was already serving.
the record also reveals that,subsequently,on april,wilson was convicted of criminal possession of a weapon.the government merely mentions this conviction in a footnote,whereby wilson admitted to the conviction during the course of his removal hearing.
in the fall of,wilson traveled from the united states to jamaica for a brief vacation.on october,wilson returned to the united states.on arrival at the john kennedy airport in new york city,wilson presented himself for inspection as a returning lawful permanent resident.an immigration inspector determined that wilson was inadmissible because of his lengthy criminal record.wilson was,therefore,taken into custody and was temporarily detained without bond at varick street,new york,new york.
b.the removal proceedings 
in the immigration court 
on november,the ins served wilson with a notice to appear.the notice alleged that wilson was inadmissible pursuant to ina a a i i codified in a a i i supp.ii,because wilson had been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude and ina a b codified in a b supp.ii,because wilson had been convicted of two or more criminal offenses for which the aggregate sentences of confinement exceeded five years,regardless of whether the offenses involved moral turpitude.
on november,in new york,an immigration judge ij held a bond hearing for wilson.the ij indicated that he did not believe wilson was eligible for bond based on his classification as an arriving alien,and wilson withdrew his bond request.
on december,wilson was transferred to federal detention center fdc oakdale in louisiana.thereafter,on december,the ins filed a notice to appear with the immigration court in oakdale.
on december,wilson filed a motion seeking to be reclassified as an admitted alien.in his motion,wilson argued that his departure from the united states was brief,casual,and innocent,and that,in keeping with the supreme court decision in rosenberg fleuti,d,wilson should not be classified as an arriving alien.the oakdale ij denied wilson motion on january.the ij reasoned that ina a c codified in a c supp.ii,had been amended to provide that a legal permanent resident is regarded as seeking admission if he has committed certain criminal offenses,including crimes of moral turpitude.
on january,wilson removal hearing was resumed before the oakdale ij.at this hearing,wilson admitted that he was a native and citizen of jamaica that he had been convicted on november,of robbery and criminal possession of stolen property and that on february,he had been convicted of assault.
the removal hearing was again resumed on february.at this hearing,the ij entered wilson criminal conviction records into evidence without objection and found that wilson was removable as charged.in addition,the ij found that wilson had not acquired derivative citizenship based on his parents naturalization because his father had not been naturalized prior to wilson eighteenth birthday.
in response,wilson sought a waiver of deportation pursuant to former ina c hereinafter,c.wilson argued that,although c had been repealed prior to the commencement of his removal proceedings,he remained eligible for c relief because his criminal convictions predated the enactment of both the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat,and the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,b,stat.the ij rejected wilson argument,ruling that c was unavailable to aliens whose deportation proceedings had commenced after c was repealed.
in addition,the ij denied wilson request to terminate the deportation proceedings in order to allow wilson to apply for naturalization.the ij reasoned that he lacked the authority to terminate the proceedings because neither the ins nor the naturalization court had indicated that wilson was eligible for naturalization.on february,the ij issued an oral decision finding wilson removable as charged and ineligible for any relief.
before the bia 
on march,wilson timely appealed the ij decision to the bia.wilson argued that the ij erred in applying iirira retroactively to his september,conviction and that the iirira is unconstitutional,violating the due process clause of the fifth amendment and international law.wilson asserted that iirira was impermissively retroactive because its application to convictions attached new legal consequences to past conduct.
the bia dismissed wilson appeal on august,affirming the ij determination that wilson was removable as charged.the bia agreed with the ij that wilson was not eligible for c relief because he had been placed in removal proceedings after the repeal of c.
in addition,the bia concluded that robbery and assault constituted aggravated felonies as defined by ina a f,a f pertaining to crimes of violence,as amended by of iirira.accordingly,the bia found that wilson was not eligible for cancellation of removal under ina,or a waiver of removal under ina h,h.
in the district court 
on september,wilson filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the southern district of new york.at the time,wilson was detained at fdc oakdale in louisiana.wilson argued,first,that iirira repeal of c was impermissibly retroactive as applied to him because his convictions predated iirira enactment.second,wilson reasserted his argument that iirira repeal of c violates his equal protection rights under the due process clause of the fifth amendment.third,wilson argued again that the ins had impermissibly refused to terminate wilson proceedings in order to allow wilson to apply for naturalization.
on may,the magistrate judge to whom the case was assigned recommended that wilson habeas petition be denied on the merits.analyzing the jurisdictional issues in the case,the magistrate judge ruled that jurisdiction in the southern district of new york was proper,in part because,although wilson removal hearings took place in louisiana,wilson had been detained in new york,had resided in new york,and had served his term of imprisonment in new york.
on september,the district court granted wilson habeas petition in part,finding that wilson was eligible for c relief pursuant to this court decision in restrepo mcelroy,cir.the district court adopted the approach propounded by the concurring opinion in restrepo,applying a categorical approach to determining whether c relief is available to an alien with a trial conviction.
however,the district court rejected wilson claim that he was eligible to apply for naturalization.the court noted that wilson needed to establish that he was an alien of good moral character and that wilson would not be able to make such a showing with two aggravated felony convictions on his record.
ultimately,the district court granted wilson petition in part and remanded the matter to the bia to determine whether wilson would be eligible for discretionary relief pursuant to c.the government appealed the district court judgment,and wilson 
relevant developments during the pendency of this appeal and a brief discussion thereof 
during the time this appeal was pending in this court,congress passed the real id act of real id act,real id,or act,stat,which significantly affected the procedure for disposing of a habeas petition that,like wilson,challenged a final order of removal.the enactment of the real id act raised two threshold issues we must first address a procedural issue and a jurisdictional issue with a related venue issue.thus,the court must consider whether an alien habeas petition challenging a final order of removal and pending in this court during the enactment of the act should be converted to a petition for review brought under.second,we must address the issue of whether the real id act requires this court to transfer the case to the fifth circuit,in which wilson immigration proceedings took place.
both of these threshold issues have been resolved by recent opinions of this court.as to the treatment of wilson habeas petition challenging the final order of removal pursuant to c of the act,and following the ruling in gittens menifee,cir per curiam,the appeal is converted to a petition for review brought under.as to this court jurisdiction despite the government contention that the case should be transferred to the fifth circuit pursuant to ina b,based on this court recent ruling in gonzales,cir,and for the reasons articulated therein,we retain jurisdiction over the appeal.
regarding the government supplemental venue argument,that even if ina b were not jurisdictional it is nonetheless a mandatory venue provision which can not be ignored absent a waiver,gov t rule j letter,at citing,at,the court is unpersuaded.we take a moment to articulate our reading more thoroughly.contrary to the government implication,we are not ignoring venue.however,much like the scenario of,we are faced with a case in procedural limbo,amunikoro sec y of dep t of homeland,cir,and find we are in somewhat uncharted sic waters,as we,unaided by express instructions from congress or the real id act,attempt to impose order on these sui generis appeals,at.in amunikoro,we reasoned that venue is a concept of convenience.at quoting rutland ry.of locomotive eng rs,cir see also id.at i t is that v enue requirements are normally for the convenience of the parties and,if the parties do not object,there is no policy objection to proceeding in any court with jurisdiction.quoting georcely ashcroft,cir.
here,the government has objected to venue in this court.however,given the protracted procedural history of this case,we believe retaining venue in this court is proper.while it is true that wilson removal proceedings were conducted in louisiana,within the fifth circuit,he filed his habeas petition in the southern district of new york,within the second circuit.moreover,not only has appeal been filed in this court,but it has progressed to such a point that to transfer the appeal to the fifth circuit for the appeal process to begin anew,in and of itself,would be inconvenient.thus,for much the same reasons as we stated in,having already had one round of judicial review by the district court albeit one that has been rendered a nullity by real id and having had the case thoroughly briefed and argued before this court,it would be a manifest injustice to now transfer this case to another court for duplicative proceedings.at citing jama gonzales,cir.in sum,given the advanced state of this case in terms of its appellate review,together with the fact that ina b did not provide any guidelines for cases in the relatively unique procedural posture presented here,we believe this court is as appropriate if not more so as is the fifth circuit to hear wilson petition for review.
thus,the remaining issues in this case concern wilson eligibility for c relief in light of ins cyr,d rankine reno,cir restrepo mcelroy,cir and,most recently,gonzales,d and wilson eligibility for naturalization pursuant to ina f,f.
the government argues that an alien,like wilson,who asserts that he is eligible for c relief under this court decision in restrepo,should be required to make an individualized showing of reliance therefore,the matter should be remanded to the bia to determine in the first instance whether wilson can make such a showing,and,if so,whether he merits such relief as a matter of discretion.
conversely,wilson argues for a categorical approach to a petitioner reliance on the availability of c relief,contending that the supreme court and second circuit both generally apply a categorical approach in retroactivity analyses.
also,in his,wilson argues that he is entitled to c relief because his jury convictions were for crimes that,at the time of conviction,were not considered crimes of moral turpitude,were not aggravated felonies,and did not make him deportable.wilson contends,therefore,that the analysis,should center on his guilty plea,rather than on his earlier jury trial convictions.
for the reasons that follow,we are persuaded that a petitioner who asserts that he is eligible for c relief under restrepo,such as wilson,is required to make an individualized showing of reliance.further,because of his failure to raise his eligibility for naturalization argument to the bia,and the government protestation of it being raised now,we will invoke our doctrine of issue exhaustion therefore,we dismiss wilson.see foster ins,cir a failure to exhaust constitutes a clear jurisdictional bar quoting ins,cir.
ii.discussion regarding wilson attempt to secure c relief 
section c of the ina provided discretionary relief from deportation for aliens who could demonstrate that they had been admitted to the united states as lawful permanent residents they had resided in the united states for at least seven years and their convictions were not for aggravated felonies for which they had served terms of imprisonment of five years or longer.c repealed.because wilson and convictions were not considered aggravated crimes at those times,wilson may have fit squarely within the category of aliens eligible for c discretionary relief.
yet,on april,through d of aedpa,congress eliminated c relief for certain criminal aliens,including those convicted of aggravated felonies,irrespective of the amount of time they served in prison.soon thereafter,on september,b of iirira repealed c relief in its entirety and replaced it with a form of relief called cancellation of removal,which is unavailable to aggravated felons.see thom ashcroft,cir.subsequent precedential case law development guides our analysis on the effects of aedpa and iirira to wilson claim of continued eligibility for c relief.we briefly discuss that case law development now.
a.an overview of relevant case law development 
the supreme court decision in cyr 
in,in cyr,the supreme court was asked to determine whether the retroactive effect of iirira was permissible or not.specifically,a lawful permanent united states resident,who,before the enactment of either the aedpa or the iiira,had pled guilty to a criminal charge that made him deportable,sought the relief afforded by ina c in his removal proceeding that was commenced after the enactment of aedpa and iirira.see cyr,at.both the district court and this court had determined that c relief was still available.in making its determination,this court relied primarily on the supreme court retroactivity analysis articulated
