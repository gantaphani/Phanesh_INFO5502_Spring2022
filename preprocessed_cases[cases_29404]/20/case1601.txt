sedley alley,a tennessee prisoner under sentence of death,filed an unsuccessful petition for a federal writ of habeas corpus.alley bell,cir,cert.denied,d,d.his execution was scheduled for june.alley then filed an amended motion with the federal district court that had originally denied his habeas petition this motion requests relief from judgment under.b,relief in the exercise of th e district court inherent authority under article iii of the constitution,and was accompanied by a motion for stay of execution.the district court granted a stay of execution,pending this court decision in the en banc case of in re abdur rahman,argued.
the state of tennessee,on behalf of the respondent,warden ricky bell,has moved us to vacate that stay.for the reasons discussed below,we hold,applying abdur rahman,that the district court lacked jurisdiction over alley amended motion,because it is equivalent to a second or successive habeas petition under b.we therefore grant the state motion to vacate the stay of execution on this basis,and do not address any of the other issues raised in this appeal.
in,suzanne collins was abducted while jogging near millington naval base,sexually mutilated,and killed.alley lived on the base,and his car was spotted on the scene shortly after two witnesses heard collins scream.after miranda warnings,alley confessed to having killed collins while drunk,and led officers back to the scene where the murder took place.he also confessed to having mutilated her with a long,tree branch,a claim which was consistent with the grave internal injuries that collins suffered,and led police to the place where the tree limb had been broken off.alley contended that he did this in order to simulate a sexual assault,and thereby in his thinking deflect suspicion from himself.he gave police some other purported details of the killing that were inconsistent with the forensic evidence.
alley went to trial for collins murder in.he did not contest having committed the act,but instead pursued an insanity defense.he presented evidence that he suffered from a multiple personality disorder,and had committed the murder while under the control of an abnormal personality.alley sought to offer into evidence videotapes of interview sessions conducted while alley was under the influence of hypnosis sodium amytal.the trial court excluded this taped evidence on relevance grounds,but allowed alley to present the testimony of two medical experts who described the interviews,and other evidence,in the course of opining that alley suffered from insanity.
the jury convicted alley of kidnapping,aggravated rape,and premeditated first degree murder.the jury then imposed a sentence of death for the murder,and the trial court imposed consecutive sentences for the remaining two counts.the jury found two aggravating circumstances to justify the punishment of death the murder was especially heinous,atrocious,or cruel and alley committed it during a kidnapping or rape.alley conviction and sentence were upheld on direct appeal.state alley.
alley then sought relief in state court.his petition raised claims of judicial bias,challenged a number of the state trial court evidentiary rulings,asserted that alley had received ineffective assistance of counsel,and claimed that the tennessee heinous,atrocious,or cruel aggravating instruction read to alley jury at sentencing was unconstitutionally vague.the tennessee court of criminal appeals affirmed the denial of most of the claims,but ruled that alley was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his claims of judicial bias.alley state.the trial court with a new judge held an evidentiary hearing,then denied alley petition,and the court of criminal appeals affirmed the denial.alley state,permission to appeal denied.
next,alley filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court.this petition raised claims that substantially overlapped with the issues in his state postconviction petition.however,alley argued for the first time in his habeas petition that the trial court exclusion of alley videotaped testimony under hypnosis violated the confrontation clause as well as due process.alley habeas petition also included the claim that the heinous,atrocious,or cruel henceforth hac aggravating instruction was unconstitutionally vague.
the district court denied relief,finding a number of alley claims procedurally defaulted,and denying the rest on the merits.alley bell,d.this court granted alley a certificate of appealability on several issues.on appeal,we affirmed the denial of habeas relief.we upheld the district court rulings on procedural default,and,as to the claims that alley had properly presented to the state courts,we affirmed the district court holding that the state courts rejection of alley claims was not an unreasonable application of supreme court law.alley.alley petitioned for en banc rehearing,which was denied,and certiorari from the supreme court,which was also denied,d.our mandate,which had been stayed while alley sought a writ of certiorari,issued on october.
on october,alley filed a motion in the federal district court for relief from judgment under.b.the district court entered an order on november,staying the proceedings on alley motion pending the outcome of the en banc proceeding in in re abdur rahman,argued,involving the question of when a rule b motion in a habeas case should be deemed a second or successive habeas petition under b.the state apparently responded to this order by requesting the tennessee supreme court to set an execution date for alley.on january,the tennessee supreme court ordered that alley sentence be carried out on june.
in response,on may,alley filed with the district court a first amended motion requesting relief in the exercise of this court inherent authority,relief from judgment,certificate of appealability,the filing at issue here,which we will henceforth refer to simply as the motion.as the motion title suggests,it invokes both rule b,and what are contended to be the district court inherent powers to grant relief under article iii of the constitution,as alternative bases for relief.
the motion disclaims any intention to file or pursue a second or successive habeas petition,and explicitly objects to the potential recharacterization of the motion as a second habeas,a form of objection recently sanctioned by the supreme court in castro united states,d.however,the motion argues that alley is entitled to relief from judgment due to a variety of legal and factual developments that occurred after the denial of alley federal habeas petition.
first,it asserts that alley is entitled to relief because various legal developments have demonstrated the error of the district court rejection of his constitutional vagueness challenge to the tennessee hac this court intervening decision in cone bell,cir,which granted habeas relief to a petitioner who challenged the tennessee hac instruction given at his trial.
second,it asserts that alley is entitled to relief because he was denied a fair consideration of his brady claims due to the withholding of exculpatory evidence in both his state court trial and his federal habeas proceeding.relief is appropriate under rule b,alley argues,in part because this alleged withholding continued during his federal habeas corpus proceedings,and thus constitutes fraud on the court.citing,inter alia,workman bell,cir en banc.
third,alley motion asserts that he is entitled to relief on his claim which the district court previously rejected that the state trial court unconstitutionally excluded videotaped evidence of alley behavior under hypnosis.alley argues that the tennessee supreme court intervening decision in state carter,which held that it was error to exclude a defendant personal correspondence proffered as mitigating evidence,shows that he is entitled to relief from the prior habeas judgment on this basis.
simultaneously with filing the first amended motion,alley moved for a stay of execution.on may,the district court entered a brief order staying alley execution.it noted that a stay had been granted in cooey bradshaw,motion to vacate stay denied,cir en banc,in part because of the pendency of abdur rahman and its possible relevance to cooey rule b motion.accordingly,the district judge entered a stay,which,by its terms,was to remain in place until abdur rahman is decided and the district judge has ruled on alley first amended motion in light of that decision.
five days later,the state tendered to this court a motion to vacate the district court stay of execution.this motion was filed on may.the matter was automatically docketed and assigned to the present panel,which had decided alley original habeas appeal.see cir.a.in its motion to vacate the stay,the state argued in the alternative.it claimed that if,on one hand,alley motion was really a second habeas petition,then,under aedpa,the district court lacked jurisdiction to act on it.alternatively,if the motion was properly treated as a rule b motion,then it was clearly without merit,making the entry of the stay an abuse of discretion in either case.against this,alley argued that the district court stay of execution was analogous to the stay upheld by this court en banc in cooey,and that the motion,considered as a rule b motion,was sufficiently meritorious to deserve full consideration by the district court,especially in light of the pendency of abdur rahman.
on may,this panel entered an order declining to vacate the stay of execution at that time,scheduling the matter for oral argument on june,and requesting supplemental briefing on a number of issues relating to the potential application of rule b to alley motion.the parties filed supplemental briefs addressing these issues.
during oral argument,we also requested and later received supplemental briefing on a further issue whether the federal act,barred the federal district court from entering a stay of execution in response to alley motion for relief in this habeas case.as is discussed below,we do not reach that issue.
we begin instead by considering whether the entry of a stay was jurisdictionally proper.in the absence of extraordinary circumstances,we can not consider the propriety of alley motion under the standards of rule b,or the merits of the underlying claims that he seeks to revive,unless the district court jurisdiction to act as it did is first assured.steel citizens for a better environment,d id.at,concurring.in this case,the underlying substantive questions raised by alley motion are by no means trivial.accordingly,no potential exception to the rule that jurisdiction must precede other questions is applicable here.see ruhrgas ag marathon oil,d.
more specifically,the question before us is whether alley motion should have been treated as a second or successive habeas petition under aedpa.this question implicates jurisdiction,because under aedpa,a petitioner must obtain authorization from the court of appeals b efore a second or successive habeas application is filed in the district court.b a.from the district court perspective,this provision is an allocation of jurisdiction to the court of appeals,rather than the district court,over the initial processing of a second or successive habeas petition.united states barrett,cir nunez united states,cir see robinson johnson,cir workman bell,cir en banc siler,since alley did not request permission from this court to file his motion,it follows that,if the motion is properly viewed as a second or successive habeas,then the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider it,and the stay of execution is invalid.
we recently considered the circumstances in which a post judgment motion should be treated as a second or successive habeas petition in in re abdur rahman,wl cir,en banc.the majority of our court held that a filing counts as a successive habeas petition if its factual predicate deals primarily with the constitutionality of the underlying conviction or sentence id.at,wl,at quoting rodwell pepe,cir.on the other hand,if the factual predicate of a filing attacks the manner in which the earlier habeas judgment was procured,then it falls outside of aedpa limitations on successive habeas,in the case of a motion under rule b,it should be adjudicated pursuant to the normal standards governing rule b relief.id.at,wl at.
at issue in abdur rahman was the status of a petitioner rule b motion that asked the district court to vacate its earlier judgment dismissing his habeas petition on procedural default grounds.abdur rahman motion sought reconsideration on the ground that an intervening tennessee supreme court rule had clarified contrary to the district court holding that he did not need to seek discretionary review from the state supreme court in order to properly preserve his claims of prosecutorial misconduct in the state courts.id.at.our court held that abdur rahman rule b motion was not equivalent to a second or successive habeas petition.it reasoned that the motion simply relate d to the integrity of the federal habeas specifically,the basis for the district judge procedural default ruling.ibid.furthermore,i f abdur rahman motion were granted,it would simply result in the reopening of the federal habeas proceeding,not the vacation of the state criminal judgment.id.at.
applying the standard adopted in abdur rahman,we hold that alley motion should be classified as a second or successive habeas petition,with respect to each of the claims it contains.
the motion raises three separate claims for relief.first,alley argues that he is entitled to relief from the judgment based on this court intervening decision in cone bell,cir,which upheld an eighth amendment vagueness challenge to the tennessee hac instruction in a capital sentencing proceeding.this claim plainly attempts to do the work of a second or successive habeas petition.the factual predicate of this claim is simply cone itself,and the sole relevance of the cone decision to the prior habeas proceeding is that it dealt with the same issues as the parallel constitutional vagueness challenge that alley brought against the use of the hac instruction in his own trial.the district court rejected this claim on the merits in the previous habeas proceeding,and it was not encompassed in the certificate of appealability we issued to alley prior to his appeal in this court.as such,the cone claim obviously presents a direct challenge to the constitutionality of the underlying conviction abdur rahman at.aedpa therefore forecloses the district court from considering or acting on it,unless and until alley satisfies the gatekeeping criteria of b.
our conclusion that one of alley proposed grounds for rule b relief is the functional equivalent of a second or successive habeas petition raises the question of whether we should proceed to consider the status of his other claims.some of the language of our en banc opinion in abdur rahman,and of the opinions of other circuits that we drew upon in reaching our decision,could be read to imply that a putative rule b motion should be subjected,in its entirety,to the restrictions that aedpa places upon successive habeas petitions,whenever the motion contains at least one claim that is preempted by aedpa.see abdur rahman at w hen a petitioner presents a direct challenge to the constitutionality of the underlying conviction the petition should be treated as a second or successive habeas petition.but if there is no such direct challenge and the petitioner instead challenges the integrity of the district court opinion then the district court must treat the motion as one pursuant to rule b.emphases added rodwell,at a district judge should treat a rule b motion in a habeas case as a second or successive habeas petition whenever the motion threatens to encroach upon precincts patrolled by the aedpa in contrast,if the factual predicate of the motion challenges only the procurement of the federal habeas judgment,it may be adjudicated under rule b.emphasis added.
however,neither abdur rahman nor rodwell actually involved a filing that contained multiple claims.thus,our court and the first circuit did not have the chance to consider the proper procedure for such a circumstance.we now hold that when a filing denominated under rule b asserts several potential bases for relief,courts should
