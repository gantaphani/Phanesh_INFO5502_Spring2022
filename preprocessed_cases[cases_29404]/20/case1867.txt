almost a decade ago,joseph rizzo,who was years old at the time,was convicted,after a jury trial in the circuit court of kenosha county,wisconsin,on several counts of having sexually assaulted a child.he was sentenced to serve a term of years.
after his conviction,rizzo embarked on an appellate route that took him first to the trial court on motions,then to the wisconsin court of appeals which granted his request for a new trial,then to the wisconsin supreme court which affirmed in part and remanded in part,then back to the trial court which denied relief,then back to the state appellate court which affirmed the denial of relief,then back to the state supreme court which declined to consider the case again,and then to the united states district court for the eastern district of wisconsin where rizzo request for federal habeas relief was denied.in,the case arrived here on rizzo appeal from the order of the district court.
in his petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to,rizzo argued that the state trial court denial of his requests for access to the complainant treatment records and for an independent psychological examination of the complainant violated his constitutional rights to due process and to confront and his accusers.he also maintained that the state supreme court and state court of appeals decisions denying him relief were unreasonable.the federal district court magistrate judge patricia gorence,sitting with the parties consent disagreed and denied rizzo petition in a comprehensive memorandum and order.we start our review with the facts.
in late,the parents of a girl,we call her daphne,asked rizzo,a neighbor and family friend who had previously helped them with marital problems,to counsel their daughter about various personal and disciplinary problems she was having.in may,daphne told her parents that rizzo touched her inappropriately during their counseling sessions the sessions were immediately cancelled.around the same time,daphne began seeing linda marinaccio pucci,a clinical psychologist.pucci testified that,during their fifth therapy session,daphne told her that,until recently,an adult had been messing with her but that she would not disclose further details.daphne returned to pucci in the summer of for additional therapy,at which point both daphne and her parents told pucci that daphne had been molested by a neighbor.daphne and her family eventually reported rizzo alleged misconduct to the police in june.as investigation ensued and state criminal charges were filed.
before trial,rizzo motioned the court to conduct an in camera review of pucci reports and records.in response,the state provided a summary prepared by pucci,explaining her knowledge of the case and treatment of daphne.the state also agreed that the trial court could conduct an in camera review of pucci records concerning daphne to determine if they contained exculpatory information.after reviewing the records,the state trial judge michael fisher denied rizzo access to them,reasoning as follows 
well,very frankly,if you go through this entire file and you go through it essentially line by line,you wo find anything different than what you find in pucci summary t here is really no information that is contained in this file that you do know about already that would be exculpatory in any way or even lead to anything that is exculpatory 
rizzo also filed a pretrial motion requesting that daphne submit to an independent psychological examination.at a subsequent hearing,rizzo counsel explained that he asked for the examination because the state would be eliciting expert testimony from pucci concerning the issues that would be relevant to an independent fact finder evaluation of whether or not a person is a victim of a sexual assault.as a result,he said,the predicate is laid based on the maday criteria for the court to order the alleged victim make herself available for independent psychiatric evaluation.the prosecutor responded that,while the state had initially intended to elicit such evidence from pucci,it decided not to.specifically,the prosecutor stated that the state did not intend on direct examination,subject to the defense opening the door based on,to elicit expert jensen type testimony from pucci.accordingly,the judge concluded that rizzo was not entitled to the requested psychological examination of daphne.
at trial,pucci gave extensive factual testimony with regard to her knowledge and treatment of daphne.following this testimony,pucci and the prosecutor had the following exchange 
q do you have an opinion to a reasonable degree of psychological certainty why someone would,in this position,would not immediately report a crime like this 
a often people are reluctant to report this kind of crime because of threats the offender or the abuser makes to them about it,either directly telling them not to tell or threatening them if they do tell.often people are embarrassed.they may be afraid that they are not going to be believed.sometimes they have some positive feelings about the abuser and may not want to get that person into trouble.those tend to be the most common reasons.
rizzo objected to this evidence and renewed his request for pucci treatment records.the judge overruled the objection and denied the request for the records.the jury subsequently convicted on all counts rizzo appealed.
in the state court of appeals,rizzo argued,among other things,that the trial court refusal to require the state to produce pucci treatment records for daphne and require daphne to submit to an independent psychological examination violated his constitutional rights.the court of appeals agreed that the trial judge should have granted rizzo access to daphne treatment records.it also agreed that the state had reneged on its pretrial representation that it would not present jensen evidence,thus precluding a level playing field as required under maday.as a result,the court of appeals reversed the conviction and remanded for a new trial.the state appealed,and the state supreme court agreed to review the case.
the state supreme court reversed on the issue of access to the treatment records.it concluded that,under state shiffra,rizzo was only entitled to an in camera review of confidential treatment records,which he received.rizzo position that he was entitled to the records to effectively pucci,the court said,is in stark contrast to the in camera procedure under shiffra,which specifically balanced the victim interest in confidentiality against the constitutional rights of the defendant.state rizzo.regarding the psychological examination,however,the court agreed that the state introduced jensen testimony through an expert after representing that it would not do so.thus,rizzo was deprived of his right to a pretrial determination under maday as to whether there was a compelling need for an independent examination of daphne.but the court concluded that giving rizzo a new trial was premature because his constitutional rights were violated only if he was actually entitled to the examination.for that reason,the case was remanded to the trial court for an answer to that question.
on remand,rizzo sought a ruling that he was entitled to an independent psychological examination,access to pucci treatment records,and a new trial.in support of his motion,rizzo submitted an affidavit from marc ackerman,a psychologist whom he retained.ackerman also testified at the evidentiary hearing held on remand.the trial judge ultimately denied rizzo motion in full.specifically,the judge found that pucci jensen testimony was confined to delayed reporting and that ackerman testimony established that he could offer an opinion concerning the delayed reporting aspects of the case without conducting a psychological examination of daphne.
rizzo,as we noted earlier,appealed again,and this time he struck out.the state court of appeals affirmed,holding that the state jensen evidence was confined to delayed reporting and that rizzo did not demonstrate a compelling need for the psychological examination under maday.the court noted that rizzo had not pointed to any statement by ackerman that he required a personal
