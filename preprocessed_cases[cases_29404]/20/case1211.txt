mario roberto,an alien,appeals the denial of his habeas corpus petition under seeking to challenge his removal order.we affirm.
facts and proceedings below 
mario roberto madriz is a native and citizen of guatemala who entered the united states without inspection on september,when he was eight years old.on november,madriz pleaded guilty in a texas court to possession,on or about october,of less than one gram of lysergic acid diethylamide lsd and was granted a deferred adjudication under texas code of criminal procedure article section,being placed on probation for five years and fined on december,the immigration and naturalization service ins charged madriz with removability,because he was unlawfully present in the united states and because he had been convicted for possession of a controlled substance,under a a i and a a i ii,respectively at his removal hearing,madriz conceded his removability as an alien present without admission or parole,but contested the charge that his state court controlled substance deferred adjudication was a conviction for immigration purposes.madriz,informing the immigration judge ij that he had an approved visa petition with a current priority date,submitted an application for adjustment of status to that of lawful permanent resident under i as the child of a united states citizen.on may,the ij sustained both charges of removability,held that by reason of his controlled substance offense madriz was ineligible for waiver of inadmissibility under h and hence was ineligible for adjustment of status under i,and ordered that madriz be deported to guatemala.the ij decision was upheld by the board of immigration appeals bia in a decision dated december.the bia specifically rejected madriz argument that his controlled substance deferred adjudication was not a conviction for immigration purposes.
on january,madriz filed with this court a petition for review of the december,order of the bia.the government moved to dismiss the petition for want of jurisdiction,arguing first that the petition was not timely filed and,alternatively,that pursuant to a c this court jurisdiction over the petition for review was precluded because madriz was removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section a.on may,this court granted the government motion in an order without any statement of reasons or identification of grounds 
on august,madriz filed an application for writ of habeas corpus under section in the united states district court for the southern district of texas,challenging his removal order,arguing that his texas deferred adjudication was not a conviction because if he had been prosecuted in federal court would have precluded so considering it and because in any event it was not final.the petition was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction on november,by judge hoyt,who ruled that the court lacks jurisdiction because a proper forum exists for petitioner to raise all issues concerning his deportation.that avenue or forum is the court of appeals.madriz did not appeal that decision.
on november,madriz filed with the bia a motion to reopen and reconsider.he relied on the decision in ins,cir.in the ninth circuit reversed in part the bia decision in matter of,i n bia,on which the bia had relied in its december,dismissal of madriz appeal from the may,decision of the ij.as the bia noted in its april,memorandum denying the motion to reopen and reconsider,madriz filed with that motion a copy of an order from the texas criminal court dated june,terminating his probation after successful completion,and dismissing the drug possession complaint against him pursuant to article,of the texas code of criminal procedure.the government opposed madriz motion to reconsider and reopen on the ground,among others,that it was untimely.the bia,by its april,decision,denied the motion to reconsider and to reopen,noting that the regulations,b c,required filing within thirty and ninety days,respectively,of the date of the final administrative decision,which was december,and that the november,motion to reopen and reconsider is therefore untimely.the bia decision further held that madriz has failed to show that an exceptional situation warrants our consideration of his untimely motion to reopen and reconsider in the exercise of discretion,noting that in matter of,i n bia the bia had held that the decision in would not be applied to cases arising outside of the ninth circuit and that,except where applied,matter of would continue to govern.madriz did not seek to appeal the bia april,denial of his motion to reconsider and reopen.
on may,madriz filed the instant habeas petition,arguing that his texas state court deferred adjudication for possession of lsd was not a conviction for immigration purposes.respondents moved for summary judgment,arguing that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and,alternatively,that madriz was not entitled to relief on the merits.madriz filed a for summary judgment,claiming that the district court did have jurisdiction over his section application and that he was entitled to relief because his removal order was a violation of due process and equal protection.the district court referred the matter to a magistrate judge who concluded on october,that the district court did have jurisdiction to entertain the section habeas application,but recommended that madriz application be denied on the merits.the district court,judge werlein,adopted the recommendation over madriz objections and entered final judgment on december.madriz timely appealed.

the district court jurisdiction 
the government argues that the district court lacked jurisdiction to entertain madriz habeas petition because madriz was found removable by reason of having committed an offense covered in a a i ii,and because a c provides that no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien by reason of having committed an offense covered in section a.madriz responds that in ins cyr,d,the court held section a c did not preclude resort to habeas relief under section.the government contends that cyr does not control where all the issues raised in the section petition could have been resolved by a court of appeals in ruling on a petition for review of the bia order and that the only issue raised by madriz in his habeas that his texas deferred adjudication does not,and may not constitutionally,constitute a conviction under section a a i ii or otherwise render him removable have been resolved by this court in ruling on its jurisdiction to consider a petition for review of the bia decision or decisions in his case.see,santos reno,cir see also ins,cir we pretermit this jurisdictional issue because it has no effect on the disposition of this case inasmuch as we conclude that the district court correctly dismissed madriz habeas petition on the merits.see seale ins,cir pretermitting the same issue for essentially the same reasons.see also texas employers ins.ass jackson,cir en banc pretermitting issue of district court jurisdiction since relief properly denied on merits 
madriz deferred adjudication as a ground for removal 
a introduction 
madriz contends that his november texas deferred adjudication for possession of lsd is not a conviction,or grounds for removal,under section a i ii,see note supra,for basically two reasons 
that it was not a conviction because it was not final and did not meet the definition of conviction stated in matter of ozkok,i n bia,and applied to deferred adjudications under crim.proc.in ins,cir,in that on violation of his community supervision he could not be convicted or sentenced for the underlying offense without a trial leading to formal adjudication of guilt and sentence,with right of appeal,and the proceedings against him were ultimately dismissed and he was discharged in june on completion of his community supervision and 
that under the rule of in re manrique,i n bia may,and ins,cir,madriz texas deferred adjudication for possession of lsd,even if it were otherwise a final conviction for immigration purposes,would not be so treated because it was his first drug offense and had it been prosecuted in federal court madriz would have been eligible for favorable treatment,and ultimate expungement of conviction,under the federal first offender act ffoa,
in holding that madriz deferred adjudication was a conviction for purposes of section a i ii,the bia relied on a a,enacted september,as part of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,stat,which contained comprehensive amendments to the immigration and nationality act ina,stat,as amended,et.section a provides definitions for diverse terms a s used in this chapter,namely chapter of the ina.prior to the enactment of iirira,the ina contained no definition of conviction nor was there otherwise any federal statutory definition of conviction for purposes of the immigration laws.section a of iirira,stat,amended section a by adding thereto the following definition,codified as section a a 
a the term conviction means,with respect to an alien,a formal judgment of guilt of the alien entered by a court or,if adjudication of guilt has been withheld,where 
i a judge or jury has found the alien guilty or the alien has entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or has admitted sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilty,and 
ii the judge has ordered some form of punishment,penalty,or restraint on the alien liberty to be imposed.
section c of iirira,stat,provides that t he amendments made by subsection a shall apply to convictions and sentences before,on,or after the date of enactment of this act.
b does section a a by its terms render madriz deferred adjudication a conviction for immigration law purposes and,if so,does such application of section a a violate madriz constitutional rights 
i the language of section a a covers the deferred adjudication.
madriz in november pled guilty to the lsd possession offense,and the texas judge,pursuant to crim.proc.see note,supra,accepted the plea,heard evidence,found that it substantiated madriz guilt,fined him and placed him on five years probation under community supervision,but withheld adjudication of guilt.according to madriz,on june,the texas court dismissed the proceedings against him and discharged him on completion of his community supervision pursuant to the provisions of article a see notes and supra.under our holding in moosa ins,cir,t he text of a a a could not be more clear and madriz deferred adjudication constitutes a conviction thereunder,and does so notwithstanding the dismissal of the charges and discharge of madriz pursuant to article section c and notwithstanding the provision of article section c that such a dismissal and discharge under this section may not be deemed a conviction for purposes of disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law for conviction of an offense.see also ins,cir,noting that the language of section a a leaves nothing to the imagination,id.at,and approving moosa,id.at,ins,cir id.at benavides,specially concurring ins,cir.
ii no implied exception for offenders eligible for ffoa disposition if federally prosecuted 
madriz further argues in this connection that as the ninth circuit held in,the ffoa section see note supra was not repealed or limited in application by section a a so that one whose federal drug charges have been dismissed thereunder would not be considered to have been convicted for purposes of the immigration laws,and that hence an implied exception should be read into section a a for state deferred adjudications of first offenders for offenses which if prosecuted in federal court would have been eligible for disposition under the ffoa.even assuming,arguendo only,that the provision of the ffoa b that a deferred adjudication and subsequent dismissal thereunder shall not be considered a conviction for the purposes of a disqualification or disability imposed by law upon conviction of a crime,or for any other purpose precludes application of the section a a definition of conviction to a proceeding dismissed under the ffoa such a consequence would result only from the applicability of the ffoa to the putative conviction in question and would not to any extent result from any analysis of or ambiguity in the language of section a a.the section a a definition of conviction,expressly directed to situations where adjudication of guilt is withheld,could not be more clear,leaves nothing to the imagination and affirmatively and unambiguously includes madriz deferred adjudication under of crim.proc.there is simply no warrant,as a matter of statutory interpretation,to make up out of whole cloth some implied exception for state deferred adjudications on the basis of an analogy to section we agree with the several other courts of appeals that have rejected the same argument that madriz advances here.see gill ashcroft,cir it is enough to say that has no residual effect on the appropriate characterization of deferred dispositions.these are handled comprehensively,and exclusively,by a a acosta ashcroft,cir,at attorney general,cir 
iii equal protection 
madriz further argues that his contentions in this respect,even if not supportable as a matter of statutory construction,are constitutionally compelled by the equal protection component of the fifth amendment due process clause.again relying on,he contends that section continues to govern what constitutes a conviction for immigration law purposes and that it denies him equal protection to treat his texas deferred adjudication as a conviction when had his offense been prosecuted in federal court he would have been eligible for deferred adjudication and dismissal under section.assuming,arguendo only,that section controls over section a a for purposes of determining whether a federal offense disposed of under section is a conviction for immigration law purposes,we nevertheless reject this equal protection contention,as have all the courts of appeals which have considered it,other than the ninth circuit.
in light of congress plenary power to pass legislation concerning the admission or exclusion of aliens,it is clear that no more searching review than that of rational basis is appropriate.see,fiallo bell,d t he power to expel or exclude aliens is a fundamental sovereign attribute exercised by the government political departments largely immune from judicial control.citation and internal quotation marks omitted demore kim,d i n the exercise of its broad power over naturalization and immigration,congress regularly makes rules that would be unacceptable if applied to citizens.citation and internal quotation marks omitted under rational basis review,differential treatment must be upheld against equal protection challenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.fcc beach communications,d.see also,acosta,at,at.
we agree with the third circuit acosta opinion that the equal protection challenge is without merit because 
f amiliar with the operation of the federal criminal justice system,congress could have thought that aliens whose federal charges are dismissed under the ffoa are unlikely to present a substantial threat of committing subsequent serious crimes.by contrast,congress may have been unfamiliar with the operation of state schemes that resemble the ffoa.congress could have worried that state criminal justice systems,under the pressure created by heavy case loads,might permit dangerous offenders to plead down to simple possession charges and take advantage of those state schemes to escape what is considered a conviction under state law.acosta,at.
essentially the same reasoning was employed in to reject the similar equal protection challenge made there involving a texas deferred adjudication under crim.proc.for possession of a controlled substance 
there is a further reason that madriz equal protection argument fails.that argument assumes,in effect,that if the state judge who granted madriz deferred adjudication under crim.proc.had been a federal judge and madriz had been prosecuted for his lsd possession in federal court under a,the judge would have granted him deferred adjudication under section.of course,deferred adjudication under section is discretionary with the court.however,the state judge in madriz case determined that the appropriate sentence was five years probation and a fine,but deferred adjudication under section is limited to instances where the court places the defendant on probation for a term of not more than one year and there is no provision for a fine.the judge who thought five years probation appropriate might well have for that reason declined to grant deferred adjudication under section thus,in,the eleventh circuit rejected the alien similar equal protection argument,stating 
could not have received ffoa expungement relief,because he was actually sentenced to two years of probation,as well as a term in jail.relief under ffoa b is not available to an individual sentenced to a term of probation that exceeds one year nor is it available to anyone sentenced to jail time.id.at.
we conclude that drug offense could not have been expunged under the ffoa had he received his sentence under federal law and,therefore,the bia did not violate equal protection in ordering him removed from the united states.id.at footnote omitted.
in,the eighth circuit rejected an identical equal protection challenge to the application of section a a to a deferred adjudication under crim.proc.for possession of a controlled substance,in which the alien was placed on probation for ten years but two years later was permitted to withdraw his guilty plea,the indictment was dismissed and the conviction was set aside.at.the court expressly agreed with the above noted rational of,at.the court concluded that treating petitioner differently from an alien whose conviction was expunged under the ffoa is not arbitrary or unreasonable.his sentence was much greater than allowed under the ffoa,so he is not similarly situated to aliens who receive relief under that statute.id.at 
for the reasons above stated,we reject madriz equal protection claims.
iv does section a a,by its terms and the terms of iirira section c apply to deferred adjudications before its enactment 
madriz makes various arguments that the terms of section c are an insufficiently clear expression of congressional intent to warrant application of section a a to deferred adjudications entered prior to the enactment of iirira.we rejected all these arguments in moosa,at.madriz urges that cyr in effect supercedes this portion of moosa.we disagree.in cyr,the court noted iirira section c and other similarly worded sections of constituting instances in which congress did indicate unambiguously its intention to apply specific provisions retroactively.cyr.at quoting section c.cyr clearly supports,rather than undercuts,moosa holding in this respect.several courts of appeals have upheld the application of section a a to deferred adjudications entered before the enactment of iirira,see,acosta,at october pennsylvania heroin possession deferred adjudication based on nolo plea,at controlled substance possession deferred adjudication under crim.proc.based on guilty plea,at nolo contendere based california deferred adjudication for cocaine possession.we are not aware of court of appeals holdings to the contrary.
v constitutionality of retroactive application of section a a 
madriz contends that it is unconstitutional to apply section a a,enacted in,to his deferred adjudication,because at the time of the deferred adjudication it was not considered a conviction by reason both of ozkok and manrique.we reject this contention as we did the similar contention in moosa where we noted that it is well settled that congress has the authority to make past criminal activity a new ground for deportation.at quoting ignacio ins,cir.see also,mulcahey catalanotte,d marcello bonds.indeed congress can do so even for past antisocial conduct that not only did not result in a conviction but was not even criminal when engaged in.see galvan press.membership in communist party from to,made a ground for deportation in without formerly required proof in particular case that party advocated violent overthrow of the government,properly applied to alien who was unaware of the party advocacy of violence harisiades shaughnessy.membership in communist party which terminated prior to enactment of statute making it a ground for deportation,as to alien unaware of party commitment to violence united states sahli,cir.
madriz further argues in this connection that his guilty plea in the deferred adjudication must necessarily be considered constitutionally infirm because at the time the deferred adjudication was not a conviction for immigration law purposes and he could not have known that it would become so by the enactment of iirira.however,it has long been settled that a plea is not rendered constitutionally infirm because the defendant was not aware of the immigration consequences of a conviction pursuant thereto or because counsel or the court failed to advise him thereof.united states banda,cir united states holton,cir wright,federal practice and procedure criminal at.
we note that madriz lsd charge was dismissed solely as a result of his satisfactory completion of his sentence to probation as contemplated by crim.proc,and not to any extent because of the merits of the charge,or any question as to madriz guilt thereof which he has never denied or on account of any defect in the underlying proceedings or any question as to the validity of his guilty plea therein 
we likewise reject madriz reliance on cyr holding that the provisions of iirira section b,eliminating the eligibility for discretionary relief under ina c as to aliens convicted of certain crimes,did not apply to aliens convicted of such offenses pursuant to plea bargains prior to the enactment of iirira.as previously observed,this holding was not based on constitutional grounds,but was rather grounded on the court view that the language of the statute was not sufficiently express or explicit in that respect 
madriz constitutional arguments respecting the retroactive application of section a a lack merit.

our order simply states it is ordered that respondent motion to dismiss petition for review for lack of jurisdiction is granted.
this was apparently the first occasion that the june,order was before the bia.it is not mentioned in the bia december,decision,nor does madriz allege,or anything in the record before us reflect,that it was in the administrative record or otherwise available or furnished to the bia or mentioned or referred to before the bia at any time before november.although the record before us contains copies of the bia december,and april,decisions,as well as of the ij may,decision,it contains no other portions of the administrative record.the government motion to dismiss madriz january appeal to this court from the bia december,decision does contain,in addition to the bia decision and that of the ij,a copy of the complaint,waiver of indictment,deferred adjudication order and bill of costs in the texas criminal proceeding which had been admitted in evidence before the ij.the administrative record was not filed with this court in connection with the january attempted appeal.
cyr states if it were clear that the question of law could be answered in another judicial forum,it might be permissible to accept the ins reading of.but the absence of such a forum,coupled with the lack of a clear,unambiguous,and express statement of congressional intent to preclude judicial consideration on habeas of such an important question of law,strongly counsels against adopting a construction that would raise serious constitutional questions.id.at emphasis added.in a footnote called for at the end of the quoted passage,the court noted that congress could,without raising any constitutional questions,provide an adequate substitute through the courts of appeals.id.at.
in there were other issues in the habeas case besides the one which controlled our jurisdiction on the appeal from the bia.see id.at and.the government also argues that by granting its motion to dismiss madriz petition for review for want of jurisdiction we in fact did rule,adversely to madriz,on the sole claim raised in his habeas petition,and hence habeas relief was also barred by the provision of d that a court may review a final order of removal only if another court has not decided the validity of the order,unless the reviewing court finds that the petition presents grounds that could not have been presented in the prior judicial proceeding or that the remedy provided by the proceeding was inadequate or ineffective to test the validity of the order.however,it can not be determined whether our order granting the government motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction was not based only on the government apparently valid claim of untimeliness and did not reach the alternative a c ground.see note supra and accompanying text.
we observe in this connection that this litigation clearly presents a justiciable article iii case or controversy between the parties.further,whether one accepts the government view of cyr construction of the statutory jurisdictional framework or madriz view thereof,it is clear that this court is an appropriate judicial forum to resolve the issues presented,whether on review of the district court habeas ruling or by deciding its own jurisdiction on appeal from the bia.
