the supreme court of ohio set forth the facts underlying roe criminal convictions in its decision affirming those convictions and the sentence of death,which the district court relied upon,as follows 
the appellant,john roe,was convicted by a jury of the kidnapping,aggravated robbery and aggravated murder of donette crawford,and was sentenced upon the recommendation of the jury to death for aggravated murder.on the evening of october,donette crawford left her infant daughter with her parents on the west side of columbus and went with a friend,toni jester,to the alrosa villa tavern in the north end of columbus.crawford had cashed her paycheck that day and locked most of her money in her car before entering the tavern.the pair left the tavern around on october.jester drove the car to her home while crawford sat on the passenger side looking for her cigarettes.upon leaving jester at her home on the west side of columbus,crawford stated she was going to pick up her daughter and go home,which was less than a mile away.on her way,and between and,crawford stopped at a nearby convenience store on west mound street to buy a pack of cigarettes.an acquaintance of crawford last saw her as crawford left the and continued west on mound street.
at approximately,crawford mother,who was concerned that donette had not returned to pick up her daughter,telephoned jester and donette husband,steve steiner,to find out where donette might be.when she learned that neither party had seen nor heard from crawford,crawford mother began looking for her.later that saturday morning,when crawford father went looking for donette,he found his daughter empty car parked in the parking lot of agnes church on west mound street.the car had been ransacked,and the keys were later found in a flower bed at the church.donette wallet,purse,and money were never found.
on or about october,the huntington clothiers store on alum creek drive on the near east side of columbus was broken into through a hole in the wall,and a considerable amount of clothing was taken.a security guard was hired to watch the building on sunday night,october.at,the guard observed a car pull into a lot near the store.the driver in the car waited about five minutes and then got out and proceeded to walk to the huntington clothiers store.he then entered the store through the hole in the wall.the police were called and the guard attempted to block the hole with his vehicle,but the subject,a slim white male with long hair,slipped out and ran.the guard gave chase and fired three shots at the subject,who nevertheless escaped.the subject car was impounded and later identified as being registered to the appellant.at approximately,appellant mother,joyce lucas,took appellant to the home of michael and patricia daniel and asked if he could stay with them overnight.appellant had been shot in the foot,which,he explained,occurred while running from a store he had broken into that night.appellant then characterized the event as minor when compared to his shooting of a woman in the head the previous friday night.the daniels that night dismissed his description of the murder as in keeping with his character as a braggart.
a month later,on november,appellant was arrested with moses stevens while breaking into a radio shack store in beavercreek,ohio.once in custody,appellant was read his rights,which he waived,agreeing to speak with the police.after discussing his breaking and entering charges,appellant offered that he had information regarding a missing woman in that she had been killed and that he knew who was involved and where the body could be found.appellant indicated he wished to exchange this information to deal with his current charges.beavercreek detective harry anthony then asked appellant if he would like to talk about it later,and appellant agreed.the next day,appellant claimed that a person named jerry powell had shot the woman in the face and dumped her body behind a cement plant on alum creek drive in columbus.appellant described crawford car,stated she was possibly shot with a magnum handgun,and gave details including a map of the location of the body.he then indicated his willingness to talk to columbus police about crawford.detective anthony verified the information about the missing woman with columbus police and then arranged for them to talk with appellant.
on november,columbus police detectives stephen judy and david verne went to the cement plant to familiarize themselves with the area and then drove to the greene county jail to talk with appellant.appellant repeated his earlier description of the body location,and of jerry powell involvement,and tentatively identified photographs of crawford and her car.on november,the area described by appellant was searched,and the decomposed remains of crawford were discovered.the remains were identified by the clothing found with them and by use of crawford dental records.a hole,consistent with a gunshot wound,was located in the lower back right portion of the skull.however,subsequent investigation of jerry powell,including a polygraph examination,excluded him as a suspect.
on november,detective judy met with an anonymous caller,who was later identified as michael daniel,who conveyed his information concerning appellant statement about a murder he had committed in october.further investigation turned up appellant weapon,a ruger security six magnum revolver.this weapon was traced back to a burglary of castner gun shop in kirkersville,ohio,on september.appellant had committed two of castner in march,had served jail time thereon,and was suspected of having committed the september as well.other weapons stolen from castner were later recovered from the appellant parents home.ballistics evidence indicated that a caliber bullet fragment recovered from crawford skull had been fired from appellant revolver.
appellant was indicted on december,for two counts of aggravated murder with two specifications for felony murder kidnapping and aggravated robbery,b,a,one count of aggravated robbery with a firearm specification,and two counts of kidnapping with firearm specifications.trial began on november,and on december,the jury found appellant guilty on all counts and specifications.a sentencing hearing was held pursuant to,and after three and days of testimony and deliberations,the jury recommended the imposition of the death penalty.following its independent review,the trial court accepted the jury recommendation and,merging counts one and two,sentenced appellant to death for aggravated murder.in addition,merging the two kidnapping counts,the trial court sentenced appellant for the kidnapping and aggravated robbery,and two firearm specifications.the court of appeals affirmed the judgment of conviction and death sentence.
state roe,ohio.
following the ohio supreme court decision,and the united states supreme court denial of certiorari,roe filed a motion for relief in the trial court,pursuant to,on october.the trial court held a hearing,and subsequently denied roe petition for relief.roe appealed,but in,the franklin county court of appeals affirmed the trial court judgment dismissing his claim.the ohio supreme court denied roe request for a discretionary appeal in.
roe filed his habeas corpus action in,raising claims for relief.in,the case was transferred to the southern district of ohio,the district of his conviction.then,inexplicably,the case languished and was reassigned to several different judges.finally,the case was assigned to judge sargus who dismissed the petition in,but certified issue for appeal to this court.roe raises seven of those certified issues in this appeal.the government makes no claims of procedural default as to any of these seven issues.
although we review de novo the district court disposition of a petition for writ of habeas corpus,we review the district court factual findings only for clear error.mcqueen scroggy,cir.further,federal courts must defer to state court factual findings,according to them a presumption of correctness that the petitioner may rebut only with clear and convincing evidence.id.however,t he presumption only applies to basic,primary facts,and not to mixed questions of law and fact,which receive de novo review.id.
in setting forth this standard of review,the effect of the amendments to contained in the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat,has been ignored.although aedpa became effective on april,and it mandates significant changes to the federal courts treatment of both factual and legal issues in the habeas setting,the supreme court decision in lindh murphy,d,instructs that those changes do not apply to this case,or to any case pending at the time of the aedpa enactment instead,those changes generally apply only to cases filed after the act became effective.id.at.because roe filed his habeas petition in,we must apply d as it existed prior to enactment of aedpa.id.
roe does not contest on appeal any of the facts underlying his convictions.all seven of his assignments of error allege various procedural errors by the state courts.we address each assignment in turn.
whether the jury instructions addressing unanimity in its sentencing recommendation violated roe constitutional rights 
roe objects to the trial court instructions to the jury related to its sentencing recommendation.the first instruction at issue was given,as follows 
as in the first case,and this is not in the written instructions,as in the first case your verdict must be a unanimous verdict.all of the jurors must agree unanimously on the appropriate verdict.once you have made such a finding,again you would notify my bailiff with respect to that.all jurors have to sign the verdict form.the foreperson will sign on the line designated foreperson.
the second instruction at issue was given earlier,as follows 
now each of you must decide the case for yourself,but you should do so only after a discussion and consideration of this case with your fellow jurors.now do not hesitate to change an opinion if you later find that that opinion or that position is wrong.however,you should not surrender honest convictions in order to be congenial or in order to reach a verdict solely based upon the opinion of the other jurors.
the relevant ohio statute provides 
if the trial jury unanimously finds,by proof beyond a reasonable doubt,that the aggravating circumstances the offender was found guilty of committing outweigh the mitigating factors,the trial jury shall recommend to the court that the sentence of death be imposed on the offender.absent such a finding,the jury shall recommend that the offender be sentenced to life imprisonment with parole eligibility after serving twenty full years of imprisonment or to life imprisonment with parole eligibility after serving thirty full years of imprisonment.
d.roe argument,then,is that though the court correctly instructed the jurors that their sentencing recommendation of death had to be unanimous,it erroneously failed to instruct the jurors that unanimity was not required to sentence roe to either life imprisonment with parole eligibility after serving twenty years or life imprisonment with parole eligibility after serving thirty years.the district court described the issue in this manner 
it is clear from this statutory provision that a jury recommendation of death must be unanimous.equally clear is the fact that this provision does not require a capital jury to unanimously reject a death sentence in order to impose one of the life sentence options.what seems ambiguous is whether one of the life sentence recommendations could just from a unanimous determination by the jurors that it was the appropriate from an inability of the part of the jurors to achieve unanimity on whether to recommend a death sentence.
in essence,roe contends that the failure of the court to instruct the jury regarding the result of any deadlock as to the imposition of a death sentence may have resulted in the impression on the jury that it must unanimously reject death,rather than a single juror being capable of preventing a death sentence by creating a deadlock.
the ohio supreme court has issued several decisions on this point.in state jenkins,ohio,it held that a jury recommendation of life imprisonment under that section must be unanimous.in state springer,ohio,the court held that when a jury becomes hopelessly deadlocked as to sentence,the trial court is required to impose a life sentence.in state brooks,ohio,the court reviewed a sentencing instruction that the jury must unanimously agree that the death penalty is inappropriate before recommending a life sentence.the court found this instruction contrary to d.brooks purported to harmonize the jenkins and springer holdings by requiring an instruction to be given thenceforth that a solitary juror could prevent the imposition of the death penalty.
nevertheless,the fact that an instruction was allegedly incorrect under state law is not a basis for habeas relief.estelle mcguire,d.the issue on collateral review in the federal courts is whether a defendant federal constitutional rights were violated by the instruction.we addressed this same issue in coe bell,cir,and held that such a unanimity instruction as to a sentencing recommendation of death did not violate the constitution.again in scott mitchell,cir,we observed the same.just as in coe and scott,the instructions at issue do not require unanimity as to a specific mitigating factor,which would violate mills maryland,d,but only as to the overall weighing process,which is permissible.further,as we observed in scott,both this circuit and the supreme court have chastised such instructions as encouraging deadlock and undermining the strong governmental interest in unanimous verdicts.scott,at citing jones united states,d and coe,at.accordingly,this assignment is without merit.
roe relies on mapes coyle,cir,to support his argument.he contends that mapes held such a unanimity instruction violates ohio law 
the ohio statute contains no requirement that a capital jury must unanimously reject a death sentence before considering life imprisonment moreover,the ohio supreme court has ruled that an instruction,such as the one given by the trial court here,violates the eighth and fourteenth amendments by creating a risk of an erroneous imposition of the death penalty.see state brooks,ohio.the record reflects that the jury in this case was instructed in a manner completely contrary to law,this error required vacating the death sentence and remanding for although the trial court in this case did not have the benefit of brooks,that case clearly establishes that the trial court misapplied ohio revised code d by requiring the jury to unanimously reject the death penalty before considering a life sentence.
id.at.nevertheless,mapes ultimately held b ut all that being so,the trial court instructional errors do not require granting mapes habeas petition because neither of these last two instructional issues was raised on appeal.thus,mapes procedural default is an adequate and independent ground for affirming his sentence.id.at.accordingly,the scott court in addressing the same issue found the mapes language to be dicta.ironically,the scott court likewise found the issue procedurally defaulted and addressed the merits in the alternative only out of an abundance of caution and in order to clarify our precedents governing instructions on jury unanimity.scott,at.yet,as the scott court emphasized,in year prior to court had directly and conclusively addressed the same issue in coe.see id.at.therefore,even if mapes discussion was not dicta,coe would control.
whether remarks by the prosecutor during the sentencing phase of the trial rendered roe trial fundamentally unfair 
roe maintains that the prosecutor arguments at the mitigation hearing deprived him of a fair sentencing hearing because those comments improperly denigrated the entire notion of a mitigation hearing,and,were arguments as to evidence of mitigating factors not presented by roe.
though not procedurally defaulted,as roe raised this issue in his state appeal,his counsel did not object to any comments of the prosecutor at trial.thus,as both the supreme court of ohio and the district court held,this issue was not preserved.accordingly,we review for plain error.united states crozier,cir.to establish plain error,a defendant must show that an error occurred in the district court the error was plain,obvious or clear the error affected defendant substantial rights and this adverse impact seriously affected the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.id.roe does not show either that the remarks affected his substantial rights or such remarks seriously affected the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of the judicial proceedings,as he must.id.
first,with regard to denigration of the mitigation process,the prosecutor merely argued that the victim perspective was ignored in a mitigation hearing 
defendant usurps the compassion that is justly his victim due.he will steal his victim moral constituency along with her life and now defendant asks you,ladies and gentlemen,without a word of remorse,with only tears for himself,without a tear for his victim.not a sorry.he wants you to give him what he would have gotten if the victim had been allowed to.
roe asserts that this argument from the prosecutor essentially asked the jury to agree that the entire concept of a mitigation hearing was repugnant and constituted an attempt to steal or usurp the victim moral constituency along with her life.this form of argument undermined the integrity of the entire process and offended the constitutional concept of a fair trial.it is not clear that these comments denigrated the mitigation process,but,rather,as the district court held,t he prosecutor argued,in essence,that the victim life had ended and that only roe plight could be presented,in person,to the jury.to this extent,the prosecutor comments concerning the victim,understandably dramatic and emotional in the case of a crime involving a violent killing,were well within the constitutional parameters of a fair trial.
in payne tennessee,d,the supreme court held that the eighth amendment does not prohibit evidence and argument relating to the victim personal characteristics and the impact of the victim death on the victim family.under payne,such argument would be proper.the court,however,left open the question as to whether under the fourteenth amendment such arguments,when unfairly prejudicial,might offend due process.the standard for such due process challenges is whether the evidence or argument so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.darden wainwright,d concerning admission of evidence see also donnelly dechristoforo,d concerning prosecutorial misconduct.a court must look to the totality of the circumstances to determine whether the misconduct denied roe a fair trial.summitt bordenkircher,cir.we have identified the factors to be considered in weighing the extent of prosecutorial misconduct in habeas cases.we consider the degree to which the remarks complained of have a tendency to mislead the jury and to prejudice the accused whether they are isolated or extensive whether they were deliberately or accidentally placed before the jury and the strength of the competent proof to establish the guilt of the accused.angel overberg,cir citing united states leon,cir.even if the prosecutor comments conveyed the meaning that roe alleges they conveyed,it is clear that such isolated and indirect comments did not render roe trial fundamentally unfair.
second,with regard to the prosecutor comments as to the absence of evidence as to certain mitigation factors,roe points to the following statement,i n some crimes,the victim has something to do with what happened,the victim is somehow partially to blame.what makes this crime so repulsive,what absolutely tests your faith in the mercy of god is the awesome randomness of the crime,as well as,s ome crimes you find that the person who commits the crime was under duress,coercion,provocation.i remind you of what roe said in his unsworn statement.i could have stayed home,no one forced me,i wanted the money.he wanted to do it.he did it.in considering this assignment of error,the supreme court of ohio held 
the prosecutor commented on statutory mitigating factors on which appellant had not presented evidence at the hearing.in state depew,ohio,we stated that such comment is appropriate only with regard to those factors actually offered in mitigation by the defendant.here,however,as in williams,supra,ohio at,obr at,at,appellant failed to timely object to such comment below,and in any event,the trial court instructions to the jury regarding both and statutory mitigating facts were sufficient to correct any error on the part of the prosecution.although the prosecution argument was improper,it did not amount to a conversion of mitigating factors into prohibited aggravating factors.
as below,the government does not argue that such comments were appropriate,but they were limited,isolated and mitigated when the court gave the jury appropriate instructions,which would have cured any misperception that the jury might have received from the prosecutor arguments.we agree.moreover,such passing comments did not render the sentencing phase fundamentally unfair.when reviewing prosecutorial misconduct on direct appeal,this court has remarked 
more commonly,however,the conduct will not rise to reversible error,notably if it is not flagrant,where proof of guilt is overwhelming,where counsel does not object where the trial judge steps in and admonishes the jury.indeed,it is notable how often courts cite improper argument by a prosecutor and how seldom they reverse convictions because of it.
united states bess,cir citations omitted.this case easily falls into that category.
whether roe constitutional right to an impartial jury was violated by the admission of testimony that he possessed a list of all the potential jurors names and addresses 
vincent boyd,roe cellmate,testified against him at trial regarding certain incriminating admissions made by roe to him.admittedly,the defense attempted to discredit his testimony on with questions designed to show that he knew details of the case by reading roe legal papers in the cell.on,the prosecution asked boyd what he remembered about the papers.boyd denied seeing them except cursorily and said that the only thing he remembered was a list of all the jurors names and addresses.roe objected,and the trial court overruled that objection,having already conducted a sidebar as to this general issue.later,counsel moved for a mistrial on that basis,which the trial court denied.after the lunch recess,the jurors expressed their concern to the bailiff about roe possessing a list of their names and addresses.the bailiff advised the court.the court then gave the following curative instruction to the jury 
there has been brought to my attention some concern about testimony concerning the jury list.as you may or may not be aware,we have individuals subpoenaed for this particular jury.we have got for monday,tuesday,wednesday,and thursday.our legislature,in their infinite wisdom,deci
