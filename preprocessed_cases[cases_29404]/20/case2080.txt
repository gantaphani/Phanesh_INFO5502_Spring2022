at the age of,derrick hardaway confessed under police questioning to the murder of robert sandifer.an illinois trial court denied hardaway motion to suppress his confessions as involuntary,and he was convicted of the crime and sentenced to years in prison.after exhausting his state court remedies,hardaway filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.the district court granted the petition,finding that in light of hardaway age,the lack of a friendly adult presence,and the length of the interrogation,hardaway confession was involuntary and suppression was required.because we reluctantly conclude that the illinois courts application of the totality of the circumstances test to hardaway confession was not an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court precedent,we reverse the judgment of the district court.we do so,however,with the gravest misgivings and only in light of the stringent standard of review that applies under the applicable law,because we are convinced that the many other indicia under illinois law of the special care that must be exercised with children as young as strongly suggests that an injustice was committed here.
on august,robert yummy sandifer,a member of the black disciples street gang in chicago roseland neighborhood,shot and killed shavon dean and wounded two other children.sandifer himself then disappeared.an intensive police search for sandifer ensued until sandifer body was found under a viaduct at street and dauphin avenue shortly after midnight on september.he had been shot twice in the back of the head.
in the early morning hours of september,cassandra cooper telephoned the police and told them that sandifer had been at her home around the night before and that her daughter jimesia saw sandifer leave their porch with hardaway and his older brother cragg.at around,the police went to the hardaway home.hardaway was roused from sleep,told of the investigation,and,after conferring with his father,agreed to accompany the officers to the police station to help with the investigation.hardaway father was offered a ride to the station but declined,choosing instead to wait for his son cragg to return home.hardaway dressed and was transported to the police station unhandcuffed and placed in an unlocked interview room at about 
two detectives,robert lane and romas arbataitis,questioned hardaway at that time.hardaway admitted to knowing sandifer but stated that he had last seen him three days earlier.the detectives then left the interview room and arbataitis spoke to jimesia,who confirmed her mother report that sandifer and hardaway had been together that very night.jimesia said that hardaway had approached sandifer and another boy,mike griffin,who were both sitting on the porch of her home,and told sandifer that he had to go with derrick,that cragg and the boys wanted to take him out of town.
at about,the detectives interviewed hardaway for a second time.this time they read him his miranda rights and confronted him with jimesia statements.hardaway then changed his story,essentially admitting to jimesia version of events.he said that sandifer and griffin followed him off the porch and went to a waiting car,driven by cragg.cragg then drove off with sandifer while hardaway and griffin walked home.the detectives conversation with hardaway lasted about minutes and he was then left alone in the interview room.over the next six hours he was briefly questioned on matters such as the name of cragg girlfriend,provided with lunch,and occasionally checked on.most of his time,however,was spent alone.
during the afternoon,griffin was located and interviewed by the police.he confirmed that he and sandifer walked to cragg car but stated that hardaway had gotten into the car with sandifer and that the brothers had refused to give griffin a ride home because they were in too deep.at,two new detectives,john mccann and james oliver,reiterated the miranda warnings and then interviewed hardaway,who repeated his story.mccann informed hardaway that griffin had said something different and walked him down the hall to show him that griffin was in another interview room.at that point,hardaway admitted that he did get into cragg car with sandifer and that he was present when cragg shot sandifer under the viaduct shortly thereafter.
questioning then ceased while an assistant state attorney,theresa harney,and a youth officer,james geraci,were contacted.at approximately,mccann,harney,and geraci met with hardaway.harney told hardaway that geraci was a youth officer and that he was present as an observer and to assist hardaway if he had any questions or problems.geraci then asked hardaway if there was anything he could assist him with,to which hardaway responded no.from that point onward,geraci did absolutely nothing to assist hardaway.harney read hardaway his miranda rights yet again and informed him again that he could be tried as an adult.hardaway then explained his rights back to harney in his own words,stating that he did not have to speak with harney if he did want to,that anything he told harney she could tell a judge in a trial against him,that he could have an attorney there when he was questioned about the case,even if he or his family could pay for one,and that his case could be moved out of juvenile court to adult court if the judge decided.
hardaway gave a statement to harney in which he again confessed to the crime and then agreed to repeat the statement to a court reporter.another break was taken until the court reporter arrived at.at that time,hardaway admitted that he and cragg had been ordered by the leader of the black disciples to get rid of sandifer,that he approached sandifer on the coopers porch and brought him back to cragg car,that he accompanied cragg and sandifer to the viaduct,and that he watched out for police while cragg shot sandifer.
the state courts found that hardaway parents never tried to come to police headquarters to see their son,and hardaway never asked for his parents or for an attorney.he was not physically abused or threatened by the detectives in any way.hardaway had previous arrests for charges including robbery,attempted criminal sexual assault,unauthorized use of a weapon,and delivery of a controlled substance,but he had never faced anything as serious as a murder charge.he had appeared in juvenile court with appointed counsel on seven occasions there is no evidence,however,whether he had ever been advised of his miranda rights on those occasions,and it appears that he had little or no experience in the adult criminal justice system.
hardaway moved to suppress his confession.the trial court denied the motion,finding that the police had never prevented hardaway from seeing his parents or an attorney that a youth officer was present to assist hardaway at his last two confessions that there were no threats or abuse that there was no evidence hardaway suffered from any mental incapacity or handicap and that he was already more familiar with the criminal justice system and with attorneys than most ordinary adult citizens would be in light of his numerous prior court referrals.it therefore found the confession to be voluntary under the totality of the circumstances.the illinois appellate court affirmed and the illinois supreme court denied review,leading to this timely petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,governs the grant of a writ of habeas corpus here,because hardaway petition was filed after the effective date of that statute.before a writ may issue,a federal court must find that the challenged state court decision is either contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court.williams taylor,d.the district court found and hardaway here concedes that the decision to admit the confession was not contrary to clearly established federal law it instead focused on the unreasonable application inquiry.a state court decision that correctly identifies the governing legal rule but applies it unreasonably to the facts of a particular prisoner case certainly would qualify as a decision involv ing an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.id.at.a state court decision must be more than incorrect from the point of view of the federal court aedpa requires that it be unreasonable,which means something like lying well outside the boundaries of permissible differences of opinion.id.at.we review the findings of both the state and district court de novo but with a grant of deference to any reasonable state court decision.anderson cowan,cir.
the voluntariness of a confession,whether made by a juvenile or an adult,is evaluated on the basis of the totality of the circumstances surrounding that confession.schneckloth bustamonte,d fare michael,d.in juvenile cases,the totality approach requires an evaluation of the juvenile age,experience,education,background,and intelligence as well as the circumstances regarding the confession.fare,at.the supreme court in the past has spoken of the need to exercise special caution when assessing the voluntariness of a juvenile confession,particularly when there is prolonged or repeated questioning or when the interrogation occurs in the absence of a parent,lawyer,or other friendly adult.in re gault,d gallegos colorado,d haley ohio.in this case,the trial court correctly recognized that it was required to apply a totality of the circumstances analysis and also stated,i do realize and i do take into consideration that the defendant is a juvenile.and that this court must take great care to insure that the admission was voluntary.the illinois appellate court also stated that it would scrutinize the juvenile confession with particular care.people hardaway,d.notwithstanding these protestations,the district court found that the analysis of both state courts was an unreasonable application of the totality of the circumstances test in light of haley,gallegos,and gault,and it therefore issued the writ.
the district court had good reason for doing so,in that it relied on several supreme court decisions that had held that the fifth amendment rights of a juvenile had indeed been violated.in haley,a boy was arrested at midnight and interrogated for five straight hours by six officers in relays of one or two officers at a time.at,after being falsely told that two other boys had implicated him,the defendant confessed.haley,at.he was then held for three more days before being charged while his mother and an attorney she had retained were rebuffed in attempts to see him.id.the supreme court found this confession involuntary because t he age of petitioner,the hours when he was grilled,the duration of his quizzing,the fact that he had no friend or counsel to advise him,the callous attitude of the police towards his rights combine to convince us that this was a confession wrung from a child by means which the law should not sanction.id.at.hardaway case is less egregious,in that there were no efforts to keep his parents away or to confront him with false testimony,and he was held for less than one day rather than three.there were also lengthy breaks in the interrogations,rather than the five grueling hours that haley was forced to endure.
gallegos,in contrast,is closer to the mark.in that case,a boy was arrested on assault and robbery charges he immediately admitted to the crime.gallegos,at.after his arrest,he was locked for five days in juvenile hall,where his mother was not permitted to see him.he signed a full and formal confession at the end of the week.during that time,he never asked to see his parents or an attorney.the court admitted that there was no prolonged questioning or use of fear to break down the defendant,but it found that under the totality of the circumstances the detention and refusal to permit the boy mother to see him gave the case an ominous cast.id.at.it concluded that a boy,no matter how sophisticated,is unlikely to have any conception of what will confront him when he is made accessible only to the police he would have no way of knowing what the consequences of his confession were without advice as to his someone concerned with securing him those rights.id.the court therefore found that the formal confession had to be suppressed.id.at.
in many respects,this case is quite similar to gallegos.like gallegos,hardaway was only at the time of his arrest.he was questioned for a longer time than gallegos before his first confession,and no friendly adult was present to explain his rights to him until many hours later even if we assumed that the passive geraci served that function.thus,reading the gallegos decision in isolation,we would likely affirm the district court judgment.
later decisions,however,indicate that the mere absence of a friendly adult is by itself insufficient to require suppression of a juvenile confession.in fare,the supreme court held that a totality of the circumstances analysis was adequate to take into account those special concerns that are present when young persons,often with limited experience and education and with immature judgment,are involved.at.turning to the specific facts of the case before it,the court found voluntary the confession of a with a prior criminal record and no signs of insufficient intelligence who had been subjected to no threats,intimidation,or trickery,despite the absence of a friendly adult.id.at.since fare was decided,gallegos has been cited just twice by the supreme court,both times as support for a totality of the circumstances or compound influence analysis to analyzing the voluntariness of confessions.see dickerson united states,d miller fenton,d.
the illinois state courts knew that they were supposed to apply a totality of the circumstances approach when evaluating hardaway claims,and they claimed to have done so.the district court agreed that the state courts used the correct test and thus were not acting contrary to applicable law,but that they did so unreasonably by failing adequately to consider three factors hardaway age the de facto absence of a friendly adult and the length and nature of the interrogation.
age is clearly a relevant factor in this case,as it is in many areas of the law.children under the age of are treated differently from adults under illinois law in a host of different ways.they may not marry,ilcs,vote,ilcs,serve on a jury,ilcs,or make a will,ilcs.restrictions are placed on their ability to work,ilcs,to smoke,ilcs,to operate a motor vehicle,ilcs,to withdraw from compulsory education,ilcs,and to travel outdoors between midnight and,ilcs.they can not purchase airline tickets,ilcs,consent to medical care,ilcs,attend a raffle,ilcs,or pierce their bodies,ilcs,without parental permission.see also united states shannon,cir noting various state limitations on ability of minors to consent to sexual activity with adults.it is thus somewhat incongruous that the state of illinois believes that children,in whose decisions the state has so little confidence in other areas,should be subjected to questioning for major crimes they are suspected of having committed without the continuous presence and assistance of a friendly adult.
the constitution too affords children rights that can not always be equated with those of adults.see,planned parenthood of cent.danforth,d gault,at.constitutional distinctions between minors and adults are recognized for three reasons the peculiar vulnerability of children their inability to make critical decisions in an informed,mature manner and the importance of the parental role in child rearing.bellotti baird,d.thus,children may be required to consult with a parent or other friendly adult before obtaining an abortion,id.at,and they may in some circumstances be tried in juvenile court proceedings without a jury trial or certain other precautions,but also without risk of the imposition of adult punishments,to be served in adult institutions.mckeiver pennsylvania,d,gault,at.
the difficulty a vulnerable child of would have in making a critical decision about waiving his miranda rights and voluntarily confessing can not be understated.indeed,hardaway argues that we should interpret gallegos to impose a per se rule that no child under the age of may waive his rights or make a voluntary confes
