the question presented,one of first impression for this court,is whether a petitioner in immigration detention or under an order of removal as a consequence of a state conviction is in custody within the meaning of the statute providing for a writ of habeas corpus to challenge such a conviction.we join our sister circuits that have considered the issue in holding that immigration detention is not custody for the purposes of establishing jurisdiction to consider habeas petitions challenging a state court conviction pursuant to.
