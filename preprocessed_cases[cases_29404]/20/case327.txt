background 
i.the evidence at trial 
because this case centers on walker various statements,including the hearsay statement admitted at trial,it will be most useful to describe the facts as she told them at trial,including the inconsistencies in her account revealed on and through the admission of her written statement.
walker testimony on direct examination 
the account in this section relies only on walker sworn testimony given on direct examination at trial.walker is a dancer who,at all times relevant to the facts of this case,worked at an adult club called sweet cherry,located in the sunset park neighborhood of brooklyn.walker met omitogun,the victim of the burglary,soon after moving into the apartment complex where they both resided in the canarsie neighborhood of brooklyn.she had visited his apartment on two occasions,observed that he had fairly nice things,and heard him brag about his car,jewelry,and clothes.
walker met evans merzier through a mutual friend three weeks to a month prior to the evening of the burglary.that meeting was arranged so that walker could ask merzier for a loan to pay her overdue rent,but merzier was not able to lend her the money at the time.she met evans a few weeks before the burglary,and foster only one or two days before the crime.
on august,walker was at her apartment with the three defendants and one of her coworkers,diamond.during this gathering,foster told the group that he intended to rob omitogun.foster then went to the roof of walker building to canvass omitogun apartment,which was accessible via the roof.he later commented on the similarity of the layout of walker and omitogun apartments.over the course of the evening,the group planned the burglary.foster was to be the ringleader and direct the burglary,evans was to follow him into omitogun apartment,and merzier was to stay behind in walker apartment as a lookout and getaway driver.the proceeds from the burglary were to be split among the defendants and walker,whose share was promised in exchange for allowing the burglars to use her apartment as a staging ground.
the next day,in the evening of august,walker was at home with diamond,evans,and merzier.as she entered her apartment,walker received a phone call from omitogun,who said that he was at a friend apartment in the same building.omitogun asked walker if she and other dancers from sweet cherry would be willing to entertain him and several friends from out of town.walker told omitogun that she had to be at work in approximately half an hour,but that she would come by his apartment afterward.evans,having overheard this conversation,stated that he intended to rob omitogun that night.shortly thereafter,merzier left the apartment,walker and diamond took a taxi to work at sweet cherry,and evans stayed behind at walker apartment.
upon her arrival at the club,walker was told that she was not allowed to work that evening because she was late.fearing for her safety,however,she decided to remain at the club.walker called omitogun cell phone to arrange details related to her visit to omitogun apartment later that evening,particularly whether she and her coworkers would be paid for their services.about an hour after her conversation with omitogun,walker spoke on the phone with merzier,who by that point had returned to walker apartment.walker testified,over defense objections,that merzier told her that foster and evans were in omitogun apartment robbing him.she also testified that she believed no weapons would be used in the robbery.
while returning home from work,walker received a call from omitogun.omitogun told her that he had been robbed.another man,also on the phone,threatened her with harm unless omitogun money and belongings were returned.shortly thereafter,walker had a series of telephone conversations with merzier.walker testified again over defense objections that merzier told her that he was unable to leave the apartment complex because police cars and helicopters had surrounded the block.
rather than returning home,walker and diamond decided to go to the police precinct because walker feared omitogun threats.she also feared that her role in the plan might be uncovered.upon arriving at the precinct,walker spoke with a police officer whose name she could not remember.she explained that she was being threatened and requested an escort home but did not mention anything about the burglary at omitogun home.the police officer asked where walker lived and,when told,informed walker there had been a homicide apparently unrelated to the events at issue in this case on her block.as a result,all the other officers were unavailable at that time.walker left the station,but returned some time later,at which point she spoke with detectives ahern and rivera.
over the course of approximately two days,walker gave varying statements about the events at issue in this case to the two detectives.most importantly,she told detective rivera that evans and foster but not merzier had discussed robbing omitogun.she also gave details about the plan to detective rivera in a written statement,which omitted her role in the discussions.
walker testimony on cross examination 
the facts in this section are drawn from walker testimony on,during which defense counsel successfully elicited several inconsistencies in walker account,as well as contradictions between walker testimony on direct examination and various other statements she had given at different times about her role in the burglary.the defendants sought on to demonstrate that walker was willing to tell different stories at different times to serve her interests.
walker admitted that,when giving a statement to detective ahern,she basically lied and said she had nothing to do with the burglary.she further testified that she did not mention any of the defendants in her initial statement to detective ahern.she told detective ahern that there was no one in her apartment and that nobody had her permission to be there.
walker testified that,after she spoke with detective ahern,the police accompanied her back to her apartment.upon arriving there,they found the three defendants,who were then arrested for burglary of walker apartment when asked by the police officers,walker denied knowing the defendants except for merzier.she then swore out a complaint falsely stating that the defendants did not have permission to be in her apartment that evening.
defense counsel did not ask walker about the specific contents of the written statement other than to ask whether her comments to detective rivera were consistent with her testimony on direct examination.walker did not testify about the contents of the written statement other than to say that the statement she gave to detective rivera was at least partially false.
finally,walker admitted that she agreed to testify against the defendants in exchange for a sentence.defense counsel also attempted to elicit contradictions in walker timeline of events and to raise questions about the true nature of her profession and her relationships with omitogun and merzier.however,walker denied that she had misrepresented anything about those subjects.
walker written statement 
the state then called detective rivera.over the objections of defense counsel,detective rivera testified to the contents of walker written statement.defense counsel argued that the statement contents were inadmissible because walker had already testified,because she could have been asked about the statement during her testimony,and because to admit the statement contents as prior consistent statements would constitute improper bolstering under new york law.after hearing arguments outside the presence of the jury,the trial judge overruled the objections to detective rivera testimony about the contents of the statement,and admitted the statement itself into evidence on the theory that,by asking walker whether she had lied when she gave the statement to detective rivera,defense counsel had made a charge of recent fabrication.the trial judge did not redact the written statement and did not limit the jury consideration of the statement as substantive evidence to the extent it was consistent with walker testimony.
the substance of the statement tracked much of walker version of events on direct examination,with the notable exclusion of any reference to walker role in facilitating the burglary.walker stated that she had gone shopping the day of the incident with diamond,merzier,and evans.after being dropped at home,diamond,walker,and evans stayed at walker apartment as the two women prepared for work.after leaving for work,walker received a phone call from merzier informing her that foster and evans were inside omitogun apartment.
at that point,walker statement departed from the version she gave at trial.in the written statement,walker claimed that she had told them to leave omitogun apartment,and that merzier assured her that they would.additionally,she stated that evans did have permission to be in her apartment,which contradicted what she had told police at the apartment.the written statement also described in significant detail the meeting during which the defendants discussed the proposed burglary and mentioned that evans had talked the week before about robbing her neighbor.the rest of walker statement was in line with the account given on direct examination,including the threatening phone call from omitogun and the threats made by omitogun friend 
d.other evidence at trial 
also testifying at trial were the three victims omitogun and two of his friends,who were at omitogun apartment when the burglary took place.according to their testimony,when the masked burglars entered the apartment,omitogun was on the phone with his girlfriend,who heard the burglary over the phone and informed the police.the victims testified that the burglars restrained them with telephone cords as they took valuables from the apartment.the burglars inflicted injuries on the victims that caused broken bones and required stitches.omitogun testified that,when the police arrived in response to his girlfriend call,the burglars left the apartment through the upstairs window,onto the roof.further investigation showed footprints leading from omitogun window,including some in the direction of walker apartment.
although the victims testified that the burglars had the same general build as foster and evans,the victims did not see the burglars faces.moreover,police were unable to match fingerprints found at the scene with any of those of the defendants.although footprints found on the roof were consistent with the boots worn by evans and foster,a police expert was unable to conclude that they were in fact made by any of the defendants.
a few hours after finding the defendants in walker apartment during which time the crime scene was unsecured,the police also found in walker apartment omitogun briefcase in the broiler of the stove,two loaded handguns underneath the refrigerator,obscured by several articles of men clothing,in cash the same amount omitogun had reported missing,seven wristwatches which omitogun had also reported missing,approximately twenty british pounds,and other personal effects of omitogun.
ii.procedural history 
after hearing the evidence recounted above,the jury returned a verdict convicting foster who had fled during trial and evans merzier was acquitted of all charges.evans appealed,arguing that the admission of walker statement into evidence represented improper bolstering.the prosecution argued that the statement was admissible as a prior consistent statement to refute a charge of recent fabrication.
the appellate division held that the admission of walker statement was error because the statement did not predate her motive to lie.it additionally held that the statement could not be admitted as a prior consistent statement,even if it had postdated her motive to lie,since it was not entirely consistent with her testimony at trial.finally,it held that,during their cross examination of detective rivera,defense counsel had refrained from asking about the specific contents of the statement and therefore had avoided open ing the door to the issue.people evans,dep t.
the appellate division further held,however,that the error was harmless and did not require reversal of petitioner sentence because there is no reasonable probability that the defendant would have been acquitted had the error not occurred,as the additional evidence adduced at trial was overwhelming in establishing petitioner guilt.id.
evans petitioned the district court for a writ of habeas corpus on october.on september,the district court granted the petition.evans fischer,d.in granting the writ,the district court relied on what it called the due process guarantee of trial fairness.id.at.the district court concluded that this federal constitutional guarantee is violated where the state trial court misapplies evidence rules in such a fundamental way that it interferes with a criminal defendant ability to put on a defense.in particular,the district court concluded that the cumulative effects of the admission of the hearsay statement were so prejudicial to the outcome of the case that the statement admission was not reconcilable with basic conceptions of justice.id.at.in finding that aedpa authorized relief under such circumstances,the district court identified four supreme court cases that,in its view,the appellate division unreasonably applied estelle mcguire,d dowling united states,d lisenba california.and chambers mississippi,d.according to the district court,mcguire,lisenba,and dowling together stand for the proposition that serious evidentiary errors can go to the fundamental fairness of a trial.the district court read chambers to say that the cumulative nature of errors embedded in a single evidentiary ruling and their cumulative effect can render a trial unfair.evans,d at.on the basis of these principles,which it took to be embodied in clearly established federal law,thaler haynes,d,the district court granted the petition and ordered the state either to retry or release petitioner within ninety days.evans,d at.
the state filed a timely notice of appeal,and the district court order was stayed pending appeal.
