background 
factual background 
this case involves the actions of terry peveler and four of his codefendants.in september of,the kentucky state police and the police department in livermore,kentucky began investigating peveler and his codefendants for suspected drug trafficking.this investigation commenced after a confidential source informed both law enforcement agencies that peveler was using and selling illegal drugs in western kentucky.
at approximately the same time as the investigation of peveler commenced,larry blanford was arrested by livermore police chief charles cobb for attempted theft of a motorcycle.blanford agreed to serve as a confidential informant and to purchase drugs from peveler in exchange for cash payments and the dismissal of his theft charge.
pursuant to this arrangement,blanford informed cobb and kentucky state police detective charles brownd that he purchased marijuana from peveler on november,and again on december,and that he saw peveler weigh and package various quantities of cocaine on january.blanford reported seeing firearms openly displayed in the rooms of peveler trailer home where the marijuana sales took place in and further stated that he saw firearms in the closet of peveler bedroom where the cocaine packaging occurred in.based on the information provided by blanford,warrants were issued to arrest peveler and search his trailer.the search resulted in the recovery of pounds of cocaine,pounds of marijuana,and firearms.
procedural background 
a federal grand jury returned an indictment against peveler and his codefendants in april of.the indictment named peveler in seven of the counts.five of these counts charged peveler with drug trafficking in violation of a.the other two counts charged peveler with violating c by using or carrying a firearm in relation to drug trafficking crimes on november,and december.peveler pled not guilty to all seven counts.
shortly thereafter,peveler filed a motion to suppress the evidence recovered from his trailer,contesting,among other things,whether the search was supported by probable cause.the district court referred the motion to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendation.after a hearing,the magistrate judge recommended that peveler motion be denied.this recommendation was adopted by the district court.
peveler subsequently entered into a plea agreement with the government.the agreement required peveler to plead guilty to a superseding information that charged him with the same five drug trafficking counts included in the original indictment,but with only one count of violating c by using or carrying a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime on january.in return,the government dismissed the counts relating to the firearm charges on november,and december,and further agreed to recommend a prison sentence and fine at the low end of the applicable range.peveler entered his guilty plea in september of,but preserved his right to appeal the district court denial of his motion to suppress.
in december of,peveler received a month prison sentence based on the six counts of the superseding information.the five drug trafficking counts accounted for of these months,with the additional months attributable to the firearm count.
peveler then appealed the denial of his motion to suppress.this court affirmed the district court judgment denying peveler motion.united states peveler,wl cir,unpublished table decision.the supreme court denied peveler subsequent petition for a writ of certiorari.peveler united states,d.
proceeding pro se,peveler then filed a petition under for relief from his conviction and sentence on july.the petition contains various grounds for relief,but the present appeal concerns only peveler challenge to his conviction and sentence on the firearm count.peveler argues in his petition that he pled guilty to the firearm count because he believed that he could be convicted under c for storing firearms in close proximity to illegal drugs.but following his guilty plea,the supreme court held in bailey united states,d,that a conviction for using a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime can only arise if the defendant actively employed the firearm.because the supreme court in bailey reinterpreted a substantive provision of the criminal law,peveler insists that the bailey holding applies retroactively to his case.he further contends that the lack of evidence showing that he actively employed a firearm on january,requires that his conviction and sentence on the firearm count be vacated.
the district court referred peveler petition to the magistrate judge.in june of,the magistrate judge recommended that the district court vacate peveler conviction and sentence on the firearm count.this recommendation was based on the government concession that peveler guilty plea to the firearm count was no longer valid after bailey.the government,however,withdrew its concession shortly after the supreme court issued its decision in bousley united states,d holding that a petitioner belatedly raising a bailey challenge to his guilty plea for violating c must show cause and prejudice to avoid procedural default,or else demonstrate his actual innocence with regard to the c charge and any other more serious charges dismissed during plea bargaining.seeking reconsideration of the magistrate judge recommendation,the government argued that bousley limited peveler ability to challenge his firearm conviction.
the government insisted that peveler had procedurally defaulted his due process claim by failing to assert it on direct appeal.peveler could avoid this procedural default,according to the government,only by showing cause and prejudice for the default,or by demonstrating that he is actually innocent.citing bousley,the government further argued that,in terms of demonstrating actual innocence,peveler had to show both that he did not actually commit the firearm offense charged in the superseding information the count on which he pled guilty and that he did not commit the firearm violations charged in the original indictment counts that the government dismissed as part of peveler plea agreement.the government argued that peveler committed the firearm offenses charged in the original indictment even under bailey interpretation of c.
peveler could prevail on his due process claim,the district court agreed,only by showing his actual innocence regarding the firearm counts in both the superseding information and the original indictment.it then remanded the issue to the magistrate judge for a recommendation regarding whether peveler was actually innocent of the firearm charges.
the magistrate judge conducted an evidentiary hearing in july of.at the outset of the hearing,the government conceded that peveler is actually innocent of the firearm charge in the superseding information.the hearing therefore focused on whether peveler had committed the firearm charges contained in the original indictment that is,whether peveler used or carried a firearm in relation to drug trafficking crimes on november,and december.
blanford,peveler,and peveler codefendant jamie gross testified at the hearing before the magistrate judge.both peveler and gross denied peveler guilt on the firearm charges in the original indictment.blanford testified,however,that he saw firearms lying out in the open when purchasing marijuana from peveler on november,and december.crediting blanford testimony,the magistrate judge found that peveler was not actually innocent on the two firearm charges in the original indictment because the firearms were displayed,and therefore actively employed,during the marijuana sales.the magistrate judge thus recommended that peveler request for relief from his conviction and sentence on the firearm count in the superseding information be denied.overruling peveler objections,the district court adopted the magistrate judge recommendation.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
in reviewing the denial of a petition,this court applies a de novo standard of review of the legal issues and will uphold the factual findings of the district court unless they are clearly erroneous.hilliard united states,cir citing gall united states,cir.
peveler procedurally defaulted his due process challenge to his conviction and sentence on the firearm count in the superseding information 
peveler maintains that,in light of bailey united states,d,he did not voluntarily and intelligently plead guilty to the firearm count in the superseding information.he therefore insists that due process requires that his conviction and sentence on the firearm count be vacated.peveler claim has a substantive basis.first,the supreme court,in bousley united states,d,held that bailey applies retroactively,such that a petitioner may rely on bailey in collaterally challenging whether his earlier guilty plea to using a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime comports with due process.second,the government has conceded that,under bailey interpretation of using a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime,peveler did not commit the firearm offense charged in the superseding information.
a due process challenge based on bailey,however,must first be raised by the petitioner on direct appeal.bousley,at.t he voluntariness and intelligence of a guilty plea can be attacked on collateral review only if first challenged on direct review.otherwise,the claim is procedurally defaulted.id.a procedurally defaulted claim,absent a showing of cause and prejudice or actual innocence,can not give rise to relief under.id.at.
in the present case,the district court held that peveler procedurally defaulted his due process claim.we agree,because peveler never raised his due process claim when he appealed his conviction on the firearm count.he instead limited his appeal to the district court denial of his motion to suppress.although peveler maintains that he raised his due process claim in his petition for a writ of certiorari to the supreme court,he can not avoid procedural default by asserting the claim in such a manner.absent exceptional circumstances,the supreme court will not address claims raised for the first time in a petition for a writ of certiorari.united states alvarez sanchez,d finding no exceptional circumstances to warrant review of a fourth amendment claim never previously raised.
the court has found such exceptional circumstances where a claim challenges the court jurisdiction,city of dallas,d stating that we are required to address the issue of jurisdiction even if the courts below have not passed on it and even if the parties fail to raise the issue before us.citation omitted.another exceptional circumstance was found where the court was presented with the question of whether a remedy is available directly under the constitution if a plaintiff allegations could also support a suit against the united states under the federal tort claims act.carlson green,d addressing the merits where the parties agreed that the court should decide the issue,where the issue was important and recurring,and where the same issue was properly raised in another pending petition for certiorari.we find no equivalent set of exceptional circumstances in the present case,and therefore hold that peveler has procedurally defaulted his due process claim.
peveler relies heavily on the second circuit decision in napoli united states,cir,to support the opposite conclusion.we,of course,are not bound by a decision from another circuit.in re ann arbor,cir recognizing this principle.moreover,our holding that peveler has procedurally defaulted his due process claim in no way conflicts with the second circuit decision in napoli.
in napoli,harold fishman and joseph napoli filed petitions seeking relief from their convictions under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico.relying on a supreme court decision issued after their convictions,fishman and napoli argued that the trial court improperly instructed the jury that it could find them guilty of violating rico without determining that they had participated in the management or control of a corrupt enterprise.neither fishman nor napoli had challenged this instruction in their appeals as of right.both,however,contended that the instruction was defective in their petitions for a writ of certiorari to the supreme court.the district court held that fishman and napoli challenge to the jury instruction was not procedurally barred,but concluded that giving the instruction was at most harmless error.fishman and napoli subsequently appealed to the second circuit.
the second circuit did not,contrary to peveler argument,agree with the district court that fishman and napoli had preserved their claims by raising them for the first time in their petitions for a writ of certiorari.instead,the second circuit held that,even assuming fishman and napoli had preserved their challenge to the jury instruction,any error in the instruction would not justify granting relief under.napoli,at.the second circuit thus never reached the issue of whether fishman and napoli procedurally defaulted their claims.our holding that peveler has procedurally defaulted his due process claim therefore does not conflict with napoli.
peveler offers no valid excuse for his procedural default 
based on peveler procedural default,the claim may be raised in a petition under only if peveler can first demonstrate either cause and actual prejudice,or that he is actually innocent.bousley,at.citations omitted.the hurdle peveler faces in excusing his procedural default is intentionally high,for respect for the finality of judgments demands that collateral attack generally not be allowed to do service for an appeal.elzy united states,cir.
peveler argues that he has demonstrated cause by raising his due process claim at the earliest possible stage,namely,after the supreme court issued its decision in bailey.a claim so novel that its legal basis is not reasonably available to counsel may establish cause for procedural default.bousley,at.quotation marks omitted.in bousley,however,the supreme court held that its decision in bailey was not sufficiently novel to excuse the petitioner failure to raise a due process challenge to his firearm conviction on direct appeal.id.the court explained that,at the time of petitioner plea,the federal reporters were replete with cases involving challenges to the notion that use is synonymous with mere possession for purposes of using a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime.id.
to excuse his procedural default,then,peveler must demonstrate his actual innocence with regard to both the firearm count in the superseding information and any other more serious counts dismissed during plea bargaining.id.at.part of his burden is satisfied by the government having conceded that peveler is actually innocent of the firearm violation charged in the superseding information.but the district court held that peveler failed to demonstrate his actual innocence on the two dismissed firearm counts in the original indictment.with regard to the required showing of actual innocence,i n cases where the government has forgone more serious charges in the course of plea bargaining,petitioner showing must also extend to those charges.id.
peveler now argues that the two firearm counts in the original indictment are not more serious than the firearm count in the superseding information.but he did not raise this argument bel
