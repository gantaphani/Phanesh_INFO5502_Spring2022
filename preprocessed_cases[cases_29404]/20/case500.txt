robert kuhlmann,superintendent of the sullivan correctional facility,appeals from that portion of the october,judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york joanna seybert,judge which granted curtis harris petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to,as amended by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat,vacated harris state conviction for two counts of murder and other related crimes,and directed that harris be released unless the state of new york retried him within sixty days.the district court granted harris petition after finding that harris fourteenth amendment rights were violated by the state prosecutor use of peremptory strikes in a racially discriminatory manner.see harris kuhlmann,d,relying on batson kentucky,d.kuhlmann also appeals from that portion of the district court november,order which denied his motion for reconsideration of the court judgment granting the writ,or,in the alternative,reconsideration of the court judgment granting harris a new trial,rather than a hearing on the reasons why the prosecutor peremptorily struck the jurors that he did.
harris filed a,challenging that portion of the district court october,judgment which denied the part of his habeas petition that was based on the contention that his constitutional right to present a defense was violated when the state trial court failed to hold a competency hearing despite evidence that harris was incompetent at the time of his trial and the district court may,order denying harris motion for reconsideration.
for the reasons set forth herein,we conclude that the district court correctly concluded that the state court denial of harris batson claim was inappropriate under federal law,but that the district court erred by ordering that harris be granted a new trial without first conducting a reconstruction hearing to determine,if possible,whether the state prosecutor had valid reasons for using his peremptory strikes as he did.with respect to the issues harris raised in his,we find no error in the district court rulings.
background 
on january,a jury in nassau county court found harris guilty of one count of intentional murder,two counts of felony murder,one count of burglary in the first degree,and one count of robbery,as a result of an incident in which harris and another man,julio giano,robbed and killed giano former girlfriend,vicki kestoglou.harris was sentenced to an indeterminate term of years to life on each of the three murder counts,and to years on each of the burglary and robbery counts.
harris habeas petition challenges two aspects of the proceedings in the state courts the trial court failure to order a competence hearing after harris was shot in the head and the prosecutor use of peremptory strikes.therefore,in order to evaluate the merits of harris habeas petition,it is first necessary to recount certain portions of the proceedings below.
harris motion to suppress 
in june and july of,the state trial court conducted a hearing on harris motion seeking suppression of oral,written,and videotaped statements harris made to the police.harris argued that the statements should be suppressed because his waiver of his right to an attorney was involuntary due to his low intelligence and consequent inability to understand parts of the miranda warnings he was given.
in support of this motion,harris presented testimony from roger feldman,a psychiatrist.feldman examined harris for an hour in march and for a half hour in july.resp app.at hereafter app.the first examination focused on harris competence to stand trial and whether feldman felt there was any indication for insanity at the time of the alleged crime.id.at.the second examination focused on harris understanding of his miranda rights,specifically id.during the course of these examinations,feldman observed and spoke to harris but did not conduct any formal diagnostic testing.id.at.feldman also reviewed harris school records from the time harris was nine years old until he dropped out of high school.id.at.feldman did not review any records from the time period after harris dropped out of high school,despite the fact that he was aware that harris had been enrolled in various educational programs during that period.id.at.
feldman testified that harris had borderline intellectual functioning,which is not considered a mental retardation diagnosis.id.at.instead,i t considered somewhere in between normal and in between sic retarded,so that any individual with intellectual functioning,even though their iq may be between and,still have sic the ability to function in life adequately.id.feldman opined,based on his conclusion that harris was in the borderline intellectual functioning category,that harris iq was in the range between seventy and eighty.id.at.feldman noted that,though he did not rely on the hartford school department records in making his assessments,those records were consistent with his conclusion about harris id.
feldman concluded that harris was competent to stand trial in march because harris understood at that time the nature of the charges the consequences if convicted and the role of the prosecuting attorney,of the judge,of the jury,if there was a jury,and what would happen if he was found guilty.id.at.however,feldman had the impression that,at the time of his confession,harris did not understand that he was entitled to speak with an attorney before speaking to the police.id.at.
on cross examination,the prosecutor challenged the validity of and the sufficiency of the evidentiary basis for a number of feldman conclusions.for example,on feldman acknowledged that he was aware that harris attended rehabilitative programs and educational programs in some of the institutions he was in after he dropped out of high school,and that he knew that harris intellectual functioning had improved as a result of the training harris had received since age seventeen.id.at.nonetheless,feldman did not attempt to obtain any records from any of those programs.id.at.
the prosecutor also pointed out on that feldman initially classified harris as being in the intellectual functioning category,which is the category above the borderline intellectual functioning category.id.at.only after the second interview,when harris ability to understand the miranda warnings was the focus,did feldman assessment of harris intellectual capability drop from to borderline intellectual functioning.however,as feldman pointed out,between the first and second interviews feldman had received harris hartford school records,which indicated that harris had severe learning disabilities.see id.at.
finally,the prosecutor raised the possibility that harris was malingering when feldman interviewed him.id.at.although feldman testified that he did not believe that harris was malingering,he conceded that he had not conducted any tests to determine the accuracy of the information harris provided.id.at.moreover,feldman testified that the issue of harris understanding of the miranda warnings did not come up until the second interview,at which time,according to feldman harris had discussed with his attorney in detail the meaning of the miranda rights,id.at harris had been researching or reading law books on this particular topic,id.at and harris understood that it was in his best interest to have his statements to the police suppressed,id.
ii.harris motion seeking a mental competence examination 
on september,before the trial court ruled on harris motion to suppress,harris and giano escaped from the custody of a court officer at the county courthouse in mineola,new york.during the ensuing shootout,harris shot a court officer in the head harris himself was also shot in the head.the bullet,which has never been removed,passed through the midline of his skull and lodged in the central ventricle of his brain.
in october,harris filed a motion seeking a competence examination pursuant to.proc.law mckinney in support of this motion,harris counsel filed an affirmation in which he stated that it was impossible to communicate with harris about the case due to the combined effects of harris low iq,harris head injury,and the medication harris was taking in treatment of his head wound.harris attorney did not submit any medical documentation about the effect of harris injury on his mental capacity,a list of medications harris was taking,or any other evidence in support of this motion.
on october,the state trial court heard oral argument on the motion.in support of the motion,harris counsel stated 
i t my understanding from the physicians treating my client that a bullet is lodged in the ventricle of his brain.accordingly,i have had difficulty communicating with my client in several respects.i would say that it is beyond my competence as a lawyer to decide whether this individual is competent to stand trial.for that reason,i would suggest to the court that we have someone who is competent to sic make that determination.
app.in response,the prosecutor argued that there was insufficient evidence to warrant a section examination.id.at.as evidence of harris competence,the prosecutor stated that harris had been released from the hospital and returned to the jail and jail personnel with whom the prosecutor had spoken that morning reported that t hey have no problem in communicating with harris and have made no noticeable observation of any inability to communicate at this time.id.the prosecutor then suggested that the judge should inquire of the defendant at this time as to whether there are any facts that would warrant a hearing.id.at.the trial judge then asked the prosecutor,how do you respond to harris counsel oral argument that irrespective of the fact that none of the personnel that you described have difficulty in communicating with the defendant harris that he,harris counsel,has difficulty communicating with harris id.at.the prosecutor noted that,even though he was not privy to the conversation,he did observe harris counsel conversing with his client in the courtroom.id.
the judge proposed that he himself question harris to determine whether a section hearing was required.harris counsel objected on fifth amendment grounds to any such questioning.id.at.however,the judge overruled that objection and conducted a brief session with harris.the colloquy was as follows 
the court harris,i going to ask you some questions.do you know what date today is 
harris what 
the court do you know what day of the week it is 
harris today 
the court what is it 
harris i do know.
the court you know liotti,do you 
harris yes.
the court he your attorney 
harris yes.
the court have you spoken to liotti recently 
the court pardon 
the court when was the last time that you spoke to him i not asking you what you discussed.all i want to know is if you spoken to liotti recently.
harris i do remember.
id.at.the trial judge then stated all right,based upon the court observation in the questions that i asked,i constrained to deny the motion seeking a section examination.
iii.the trial court denied harris motion to suppress 
on december,the trial court denied harris motion to suppress statements he made to law enforcement officials.in support of its ruling,the court made a number of findings and observations with respect to harris mental capacity at the time he initially spoke to the police.id.at.
first,the court found,as a matter of fact,that harris intelligence was in the low normal range.id.at.next,the court concluded that harris failed,as a matter of law,to demonstrate through the testimony of feldman that it was impossible,due to harris reduced level of intelligence,for harris to comprehend the full meaning of the rights afforded to him id.at.in support of this conclusion,the court primarily relied upon the evidence that harris had been arrested on prior occasions and was familiar with his miranda rights,and that harris was informed of his rights on several different occasions in the instant case.id.the court also appears to have accepted,at least to some degree,the government argument that harris was malingering.see id.at finally,it is interesting to note,that the defendant did not raise to feldman his confusion concerning his right to counsel until the second interview,at which point he had been studying this area of the law.
iv.evidence concerning harris competence at the time of trial 
harris ability to comprehend the proceedings and to assist in his own defense was raised again at trial,but not in the context of a request for a competence hearing.on january,the second day of jury selection,the court addressed the government application,pursuant to people sandoval,to be permitted to inquire into harris prior convictions and arrests in the event harris chose to testify at trial.during the course of the hearing on this motion,harris counsel questioned the accuracy and sufficiency of the government records concerning harris prior convictions.the trial court noted that,under sandoval,the defendant bears the burden of inform ing the court of prior convictions and misconduct which might unfairly affect him as a witness in his own behalf,and demonstrating that the prejudicial effect of the admission of evidence thereof for impeachment purposes would so far outweigh the probative worth of such evidence on the issue of credibility as to warrant its exclusion.id.at.in response,harris counsel stated 
well,i do object to the idea that harris bears the burden of proof,judge,except i would rely,you know,i have a defendant here,judge,with,i think,your honor said,you know,a modicum of intelligence.he has a he very inarticulate,judge.in addition to that,he has a bullet in his head at this moment in time.i tried to speak with him previously about these prior convictions.i spoken to him a number of times about them and he just does recall or recollect,and as in this past matter that i just raised a moment ago,his ability to communicate what transpired is sorely lacking.
id.at.the trial court responded 
i not suggesting that some of these circumstances are incorrect that you have asserted.i just do have and have made a finding of any sort about the situation because that does go back some years,that reference in the hartford public school system.but i understand your position 
id.at.shortly thereafter,the trial court granted harris counsel a continuance with respect to the government sandoval motion,so that harris counsel could speak with harris family and otherwise research harris prior convictions.id.at.
the next day,at the end of jury selection,the trial judge took up the government sandoval motion again.during the course of the hearing,harris counsel repeatedly stated that neither harris nor his parents were able to recall the details of most of harris prior convictions with enough specificity to allow harris counsel to challenge those convictions properly.see,id.at i tried to get information from this defendant about his prior record and very honestly,your honor,the defendant can not elucidate or carry on a conversation to the extent that he remembers anything about these prior acts.id.at noting that harris confirmed to some extent the limited information that his mother was able to provide,but also noting that harris had a very substantial drinking and drug problem for many,many years.
prior to rendering his decision,the trial judge observed 
n otwithstanding the arguments advanced,i too have had an opportunity during the course of the various proceedings and indeed the proceeding today and yesterday and the day before and a very important aspect of the trial of any criminal action,i had an opportunity not only to observe the fact that you,harris trial counsel,have done a fine job,but i have seen you work very hard for your client and i think from an observation standpoint,most ably for your client.i think he participated with you in the jury selection t hat my own observation 
app.thereafter,the following exchange occurred between harris counsel and the trial judge 
harris counsel judge,most respectfully i know you ca hear the conversation that harris and i are having 
the court but i can see facial expressions and i can see the interest that harris expresses which i think is commendable.
harris counsel you may recall,judge,on the first day of jury selection we had a paralegal sitting between myself and harris.she and i are both prepared to state for the record,judge,that harris has offered absolutely no assistance in jury selection because he been unable to do so.
his response 
the court then why have you asked 
harris counsel because out of curiosity 
the court opportunity to discuss things with your client 
harris counsel out of curiosity,judge,and in response to my professional obligations,i have turned to harris and i asked harris what about this juror,and harris would utter forth a grunt or something of a reasonable facsimile which makes absolutely no comprehensible sense to me.
just so your honor is aware of that.
the court does that have a bearing on the sandoval ruling 
harris counsel well,judge,it does to the extent that i can not get any information from harris about his prior offenses.
the court if you will pardon me and i mean no disrespect and no harm 
harris counsel i understand.
the court i think that the observation that you made and the context of which we at now are improperly placed.that merely an observation by the court.we are concerned with a sandoval ruling.i made some observations and i prepared to accept the fact that at the present time i seen no evidence to the contrary to indicate to my satisfaction certainly that harris ca participate with you,cooperate effectively and also aid you in the trial of this action.
id.at.after allowing the parties an opportunity to make final arguments,the trial judge ruled on the government sandoval motion.largely adopting harris position,the trial judge held that the government could only inquire into one of harris prior convictions.
at no point during the hearing on the sandoval issue did harris counsel renew his motion for a competency hearing.after the sandoval hearing,the competency issue was not mentioned again at trial 
harris challenge to the prosecutor use of peremptory strikes during jury selection 
on january,the state trial court began jury selection.the first black venire person to be examined was named mcgruder.both the prosecution and the defense accepted mcgruder for the jury panel.however,on the following day,before any additional jurors had been selected,mcgruder told the court that in he had been charged with a misdemeanor involving the carrying of weapons,that he was convicted,that he received a suspended sentence,and that he thereafter was granted a certificate of relief from civil disabilities.mcgruder had failed to provide this information when questioned by the judge during his examination the previous day.id.at.
after this disclosure,the prosecutor asked that mcgruder be dismissed for cause or,in the alternative,that permitted to utilize a peremptory challenge to strike mcgruder.the court denied the challenge for cause,but allowed the prosecutor to exercise a peremptory challenge.harris counsel objected to the exclusion of mcgruder,arguing that mcgruder was one of the few blacks on the panel of prospective jurors.the court nevertheless granted the prosecutor application for leave to strike mcgruder peremptorily.id.at.
later that afternoon,the prosecutor excused two more black potential jurors with peremptory challenges.harris counsel objected to their removal,stating 
judge,i want the record to reflect that at this time the prosecutor has challenged the two black jurors that we had sitting in the jury box,in addition to mcgruder,okay,and both of those jurors i found to be acceptable.i think this is a purposeful attempt by the prosecutor to exclude black jurors.
id.at.the judge offered to allow the parties to make a separate argument afterwards,to which harris counsel replied,well,i say it purposeful.under mccray abrams,cir.id.at.the prosecutor responded 
i certainly would indicate just because harris counsel finds certain jurors qualified,does not mean the people do.i have specific reasons why i excluded the jurors that i have.i selected yesterday mcgruder,who was a black juror,who was,i believe,the first one that came into view and because he was excused today had nothing to do with the fact that he was picked yesterday.
id.at.after harris counsel declined the judge invitation to respond to this argument,the judge proceeded with jury selection without further comment.id.
the next time the judge asked for peremptory challenges,harris counsel may have again attempted to raise an issue regarding the prosecutor exercise of peremptory challenges.unfortunately,the record is not entirely clear what the issue was at that time,because the prosecutor interrupted,asking can we do this after the judge replied we do this after.id.at.
at the end of jury selection,all five black venire persons,including mcgruder,had been peremptorily challenged by the prosecutor and subsequently removed from the panel.harris counsel again objected to the prosecutor use of his peremptory challenges to strike these five potential jurors.id.at.the judge,after hearing harris counsel argument,responded 
now,i troubled by what you stated because it seems to me that mcgruder was a black man on wednesday and on thursday,but he was the same black man that he had accepted on wednesday.now,how could you argue that there is a systematic attempt to exclude blacks by the district attorney office of nassau county when we had here,which was proof positive of the fact that the prosecutor had accepted a black man on wednesday 
id.at.for this reason,the judge said,he did not see the argument harris counsel was making.id.at.
harris counsel pointed out that,even assuming that mcgruder was excused for a legitimate,reason,the prosecutor used four other peremptory challenges against black venire persons.id.harris counsel then asked for the court to have the prosecutor state on the record his reasons for excusing the black venire persons or produce his notes and records on voir dire with respect to those prospective jurors,or for the court to conduct a hearing on the matter.id.at.in response,the court again pointed out that the prosecutor had,in fact,allowed mcgruder to be seated the court stated that at the present moment,i do have the background of having had the prosecutor select at least one black juror.id.at.the prosecutor again denied the allegations,stating 
i deny any allegation that harris counsel makes.i think he is the only one who has interjected race into this voir dire he questioned each and every juror that came in here,black,white,whatever,with respect to their opinions on interracial dating,school busing,police brutality and he tried to even go into the death penalty.
i deny any systematic exclusion of black jurors.i did select mcgruder who was acceptable to the people prior to his revealing the fact that he withheld a response to your question.and i specifically addressed myself to all those jurors with respect to the question of anyone who had been accused of a crime and i submit on the record there is nothing that would be in violation of mccray.i think harris counsel request for a hearing and for an analysis of my notes is frivolous and in poor taste.
id.at.the court then denied the request for a hearing.id.at.
vi.harris appeals in the state courts and his federal habeas petition 
harris appealed his convictions to the appellate division claiming,inter alia,that the prosecutor used peremptory challenges to exclude black jurors unlawfully in violation of batson and he was not competent to stand trial because of his low iq and his head injury.the appellate division held,sua sponte,that there was insufficient evidence to support harris intentional murder conviction,but otherwise affirmed the judgment of the trial court.people harris,dep t.harris then sought,and was denied,leave to appeal to the new york state court of appeals.people harris.
harris filed the present application for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to on april.he sought habeas relief on the same grounds as those presented in his direct appeal in the new york courts.on december,the district court dismissed the petition as,but,on september,this court entered an order vacating that judgment and remanding the case for a determination of whether harris timely filed his petition and if the petition was timely filed,consideration of its merits.see harris,d at.
on remand,the district court held that the petition was timely filed.id.at.the district court then granted harris petition on the batson issue,id.at,but denied the petition on all remaining grounds,id.at.kuhlmann filed a motion asking the district court to reconsider its decision on the batson issue or,in the alternative,to hold a hearing to allow him to present evidence of the prosecutor reasons for using his peremptory challenges as he did.app.the district court denied kuhlmann motion in both respects.id.at.kuhlmann filed his notice of appeal on december.id.at.harris also filed,and the district court denied,a motion seeking reconsideration of the district court denial of his petition with respect to the competence issue.harris filed his notice of on may.
discussion 
this appeal involves four issues,which we address in turn.first,kuhlmann contends that the district court erred by concluding that the state court incorrectly denied harris claim that the prosecutor used peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner in violation of batson kentucky,d.second,kuhlmann argues that,even if the district court correctly determined that the state court erred by denying harris batson claim,the district court improperly granted harris a new trial on that basis without first conducting a reconstruction hearing to determine,if possible,whether the prosecutor had valid,reasons for using the peremptory strikes as he did.third,harris argues on that the district court erred by denying him habeas relief on his claim that he was not competent to stand trial.finally,harris argues that the district court erred by denying his motion seeking reconsideration of the denial of that portion of his habeas petition which was based on the competence issue.
i.the batson claim 
kuhlmann argues that the district court erred when it concluded that harris conviction was the result of an incorrect application of the supreme court decision in batson although we conclude that the district court erred in its application of the habeas standard of review,we nonetheless agree with the district court conclusion that the state court denial of harris batson claim was incorrect.
standard of review 
this court reviews de novo a district court decision to grant or deny a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.overton newton,cir.
a petitioner may prevail on a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to d based on a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court if the petitioner establishes that the adjudication of his or her claim in state court resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d in williams taylor,d,the supreme court explained that a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court confronts facts that are materially indistinguishable from a relevant supreme court precedent and arrives at a result opposite to the result reached by the supreme court.id.at.see also bell cone,d sevencan herbert,cir.a state court decision involves an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.williams,at.see also bell,at.sevencan.
b.the batson standard 
the clearly established federal law that governs harris claim that the prosecutor used his peremptory strikes in a racially discriminatory manner was established by the supreme court in batson kentucky,d.as this court explained in mckinney artuz,cir 
the batson court establish ed a framework for the evidentiary inquiry into whether a peremptory challenge is first,the moving,the party challenging the other party attempted peremptory make a prima facie case that the nonmoving party peremptory is based on race.second,the nonmoving party must assert a reason for the peremptory challenge.the nonmoving party burden at step two is very low a lthough a reason must be given,it need not be persuasive or even plausible.finally,the court must determine whether the moving party carried the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the peremptory challenge at issue was based on race.
id.at internal citations,quotation marks and footnote omitted.in overton,we explained the showing required to establish a prima facie case as follows 
to establish a prima facie case under batson,a defendant must show that the circumstances surrounding the peremptory challenges raise an inference of discrimination.specifically,i n deciding whether the defendant has made the requisite prima facie showing,the trial court should consider all relevant circumstances.for example,a pattern of strikes against black jurors included in the particular venire might give rise to an inference of discrimination.similarly,the prosecutor questions and statements during voir dire examination and in exercising his challenges may support or refute an inference of discriminatory purpose.
overton,at citing batson,at.
c.the district court decision 
the district court held that the appellate division affirming the trial court denial of harris motion for a hearing on the prosecutor use of his peremptory challenges during voir dire,was contrary to clearly established supreme court precedent.in reaching this conclusion,the court first determined that harris made out a prima facie showing of racial discrimination,as follows 
the evidence is clear that five black venire persons were challenged peremptorily by the prosecutor and removed from the jury panel.these five blacks constituted the entire array of black prospective jurors.this evidence was sufficient to make out a prima facie showing of intentional discrimination.
harris,d at citations omitted.once it determined that harris made out a prima facie case,the district court noted that t he trial court did not complete the second or third steps required by batson,because the trial court denied harris motion to hold a hearing on the issue.therefore,the district court concluded,the state courts actions resulted in a decision that was contrary to the clearly established law of the united states as determined by the supreme court.id.
as an initial matter,we note that the district court erred by analyzing harris claim under the contrary to prong of d.under williams,a state court decision is not contrary to supreme court precedent unless the state court arrive d at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court decide d a case differently than the supreme court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.williams,at.the district court did not identify any supreme court case with materially indistinguishable facts,nor did the district court identify any question of law that the state courts decided differently than the supreme court did in batson.
the district court should have analyzed harris batson claim under the unreasonable application prong of the aedpa habeas standard of review.as the supreme court stated in bell cone,d contrary to and unreasonable application clauses have independent meaning the court may grant relief under the unreasonable application clause if the state court correctly identifies the governing legal principle from our decisions but unreasonably applies it to the facts of a particular case.at.citing williams,at.the appellate division reviewing harris case correctly identified the relevant federal law applicable to harris batson claims,because in summarily affirming the trial court it cited a case applying the holding of batson.see people harris,dep t citing,inter alia,people bridget,dep t.under williams and bell cone,therefore,the district court should have conducted its analysis under the unreasonable application prong of d,rather than the contrary to prong.however,this technical error does not undermine the ultimate correctness of the district court conclusion that the state court improperly denied harris batson claim.
stated simply,a federal habeas court making the unreasonable application inquiry should ask whether the state court application of clearly established federal law was objectively unreasonable.williams,at.it is undisputed that the state trial court failed to conduct the type of inquiry into the prosecutor reasons for striking the last four black potential jurors that is required at the second and third steps of the batson analysis.thus,the dispositive question under the unreasonable application prong of d is whether it was objectively unreasonable for the appellate division to determine that harris failed to make a prima facie showing of purpose before the state trial court.
because the appellate division did not specifically discuss the batson issue,yet relied on a case applying batson,we must construe its summary holding as an affirmation that the trial court proceedings,though conducted prior to batson,did not violate the supreme court holding in that case.thus,in reviewing the appellate division decision,we must focus on the trial court treatment of peremptory strikes.
the state trial court acknowledged the fact that the prosecutor used peremptory strikes to exclude all five black potential jurors,but was apparently convinced that the prosecutor initial acceptance of mcgruder established that the prosecutor was not engaged in a systematic attempt to exclude blacks.harris counsel pointed out that,even assuming that mcgruder was excused for a legitimate,reason,there was still evidence of possible racial discrimination in the fact that the prosecutor used four other peremptory challenges against black venire persons.however,the state trial court ultimately concluded,based solely on the fact that the prosecutor had initially selected mcgruder,that there was no reason to hold a hearing to inquire into the reasons the prosecutor used his peremptory strikes in the manner that he did.
kuhlmann argues that the state trial court decision and,by extension,the decision of the appellate division affirming it could not have been objectively unreasonable because harris presented only statistical evidence of discrimination and m any courts throughout the nation have held that a prima facie case of discrimination can rarely,if ever,be established by a showing that consists of nothing more than the number of peremptory challenges exercised against the protected class.resp br.at collecting cases.however,the cases kuhlmann cites stand not for the narrow proposition that kuhlmann argues,but rather for the broader proposition that an assessment of the sufficiency of a prima facie showing in the batson analysis should take into consideration all relevant circumstances including,but not restricted to,the pattern of strikes.see,mccain gramley,cir courts must look to the totality of the circumstances.citing batson,at.tankleff senkowski,cir courts have used a analysis in analyzing prima facie showings under batson.
in order to determine whether the appellate division applied batson in an objectively unreasonable manner,we must examine the united states supreme court law applicable to the batson claim at the time of the appellate division judgment.see williams,at.t he phrase clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states refers to the holdings of this court decisions as of the time of the relevant decision.supreme court precedent on the sufficiency of a prima facie showing under batson in consisted only of batson itself.in batson,the supreme court provided,as a primary example of what might constitute a prima facie showing,that a pattern of strikes against black jurors included in the particular venire might give rise to an inference of discrimination.batson,at.here,where every black juror was subject to a peremptory strike,a pattern plainly exists.as the district court observed,five black venire persons were challenged peremptorily by the prosecutor and removed from the jury panel,and t hese five blacks constituted the entire array of black prospective jurors.harris,d at united states alvarado,cir noting,albeit in a case on direct appeal rather than habeas review,that a challenge rate nearly twice the likely minority percentage of the venire strongly supports a prima facie case under batson.we therefore agree with the district court that,in highlighting a pattern of the use of peremptory strikes against prospective black jurors,p etitioner made out a prima facie showing of racial discrimination resulting from the prosecutor pattern of peremptory strikes.harris,d at.
kuhlmann contends,however,and the state trial court apparently agreed,that the persuasive strength of this pattern is fatally undermined by the additional fact that the prosecutor initially accepted mcgruder.although we agree that,under batson,the fact that the prosecutor initially accepted one black juror is a circumstance that might tend to rebut an inference that the prosecutor used his peremptory strikes in a discriminatory manner,see batson,at.charging trial judges to consider the circumstances concerning the prosecutor use of peremptory challenges to evaluate whether the defendant has established a prima facie case of discrimination,we do not agree that this fact alone was sufficient to refute an inference.
even if we were to conclude that the decision to strike mcgruder was legitimate,the fact remains that the prosecutor used peremptory strikes to remove all four of the other black potential jurors as well.as we explained in alvarado,a prosecutor may not avoid the batson obligation to provide explanations for what appears to be a statistically significant pattern of racial peremptory challenges simply by forgoing the opportunity to use all of his challenges against minorities,at emphasis supplied see also,united states johnson,cir we reject the government contention that the mere presence of two blacks on a jury automatically negates a batson violation.united states clemons,cir striking a single black juror could constitute a prima facie case even when blacks ultimately sit on the panel and even when valid reasons exist for striking other blacks.the fact that the prosecutor in this case was initially willing to accept one black juror is not sufficient to exempt from scrutiny the prosecutor later decisions to strike all four of the remaining black potential jurors.
for these reasons,we conclude that,even taking into account the prosecutor initial acceptance of a single black juror,it was objectively unreasonable for the appellate division to conclude,by summarily affirming the trial court,that petitioner failed to make out a prima facie case of discrimination under batson in the instant case,where all five prospective black jurors were eliminated by peremptory strike.because it is undisputed that the state trial court did not conduct the type of inquiry required in the second and third steps of the batson inquiry,we conclude that harris has established that the appellate division rejection of his batson claims on appeal was an unreasonable application of batson for the purposes of habeas relief under d.
ii.the district court decision to grant harris a new trial,and kuhlmann motion seeking reconsideration or,in the alternative,a hearing on the batson issue 
having concluded that the state court erred in its treatment of harris batson claim,the next question is to what relief is harris entitled the district court determined that harris was entitled to a new trial.kuhlmann contends that the district court erred by ordering a new trial without first conducting a reconstruction hearing to determine,if possible,whether the prosecutor had legitimate reasons for using the peremptory strikes as he did for the reasons given below,we agree with kuhlmann.
a.the district court initial decision 
after it concluded that the state court had committed error on the batson issue,the district court then turned to the question of the appropriate remedy.the court correctly recognized that it could either hold a reconstruction hearing and take evidence regarding the circumstances surrounding the prosecutor use of the peremptory challenges to the five excluded black jurors return the case to the state trial court on a conditional writ of habeas corpus so that the state court could conduct the inquiry on its own or order a new trial.harris,d at citing,inter alia,tankleff,at,and brown kelly,cir.with respect to the third of these options,the district court noted that this court has stated that there are cases where the passage of time may impair a trial court ability to make a reasoned determination of the prosecutor state of mind when the jury was selected.where such demonstrably exists,there must be a new trial.id.citing brown,at.
the district court then decided that a new trial was the appropriate remedy,reasoning as follows 
in this case,more than fifteen and a half years have passed since harris s trial in the last fifteen years,the persons involved in harris s jury selection likely have moved on to other phases and stations in life,and their minds likely have been filled with other matters,far removed from the events of january.in fact,the court takes judicial notice of the fact that judge ain has retired from the bench,and daniel cotter,then an assistant district attorney,is now himself a judge of the nassau county court.under the circumstances,fifteen years is a very long time.a hearing at this juncture would be akin to an attempt to repair a broken cobweb.
kuhlmann motion for reconsideration 
in response to this holding,kuhlmann filed a motion under federal rule of civil procedure b for reconsideration,and under federal rule of civil procedure e to amend the judgment for the purpose of granting a hearing.in support of both motions,kuhlmann argued that the district court erred by concluding,without making any inquiry or allowing the parties an opportunity to argue or present evidence,that a reconstruction hearing would be a practical impossibility.harris,d at.kuhlmann proffered the testimony of the prosecutor who had tried harris case in the state court,and who claimed to recall the details of the jury selection and notes taken by the prosecutor at the time of the trial,and retained in the district attorney office since the trial.kuhlmann acknowledged that he had not asked the district court for a reconstruction hearing in his initial briefs due to his belief that harris claim was without merit,but pointed out that,in the appeal in the state courts,the government had asked for a hearing if the appellate division held harris had met his prima facie burden.app.
the district court denied the motion for reconsideration without mentioning the proffer of evidence about the prosecutor motives.id.at.
standard of review 
this court reviews a district court denial of a federal rule of civil procedure b motion for reconsideration for an abuse of discretion.malik mcginnis,cir.the denial of a motion to amend a judgment under federal rule of civil procedure will not be overturned on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.mccarthy manson,cir.
the question of whether it would be productive to hold a hearing after the fact to determine whether the prosecutor exercised peremptory strikes in a racially discriminatory manner is committed to the discretion of the trial court.see tankleff,at.therefore this court reviews such a decision for abuse of that discretion.
we conclude that the district court abused its discretion by denying kuhlmann motion seeking a reconstruction hearing to determine,if possible,whether the prosecutor had legitimate reasons to use his peremptory strikes to strike the black potential jurors.although the decision to hold such a hearing is within the discretion of the district court,this court has said that if appropriate findings may be conveniently made,this should be done.brown,at quoting alvarado,at.moreover,the district court has the discretion to order a new trial only where it is demonstrably true that the passage of time has impair ed the trial court ability to make a reasoned determination of the prosecutor state of mind when the jury was selected.id.
there was no such demonstration of the effect of the passage of time here.instead,the district court relied only on the facts that a significant amount of time had elapsed,the trial judge had retired,and the former prosecutor had become a judge.harris,d at.the court made no inquiry into or determination of what effect those facts would have on the feasibility of a reconstruction hearing.
furthermore,even if the initial decision to order a new trial was a permissible exercise of the district court discretion,the subsequent denial of kuhlmann motion for denial made without any mention of the newly proffered an abuse of that discretion.therefore,we vacate that portion of the district court judgment that granted harris a new trial,and we remand the case for the district court to hold a reconstruction hearing,see,brown,at alvarado,at,and complete the inquiries required at the second and third steps of the batson test.
iii.the question of harris competence to stand trial 
in his,harris contends that he is entitled to habeas relief based on his claim that the state trial court violated his due process rights by failing to order a competence examination at the time of his trial.harris acknowledges that there is no indication in the record before this court that his trial counsel requested a competence examination at the time of harris trial.nonetheless,harris contends that,given the evidence before the trial court the evidence of harris low,the fact that harris had recently been shot in the head,harris request for a competence hearing approximately two months before the trial,along with harris reaction to questions at the earlier hearing,the trial court should have ordered a competence examination sua sponte.
the appellate division rejected this argument without specific comment.see people harris,at,at citing,inter alia,people armlin,and people corwise,dep t.the district court concluded that harris was not entitled to habeas relief on this claim because harris trial counsel did not request a competence examination at the time of harris trial,and there was insufficient evidence to require the trial court to order a competence hearing sua sponte.
although we disagree with several aspects of the district court analysis of harris competence claim,we agree with the district court ultimate conclusion that harris is not entitled to habeas relief on this basis.after a review of all of the evidence before the trial court,we conclude that harris has failed to establish that his federal constitutional rights were violated by the state court decision that harris was not entitled to a competence hearing before or at the time of his trial.see gaines kelly,cir to obtain habeas relief petitioner must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that his federal constitutional rights were violated.emphasis added.
a.the relevant legal standard 
the constitutional right to due process is violated when a person who is incompetent is convicted of a crime,whether the conviction follows a trial or a plea of guilty.see cooper oklahoma,d drope missouri,d pate robinson,d.as the supreme court explained in cooper,a defendant may not be put to trial unless he has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding and a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.at.citations,internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted.
moreover,the right not to stand trial while incompetent is sufficiently important to merit protection even if the defendant has failed to make a timely request for a competency determination.cooper,at.citing pate,at.as this court explained in nicks united states,cir,a hearing must be held when there is reasonable ground for a trial court to conclude that the defendant may not be competent to stand trial.id.at.of course,i t is axiomatic that in reviewing whether this obligation was properly discharged only evidence before the court at the time its decision was made is pertinent.id.
finally,t here are no fixed or immutable signs which invariably indicate the need for further inquiry to determine fitness to proceed the question is often a difficult one in which a wide range of manifestations and subtle nuances are implicated.drope,at.in the end,then,the inquiry is whether,in light of what was then known to the trial court,the failure to make further inquiry into harris competence to stand trial denied him a fair trial.nicks,at citing drope,at.
when we inquire,on habeas review,into whether harris was denied a fair trial,we must presume the state court findings of fact are correct,unless the petitioner meets the burden of rebutting th is presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.lanfranco murray,cir quoting e and citing brown artuz,cir.this presumption of correctness is particularly important when reviewing the trial court assessment of witness credibility.parsad greiner,cir shabazz artuz,cir.furthermore,a petitioner is not entitled to habeas relief unless the state court applied the clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court to the facts of the petitioner case in an objectively unreasonable manner.d lanfranco,at see also sellan kuhlman,cir under d,we must determine not whether the state court was incorrect or erroneous in rejecting petitioner claim,but whether it was objectively unreasonable in doing so.citing williams taylor,d plurality opinion.
b.the district court decision 
in analyzing harris claim,the district court first held that the state trial court erred by failing to hold a competence hearing in october when harris made a motion seeking such a hearing under.proc.law.the district court stated that 
i t is patently obvious that during the proceedings held on october,harris s responsiveness and lack of understanding indicated his inability to comprehend the proceedings.for example,he did not know the day of the week,and he said he had not spoken recently to his attorney.the cursory questioning of harris conducted by the court was insufficient to ascertain whether harris may have been mentally incapacitated at that time and thus incapable of proceeding toward trial.
harris,d at citations omitted.accordingly,the district court concluded that 
t he circumstances before the trial court in october presented a reasonable ground for believing that harris was,at that moment,incompetent to stand trial.petitioner mental deficiencies were never disputed by the people,nor did the people contest the fact that petitioner had been shot in the head and was still recovering from that wound,nor the fact that harris was taking medication at the time to assist his recovery.moreover,defense counsel statements that he could not communicate with harris gave increased urgency to the issue,as did the bizarre responses given by petitioner to the court during the hearing on the motion.
however,the district court then concluded that the dispositive inquiry was not whether the trial court failure to order a competence examination in october was error,but rather,whether the state trial court committed constitutional error by failing to make sufficient inquiry into harris mental condition at the time of harris trial in january.id.the district court noted that incapacity or incompetence to stand trial can come and go,and the proposition that a defendant may be competent at one point and incompetent at a later point is equally valid in reverse.that is,a defendant may be incompetent at one point but competent later on,which may have been the case here.id.at citing drope,at.even when a defendant is competent at the commencement of his trial,a trial court must always be alert to circumstances suggesting a change that would render the accused unable to meet the standards of competence to stand trial.based on this premise,the district court rejected harris claim,reasoning as follows 
despite having determined that harris s due process rights would and should have been better protected by a competency hearing or psychiatric examination in october,the court can not ignore that the actual trial of this matter did not take place until some two and a half months later.nor can the court ignore the absence of any subsequent arguments or applications at trial regarding harris s mental state.without any evidence to the contrary,and without any application or motion having been made on the record,the court must presume that harris was not incapacitated at the time of trial in january.it is logical to presume that harris s far as the bullet improved between october,and january,when voir dire began.to the extent that harris medication was causing some or all of his difficulties in october,it is likely that the medication had been reduced or eliminated entirely by january.thus,despite the fact that the trial court should have ordered an examination in october,the court can not say that the failure to do so deprived harris of his constitutional right to a fair trial two and a half months later.
first,we take issue with one aspect of the district court articulation of the applicable standard of review.although the district court correctly noted that on habeas review,the state court findings of fact,if any,are presumed correct,id.at citing e,the court erroneously stated that d eference to the state courts legal determinations arising from record facts is not required when considering an inquiry into a petitioner mental condition under the due process clause.in support of this latter premise the district court cited the supreme court decision in drope,at.this portion of the standard of review applied in drope,however,is not applicable in the present case.in drope the supreme court reviewed the state court decision directly,rather than collaterally through a habeas petition.in the present case,because the state court adjudicated harris competence claim on the merits,our review of legal determinations by the state courts is limited,and we may not grant the writ unless the state court adjudication of harris claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.cox miller,cir quoting d and citing williams,at.
we express no view on the validity of the notion,relied upon by the district court,that harris claim fails because he failed to request a competence hearing at the time of his trial,even though he sought and,in the district court view,was improperly denied such a hearing two months before trial.we need not do so because we conclude,for the reasons given below,that it was not objectively unreasonable,once appropriate deference is accorded to the factual determinations of the state trial court,for that court to have denied harris motion for a competence hearing in october of,and that there was insufficient evidence to require that court to have,sua sponte,conducted a competence hearing at trial.
the state trial court denial of harris motion for a competence hearing on october,
harris argues,and the district court agreed,that the state trial judge erred by denying harris motion for a competence hearing on october.in support of this position,both harris and the district court cited four evidentiary factors evidence of harris low intelligence the fact that harris had recently been shot in the head and the bullet remained lodged in his brain the bizarre responses harris gave when questioned by the trial judge and statements by harris trial counsel to the effect that he was having great difficulty communicating with harris.however,as we explain below,the evidence harris cites in support of his position neither supports his argument as effectively as he contends,nor was the only significant evidence before the state court.
harris intelligence 
first,we note that,contrary to the district court statement that harris mental deficiencies were never disputed by the people,the government did,in fact,challenge the severity and nature of harris mental deficiencies.to be sure,the government acknowledged that harris intelligence was below average.however,the prosecutor challenged feldman view that harris was in the borderline intellectual functioning category and questioned the validity of the quantitative assessments,and reading ability contained in the hartford school department records upon which feldman relied.additionally,the prosecutor suggested that harris may have been malingering when he was examined by feldman in order to bolster his argument that he had not voluntarily waived his miranda rights.
when the state trial court denied harris motion to suppress,the court largely accepted the government position.the court explicitly concluded that harris intelligence was in the range,as feldman had initially concluded.thus the court rejected feldman later testimony to the effect that harris was in the lower borderline intellectual functioning range.this is a factual determination,which we presume to be correct.see parsad,at the presumption of correctness mandated by e is particularly important when reviewing the trial court assessment of witness credibility.the state trial court also appeared to accept the possibility that harris was malingering.although the court did not express these conclusions until it denied harris motion to month and a half after the october,nonetheless provide insight into the trial court assessment of the credibility of feldman testimony about harris intellectual capabilities.
finally,the effect of harris mental deficiencies on his competence to stand trial was not in the form of a formal competence the context of the suppression hearing.in that hearing,the expert that examined harris testified that,despite harris limited intelligence,harris was competent to stand trial.the state trial court credited this portion of feldman testimony,see app.at,and harris never challenged it.therefore,again,we presume that the state trial court factual determinations with respect to this issue are correct.
evidence concerning the effect of harris head injury 
thereafter,however,harris did request a competency hearing,citing the fact that he had recently been shot in the head,and the bullet remained lodged in his brain.although it is reasonable to assume perhaps even to expect that a person who suffers a gunshot wound to the head might,at least for a time,have a diminished mental capacity relative to that person mental capacity before the gunshot wound,the mere existence of harris head injury was not enough to require a competence examination.harris head injury is only relevant if it actually produced a diminished capacity at the time of harris trial.
however,there is no evidence,other than the statements of harris trial counsel and the cryptic nature of harris response to the trial judge questions at the october,hearing both of which we discuss below,to support the notion that harris suffered lingering effects of the gunshot wound of a type that might warrant a competence examination.in order to obtain habeas relief,harris has the burden of showing that his federal constitutional rights were violated by the state judge.however,harris counsel failed to submit any medical documentation about the effects if any of the injury on harris competence.nor did he submit a list of medications harris was taking,or documentation about the side effects if any of any medication harris was taking.we know that harris was competent to stand trial before the shooting,but very little is presented to show the effect of the shooting on harris competency.
on the other hand,there was evidence proffered to the state trial court suggesting that harris had recovered from the gunshot wound without any serious adverse effect on his mental capacity.during the october,hearing,the prosecutor stated that harris had been released from the hospital and returned to the jail and jail personnel with whom the prosecutor had spoken that morning reported that t hey ha d no problem in communicating with harris and ha d made no noticeable observation of any inability to communicate at th at time.
harris response to the state trial judge questions during the october,hearing 
another significant piece of evidence cited by harris and the district court is the bizarre nature of the responses harris gave to the trial judge questions at the october,hearing.the district court concluded that it was patently obvious that during the proceedings held on october,harris responsiveness and lack of understanding indicated his inability to comprehend the proceedings.for example,he did not know the day of the week,and he said he had not spoken recently to his attorney.harris,d at.we agree that evidence that a defendant did not know the day of the week and did not recall the last time he spoke to his attorney when,in fact,it was obvious that he had spoken to his attorney several minutes prior could be strong evidence that a competence hearing is warranted.however,we do not agree with the district court conclusion that harris answers to the trial judge questions necessarily establish that he was unaware of the day of the week or when he last spoke to his attorney.
based on the trial transcript alone,we can not determine whether harris was legitimately confused in his answers,or he was simply uncooperative.during the earlier suppression hearing,the government argued and the trial court apparently agreed that harris was his apparent mental limitations in order to bolster his legal arguments.thus,another reasonable interpretation of harris responses to the trial judge questions is that harris was being deliberately uncooperative in order to support the perception that he was incompetent to stand trial.
based solely on the bare language of the trial transcript,without neither detailed findings of fact nor evidence about harris demeanor during the hearing,it is impossible for us to determine which view of this evidence is the correct one.we do know that the trial judge had observed harris conferring with counsel during the hearing,and that immediately following the strange answers the judge stated that,based upon his observations of defendant during questioning,he was constrained to deny the motion.in such circumstances,an appellate court should generally defer to the conclusions of the trial judge,who was present in the courtroom and in a position to assess the defendant demeanor.see donato bethpage cent.sch,cir w e must accord great deference to the trial court findings regarding credibility because the trial judge is in the best position to evaluate a witness demeanor and tone of voice as well as other mannerisms that bear heavily on one belief in what the witness says.this is especially appropriate in a habeas case,in which the state court factual determinations are presumed to be correct and the petitioner bears the burden of establishing that he is entitled to relief.
statements by harris trial counsel 
finally,harris argues that a competence hearing was required because harris trial counsel reported that he was unable to communicate effectively with harris.the supreme court has acknowledged that representations by defense counsel concerning the competence of his client are unquestionably a factor which should be considered when determining whether that client is competent.drope,at.in the instant case,the transcript reflects that the trial judge considered the representations of harris counsel regarding harris competence,asking the prosecutor directly how do you respond to harris counsel oral argument that irrespective of the fact that none of the personnel that you described have difficulty in communicating with the defendant harris that he harris counsel has difficulty communicating with harris 
however,it is indisputable that courts are not required to accept the representations of defense counsel without question.id.on the contrary,such representations are merely one factor to be considered by the court,including,in this case,the court own observation of the defendant conduct and evidence concerning the effects of harris injury,as well as evidence adduced at harris competence hearing.
e.the cumulative weight of this evidence 
the district court concluded,citing the evidence discussed above,that the circumstances before the trial court in october presented a reasonable ground for believing that harris was,at that moment,incompetent to stand trial.harris,d at.however,th
