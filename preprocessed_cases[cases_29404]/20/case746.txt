opinion of the court 
appellant barry gibbs appeals from the district court judgment denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.gibbs,who is currently serving a sentence of twenty to forty years imprisonment,argues that the state court decision was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.we agree and reverse.
in march of the commonwealth of pennsylvania charged gibbs with,inter alia,criminal homicide for shooting and killing a security guard named george mehl.the commonwealth charged that gibbs shot mehl after a woman named sharon burke hired him to kill her husband,wayne burke,who was also a security guard.mehl was shot as he sat beside burke while they were both at work.
prior to his trial in the court of common pleas of pike county,gibbs petitioned the state judge to appoint an expert to explore the possibility of raising a mental infirmity defense.the court appointed anthony turchetti.following turchetti evaluation,gibbs notified the commonwealth that he in fact intended to raise a mental infirmity defense at trial.
the commonwealth consequently secured an order from the court requiring gibbs to submit to an examination from a state psychiatrist,robert sadoff.sadoff gave gibbs miranda warnings prior to the examination,and gibbs thereafter made several inculpatory statements.
at the trial,gibbs offered expert testimony from turchetti to support a diminished capacity defense,and the commonwealth called sadoff as a witness to rebut turchetti testimony.the jury found gibbs guilty and sentenced him to death.the pennsylvania supreme court eventually reversed gibbs conviction on grounds unrelated to this appeal,see pennsylvania gibbs,and the commonwealth thereafter retried gibbs.
gibbs decided not to pursue a mental infirmity defense at his second trial.the defense decided instead to contest is,to raise doubt that it was gibbs who shot george mehl.nonetheless,the commonwealth moved in limine for permission to call sadoff as a witness to testify about the inculpatory statements gibbs made to him.the court granted the commonwealth motion under the theory that a defendant testimony from an earlier trial may be introduced in the prosecution case against a defendant regardless of whether that defendant takes the stand or not in the second proceeding,because a defendant waives his right against by taking the stand in a previous proceeding.app.internal citations and quotations omitted.sadoff testified at the second trial as a part of the commonwealth he related the inculpatory statements gibbs made to him.
the jury again found gibbs guilty,and the pennsylvania superior court affirmed his conviction and sentence.the pennsylvania supreme court denied allocatur,and gibbs brought this petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to in the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania.the district court denied the petition as to all the claims.we granted a certificate of appealability on the issue whether gibbs fifth amendment privilege against was violated during his retrial when the commonwealth was permitted to introduce sadoff psychiatric testimony,which had originally been offered by the commonwealth to rebut the diminished capacity defense asserted by gibbs at his first trial,relating incriminating statements made by gibbs despite the fact that gibbs did not raise that defense at his second trial.
we exercise jurisdiction under and.where as here a district court relied exclusively on the state court record and did not hold an evidentiary hearing on habeas review,this court review is plenary.see moore morton,cir.like the district court,we review the state court determinations with the deference the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa requires.the statute provides 
d an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.in addition,a determination of a factual issue made by a state court shall be presumed to be correct unless the petitioner rebuts the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.e.
c learly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states means the holdings,as opposed to the dicta,of the supreme court decisions as of the time of the relevant decision.williams taylor,d see also lockyer andrade,d c learly established federal law under d is the governing legal principle or principles set forth by the supreme court at the time the state court renders its decision.a decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if the state court contradicts the governing law set forth in the supreme court cases or confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of the supreme court and nevertheless arrives at a different result.williams,at.a decision involve s an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if the state court identifies the correct governing legal rule from the supreme court cases but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular case or unreasonably extends a legal principle from supreme court precedent to a new context where it should not apply or unreasonably refuses to extend that principle to a new context where it should apply.id.at.see also mitchell esparza,d per curiam werts vaughn,cir.
we begin by identifying the relevant supreme court precedents.the case law begins with estelle smith,d.there,the state judge ordered a capital defendant to undergo a psychiatric examination by a doctor.the defendant did not offer a defense of mental infirmity at the guilt phase of the trial,but at the capital penalty phase the state sought to offer the doctor testimony about the defendant admissions as proof of future dangerousness.
the supreme court granted habeas relief.the court determined that the fifth and sixth amendments through the fourteenth applied at the penalty phase that the defendant interview had been compelled and without notice to the defense attorney and that no miranda warnings had been given.see miranda arizona,d the court expressly language of significance before interrogation the state must provide the defendant with an awareness of the fifth amendment privilege and the consequences of forgoing it.at.
the court in smith emphasized that there were two distinct circumstances that were elements of its conclusion the state court compelled the defendant to submit to the examination and the defendant himself never placed his mental state in issue at either the guilt or penalty phase of the trial.at.
the supreme court soon addressed a case where these two circumstances did not exist in buchanan kentucky,d.there,the murder defendant counsel and the prosecutor jointly petitioned the state court to order a psychiatric examination of the defendant to see if he should be treated during incarceration.at trial,the defendant raised a defense of extreme emotional disturbance,and the court allowed the prosecutor to use the earlier psychiatric report to rebut the defense.
the buchanan court distinguished smith,drawing on language in its earlier decision suggesting that if a defendant requests a psychiatric evaluation or presents psychiatric evidence,then,at the very least,the prosecution may rebut this presentation with evidence from the reports of the examination that the defendant requested.at.since,in buchanan,defense counsel sought the examination and then placed his mental state in issue,there was no constitutional violation when the state offered the examination for a limited rebuttal purpose.id.at.emphasis added.
since buchanan,the ruling in smith was reaffirmed and applied to invalidate convictions in two further supreme court cases.satterwhite texas,d presented facts almost identical to smith,in that the state offered penalty phase evidence from a compelled psychiatric examination of the defendant,even though the defendant did not put his psychological state in issue.the court held that because the examinations occurred after indictment,and without proper notice to defense counsel,there was a sixth amendment violation.at.powell texas,d presented a somewhat different factual pattern.there,the state examined the defendant and offered the psychiatric report at the penalty phase.the state argued that this did not run afoul of smith because at the guilt phase the defendant himself had raised a psychiatric defense.the court refined what was implicit in smith by holding that a defendant initiation of the psychiatric issue at trial could waive a fifth amendment not a sixth amendment the state subsequent use of a mandatory psychiatric report.as part of its analysis,the court observed that there could be no sixth amendment waiver because no supreme court case had suggested that by opening the door to the admission of state psychiatric evidence in the guilt phase,the door would also open automatically to the admission of that evidence for a different purpose in the penalty phase.at.
most recently,the supreme court revisited this issue in the context of a habeas challenge mounted after the aedpa habeas amendments,and under the narrower standard of review which now applies in penry johnson,penry was charged with a capital murder,d.earlier,in,he had been subjected to a psychiatric examination requested by defense counsel for an unrelated crime.penry placed mental state in issue both in his capital trial and in the previous trial for the earlier crime.in the capital trial,the state was permitted to use the voluntary psychiatric report from the prior trial to impeach penry own psychological witness.the supreme court held the state court rulings not contrary to,or unreasonable in applying,prior supreme court precedent because it distinguished smith.in particular,the court underscored the following differences in smith,the defendant did not place his mental state in issue in penry he did.in smith,the psychiatric examination was compelled by the court and conducted by a state doctor in penry,the defense attorney requested the examination.in smith,the state put on the psychological evidence in its case in chief in penry it was limited to.finally,in smith,the defendant could have been warned about the possible use of his admissions in a subsequent penalty phase in penry,the psychiatric examination preceded the capital crime itself,so the state could not have warned possibility of its future use in the capital case.at.
if we lay these decisions out,the following landscape emerges.a compelled psychiatric interview implicates fifth and sixth amendment rights smith.before submitting to that examination,the defendant must receive miranda warnings and once the sixth amendment attaches counsel must be notified smith.the warnings must advise the defendant of the consequences of foregoing his right to remain silent smith.the fifth and sixth amendments do not necessarily attach,however,when the defendant himself initiates the psychiatric examination buchanan,penry.similarly,the not right can be waived when the defendant initiates a trial defense of mental incapacity or disturbance,even though the defendant had not been given miranda warnings buchanan,powell.but that waiver is not limitless it only allows the prosecution to use the interview to provide rebuttal to the psychiatric defense buchanan,powell.finally,the state has no obligation to warn about possible uses of the interview that can not be foreseen because of future events,such as uncommitted crimes penry 
how does the state court decision in this case stack up against these precedents here,the defense initially indicated it would raise a psychiatric defense and accordingly the court ordered as a condition that the defendant submit to an interview by a state doctor,robert sadoff.sadoff gave gibbs miranda warnings.during the first trial,gibbs in fact offered insanity and diminished capacity defenses,and sadoff testified in rebuttal.undoubtedly,sadoff testimony was permissible in that trial under smith and buchanan.but that trial was reversed and vacated,by the pennsylvania supreme court,on other grounds.
at the second trial,gibbs presented no mental capacity defense.sadoff was permitted to testify in the prosecution case in chief,however,simply to repeat incriminating statements that gibbs had made in the interview.
as in smith,gibbs interview with sadoff was mandated by the state court,and sadoff was the doctor.as in smith,the statement was not offered at the second trial after the defense put psychiatry in issue,and it was not limited to rebuttal.in fact,the purpose for which it was offered at gibbs trial was not even to prove a psychological point,since the second trial presented no psychological issue before sadoff testified.the statement was offered simply for the truth of the admissions of fact.in this sense,the psychiatric interview was used for a purpose even less justifiable than that in smith,where at least the state purpose in offering a psychiatric analysis at the penalty phase was to establish a psychological disposition to be dangerous in the future.
if these facts were all that were before us,we could say that the state ruling admitting the gibbs interview in the second trial was contrary to smith itself.but there is a crucial additional fact that makes a difference.according to the finding of the state court,sadoff mirandized gibbs.app.the state argues that this takes the case out of the template of smith altogether 
we agree that the warning takes the fact pattern outside the strict bounds of smith,so that this case is not contrary to smith,or any other decision.that leaves the question whether the admission of gibbs interview is either an unreasonable application of smith to the facts or an unreasonable failure to extend smith to the facts.
we initially recall that smith explicitly held that the warnings given to a potential psychiatric interviewee must advise him of the consequences of waiving his fifth amendment rights.under any reasonable view,this requires an accurate statement of those consequences.thus,if sadoff told gibbs that his statements could be used against him only if he raised a mental state defense at trial,any waiver by gibbs would be specific to that condition,and the only reasonable application of smith would mandate that the statements be excluded if no such defense was raised.on the other hand,if sadoff told gibbs that his statement could be used against him in court for any purpose whatsoever,whether or not he offered any kind of psychological defense,then it would arguably be a general waiver,and it would be reasonable to regard smith as satisfied.but simmons united states,d defendant who testifies at suppression hearing asserting fourth amendment claim does not waive his fifth amendment privilege and his statements can not be used against him at trial on the issue of guilt.
the record is silent as to what sadoff said precisely,and the state court made no factual findings in this regard,either explicit or implicit.the inference from the term of art mirandized is that he offered the standard language articulated in the miranda decision.see dickerson united states,d.since that warning states without limitation that anything you say may be used against you in a court of law,one might conclude that gibbs gave a general waiver.but sadoff warning did not occur in a vacuum.everyone understood that the psychiatric interview was a precondition to gibbs presentation of a psychiatric defense.more important,pennsylvania law expressly limited the scope of any psychiatric examination waiver so that the evidence could not be used for any purpose other than a proceeding about the defendant mental condition.stat.e.
accordingly,gibbs and his attorney were legally entitled to understand any miranda waiver in the context of existing state law and the procedural setting of the case.that is,that
