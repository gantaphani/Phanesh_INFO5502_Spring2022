defendants case 
defendants case consisted of calling four witnesses.theresa newsome testified that on the evening of august,the four were at her home,when rouster asked if they wanted to accompany him to the rease house.newsome claimed that rouster said he wanted to be with some friends.the four then left newsome house and boarded a bus at avenue and johnson street.at broadway and avenue,rouster and williams got off the bus,bought one bottle of malt liquor each,and the bus several minutes later with the beer bottles wrapped in paper bags.newsome testified that rouster continued to drink his beer the entire bus ride.when the four got off the bus,they walked down jennings street,entered the rease house,and sat down in the living room with henrietta rease,john rease,and bryant.newsome testified that rouster and henrietta rease then went into a back room to talk,where they were talking loud.after several minutes,newsome,toney,and maybe williams newsome testified that she could not remember left the house and walked a few feet down jennings street.
newsome then heard two gunshots that sounded as if they were fired from outside the front of the rease house.although she was not wearing her glasses,at the time she heard the first gunshot,she also saw rouster standing with his arms up in the air in the front hall of the rease house.one of the neighborhood children told newsome that rouster had a gun,and toney told that child to call the police.newsome and toney then went back into the rease house and saw rouster,williams,and the reases talking in the living room.newsome asked henrietta rease how she was doing,and she replied that she was doing fine.after telling their boyfriends that they were ready to go,newsome and toney left the rease house,where rouster and williams remained.
newsome and toney walked to the bus stop on avenue,at which point newsome realized she had no money for bus fare.newsome then started to return to the rease house to ask rouster for some money.as she approached the rease house,she saw rouster in the front yard of the house.she asked him for bus fare,and he told her to go home.newsome then testified that rouster told her that he killed the motherfuckers and asked her,do you love me newsome did not see williams and did not hear any gunshots.further,newsome stated that she did not see rouster with a gun that entire night.newsome then testified that a police car pulled up to the rease house,and that she and rouster approached the car and that rouster told the police officers that the disturbance was down the street.newsome also testified that rouster gave her some money from a purse that he had taken from the rease house.after receiving the money,newsome stated that she and rouster boarded a bus.finally,newsome testified that she and rouster were apprehended by the police when they got off the bus at avenue and broadway.
williams called two witnesses.first,he called an employee of the public defender office to authenticate some photographs taken of the rease house.then,he called his and newsome mother,shirley williams,who testified that williams had possessed the black pouch and the items therein before august.rouster called one witness,officer means,who testified that while at the gary police department,he searched rouster and found some money on him.he testified that the bills and coins that he found on rouster totaled approximately twenty dollars.
for the most part,rouster trial strategy consisted of the state witnesses,seeking to establish the following facts that rouster was outside of the rease house when at least one gunshot was fired that rouster was intoxicated on the night of august,that the reases kept guns in their house that no one except gray saw rouster with a gun that night and in any event,no one saw who shot the reases.similarly,williams strategy was to establish the following facts through the state witnesses that he was outside of the rease house when some of the shots were fired that no one saw him with a gun that night and that no one saw who shot the reases.further,both rouster and williams attempted to impeach the state witnesses in order to attack their credibility.
closing arguments 
during closing arguments,rouster and williams began to accuse each other for the first time.before closing arguments,the trial judge informed the parties that each defendant had minutes to address the jury.newsome was to argue first,then williams,and then rouster.however,because rouster was to go last,the trial judge informed the parties that if he perceived that rouster had turned on his,he would allow each an additional fifteen minutes to rebut rouster contentions.he would signal his intention to allow this additional time by placing his eyeglasses on the bench during rouster argument.if that happened,then rouster would also be given the opportunity to extend his argument by fifteen minutes,so that each would be allotted an equal amount of time one hour for final argument.
following the state and newsome summations,williams counsel told the jury that rouster wanted to settle the score with the reases and that rouster had gone berserk.he also argued that the state had not proved that williams was guilty of felony murder beyond a reasonable doubt.rouster counsel countered in his closing argument that the real maniac was darnell williams.he argued that because williams was twenty and rouster only eighteen on august,williams was the ringleader and driving force behind the murders.he also argued that the police only found drops of blood on the back of rouster vest and shirt,and that this was evidence that he was facing away from the reases when someone else shot them.in response,the trial judge placed his glasses on the bench,and each defendant received an additional fifteen minutes of argument.in his additional time,williams counsel argued that the police also found blood on rouster shorts,socks and shoes,so that it is unclear whether he was facing away from the reases when they were shot.newsome counsel also argued in his additional time that newsome received the money that the police found on her from greg rouster,after he had told her the reases were dead.
sentencing 
the jury found rouster and williams guilty of two counts of felony murder and acquitted newsome on both counts.at the joint penalty phase phase ii,which began the next day in front of the same jury,the state sought the death penalty pursuant to.that statute provided that the state could seek the death penalty against a defendant convicted of murder if the state proved beyond a reasonable doubt one of the following aggravating factors that the defendant committed murder by intentionally killing the victim while committing or attempting to commit robbery or that the defendant has been convicted of another murder.id.at b and.in this case,the state alleged that at least one of the following aggravating factors was present that rouster and williams intentionally killed john rease while committing or attempting to commit a robbery,that rouster and williams intentionally killed henrietta rease while committing or attempting to commit a robbery,or that rouster and williams had been convicted of the murder of john rease and henrietta rease.
the indiana death penalty statute also provided that the defendant could present evidence pertaining to one of the following mitigating circumstances the defendant had no significant history of prior criminal conduct the defendant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance the victim was a participant in,or consented to,the defendant conduct the defendant was an accomplice in a murder committed by another person,and the defendant participation was relatively minor the defendant acted under the substantial domination of another person the defendant capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was substantially impaired as a result of mental disease or defect or of intoxication any other circumstances appropriate for consideration see id.at c.the statute provided that the jury could recommend the death penalty,see e,only after it had found that the state had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that at least one of the aggravating circumstances existed and any mitigating circumstances that existed were outweighed by the aggravating circumstance s id.at k.the judge would then make the final determination about the appropriate sentence after considering the jury recommendation and the standards elucidated in k.id.at e.
in phase ii,rouster once again waived opening statement.the state then called taylor,who testified that after the four entered the rease house,rouster,williams,and henrietta rease went into a back room to talk.taylor heard williams tell henrietta rease,you better get greg rouster his fucking money.everyone returned to the living room,and henrietta rease asked taylor to take rouster and williams outside.taylor then saw rouster pull out a gun that was hidden in his vest,and taylor ran out of the house.while next door to the rease house,taylor testified that he saw rouster,who was on the sidewalk outside of the rease house,fire his gun twice at the living room window.after taylor ran to the back of the rease house and hid behind a shed,he heard williams say,greg rouster,somebody in back,and then rouster say,come on out,i going to shoot.after taylor came out from his hiding spot,williams took the gun from rouster,pointed it at taylor,and asked him where the reases kept their money.taylor answered,at which point rouster told williams to leave taylor alone.taylor then said that williams dropped the gun in the yard and started looking for it,using a lighter for illumination.taylor then ran to his friend house to call the police.
taylor also identified the caliber gun found at the rease house as the gun that rouster and williams had brandished and the caliber gun found behind the house as the reases gun.in addition,taylor testified that both williams and rouster appeared drunk that night.finally,he testified that about two or three weeks prior to august,rouster told taylor over the telephone that he was going to rob the reases.in addition,the state also presented evidence that in,rouster had been adjudicated as a delinquent for two counts of burglary and that williams,but not rouster,had previously participated in a robbery similar to the one committed against the reases.
rouster evidence during phase ii consisted of the testimony of his welfare caseworkers and of his welfare file,which revealed that rouster had been abandoned at birth by his prostitute mother.the evidence also showed that rouster had lived in a number of foster homes and institutional placements prior to his placement with the reases.further,rouster was tested several times as having mild mental retardation.in an iq test administered in,rouster was found to have an iq of,although rouster april welfare report indicated that he was able to receive passing grades in high school.
during phase ii,williams presented testimony that he was employed,had graduated high school,and had lived with his mother for most of his life.further,friends and family members testified about williams character,claiming that he was a kind and responsible young man.
williams counsel gave his closing argument after the state summation.he argued that rouster was the triggerman and that rouster deprived background was reason to find that rouster was more blameworthy than williams.during rouster closing argument,his attorneys addressed rouster unfortunate upbringing and argued that rouster had not intentionally killed the reases and was not the triggerman.on february,the jury recommended the death sentence for both rouster and williams.
on march,a joint sentencing hearing was held,at which rouster did not present any witnesses or testify.williams,however,presented testimony from his family members and from his employer.the judge entered a death sentence against rouster and issued written findings therewith the judge findings indicated that the state had proved three aggravating factors under that rouster intentionally killed john rease while committing the crime of robbery that rouster intentionally killed henrietta rease while committing the crime of robbery and that rouster had previously been convicted of another murder.he also addressed each potential mitigating factor and held that none applied.specifically,the judge found 
as a juvenile the defendant was adjudicated for two burglaries in and for violation of probation in.as an adult he was charged in lake county division i for conversion.
the killings were done in a deliberate fashion.though there is some indication that rouster thought he was suffering an injustice,this had no basis in fact.it was pretext to give the appearance of justification for killing.
from the evidence previously referred to,we conclude the victims acceded to the robbery to avoid the killings,but were completely at the defendant mercy.
rouster planned the robbery with williams.both were well known to the reases.it is reasonable to conclude that once the robbery plan was carried out the reases could not be permitted to identify either rouster or williams.rouster additionally was the one announcing that he had killed them both.
both rouster and williams acted as a team.it was rouster who said let get them now.he was equal partner and not under anyone domination.
rouster is mentally alert and was capable of making a and b in high school there is no indication of mental disease or defect.there was evidence that rouster had been drinking that evening.he was,however,able to deceive the arresting officer as to his prior locations that evening and had the presence of mind to duck down in the bus when the police car went by.
the defendant,rouster is a nineteen male,of stature,physically strong and mentally alert.his lack of family support and traditional human relationships,though a factor in his antisocial behavior,can not excuse that conduct as resulting from a social disorder or mental disease.the court also notes that rouster was eighteen years of age at the time of the murders.a young age is always a mitigating factor,though not enumerated by statute.a person of tender age makes impulsive choices,often unwise,that someone of greater experience and years would not make.had this been the first or second bad decision,his age would have been a substantial mitigating factor.but rouster has consistently made bad decisions.he has been subjected to corrective treatment.he has been given more time to reflect.he has had his environment changed.he has had the benefit of supervision at all levels of his development.it has had no deterrent effect.
the judge then sentenced rouster and williams to death.
procedural history 
after the indiana supreme court rejected all of rouster claims on direct appeal,see rouster state,he filed a petition for relief in lake county superior court on april.in that petition,rouster alleged the following that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because of his trial counsel failure to move for severance and present expert testimony on that there were fundamental errors in the jury instructions that false evidence was submitted to the jury that the indiana sentencing scheme was unconstitutional and that execution by electrocution was a cruel and unusual mode of punishment.
magistrate edward page held a hearing the week of june,to evaluate rouster claims,at which time the court received an affidavit from jeffrey gwynne,a reconstruction expert.gwynne asserted that it was highly likely that rouster was acting in at the time that henrietta rease was shot,based on the angle of the bullet path and the location of the in her dress.additionally,he asserted that the fatal wound to john rease also supported the theory that rouster was acting in.gloria williams,the reases neighbor,testified in support of rouster and stated that the reases had used inappropriate force in dealing with their foster children.jimmy gray also testified that he saw the reases carry guns in their home and saw a rifle in their bedroom.
judge richard conroy dismissed rouster petition in its entirety.rouster appealed the denial of his petition for relief directly to the indiana supreme court,alleging the following that his trial counsel was ineffective during the guilt phase for failing to file a motion to sever,for failing to engage in certain discovery,and for failing to present expert testimony on that trial counsel was ineffective during phase ii for failing to present additional mitigation evidence and for failing to make a new request for separate sentencing proceedings that errors in the phase ii jury instructions constituted fundamental error and ineffective assistance of counsel that he was denied the right to effective assistance of counsel because of systematic defects within the lake county public defender system that the prosecutor knowingly presented false evidence against him at trial and that his hearing denied him due process.the indiana supreme court unanimously affirmed the decision of the trial court denying relief.see rouster state.
rouster then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the northern district of indiana on february,alleging that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to move for severance prior to trial and prior to phase ii,that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present expert testimony on,that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate all of the potential mitigating evidence during phase ii,and that several of the jury instructions contained fundamental errors.rouster habeas petition was denied,and this appeal followed.on appeal,rouster now raises three issues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to move for severance prior to trial,that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to move for severance prior to phase ii,and that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present expert testimony on.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
rouster filed his habeas petition on february,which was after the effective date of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat.codified at.therefore,the provisions of aedpa govern our review.see,lindh murphy,d.aedpa provides that if a constitutional claim was adjudicated on the merits by the state courts,a federal court may only grant habeas relief based on that claim if the state court decision was contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law as determined by the supreme court of the united states d.
the indiana supreme court decision in this case was not contrary to federal law as determined by the supreme court of the united states.in williams taylor,d,the supreme court stated that a state court decision is contrary to established supreme court precedent when the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in supreme court cases or the state court confronts a set of facts that is materially indistinguishable from those of a decision of the supreme court and nevertheless arrives at a decision different from that reached by the supreme court precedent.
in the present case,the indiana supreme court correctly applied strickland washington,d as the controlling precedent for rouster three ineffective assistance of counsel claims see rouster,at,and strickland undoubtedly qualifies as clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,within the meaning of aedpa.williams,at.further,rouster concedes that the supreme court has never addressed facts that are materially indistinguishable from those in this case.therefore,because the indiana supreme court decision was not contrary to established federal law,rouster is not entitled to habeas relief on this ground.
nevertheless,we must determine whether the indiana supreme court conclusions with respect to rouster three ineffective assistance of counsel claims resulted from an unreasonable application of strickland.see williams,at.in doing so,we must keep in mind that we may not issue a writ of habeas corpus simply because we conclude that the relevant decision applied strickland erroneously or incorrectly.rather,that application must also be unreasonable.id.
strickland 
a defendant who claims that his counsel assistance was so defective as to warrant a reversal must establish two components that his counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that he was prejudiced by the deficient performance.see strickland,at.a failure to establish either prong results in a denial of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim.see hough anderson,cir.prejudice occurs when there is a reasonable probability that but for counsel deficient performance,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland,at.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.id.because rouster can not establish that he was prejudiced by his counsel allegedly deficient performance,we need not address whether his counsel performance was objectively unreasonable.
severance prior to trial 
rouster contends that his conviction should be overturned because his trial counsel failed to move to sever his trial from that of his.indiana law allows for severance when the parties defenses are mutually antagonistic and acceptance of one party defense precludes the acquittal of the other.lampkins state.rouster relies on events that occurred during closing arguments to illustrate the alleged irreconcilable defenses between his case and williams for example,williams counsel depicted rouster as an individual who wanted to settle the score and who went berserk.in response,rouster counsel argued that williams was the real maniac and that blood stains on rouster vest and shirt indicated that rouster could not have fired the shots at the reases.rouster argues that this sort of fingerpointing establishes mutually antagonistic defenses.therefore,rouster asserts he was prejudiced by being jointly tried with williams.
in order to show that he was prejudiced by his joint trial with williams,rouster must show that had his counsel moved for severance and had the motion been granted so that he was tried separately,there was a reasonable probability that he would have been acquitted.see strickland,at.even if indiana law mandated severance in this case rouster would not be able to establish prejudice because there was not a reasonable probability that he would have been acquitted if tried separately.see strickland,at.in applying strickland to rouster claim,the indiana supreme court stated 
moreover,there is no reasonable probability that the results of the guilt phase of trial would have been different if a separation had occurred.first,each arguments regarding who pulled the trigger were actually of little relevance since both were convicted of felony murder under.all participants in a robbery or attempted robbery that results in killing by one robber are deemed equally guilty of murder,regardless of which participant actually killed the victim.additionally,the same evidence would have been admitted against rouster even if he had been granted a separate trial.such evidence includes testimony that rouster said,i killed the motherfuckers to his teresa newsome shortly after shots were heard inside the rease home derrick bryant testimony that he heard rouster tell williams,bring them both back here before he heard henrietta rease say,greg,why are you doing this followed by two shots plus the physical evidence of the blood consistent with that of john rease found on rouster shoes,socks,and vest.considering the amount of corroborating evidence indicating rouster role in the crime,rouster was not prejudiced by his counsel failure to move for separate trials.
id.at citations omitted emphases added.
we have no problem holding that the indiana supreme court application of strickland was reasonable.in hernandez,at,we held that strickland prejudice exists with respect to trial counsel failure to move for severance only when there is a reasonable probability that the severance would have made a difference to the outcome of the trial.in that case,hernandez was convicted for murder based on evidence that was adduced almost entirely from his testimony at trial,which contradicted hernandez own testimony at trial.see id.we held that hernandez was prejudiced by his trial counsel failure to move for severance because there was a reasonable probability that had hernandez been tried separately,his would not have testified at hernandez trial.see id.at.
in contrast to hernandez,in the present case,the only contradictory positions proffered by the occurred during closing arguments.as rouster counsel argued to the jury,however,closing arguments are not evidence.see,united states henry,cir.therefore,had severance been granted,the evidence that would have been presented at rouster trial would have been the same as the evidence that was,in fact,presented at his joint trial.hernandez,at.this evidence would include the testimony of several witnesses who heard rouster admit that he killed the motherfuckers,the testimony of several witnesses that saw rouster in or around the rease house on the night of august,and then heard gunshots coming from the house,and the physical evidence indicating that rouster had blood consistent with john rease blood on his clothing.further,we agree with the indiana supreme court that the contradictory defenses concerning who was the triggerman were irrelevant,as both rouster and williams could have been convicted of felony murder even if the other had fired all of the gunshots.see rogers,at.therefore,because we do not believe that there would have been a reasonable probability of a different outcome had rouster been tried separately,we find that no prejudice resulted from rouster counsel failure to file a motion for severance prior to trial.see strickland,at.
severance prior to sentencing 
next,rouster contends that his sentence should be reversed because his trial counsel failed to move for severance prior to phase ii.rouster argument to the indiana supreme court with respect to this issue was the same as his argument with respect to counsel failure to move for severance prior to he and williams had mutually antagonistic defenses.thus,the indiana supreme court was faced with the novel question of w hether a defendant may claim separately that his counsel was deficient for failing to file a motion for separate trials in regard to the guilt and penalty phases of his trial.rouster,at.the indiana supreme court determined that a defendant could do so only if counsel became aware of a previously unknown ground that required severance after the trial had started,and still failed to move for severance.see id.there was no such ground in this case,and therefore,the indiana supreme court held that because the evidence against him was overwhelming,rouster was not prejudiced by counsel omission in failing to file a motion to separate trials before sentencing.id.at.
now on appeal,rouster has his argument to claim that counsel failure to move for severance prior to phase ii constituted ineffective assistance of counsel because it denied him an individualized sentencing hearing as required by the fourteenth amendment.see,woodson north carolina,d.further,even though rouster did not mention woodson nor its progeny in his brief to the indiana supreme court,rouster claims that the indiana supreme court decision was contrary to supreme court precedent because it did not consider the standard elucidated in those cases.however,woodson,at,held that the eighth amendment requires consideration of the character and record of the individual offender as a constitutionally indispensable part of the process of inflicting the penalty of death.that case had nothing to do with the issue at severance during the penalty phase was required.therefore,the standard for determining whether rouster counsel was ineffective for failing to move for severance prior to phase ii is whether there is a reasonable probability that had severance been granted the sentencer would have concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant death.strickland,at.
rouster speculates that had there been separate sentencing trials,the witnesses that testified favorably about williams williams family and friends would have testified favorably about him.rouster also argues that the state offered evidence at the joint sentencing proceeding that williams had previously participated in a robbery,and that the jury may have misascribed that conduct to rouster.next,rouster suggests that because williams had some mitigating evidence that rouster did not have evidence of a job and kindness to his relatives,rouster looked more deserving of the death penalty in comparison.finally,rouster claims he was prejudiced by williams counsel statements about him during closing arguments.
despite rouster contentions,there is no evidence that in a separate proceeding,the jury and the judge would have balanced the aggravating and mitigating factors differently.see id.the court instructed the jury that it could recommend the death penalty for rouster only if it found that the state proved that at least one of the aggravating factors applied to rouster and that the mitigating circumstances applicable to rouster were outweighed by the aggravating factor s.therefore,the jury knew that in determining whether to recommend a death sentence for rouster,it should only consider the aggravating and mit
