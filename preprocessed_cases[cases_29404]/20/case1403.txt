a jury found timothy rosencrantz guilty of sexually assaulting elaine lasky.he seeks habeas relief on the ground that the prosecution,by countenancing false testimony from lasky,violated his due process rights.as explained here,we affirm the district court denial of rosencrantz petition because,even assuming the materiality of the testimony at issue,the prosecutorial misconduct qualifies as harmless under brecht abrahamson,d.
state court proceedings 
the controversy in this case centers on rosencrantz trial.the prosecution began by calling sergeant william gooch,who testified that lasky reported a sexual assault to the police at on august.gooch stated that he met with lasky by,and she told him that around a,shirtless,white male with a car tattoo on his chest and driving a black truck assaulted her.
lasky testified next,giving her story that she spent the evening of august at a motel in burton,michigan with her friend jack pascoe.in contrast to gooch testimony,she told the jury that around or,she left her room and walked to the motel parking lot,where a black by a man she identified at trial as alongside her.lasky entered the truck intending to steal rosencrantz money,but instead rosencrantz,armed with a knife,sexually assaulted her,inflicting cuts to her arms,legs,and chest in the struggle.lasky then begged him to take her back to the he did,but not before lasky noticed the image of a car tattooed on his chest.
according to lasky,rosencrantz dropped her off at the motel to sixty minutes after she left.back in her room,she initially hesitated to involve police because she was on probation and,she said,the motel had no phone.but lasky went on to say that she changed her mind after an hour to an hour and fifteen minutes,during which time she consumed two bottles of wine and took one or two xanax pills,an medication.another twenty minutes passed before she found a phone down the street and allowed pascoe to call the police on her behalf.
lasky also testified that when detectives showed her a photo of six faces,she immediately picked rosencrantz face as her rapist.her direct examination concluded when the prosecutor asked rosencrantz to bare his chest.seeing a tattoo of a car,lasky confirmed that it matched that of her assailant.
on,defense counsel opened by questioning lasky about her pretrial preparation 
q.did you have an opportunity to discuss your testimony with anybody prior to coming in here today 
q.you never talked to anybody 
q.you did go were over to the prosecutor office a few days ago,being brought in for any interviews you were around anything like that 
q.you did talk to anybody about it prior to coming in here today you were in any rooms up on the second floor talking to anybody about it 
no,sir,i was not.
the prosecutor remained silent during this colloquy and never reopened the topic during the trial.
defense counsel continued lasky,questioning her about how her account of when the assault occurred changed between her reporting to the police approximately and testifying at the preliminary hearing approximately,and the day of trial approximately.likewise,the defense undermined lasky credibility by eliciting admissions that she had a conviction she lied under oath during the preliminary investigation in claiming rosencrantz forced her into the truck at and her story varied on whether her assailant had a beard or whether he wore a shirt.defense counsel also impeached lasky by contrasting part of lasky testimony,where she admitted drinking during the afternoon of the assault,with her trial testimony,where she insisted she was sober at the time she met rosencrantz.and lasky also conceded during that she drank heavily after the assault,and suffered from a history of alcohol problems.
aside from gooch and lasky,the state other witnesses included jack pascoe,whose testimony supported much of lasky account,and ellen rogers,a pool attendant in flint township,michigan,who testified that about a month before the alleged assault,she saw rosencrantz with a car tattoo on his chest driving a dark.
rosencrantz defense aimed at establishing an alibi.his girlfriend claimed to be with him in fairview,miles away from the both august and.fairview restaurant owners,linda and gary vanderlinden,also said they saw rosencrantz in morning on the.and his fairview landlord testified to meeting with rosencrantz about on the.
the jury found rosencrantz guilty of sexual assault and felonious assault,and the court sentenced him to to years imprisonment.he succeeded in his state court appeal to the extent that the michigan court of appeals vacated the felonious assault conviction.on the remaining conviction,rosencrantz persisted in the michigan supreme court,eventually exhausting his state remedies.
district court proceedings 
rosencrantz argued to the district court,and maintains on appeal,that the prosecutor failed to disclose exculpatory evidence or knowingly presented false testimony on four material points that the assault occurred shortly after,on august,rather than shortly after on august,that lasky felt certain in identifying rosencrantz as the attacker,that she was sober at the time of the assault,and that lasky met with the prosecution before trial.
rosencrantz asserts that he discovered that lasky testified falsely through an affidavit submitted by jan burgess,who stated that while working in the genesee county sheriff department from august through july,interviewing detainees,she had contact with lasky in january and may rosencrantz trial took place in june.with regard to her may encounters with lasky,burgess affidavit states in pertinent part 
may lasky and her.she said she was back in jail as a witness.she said she told the police she had been raped.she said she gave a description of the man but that she had no idea what he really looked like or the details of what happened because she had been cracked up.
may while working with lasky in the floor activity room at approximately noon,a group of or men arrived on the floor.the activity deputy brought the men into the room and told me they were there to meet with lasky and that i would have to leave.after leaving,i asked the deputy what was going on and who these men were.he pointed out prosecutor garner train and someone else from the prosecutor office.he said the others were detectives.this group surrounded lasky and was often quite loud,although with the room closed,the deputy and i could understand what was being said.i left and returned twice more than afternoon to continue working with lasky.each time i returned,this group was still with lasky for a total time of at least hours.
the next day,i called lasky out to continue working with her.she was very agitated and afraid.she said she had to do what the men wanted or she felt her husband would kill her.note at some time during elaine lasky incarceration,i tested and interviewed john lasky elaine husband,who was serving a sentence.he told me he would not be in jail that long because his old lady was working with the cops and would get him out.she said she worked with the police because her husband made her and she was so afraid of him she did whatever he told her to do.
burgess affidavit,at.
the district court conducted an evidentiary hearing to develop the factual record on rosencrantz claim that the prosecutor knowingly presented false testimony or allowed such testimony to stand uncorrected.burgess and lasky both testified at the hearing.
lasky testified,in pertinent part,that 
she did not use drugs the day of the assault,but had been drinking 
she was intoxicated at the time she entered the truck 
on the day she selected rosencrantz photo from a photo lineup,she was probably still half drunk from a night of drinking 
she was not certain that rosencrantz was the person who assaulted her 
she met with the prosecutor garner train and several police officers approximately three times prior to trial 
she did not recall whether she informed the police or prosecutor that she was intoxicated at the time of the assault 
she informed police that she was not certain rosencrantz was the person who assaulted her 
she had no conversations with the prosecutors or investigators regarding any other cases besides the one in which she was the complainant against rosencrantz.
evid.hearing.
burgess testified consistent with her affidavit about the meeting she observed and her impressions from lasky.noting that both burgess and lasky testified that lasky met with the prosecution team prior to trial,the district court found their testimony in this regard to be credible,and in the absence of evidence to rebut,the court concluded that the prosecution allowed false testimony to stand uncorrected when lasky denied any pretrial meetings.
as for the other three instances,the district court found that the prosecutor did not present false testimony on because the testimony failed to qualify as indisputably false,or because,if lasky did testify falsely,the prosecutor did not know it.
this left the court with the finding that the prosecution potentially violated rosencrantz due process rights by knowingly countenancing lasky false denial of pretrial meetings.the court examined whether that false testimony was material,and determined that it was not.then the court went on to decide that even if material,the false testimony meant little when viewed in the context of all the other evidence presented to the jury and therefore could be excused as harmless.in deciding to apply review,the district court looked for guidance to our decision in carter mitchell,cir applying harmless error to a case,and the first circuit decision in gilday callahan,cir same.carter,however,summarily cited harmless error as an alternative basis for denying a claim,and this circuit has yet to explicitly hold that a due process violation should be reviewed for harmless error.
the district court denied rosencrantz habeas relief but granted a certificate of appealability on the question whether lasky false denial of the pretrial meeting with the prosecution counted as material.this court expanded the certificate of appealability to include the other alleged due process violations discussed below.rosencrantz timely appealed.
a conviction obtained by the knowing use of perjured testimony must be set aside if the false testimony could in any reasonable likelihood have affected the judgment of the jury giglio united states,d internal quotation marks omitted see also united states agurs,d.rosencrantz relies on giglio rule that a prosecutor may not deliberately deceive a court and jurors by presenting known false evidence,at,and on the command in brady maryland,d,that a prosecutor must disclose evidence favorable to the accused.by relying on both brady and giglio,rosencrantz implicitly asserts a specific type of brady violation one where the prosecutor failed to correct false testimony that he knew,or should have known,to be false a claim.
the difference between claims and traditional brady withholding claims drives the analysis here.see agurs,at.to prove that the prosecutor failure to correct false testimony violated due process rights,a petitioner must demonstrate that the statement was actually false the statement was material and the prosecution knew it was false.coe bell,cir bell,cir carter bell,cir placing the burden on the habeas petitioner.but in these claims,the materiality assessment is less stringent than that for more general brady withholding of evidence claims.we weigh the materiality of brady withholding claims by asking whether there is a reasonable probability that,had the evidence been disclosed to the defense,the result of the proceeding would have been different.kyles whitley,d quoting united states bagley,d.by contrast,for claims,we ask only if there is any reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury.agurs,at.citing giglio,at.see also carter,at.the distinction matters here,because while a traditional brady materiality analysis obviates a later review under brecht abrahamson courts may excuse violations involving known and materially false statements as harmless error.see carter,at gilday,at.
in reaching the merits of the case,we note that the deferential standard supplied by aedpa does not apply here because no state court addressed the merits of rosencrantz claims williams haviland,cir.we thus apply de novo review to the four instances of alleged false testimony that the assault occurred shortly after,on august,rather than shortly after on august,that lasky felt certain in picking rosencrantz as the assailant,that she was sober at the time of the assault,and that lasky had not met with the prosecution before trial.
as for the first three instances of alleged false testimony,we dispose of the them quickly.they fail under the coe test,either because rosencrantz fails to demonstrate that lasky testified in an indisputably false manner,or because he fails to establish that the prosecution knew the statements were false,or both.although the final instance of false statements concerning her pretrial interaction with the closer treatment,we conclude that even if rosencrantz satisfies the coe test,review excuses the violation.
lasky time line 
according to gooch,lasky told him that the assault occurred at on august.lasky testified similarly at the preliminary examination,saying that the assault occurred at.but at trial she placed the assault closer to the previous night.rosencrantz speculates that the prosecutor coaxed this change to weaken his alibi defense.at the habeas evidentiary hearing,however,rosencrantz failed to question lasky about the substance of her pretrial discussion with the prosecutor,and the district court correctly declined to make any inferences favoring rosencrantz on that subject the district court then reasoned that rosencrantz failed to prove the testimony provided at trial was false.we agree.while lasky vacillated in her reporting of the time,that does not establish indisputably false testimony at trial in the presence of prosecutors.coe,at mere inconsistencies do not show indisputable falsity 
moreover,on lasky time line highlighted the inconsistencies between her trial testimony,her statements to officer gooch at the time of the assault,and her testimony at the preliminary hearing.the defense focused the jury on these inconsistencies,and it was up to the a federal court conducting collateral sort this out.see hayes brown,cir en banc tallman,dissenting an appellate judge place is not in the jury box,post hoc.united states bortnovsky,cir presentation of a witness who recants or contradicts his prior testimony is not to be confused with perjury.it was for the jury to decide whether or not to credit the witness.and wherever the truth still do not know because even at the evidentiary hearing lasky said she could not pin down the exact time of day that she was assaulted nothing about the issue was unknown to the defense at the time of trial.though rosencrantz hypothesizes that the prosecution procured this time change in lasky testimony during the pretrial meeting,rosencrantz inferences do not carry the burden of proving indisputable falsity.
lasky certainty in identifying rosencrantz as the assailant 
the requirement dooms another of rosencrantz the prosecution allowed lasky to identify rosencrantz with a level of certainty that she did not actually possess.according to rosencrantz,the prosecution knew lasky harbored doubt about whether he assaulted her.as support,rosencrantz relies on lasky testimony at the evidentiary hearing,where she testified that at the time of the photo she was hung over,and still,and shaking and probably still half drunk and that she told police she was in no condition to make an identification.lasky also claimed at the evidentiary hearing that she was never certain in her identification of rosencrantz and that she said as much to the police.but at trial,lasky said that she immediately picked rosencrantz face from the photo.lasky also confirmed that the tattoo on rosencrantz chest matched her assailant tattoo.and when the prosecutor pressed lasky with t here no doubt in your mind that rosencrantz is the man that assaulted you,she answered yes.as the district court observed,this situation fails to establish that the prosecutor presented false testimony because o nce the prosecutor elicited testimony from lasky identifying rosencrantz as her assailant,it fell to defense counsel to explore the certainty of her identification,which defense counsel did on cross examination.indisputable falsehood is not established by a simple swearing contest.the district court was not convinced that lasky testimony at the evidentiary hearing established indisputably her earlier falsehood,let alone the prosecutor knowledge of it,and the court did not commit clear error in so deciding.
without a showing of the testimony falsity and that the prosecutor knew it to be lasky saying that she told the prosecution of her doubt at the fails to show a due process violation in presenting the identification testimony.though the evidentiary hearing suggested that lasky either was not as certain at trial as she let on,or that she came to second guess her identification,that does not establish her trial testimony as indisputably false,particularly when lasky consistently identified her assailant as having a car tattoo on his chest and rosencrantz bears just such a tattoo.
lasky sobriety 
finally,rosencrantz complains that the prosecutor allowed lasky to falsely testify that she was sober at the time of the assault.to show that this testimony qualifies as indisputably false,rosencrantz points to pascoe affidavit where he claims that,before the trial,he tipped prosecutors to lasky insobriety.rosencrantz also stresses that at the evidentiary hearing,lasky herself said she was drunk at the time of the assault.nevertheless,both lasky and pascoe stated at trial that she was not under the influence of alcohol at the time of the assault.these contradictory accounts amount only to mere inconsistencies,and therefore rosencrantz claim fails to satisfy the requirement.see coe,at.nor does rosencrantz show that,if lasky did lie,the prosecution knew it.at the evidentiary hearing,defense counsel asked lasky whether she told the police the prosecutor in the case that you were drunk,intoxicated,at the time of the assault lasky responded i not positive of that.
by failing to satisfy the coe test,rosencrantz does not state a due process violation for any of the first three instances of allegedly false testimony.
lasky pretrial meeting with the prosecution 
we approach this fourth alleged instance of false testimony differently the district court found that the prosecutor did indeed knowingly allow lasky false denial of the pretrial meeting and we see no clear error in that factual finding.it then assessed whether the prosecutor countenancing lasky lying about the fact of a meeting was constitutionally material,and decided to excuse the lie as immaterial because its impeachment value would have been cumulative and because it would not have undermined lasky consistent testimony that her assailant,like rosencrantz,had the image of a car tattooed on his chest.we review the district court materiality analysis de novo as a legal conclusion.see carter,at.
materiality 
in cases,false testimony qualifies as material if there is any reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury.agurs,at.citing giglio,at.in other words,we will only excuse the perjury as immaterial if we can say that no reasonable jury could have been affected by the undisclosed information.gilday,at.the first circuit,in contrasting false testimony materiality with withholding materiality,observed that the standard is lower,more favorable to the defendant,and hostile to the prosecution.id.at see also ventura,at materiality standard is appreciably more stringent than the standard.and under giglio standard,in most cases involving perjury or its equivalent the result will likely be a finding of constitutional error.gilday,at.
applying this standard here,we first stress that our review turns on the uncorrected false evidence that no meeting took the other three claimed falsehoods,and not on the four claimed falsehoods viewed cumulatively.although rosencrantz wants us to infer from the testimony that the meeting itself precipitated the other instances of allegedly false testimony we lack a valid premise for such an inference.first,the testimony failed to convince the district court and fails to convince us of the indisputable falsity of the other three claimed instances.second,we can not fill the evidentiary gap here by speculating that the prosecution used the pretrial meetings to coach or coerce lasky to testify counsel failed to pursue this topic at the evidentiary hearing,and thus no evidence exists on the substance of the meeting.rosencrantz theory relies on burgess impressions of the tenor of the meetings as intimidating though she could not hear the conversations and her claimed conversations with lasky.but the district court did not find any of that burgess evidence to be credible.what we do have from the district court regarding the evidentiary hearing is its finding that lasky and burgess testimony that lasky met with the prosecution team prior to trial was credible in this regard.focusing,then,only on lasky denial of the pretrial meeting,we analyze whether any reasonable jury could have been affected by knowing about that false testimony.
given the implausibility of the untruthful answer lasky would expect the prosecuting witness to meet with the prosecution before might assess the impact as minimal.but turning to the impact on the jury had the prosecutor corrected lasky,or the defense counsel confronted lasky with her false denial,it is reasonable to infer that exposing lasky as tipping the jury to another of lasky inconsistencies and her willingness to lie under have affected the jury view of lasky credibility.the state argues that,viewed in the context of the whole trial and with the advantage of hindsight,the likely impact of suppressing the fact of the meeting would be minor because it would have been cumulative of her many inconsistencies.brown smith,cir evidence is cumulative when it supports a fact already established by existing evidence adds very little to the probative force of the other evidence in the case is merely a repetition of previous testimony the case of undisclosed impeachment the witness has already been sufficiently impeached at trial.internal citations omitted mastracchio vose,cir concluding that,because perjury came from an already sullied witness,it was unlikely to have tipped the balance and changed the minds of those who credited his testimony.that argument may succeed in many cases.but here,we will assume that lasky lie about the pretrial meeting is material because,as argued by rosencrantz,lasky served as the prosecution star witness,essentially providing the only evidence against rosencrantz though the pool attendant added to the identification evidence.compare shih wei su filion,cir viewing false testimony as material where lying witness was prosecution chief witness and the conviction depended significantly on lying witness testimony,with foley parker,cir denying habeas relief where,among other reasons,perjured testimony was immaterial because lying witness was not a crucial link in the case against the defendant.see also napue illinois,d the jury estimate of the truthfulness and reliability of a given witness may well be determinative of guilt or innocence.
harmless error 
having assumed materiality and therefore assumed a constitutional error,we now consider the harmlessness of that error.for the reasons given,we find the error harmless because the uncorrected testimony would likely fail to substantially influence the jury verdict given lasky uncontradicted testimony about the assailant tattoo and given the many ways that defense counsel impeached lasky.brecht,at.
our decision to review for harmlessness recognizes that most constitutional errors can be harmless,arizona fulminante,d,and follows the first circuit gilday analysis in holding that courts should review claims for harmless error but not habeas claims,given the different materiality standards for establishing the two types of constitutional breaches.gilday,at.
moreover,the error here is a trial error,not a structural one.certainly,the prosecutor behavior in this case constitutes misconduct that we condemn.but d espite the fundamental nature of the injury to the justice system caused by the knowing use of perjured testimony by the state,the supreme court has not deemed errors to be structural in the sense that they affect the framework within which the trial proceeds.shih wei su,at citing united states feliciano,cir quoting fulminante,at.brackets in original.true enough,review under brecht did not foreclose the possibility that in an unusual case,a deliberate and especially egregious error of the trial type,or one that is combined with a pattern of prosecutorial misconduct,might so infect the integrity of the proceeding as to warrant the grant of habeas relief,even if it did not substantially influence the jury verdict,at,but we do not view this case as the unusual,especially egregious instance of prosecutorial misconduct,or one that reveals any pattern of prosecutorial misconduct.
governing supreme court case law finds structural errors only in a very limited class of cases,including total deprivation of the right to counsel judicial bias the unlawful exclusion of grand jurors of defendant race denial of the right to at trial the denial of the right to a public trial and erroneous instruction to jury.johnson united states,d collecting cases.the error in this case,in contrast,is a trial occurred during the presentation of the case to the jury,and is one which may be quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine whether its admission was harmless fulminante,at.see also hayes,at commenting that error is not structural.although the dissent makes a valid point in arguing that a literal reading of giglio rule suggests that countenancing false testimony implicates structural concerns,the supreme court has yet to explicitly hold errors as structural.the dissent relies on a footnote in kyles,but read in its entirety the footnote confirms that kyles does not settle brecht impact on error.at.w e do not consider the question whether kyles conviction was obtained by the knowing use of perjured testimony and our decision today does not address any claim under the first agurs category.
reviewing for harmless error under of reviewing only for materiality and instead of reviewing under chapman especially appropriate on collateral review,and doing so here honors brecht weighty concerns 
overturning final and presumptively correct convictions on collateral review because the state can not prove that an error is harmless under chapman undermines the states interest in finality and infringes upon their sovereignty over criminal matters.moreover,granting habeas relief merely because there is a reasonable possibility that trial error contributed to the verdict,see chapman california,at,is at odds with the historic meaning of habeas afford relief to those whom society has grievously wronged.retrying defendants whose convictions are set aside also imposes significant social costs,including the expenditure of additional time and resources for all the parties involved,the erosion of memory and dispersion of witnesses that accompany the passage of time and make obtaining convictions on retrial more difficult,and the frustration of society interest in the prompt administration of justice.
at.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.testing rosencrantz claim only for materiality would be tantamount to applying only chapman harmless error the standards are equivalent and would therefore brush aside brecht policy concerns.
our dissenting colleague argues that review is inappropriate here.yet at oral argument,counsel for rosencrantz,in ably arguing for reversal and in responding to chief judge boggs question,agreed that this court should review for harmless error under brecht.rosencrantz brief likewise concedes the point.appellant br.at i f the court finds the testimony material,it must then determine whether the error was harmless.the ninth circuit adopted the opposite view in hayes brown,but we think it erred in failing to distinguish claims from brady withholding claims.see hayes,at.
under brecht,a error harms the accused when the error had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict.brecht,at.the state bears responsibility for showing that the error had no effect on the verdict.gilday,at citing mcaninch,d.if the matter is so evenly balanced that the judge feels himself in virtual equipoise as to the harmlessness of the error,then courts may not excuse the error as harmless,at.
the district court explained 
the substance of the case against rosencrantz would not have changed had lasky false testimony been corrected.ascribing a motive to lasky change in testimony or showing that this portion of her testimony was untruthful would not have made a measurable difference in the defense ability to challenge her credibility.lasky testimony that her assailant had a car tattoo on his chest remained constant from her initial statement to officer gooch through her trial testimony.in light of the cumulative nature of the impeachment evidence and the car tattoo testimony,the court is not in grave doubt about whether the false testimony had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict.therefore,the court finds any error harmless.
other comments from the district court bolster this conclusion 
t he jury had a compelling piece of incriminating evidence to consider before there had arisen any disputes or discrepancies about talking to the assistant prosecutor before trial,lasky told the responding police officer that the perpetrator,whoever he was,possessed something immutable,unusual and memorable the tattoo of a car on his chest.the parties do not dispute that,as of the summer of,rosencrantz bore just such a tattoo on his chest.
we agree with the district court and harbor no grave doubt that lasky denial of the pretrial meeting had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict.id.at.quoting brecht,at.instead,even if the prosecutor had contradicted lasky denial of the meeting,or defense counsel confronted lasky with her lie,that would not have substantially influenced the jury deliberation given the following the independent and compelling evidence that lasky identified her assailant as having the tattoo on his identification she consistently made from the time she reported the assault to the police the absence of any evidence suggesting that lasky could have been persuaded or coerced into offering the tattoo testimony the absence of evidence that the police knew rosencrantz had a tattoo before putting his photo in the line up the many ways that defense counsel impeached lasky and impugned her character the modest value to have been reasonably gained from the jury learning that lasky lied about meeting with the prosecutor the absence of evidence of coaching and coercing despite the opportunity to explore the interaction between lasky and the prosecution at the evidentiary hearing and a michigan jury found rosencrantz guilty after a trial where lasky credibility and character had been thoroughly impugned by the defense,even without knowing she lied about the meeting 
our decision to excuse the error here as harmless simply analyzes the effect on the verdict of the prosecutorial in no way countenances it.the deliberate deception of a court and jurors by the presentation of known false evidence is incompatible with rudimentary demands of justice t he same result obtains when the state,although not soliciting false evidence,allows it to go uncorrected when it appears.giglio,at.internal citations and quotation marks omitted agurs,at.condoned perjury involve s a corruption of the function of the trial process jones kentucky,cir f undamental conceptions of justice which lie at the base of our civil and political institutions must condemn as a travesty a conviction upon perjured testimony if later,but fortunately not too late,its falseness is discovered.prosecutorial culpability can not,however,outweigh brecht policy concerns.see smith phillips,d in analyzing materiality,noting that the prosecutorial misconduct effect on the trial,not the blameworthiness of the prosecutor,is the crucial inquiry for due process purposes.rosencrantz case,although it presents a close call,falls short.we excuse the error here as harmless.
viewing rosencrantz claim through the habeas lens,we are convinced that any constitutional error fails the brecht standard.we affirm the judgment of the district court dismissing rosencrantz habeas petition.
timothy rosencrantz was convicted of sexual assault and sentenced to to fifty years in prison based on the testimony of the victim who materially perjured herself at trial regarding her collaboration with the prosecution,her sobriety at the time of the attack,and her certainty as to the identity of the assailant.the prosecution knew the victim testimony was false at the time it was given,but did nothing to correct it.the prosecution inaction violated rosencrantz due process rights under the fourteenth amendment,and rosencrantz is entitled to postconviction relief under brady maryland,d.the majority,however,refuses to grant rosencrantz such relief,and alters the straightforward rule of by holding that the prosecutorial misconduct constituted harmless error under brecht abrahamson,d.see brady,at.giglio united states,d.the majority position misconstrues both brady and brecht and fails to appreciate that a brady violation necessarily brings into question the substantive fairness of the trial,and,therefore,material brady violations are never harmless under brecht.moreover,even if brecht analysis applied,the prosecution inaction was not harmless in this case.in short,because the majority lacks any sound reason for denying postconviction relief,i respectfully dissent.
brady is rooted in a line of cases requiring postconviction relief for material prosecutorial misconduct.see brady,at.giglio,at.these cases demonstrate that certain prosecutorial misconduct can so undermine confidence in a verdict and impact the fairness of trial that a new trial is required.giglio,for example,plainly states a new trial is required if the false testimony could in any reasonable likelihood have affected the judgment of the jury.at.quoting napue illinois,d see also kyles whitley,d.this court has recognized that same rule,stating that a new trial follows automatically from the knowing use of perjured testimony given any reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury.byrd collins,cir citations omitted.the majority all but ignores this line of precedent and its per se requirement for habeas relief in cases of material prosecutorial misconduct.
in so doing,the majority treats brady and its associated line of cases as providing merely a threshold test for brecht analysis.majority opinion.at.brecht,at.but the majority application of brecht is misplaced.brecht sets forth a inquiry for the grant of habeas relief for trial errors first,the habeas petitioner must establish the existence of a constitutional trial error,and second,the court must ascertain that the error was not harmless.id.the majority reads brady as simply identifying the existence of a particular constitutional trial error that is,the majority reads brady as being relevant only to the first prong of brecht.op.at.but this interpretation effectively breaks the link between the existence of a violation and the grant of postconviction relief.the whole purpose of the test is to identify those due process harms requiring relief.at.if giglio is still good law today,then the idea that a petitioner claims could satisfy the the majority concedes rosencrantz has not be entitled to a new trial is insupportable.op.at.see giglio,at.
the majority error may lie in its failure to appreciate that brecht use of trial error as a term of art.not every trial defect constitutes a brecht trial error,and certain defects necessarily remain wholly outside brecht purview.for example,trial error as used by brecht excludes structural trial defects,and analysis does not apply to such defects.at.structural defects are defects that,by their very nature,undermine confidence in the jury verdict or otherwise call the substantive fairness of the entire trial into question.kyles whitley provides indirect support for this view.at.in kyles,the supreme court applied the standard to the of exculpatory evidence at trial,stressing that satisfaction of bagley standard necessarily implied satisfaction of brecht,thereby rendering moot a brecht analysis.id.at.united states bagley,d.thus,although bagley does not itself apply in the present case,the court discussion of bagley in kyles sheds light on the sort of case in which brecht analysis is not required.the kyles court stated 
t he question is not whether the state would have had a case to go to the jury if it had disclosed the favorable evidence,but whether we can be confident that the jury verdict would have been the same.
at.the implication of this statement is that brecht analysis is moot where we can not be confident that the jury verdict would have been the same.id.
harm by its nature goes to the substantive fairness of trial.the genius of perhaps the reason that it has lent its name to a whole category of constitutional in its recognition that certain material prosecutorial misconduct renders a trial ipso facto substantively unfair.see brady,at.where this misconduct is present,relief is mandatory.id.an individual may not be imprisoned when the fairness of his trial is in question.see id.describing cases leading up to brady.and brecht does not alter this fundamental rule.see brecht,at.as the supreme court stated in the case of kyles a conviction obtained by the knowing use of perjured testimony is fundamentally unfair and must be set aside if there is any reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury.at.internal quotations omitted.
given the conceptual framework of brady and brecht,we should not shoehorn brady into brecht analysis.rather,brady and brecht remain consistent only so long as they stand apart.the court only task in the present case,then,is to apply the giglio test.if the test is satisfied,a new trial is required.giglio,at.
the majority does not dispute that the prosecutor knowing failure to correct the perjured testimony regarding meetings occurring between the prosecution and the victim meets the test.op.at.such material misconduct plainly had a reasonable likelihood of affect ing the judgment of the jury.giglio,at.because giglio requires a new trial under these conditions,i would reverse the district court and order a new trial.id.
assuming arguendo that brecht has overruled well as our prior precedent,see byrd collins,cir following the giglio rule i still maintain that the prosecution misconduct requires a new trial because those errors were not harmless under brecht.
in brecht,the supreme court resolved a dispute over the proper harmless error analysis applicable to certain types of trial error.brecht,at.the brecht court held that trial errors do not require postconviction relief unless the error had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict.id.stated differently,brecht analysis requires actual prejudice before a trial error can result in habeas relief.id.
the majority considers four allegations of prosecutorial misconduct.separately,three of these errors satisfy brecht analysis.considered jointly,therefore,there is little doubt that the facts of this case call for a new trial.
