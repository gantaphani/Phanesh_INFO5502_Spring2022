steven burgess was involuntarily committed to a wisconsin state mental health facility after a jury found that he was a sexually violent person as defined in wisconsin sexually violent person commitment statutes.stat.et chapter.both the wisconsin court of appeals and the supreme court of wisconsin affirmed the judgment ordering his commitment.after exhausting his state court remedies,he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the western district of wisconsin,and the district court denied relief.burgess now appeals to this court.
what distinguishes this case from the many habeas corpus petitions this court entertains each term is that it involves one additional is a member of a federally recognized indian tribe.he argues that as a legal resident of an indian reservation,the state of wisconsin lacked jurisdiction to commit him involuntarily as a sexually violent person.he relies on public law,stat,codified in part at,under which congress expressly granted wisconsin criminal and limited civil jurisdiction over matters involving indians.we conclude that the supreme court of wisconsin ultimate resolution of burgess jurisdictional claim was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established law as articulated by the supreme court of the united states,and we thus affirm the district court denial of the petition.
burgess is an enrolled member of the lac du flambeau band of lake superior chippewa indians lac du flambeau,a indian tribe.for most of his life,burgess has lived on the lac du flambeau reservation in vilas county,wisconsin he is a legal resident of his tribal reservation land.
in february of,burgess was convicted of attempted sexual assault of a child a crime that he committed on his reservation in the circuit court for vilas county,wisconsin.he was subsequently incarcerated at the oshkosh correctional institution,a prison facility of the state of wisconsin.there is no question that the wisconsin circuit court had jurisdiction,conferred by of public law,to try burgess for this crime.see state webster,public law gave certain states,including wisconsin,jurisdiction over crimes committed by or against indians in indian country within each state.see also a t he criminal laws of such state or territory shall have the same force and effect within such indian country as they have elsewhere within the state or territory.
on november,the day that burgess was scheduled to be released from prison,the state of wisconsin filed a petition seeking his commitment as a chapter sexually violent person.at that time,chapter defined sexually violent person as 
a person who has been convicted of a sexually violent offense,or has been found not guilty of or not responsible for a sexually violent offense by reason of insanity or mental disease,defect,or illness,and who is dangerous because he or she suffers a mental disorder that makes it substantially probable that the person will engage in acts of sexual violence.
stat.amended.the statute has recently been amended the last clause now reads that the person will engage in one or more acts of sexual violence.stat.emphasis added.once a court or jury has determined after proper proceedings that the individual is a sexually violent person,the court shall order the person to be committed to the custody of the d epartment of health and family services for control,care and treatment until the person is no longer a sexually violent person.stat.
the statute also spells out the requirements for the commitment procedures.the process begins with a probable cause hearing,to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that the person named in the petition is a sexually violent person.id.at the time the state filed its chapter petition in burgess case,the statute provided that i f the court determines after a hearing that there is probable cause to believe that the person named in the petition is a sexually violent person,the court shall order that the person be taken into custody if he or she is not in custody and shall order the person to be transferred within a reasonable time to an appropriate facility for an evaluation as to whether the person is a sexually violent person.id.amended.on november,the circuit court found probable cause that burgess was a sexually violent person and ordered him transferred to a state mental health institution for evaluation.
burgess requested a jury for the commitment proceeding.see id.at the hearing,the state bore the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that he is a sexually violent person.id.a.at the time burgess petition was pending before the circuit court,the statute also afforded him all constitutional rights available to a defendant in a criminal proceeding,id.that provision has since been repealed,but we have no occasion to consider any implications of the change,as it has no effect on burgess.
prior to his hearing,burgess filed a host of motions.most relevant to this appeal,he moved to dismiss the state petition on the ground that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to conduct involuntary civil commitment proceedings against enrolled tribal members.his position,essentially,was that a chapter proceeding falls into the cracks between the jurisdiction conferred by the criminal and civil provisions of public law.he acknowledged that the federal statute grants wisconsin broad criminal jurisdiction over offenses committed by indians both within the state and on their reservation land,but he argued that this was not a criminal proceeding.the grant of civil jurisdiction in of public law,codified at a,is limited to private,civil litigation involving tribal members in state court and does not give the state general civil regulatory authority over reservation indians burgess position was that the involuntary commitment process more resembled a regulatory action than a suit in tort or contract.
after receiving burgess motion,the circuit court wrote a letter to the lac du flambeau tribal court asking whether it could handle burgess commitment proceeding.that court declined jurisdiction,indicating that it was not in a position to hear burgess case because the tribe at that time had no laws or ordinances calling for the indefinite commitment of sexually violent persons.as a result,the circuit court denied burgess motion based on its understanding that the state was allowed to assert jurisdiction over reservation indians in any area where the tribe did not have an ongoing tradition of acting.
at the hearing,both sides presented expert testimony about burgess mental condition and the likelihood of recidivism.the jury found burgess to be a sexually violent person.on august,the circuit court entered a judgment indefinitely committing burgess to the wisconsin department of health and family services.burgess filed a number of motions,including a motion for a new trial or relief from judgment based in part on his jurisdictional objection,but the circuit court denied these motions.
burgess appealed.among the issues he raised before the wisconsin court of appeals was his argument that the state court lacked jurisdiction to conduct chapter proceedings against enrolled tribal members,particularly where the underlying offense was committed on reservation land.the court of appeals affirmed.it agreed with burgess that chapter was not a criminal or punitive law,and therefore that the circuit court did not have criminal jurisdiction over burgess case.in re the commitment of steven burgess,citing state carpenter.nevertheless,it rejected burgess argument that this proceeding fell outside the scope of public law grant of civil jurisdiction.
burgess then turned to the state supreme court,which affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals on different grounds.the supreme court reasoned that the circuit court had jurisdiction to conduct burgess chapter proceedings under public law broad grant of criminal jurisdiction because the underlying conduct at issue,sexually violent behavior,was prohibited by state criminal law.the supreme court also concluded that burgess commitment proceeding was somehow ancillary to the circuit court general criminal jurisdiction over tribal members because the civil proceedings under chapter are enveloped on both sides by criminal conduct.in re the commitment of steven burgess.in this connection,it pointed out that only persons who have committed sexually violent offenses are eligible for commitment under chapter and chapter commitments are intended to protect the public by preventing future acts of sexual violence.id.in the alternative,the supreme court decided that even if chapter is strictly construed as a civil law in its entirety,it is not the type of civil law that gives the state general regulatory authority over tribal members.instead,as a more ordinary civil law,it falls within public law grant of civil jurisdiction.id.in september,the court denied burgess motion for reconsideration the united states supreme court denied certiorari on march.
burgess then filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus.see.the district court adopted a magistrate judge recommendation to deny burgess petition on february.although the district court believed that burgess had presented a strong argument that the supreme court of wisconsin erred in determining that the state had jurisdiction to commit him under chapter,it held that the state court ruling was nonetheless not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established precedent from the supreme court of the united states.the district court further opined that in cases such as this,where reasonable jurists can debate whether a particular state court ruling is contrary to federal law,it is up to the united states supreme court to make the final call.recognizing the substantiality of the jurisdictional issue,the court granted burgess motion for a certificate of appealability on march.
on appeal,burgess makes a number of powerful arguments concerning general principles of tribal sovereignty and the extent of congress grant of jurisdiction to the states over the affairs of reservation indians.as interesting as the merits of burgess jurisdictional arguments are,because he filed his petition after the effective date of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,its standard of review governs this case.see gomez berge,cir.under aedpa,habeas corpus relief is available only if burgess can establish that the state court proceedings resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.we review the decision of the last state court to rule on the merits of the petitioner claim,here the wisconsin supreme court.see mcfowler jaimet,cir.
under aedpa,a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law when the court reache s a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or confront s facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of the supreme court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from its precedent.laxton bartow,cir quoting williams taylor,d.a state court unreasonably applies clearly established supreme court decisions when it correctly identifies the governing legal rule but applies it unreasonably to the facts of a particular petitioner case.id.quoting williams,at.internal quotation marks omitted.in determining whether a state court has fallen afoul of the unreasonable application branch of aedpa,a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.williams,at.the federal court may act only if the state court decision is objectively unreasonable.id.at.this court has defined objectively unreasonable as lying well outside the boundaries of permissible differences of opinion,hardaway young,cir we will allow the state court decision to stand if it is one of several equally plausible outcomes.hall washington,cir.
within aedpa framework,we review the district court decision to deny burgess habeas petition de novo.see horton litscher,cir.whether the state court decision was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law is a mixed question of law and fact that we traditionally also review de novo but with a grant of deference to any reasonable state court decision.jackson frank,cir quoting schaff snyder,cir emphasis in original.in this case,as in all cases that come to us under aedpa,we emphasize that we are expressing no opinion about the correctness of the state court ruling as a matter of first principles.should a case in this area reach us through a different procedural avenue without the aedpa constraints on review,we would be free to evaluate it for ourselves.
as a general matter,indian tribes retain attributes of sovereignty over both their members and their territory tribal sovereignty is dependent on,and subordinate to,only the federal government,not the states.california cabazon band of mission indians,d internal citations omitted.although a state is not completely barred from exercising jurisdiction over the activities of tribal members on reservation land lying within its boundaries,the exercise of state jurisdiction is limited and must be based upon a specific grant of authority by congress.germaine circuit court for vilas county,cir.one such delegation of authority is found in public law,which grants six states,including wisconsin,jurisdiction over specified areas of indian country.cabazon,at.in enacting public law,congress was primarily concerned with the problem of lawlessness on certain indian reservations,as well as the absence of adequate tribal institutions for law enforcement.bryan itasca county,d.with this in mind,the central focus of the act,id.at,was to give the enumerated states broad criminal jurisdiction over offenses committed by or against indians within all indian country within the state.cabazon,at.section of the act therefore grants jurisdiction over offenses committed by or against indians in the areas of indian country to the same extent that such state or territory has jurisdiction over offenses committed elsewhere within the state or territory,and the criminal laws of such state or territory shall have the same force and effect within such indian country as they have elsewhere within the state or territory.a.
section of public law addresses civil cases,conferring upon the listed states jurisdiction over civil causes of action between indians or to which indians are parties to the same extent that such state has jurisdiction over other civil causes of action,and those civil laws of such state that are of general application to private persons or private property shall have the same force and effect within indian country as they have elsewhere within the state.a.the act grant of civil jurisdiction,however,is more restricted than its grant of criminal jurisdiction.cabazon,at.the supreme court has read the statute as one that is primarily intended to redress the lack of adequate indian forums for resolving private legal disputes between reservation indians,and between indians and other private citizens,by permitting the court of the states to decide such disputes.bryan,at.in bryan,the court wrote that the consistent and exclusive use of the terms civil causes of action,aris ing on,civil laws of general application to private persons or private property,and adjudica tion,in both the act and its legislative history virtually compel led the conclusion that the primary intent of was to grant jurisdiction over private civil litigation involving reservation indians in state court,and,importantly for burgess argument,not to confer general state civil regulatory control over indian reservations.id.at.
the supreme court has also emphasized that public law plainly was not intended to effect total assimilation of indian tribes into mainstream american society,recognizing that a grant to states of general civil regulatory power over india
