background 
trial and conviction 
lorinda,the complaining witness,testified at walker trial that she was at home alone with her four children on september,when the defendant unexpectedly arrived at the house.lorinda knew walker because he dated her stepsister.upon entering the house,walker grabbed lorinda by the wrists.lorinda told him to stop playing,and he said,bitch,i not playing.he grabbed her by the neck,bit her on the cheek,and hit her.he also grabbed a hammer that was sitting on the table and threatened to hit her with it as he said,you know what i want.lorinda told him to stop,but he forced her into the bedroom and ordered her to perform oral sex on him.when she refused,he hit her,then forcibly pulled up her dress.he pulled the crotch of her underwear aside,but was not able to pull them off because she held on to them.lorinda testified that he rubbed his penis on her vagina and put his stuff on me.
lorinda testified that,during the assault,she told her oldest child,shontaya,to call,and shontaya did.shontaya took the stand at walker trial and confirmed her mother story.shontaya testified that she saw walker hit,push,and grab her mother while her mother was saying stop and telling him to leave.she saw her mother crying and she saw walker pick up a hammer and try to hit her mother with it.after walker pushed her mother into the bedroom,shontaya went upstairs to call.the state played a tape of shontaya call for the jury

after walker left,lorinda called and told the dispatcher that walker had tried to rape her,and that he bit her and tried to hit her with a hammer.she also called her fiancé,clifton keeler,who arrived at the house before the police did.
walker took the stand in his own defense and testified that lorinda invited him to her house and that they had consensual sex.walker testified that the mark on lorinda cheek was a hickey that he gave her after their sexual encounter.
the parties stipulated to the following evidence,which was presented to the jury the state crime laboratory found a small amount of semen on the cervical and vaginal swabs and the woods light swab,taken from lorinda at the hospital in the late afternoon of september,but there was an insufficient amount of semen for further serological analysis.the nurse from the hospital testified that the woods light swab was taken from lorinda right inner thigh and groin.the crime lab report also contained a finding that no semen was identified on the underwear or dress worn by lorinda,but this was not presented to the jury by stipulation or otherwise.
based on the foregoing evidence,the jury convicted walker of kidnapping and sexual assault while armed,and acquitted him of an intimidation of a victim charge.the presiding circuit judge sentenced walker to years in prison.
walker subsequently filed for relief with the wisconsin circuit court,arguing,inter alia,that his confrontation clause rights were violated by the exclusion of evidence that lorinda had a motive to falsely accuse him,and that he was denied his right to effective assistance of counsel when his attorney failed to introduce the crime lab report finding that no semen was found on lorinda underwear or dress.the confrontation clause issue centered on the trial court exclusion of evidence that lorinda fiancé,clifton keeler,had previously assaulted her on at least four occasions.all four of those incidents were memorialized in police reports.the report of the most recent incident,which occurred on october,approximately eleven months before walker sexual assault,noted that keeler was jealous because he thought that lorinda was involved with another man.walker argued that the evidence was relevant for two purposes truthfulness and motive.regarding truthfulness,walker asserted that this was evidence that lorinda was lying when she checked the no box in response to the question hit or threatened in the past year on a hospital report related to the incident with walker.as to motive,walker maintained that these prior incidents gave lorinda a possible motive to falsely accuse him of rape and falsely testify that she did not consent to their encounter.walker theory was that lorinda manufactured the sexual assault story because she feared that keeler would find out that they had sex and beat her.the trial court excluded the evidence.citing wisconsin analog of rule b of the federal rules of evidence,the court explained that truthfulness can not be attacked by specific instances of conduct.in addition,the court concluded that the evidence was not admissible evidence of motive because it was too speculative and therefore not relevant.the court cited the following considerations in support of its conclusion that the evidence was irrelevant there was no evidence that the prior beatings by keeler occurred because lorinda was having consensual sex with someone there was no evidence that she had ever manufactured a sexual assault to avoid a beating by keeler there was a physical assault component connected to the incident with walker and shontaya provided eyewitness testimony that corroborated lorinda account.the court also ruled that any probative value of the evidence was outweighed by the prejudicial effect of the evidence.the circuit court summarily affirmed the trial judge ruling on the confrontation clause issue.on the ineffective assistance issue,the court held that walker was not prejudiced by his attorney failure to introduce the crime lab results.
on july,the wisconsin court of appeals affirmed the lower court decision.with regard to the confrontation clause issue,the court explained 
the trial court reasoned that the relevance of the october,incident to lorinda motive to fabricate the nonconsensual nature of sex with walker was minimal.the court noted the evidence that lorinda called keeler in tears and told him that walker had assaulted her,she had her daughter call,her daughter witnessed walker physically abusive behavior,and lorinda had a bite mark on her cheek from walker.given this evidence,the trial court could reasonably consider walker theory tying the october,incident to a motive to lie about walker to be too speculative.the court also expressed a concern about the effect of stereotype,which we understand to mean that the trial court was concerned about the effect on the jury of evidence suggesting that lorinda had previously had consensual sex with another man besides her fiancé.it is likely that if walker introduced evidence of the october,incident,whether lorinda had been involved with another man would become a focus of the trial.that would be irrelevant to the charges against walker,but distracting and unfairly prejudicial to the state case.we conclude that the court could reasonably decide that there was a minimal logical connection between the october,incident with keeler and lorinda motive to lie about walker,and that any probative value the october,incident might have was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.
app.the court also rejected the ineffective assistance of counsel claim,reasoning that the lack of semen on lorinda dress and underwear did not necessarily strengthen walker case or undercut lorinda testimony.
on june,walker filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the eastern district of wisconsin.the court denied the petition on september.walker appointed counsel then filed a motion for relief from judgment under rule e,asserting manifest error of law.on july,the district court denied the motion.the court held that walker case was distinguishable from controlling supreme court precedent on the confrontation clause issue and that the asserted error was harmless in any event.the court also concluded that the wisconsin court of appeals application of the prejudice prong of the supreme court decision in strickland washington,d was neither contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.the district court then granted a certificate of appealability on both the confrontation clause issue and the ineffective assistance of counsel claim.

standard of review 
we review the district court decision to deny walker habeas petition de novo.searcy jaimet,cir.because walker habeas petition was filed after the effective date of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,the provisions of the aedpa govern our review.myartt frank,cir.under the aedpa,as relevant to this case,a writ can not be granted unless the state court adjudication of the claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law d.c learly established federal law refers to the holdings of the supreme court cases as of the time of the relevant decision.williams taylor,d.to run afoul of d standard,the state court must have either i adopted a rule that contradicts the governing law of the supreme court or ii on a set of facts materially indistinguishable from those at issue in the applicable supreme court precedent,reached a different result.ward sternes,cir citing williams,at,and washington smith,cir.under the unreasonable application clause,a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court identifies the correct governing principle from the court decisions but unreasonably applies the principle to the facts of the prisoner case.williams,at.even if the state court erroneously applied federal law,we may only grant the writ if the decision was objectively unreasonable.yarborough alvarado,d.
confrontation clause 
walker first argument is that the wisconsin court of appeals decision on his confrontation clause challenge was contrary to clearly established federal law in that the court confronted facts materially indistinguishable from the supreme court decision in olden kentucky,d per curiam,and nevertheless arrived at a different result.we disagree.though the facts in olden are superficially similar to the instant facts in ways that the facts in many sexual assault cases would be,they are not indistinguishable.in olden,two men were indicted for kidnapping,rape,and forcible sodomy.id.at.the olden defendants asserted a defense of consent.id.at.the defendants theory of the case was that the complainant concocted the rape story to protect her relationship with her boyfriend.id.at.the complainant admitted that she had been out drinking at a bar,became somewhat intoxicated,and voluntarily left with one of the defendants.id.at.according to the complainant,the defendants then raped her and dropped her off at her boyfriend house.id.her boyfriend,the of one of the assailants,heard a noise outside of his home,went out to investigate,and saw his girlfriend get out of the assailant car.id.at.the complainant immediately told her boyfriend that the men raped her.id.at.the jury acquitted one defendant on all charges and acquitted the second defendant of kidnapping and rape,but convicted him of forcible sodomy.id.at.
the defendant convicted of sodomy appealed his conviction on the basis of the confrontation clause.id.at trial,the wanted to demonstrate that the complainant had motive to lie by introducing evidence that the complainant was living with her boyfriend at the time of trial.id.this was the same boyfriend who had seen her get out of his friend car in an intoxicated state on the night of the incident.id.the trial judge excluded all evidence of the complainant living situation and did not allow defense counsel to the complainant on the issue even after she claimed on direct examination that she was living with her mother.id.at.the supreme court in olden held that the court refusal to permit on the complainant cohabitation with her boyfriend violated the defendant sixth amendment right to confront the witnesses against him.id.at.the court emphasized that the exposure to a witness motivation in testifying is a proper and important function of the constitutionally protected right of.id.at.internal quotations and citations omitted.the court acknowledged that trial courts have discretion to impose reasonable limits on,but concluded that the limitation here was beyond reason because the evidence about the complainant relationship had such strong potential to cast doubt on her testimony.id.at.
the instant case is distinguishable.given the olden complainant admission that she had been out drinking with the defendants on the night of the incident,her voluntary departure from the bar with the men,her admission that the men dropped her off at her boyfriend house after the incident a gesture that seems unusual in light of her allegations,her boyfriend testimony that he saw her get out of the defendant car on the night of the incident and his possible suspicion of infidelity,and her continued cohabitation with the boyfriend at the time of trial,the defendants theory of the case was plausible and had a factual basis in the evidence.the jury apparently believed so,considering that it acquitted one defendant of kidnapping,rape,and sodomy and acquitted the other of kidnapping and sodomy even in the absence of evidence of the complainant cohabitation with her boyfriend at the time of trial.walker defense,on the other hand,was somewhere between absurd and impossible.according to walker,lorinda called him over to have sex during the middle of the day while she was watching her four children,all under the age of nine.when walker appeared,lorinda shepherded the children into a room and had sex with him.but she did not want her boyfriend to find out about the encounter.to that end,instead of simply never telling her boyfriend about the tryst,she told her daughter to call while she was in the middle of having sex with walker.tr.of call my mother told me to call.lorinda also put on a good show for her children by crying,and walker got into the act of setting himself up for a false sexual assault charge by hitting lorinda before they had sex.id.the foregoing defense,walker asserts,hinged on his being able to explore the fact that lorinda was a victim of domestic violence,at least as recently as eleven months before walker sexually assaulted her.we fail to see the connection between the stale report of domestic violence at the hands of her boyfriend and the farfetched,of walker on sexual assault charges.in contrast to olden where the limitation was beyond reason because evidence about the complainant relationship had such strong potential to cast doubt on her testimony,the restriction placed on walker of lorinda was well within the trial judge wide discretion to impose reasonable limits on because it did not have potential to cast doubt on lorinda testimony.we accordingly conclude that the wisconsin court of appeals decision was not contrary to olden.
walker also asserts that the re
