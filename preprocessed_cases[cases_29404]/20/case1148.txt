orlando hall,a federal prisoner under a sentence of death,has applied for a certificate of appealability to challenge the district court denial of his motion to vacate his conviction and sentence under.hall previously sought,and was denied,a certificate of appealability from the district court.for the reasons discussed below,we deny hall application for a certificate of appealability.
background 
orlando cordia hall hall ran a marijuana trafficking enterprise in pine bluff,arkansas,along with bruce webster webster and marvin holloway holloway.hall,webster,and holloway bought marijuana in the worth area,assisted by steven beckley beckley,who lived in irving,texas.typically,beckley drove the marijuana back to arkansas,and holloway stored the marijuana in his house.
on september,holloway drove hall from pine bluff to little rock,arkansas,and hall then flew from little rock to dallas in order to buy marijuana.beckley and hall brother,demetrius hall hall picked hall up at the dallas airport.later that day,hall and beckley met two local drug dealers,stanfield vitalis vitalis and neil rene rene,at a car wash and gave them to procure marijuana.hall and beckley returned to the car wash to pick up the marijuana,but vitalis and rene did not return.hall then spoke with vitalis and rene by telephone,and vitalis and rene told hall that they had been robbed of both their car and the entrusted to them.
hall and beckley then gave vitalis and rene phone number to a friend who worked for the telephone company,and this friend told them that the number was associated with an address at the polo run apartments in arlington,texas.hall,hall,and beckley began surveilling this address,and they saw vitalis and rene exit an apartment and approach the same car which they claimed had been stolen along with the.based on this surveillance,hall and beckley concluded that vitalis and rene had lied about the robbery and had kept the for themselves.
hall called holloway on september,and instructed him to drive webster to the airport in little rock.webster then flew from little rock to dallas.that evening,hall,hall,beckley,and webster drove to the polo run apartments in a car owned by hall sister cassandra.hall and webster each carried handguns,hall carried a souvenir baseball bat,and beckley carried duct tape and a jug of gasoline.
when they arrived,webster and hall knocked on the front door of the apartment that vitalis and rene had left.lisa rene rene,rene sister,was alone in the apartment and refused them entry.when webster and hall began issuing threats,rene called her sister and.webster attempted to kick in the front door,but when that failed he and hall circled around to the patio and broke into the apartment through a glass door.webster then entered the apartment,tackled rene,and dragged her back to hall sister car.the group then drove away from the polo run apartments and returned to hall sister apartment,where beckley car was parked.there,they forced rene into beckley car and then drove off in a group.during this second drive hall raped rene.later,the group returned to hall sister apartment,and from there beckley,hall,and webster drove back to pine bluff along with rene.hall remained behind and flew back to arkansas the next day.
once beckley,hall,and webster reached pine bluff,holloway provided them with money,which they used to move into a motel room.there,they tied rene to a chair and raped her repeatedly.on september,hall and holloway arrived at the motel room and took rene into the bathroom for approximately twenty minutes.when they emerged,hall told beckley,she know too much,and then he left the motel with holloway and webster.
after leaving the motel,hall and webster went to byrd lake park and dug a grave.that evening,hall,webster,and beckley took rene to byrd lake park,but they could not find the grave site in the dark,so they returned to the motel room.early the next morning,on september,beckley and hall moved rene to another motel because they were concerned that a security guard at the first motel was becoming suspicious.
later on the morning of the,webster,hall,and beckley again drove rene to byrd lake park,after covering her eyes with a mask,and they took her to the grave site,which they were able to locate in the daylight.at the grave site,hall placed a sheet over rene head and then hit her once in the head with a shovel.rene screamed and attempted to run away,but beckley grabbed her and hit her twice in the head with the shovel.beckley then handed the shovel to hall,and hall and beckley took turns beating her.when they had finished,webster gagged rene,dragged her into the grave,covered her with gasoline,and covered her with dirt.in its current brief before this court,the government reminds us that the medical report supported findings that rene was alive but unconscious when she was buried by webster,that she died from the effects of the multiple blunt force injuries she suffered during her beating,combined with asphyxia,and that she may have regained consciousness in the grave before her death.after rene was buried,the three men returned to the motel and picked up hall.
on september,an arrest warrant was issued in arlington for hall,hall,and beckley for rene kidnapping,and hall,beckley,and webster were arrested.on september,hall surrendered to pine bluff authorities in the presence of his attorney.based on his attorney advice,hall did not give a statement at arrest,but he indicated that he would talk once he was transported to texas.on october,hall gave a written statement to fbi and arlington county officials in which he substantially implicated himself in rene kidnapping and death.
the united states district court for the northern district of texas issued a criminal complaint on october,charging hall,hall,webster,and beckley with kidnapping in violation of a.on november,a superseding indictment was returned,charging hall,hall,webster,beckley,and holloway with kidnapping in which a death occurred in violation of a,conspiracy to commit kidnapping in violation of c,traveling in interstate commerce with intent to promote the possession of marijuana with intent to distribute in violation of,using a telephone to promote the unlawful activity of extortion in violation of,traveling in interstate commerce with intent to promote extortion in violation of,and using and carrying a firearm during a crime of violence in violation of c.
the government filed notice of its intent to seek the death penalty against hall on february.the district court severed hall trial from the trial of his codefendants on april,and his trial began on october.on october,the jury convicted hall of kidnapping in which a death occurred,conspiracy to commit kidnapping,traveling in interstate commerce to promote possession of marijuana with intent to distribute,and using and carrying a firearm during a crime of violence.after a separate hearing,the jury recommended,by unanimous vote,that hall receive the death penalty 
hall appealed,and his conviction and sentence were affirmed by this court on august.united states hall,cir hereinafter hall.hall filed a petition for rehearing with this court,which was denied on october.hall then petitioned the supreme court for a writ of certiorari,which was denied on may.hall united states,d.
hall filed his initial motion to vacate his conviction and sentence,pursuant to,in may.in june,the district court granted hall request to file a discovery motion.hall filed an initial discovery motion in august and a supplemental discovery motion in may.the district court denied both motions in april.hall then filed a second motion to vacate in june,and he filed an amended version of this motion to vacate in september.in this second amended motion,hall raised twelve claims for relief from his conviction and sentence see hall united states,slip op.at,wl,hereinafter dist.op.
the government filed a response to this second amended motion to vacate in january,and hall replied in march.on june,the district court conducted an evidentiary hearing limited to the extraneous influence on the jury issues raised by hall third,fourth,and fifth claims for relief,which were grouped together by the district court as issue c in the list reproduced in note supra.on august,the district court issued a comprehensive,careful memorandum opinion and order,denying all of the claims presented in hall motion for relief.
hall filed a notice of appeal from the district court order denying his motion on november,and he applied to the district court for a certificate of appealability coa on that same date as well.the district court denied hall coa application on december,citing hernandez johnson,cir,and finding that hall had failed to make a substantial showing of the denial of a federal constitutional right.on july,hall filed the present application for a coa with this court.
ii.discussion 
this court may not consider an appeal from the denial of a motion for relief unless either the district court or this court issues a coa.c b.to obtain a coa,an applicant such as hall must make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.united states garza,citing c,and united states kimler,cir.an applicant such as hall need not establish that he will win on the merits rather,he need only demonstrate that the questions he raises are debatable among reasonable jurists.garza,at citing united states rocha,cir.in determining whether to grant a coa,our inquiry is limited to a threshold examination that requires an overview of hall current claims and a general assessment of their merits.smith dretke,cir quoting cockrell,d.because this matter involves a sentence of death,any doubts as to whether a coa should be issued must be resolved in hall favor.smith,at quoting hernandez,at internal alterations omitted.
hall raises several distinct claims in his current application for a coa.first,hall believes that a coa should issue to determine whether the district court erred in denying five of the specific substantive claims in his motion.second,hall claims a coa should issue to address whether the district court erred by limiting the june,evidentiary hearing solely to his extraneous influence upon the jury claims.third,hall claims that a coa should issue to address whether the district court erred in denying all discovery.fourth,hall claims that a coa should issue to determine whether the district court erred in denying him reasonable additional funds to develop further evidence.finally,hall claims that this court should assign a new judge if it decides that a remand is necessary.the government has provided substantive and direct responses to all of the claims discussed above 
the remainder of this opinion will discuss the claims in hall application for a coa,and the government substantive response to these claims,in greater detail.because both hall and the government devote most of their attention to hall five general merits his ineffective assistance of counsel will be addressed first,together with related procedural claims.
hall substantive claims 
in his current application for a coa,hall reiterates five of the substantive claims from his motion his ineffective assistance of counsel claim,his extraneous influence on the jury claim,his incomplete indictment claim,his prosecutorial misconduct claim,and his selective prosecution claim.related to these five claims is his procedural claim that the district court erred in limiting the evidentiary hearing to the extraneous influence on the jury claim.of the five substantive claims,the ineffective assistance of counsel claim is the most important to his current application in his brief before this court,hall acknowledges that the centerpiece of this case is the iac ineffective assistance of counsel claim.therefore,the ineffective assistance of counsel claim will be considered first,and the sentencing component of this claim will be considered most extensively.
hall ineffective assistance of counsel claim 
in the proceedings before the district court,hall claimed that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective on twelve separate grounds,all of which are substantially reiterated in his current application for a coa after separately and extensively considering each of hall arguments,the district court concluded that hall received constitutionally effective assistance of counsel at his trial because his attorneys conducted reasonable investigations in all areas of the case vigorously government witnesses ably argued all objections and points of law and eloquently defended their client in their closing statements.the government now argues that the record demonstrates that the district court conducted an exhaustive review of each of hall claims,and properly denied relief.no coa should issue because no court would resolve hall issues in a different manner.hall believes that each of his twelve grounds was sufficient to support his ineffective assistance of counsel claim,and in his current application for a coa,he argues that reasonable jurists could debate the district court decision on each of these twelve grounds.
to establish ineffective assistance of counsel,hall must satisfy a test and show both that his counsel performance was deficient and that he was actually prejudiced by the deficient performance.strickland washington,d stating that an ineffective assistance of counsel claim has two components and requiring convicted defendants to show both that counsel performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.we determine whether counsel performance was deficient by examining whether the challenged representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.cotton cockrell,cir citing kitchens johnson,cir.crucially,a fair assessment of counsel challenged conduct requires reviewing courts to make every effort to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight and to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel challenged conduct,and to evaluate the conduct from counsel perspective at the time.strickland,at.when it has been shown that counsel made an adequate investigation,we have held that any strategic decisions made as a result of that investigation fall within the wide range of objectively reasonable professional assistance.cotton,at quoting smith cockrell,cir.of course,even if hall could establish that his counsel performance was deficient,satisfying the first step of the strickland test,he would also have to establish that the prejudice caused by the deficiency is such that there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceedings would have been different,thereby rendering the trial fundamentally unfair or unreliable.cotton,at quoting ransom johnson,cir.but because,as will be discussed immediately below,no reasonable jurist could debate the district court conclusion that hall counsel provided reasonable,vigorous,and thorough assistance at hall trial and sentencing,we need not address this second step of the strickland test,and so we will not consider whether the errors hall alleges could have prejudiced his defense.
hall mitigation arguments 
the acknowledged centerpiece of hall current application for a coa is his argument that his trial counsel failed to present various mitigation evidence and arguments at hall sentencing because they failed to conduct an objectively reasonable investigation into hall family background.we observed,when considering hall direct appeal,that 
i n support of his claim that he experienced an upbringing that militated against the imposition of the death penalty,hall offered only the testimony of two of his family members additionally,this testimony indicated that hall was not himself the object of his father abuse and that,throughout his childhood,hall attended school and church and was properly housed,fed,and clothed.
hall,at.hall now argues that his upbringing was somewhat more difficult than we recognized on direct appeal.more specifically,hall now argues that he was beaten with belts and switches by both of his parents,but particularly his father,as a form of discipline,and he argues that this discipline constituted abuse.he also argues that his trial counsel failed to present evidence of this alleged abuse because they failed to adequately investigate his background before sentencing,and he concludes that his trial counsel failure to present evidence of this abuse substantially prejudiced his defense at sentencing,constituting ineffective assistance of counsel.in support of this argument,hall submitted several highly detailed declarations from family members and assorted experts along with his second amended motion.
although we did not consider some of the allegations presented in these declarations during hall direct appeal,we did consider the significant evidence,presented by hall trial counsel to the jury,which demonstrated that hall upbringing was marked by violence.as we stated in hall direct appeal,his trial counsel presented uncontroverted evidence that his mother was repeatedly beaten by his father throughout his childhood see hall,at noting the uncontroverted testimony that hall father beat hall mother throughout their marriage.moreover,we observe that in reviewing hall argument,our principal concern is not whether counsel should have presented a mitigation case of the sort hall envisions.wiggins smith,d citing strickland,at.rather,we focus on whether the investigation supporting counsel decision not to introduce mitigating evidence of hall background was itself reasonable.id.
to support his current argument that his trial counsel investigation was objectively unreasonable and therefore deficient,hall has presented declarations from various experts purporting to show that his trial counsel fell short of professional norms requiring a and thorough inquiry into his family,medical,and social history.hall believes that these expert declarations demonstrate that his trial counsel failed to conduct sufficiently extensive interviews with his family members about his alleged childhood abuse.at the very least,he argues that these declarations have created a fact question on this issue because they conflict with affidavits given by his trial counsel and submitted by the government defending the sufficiency of the mitigation investigation.
even if these expert declarations are assumed to be true,no reasonable jurist could debate the district court conclusion that the mitigation investigation of hall counsel was objectively reasonable.to begin,hall trial counsel spoke with hall and presented him with a lengthy questionnaire.from the questionnaire and their initial conversations,hall trial counsel learned that hall felt that he had a reasonably happy and peaceful childhood,although hall also indicated that he had been whipped when he was bad.hall trial counsel also made use of a private investigator to help evaluate and investigate hall background.hall trial counsel also interviewed hall mother and sister cassandra,who told him that hall father had extremely violent tendencies.based on these interviews,hall trial counsel decided to call both women to testify.hall trial counsel also employed the services of a mitigation specialist named tena francis francis,who has since submitted multiple declarations castigating hall trial counsel for,inter alia,failing to employ her earlier and failing to adopt all of her tactical litigation suggestions.notwithstanding her subsequent critical declarations,francis interviewed additional family members and a minister familiar with hall childhood and background while she was employed by hall trial counsel,and she sent summaries of these interviews to hall trial counsel before sentencing 
although hall experts have attacked some of the strategic and tactical litigation decisions made by hall trial counsel,they have not raised serious fact questions about the reasonableness of the investigation upon which those litigation decisions were made.the crux of hall current argument is that hall trial counsel conducted an insufficient investigation either because counsel was unaware that hall had been physically abused as a child or because counsel was unaware that the violent discipline inflicted upon hall constituted abuse the government has provided affidavits from hall trial counsel which contradict these points but more importantly,this core of hall argument is also clearly and directly contradicted by the declarations that he has presented and upon which he now relies.in both her declaration given on june,and her declaration given on march,after she reviewed one of hall counsel affidavits,francis repeatedly stated that hall trial counsel was informed,by me francis that the hall children had been subjected to serious domestic violence in the family throughout their childhoods,and she also repeatedly acknowledged that hall trial counsel subsequently and repeatedly tried to discuss this issue with hall mother,but that her hall mother answers lacked the kind of details i francis had noted in my reports.therefore,even if the declarations presented by hall are assumed to be true,hall central argument lacks support.contrary to the conclusory allegations found in hall application for a coa and miller declaration,it is clear that hall trial counsel was aware that hall had been subjected to physical discipline as a child hall trial counsel was aware of expert opinions that this discipline constituted abuse hall trial counsel personally conducted further investigation and also directed francis to conduct further investigation into this issue and finally,hall trial counsel attempted,albeit unsuccessfully,to elicit testimony about this issue from the family witnesses who were reasonably chosen to testify at hall sentencing.
in light of hall counsel considerable prior experience and thorough efforts to investigate the potential mitigation case that hall now describes,no reasonable jurist could debate the district court conclusion that hall counsel performed a reasonably substantial and independent investigation into potential mitigating circumstances and therefore did not provide ineffective assistance of counsel.therefore,hall is not entitled to a coa on this issue.moreover,because this conclusion is supported not only by the subsequent affidavits submitted by the government but also by the very declarations upon which hall now relies,no reasonable jurist could debate the district court conclusion that the declarations submitted by hall have failed to create any contested fact issues.accordingly,because hall expert declarations have failed to create a contested fact issue about the objective reasonableness of his trial counsel mitigation investigation,no reasonable jurist could debate the district court decision not to provide an evidentiary hearing to address this issue.as a result,hall is not entitled to a coa based on the district court limitation on the evidentiary hearing.
contrary to the arguments advanced in hall reply brief,our recent decision in smith dretke,at,does not directly control this application for a coa.in smith,we granted an application for a coa based in part on our holding that reasonable jurists could debate whether the mitigation investigation that supported trial counsel strategy at sentencing was reasonable and adequate.at.in his reply brief,hall argues that our opinion in smith illustrates why hall application also merits a coa.but whatever superficial similarities hall application may bear to the application we considered in smith,several critical distinctions prevent the direct application of smith holding to this matter.unlike hall trial counsel,the trial counsel in smith could not remember specific details about their background investigation,such as exactly who they contacted or what was learned from the individuals they contacted,and the record in smith tended to support the conclusion that trial counsel only contacted those individuals who actually testified at trial,whereas the record in this matter indicates that hall trial counsel conducted a much broader investigation.id.at.moreover,unlike hall trial counsel,the trial in smith provided substantive statements about the defendant background which were directly contrary to the actual testimony presented at sentencing id.at.based on these and other shortcomings without parallel in the matter at hand,we held in smith that reasonable jurists could debate whether trial counsel conducted a reasonable investigation.id.but because these concerns are not raised by hall application for a coa,smith does not control this application for a coa.
hall additional ineffective assistance of counsel arguments 
in addition to the mitigation arguments discussed above,hall has provided six additional specific ineffective assistance of counsel arguments which he believes merit a coa.first,hall argues that his trial counsel failed to adequately prepare for and larry nichols,a former cellmate of hall.second,hall argues that his trial counsel failed to obtain an opportunity for allocution for hall.third,hall argues that his trial counsel failed to effectively argue several motions for a continuance.fourth,hall argues that his trial counsel failed to effectively conduct voir dire.fifth,hall argues that his trial counsel failed to present an effective closing argument.sixth,hall argues that his trial counsel failed to present adequate evidence of hall good conduct during his past incarceration.the district court reviewed all of these claims individually and in detail before denying hall ineffective assistance of counsel claim,and no reasonable jurist could debate the district court conclusions.these arguments each essentially come down to a matter of degrees,and we have held in the past that these sorts of questions are even less susceptible to judicial than most ineffective assistance of counsel arguments.kitchens,at see also dowthitt johnson,cir citing kitchens and strickland,and stating the need to be particularly wary of arguments that the performance of trial counsel by a matter of degrees.because hall has offered little more than his displeasure with the outcome of his trial and sentencing hearing to support these arguments,no reasonable jurist could debate the district court decision to deny him relief on these grounds,and no reasonable jurist could debate the district court refusal to consider these grounds during its evidentiary hearing.therefore,hall is not entitled to a coa on these substantive issues,and he is not entitled to a coa based on the district court decision to limit the evidentiary hearing.
hall also claims that he is entitled to a coa on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim because of the cumulative effect of the various errors he alleges.our clear precedent indicates that ineffective assistance of counsel can not be created from the accumulation of acceptable decisions and actions.see miller johnson,cir stating that in the absence of specific demonstrated error,a defendant can not,by definition,show that cumulative error of counsel deprived him of a fair trial yohey collins,cir stating that because certain alleged errors did not rise to constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel,and because certain other claims were meritless,a petitioner had presented nothing to cumulate.accordingly,no reasonable jurist could debate the district court conclusion that the cumulative effect of the alleged errors did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel,and hall is not entitled to a coa on this issue.
hall extraneous influence on the jury claim 
hall extraneous influence on the jury claim is based on two incidents that allegedly occurred during the trial.first,hall alleges that juror jacqueline holmes holmes had contact during hall trial with hall victim mother.this first allegation is based on letters allegedly written by holmes to hall in prison after the conclusion of hall trial.second,hall alleges that at least one may or may not have been an event at which prayers were offered for hall victim.
as discussed above,the district court conducted an evidentiary hearing to resolve this claim on june,and at this hearing,holmes testified under oath.with respect to hall first allegation,holmes admitted that she had written letters to hall after the trial.she also admitted that in these letters she stated that she had met hall victim mother during the course of the trial.at the evidentiary hearing,however,holmes maintained that these letters to hall were not true she testified that she had never met the victim mother,and she claimed that she had lied in her letters in order to encourage hall correspondence with her.with respect to hall second allegation,holmes testified that she had not attended any prayer ceremony of the sort described by hall,nor was she aware of any other juror who had done so.id.
with respect to hall first allegation,the district court found holmes testimony during the evidentiary hearing to be credible,and therefore ruled that hall has not established that any inappropriate ex parte contact occurred.with respect to hall second allegation,the district court stated that even 
a ssuming that this allegation is indeed true,and a juror attended a prayer ceremony,it is not evidence that there was any outside influence on the jury.instead hall offers merely speculation that there may have possibly been some unknown person at the prayer ceremony who said something to the juror that influenced her vote.mere speculation that some discussion between a juror and an unknown person occurred does not establish that extrinsic evidence entered the jury deliberations,especially where jacqueline holmes sworn testimony is that she does not recall any juror discussing a prayer ceremony,much less any prayer offered on behalf of the victim during the jury deliberations.
in his current application,hall argues that he is entitled to a coa on this extraneous influence on the jury claim because reasonable jurists could debate the district court conclusion and with the limitations the district court imposed on the evidentiary hearing it held on this issue but by holding the evidentiary hearing,the court provided hall with sufficient opportunity to investigate his first allegation about holmes conduct,and it found holmes direct testimony credible.no reasonable jurist could find fault with either the district court method or conclusion,particularly in light of the limitations on a juror testimony on any individual juror deliberations or the jury collective deliberations.see,united states ruggiero,cir reviewing the limitations on subsequent testimony about juror deliberations set forth by this court precedent and federal rule of evidence b.with respect to hall second allegation,no reasonable jurist could debate the district court conclusion that hall has merely offered speculative and conclusory allegations that are insufficient to raise a constitutional issue.united states pineda,cir quoting united states woods,cir.
hall incomplete indictment claim 
in his second amended motion,hall claimed that the original indictment against him violated his fifth amendment rights because it did not allege the aggravating circumstances and the culpable mental state that made him eligible for the death penalty.the district court denied this claim for relief,after applying our recent precedent and the recent precedent of the supreme court.see dist.op.at citing,inter alia,schriro summerlin,d,united states robinson,cir,united states matthews,cir,and united states brown,cir.in his current application for a coa,hall acknowledges the contrary precedent of this court and the supreme court cited by the district that we must follow.because hall concedes in a footnote that he has included this claim in his current application in order to preserve this issue for further review,we will not consider this claim any further.
hall prosecutorial misconduct claim 
hall prosecutorial misconduct claim revolves around larry nichols nichols,one of hall fellow inmates who provided testimony against hall during the sentencing phase of hall trial.more specifically,hall now claims that the government concealed nichols full criminal history from hall,violated hall sixth amendment rights by deliberately using nichols to elicit information from hall outside the presence of hall counsel,and encouraged or tolerated perjury by nichols.
in denying hall motion,the district court held that these claims of prosecutorial misconduct lacked factual support.the district court found,based on a review of the trial record and an affidavit from hall trial counsel,that the government did not withhold any information about nichols prior cri
