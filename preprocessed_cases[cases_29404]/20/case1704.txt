in july,petitioner filed a motion for relief from judgment with the muskegon county circuit court raising three constitutional issues whether his jury waiver was knowing and intelligent whether the waiver of probate juvenile court jurisdiction was valid and whether he had received ineffective assistance of counsel.the circuit court at first summarily denied the motion,but the michigan court of appeals directed the circuit court to hold an evidentiary hearing to collect further evidence on all three issues.an evidentiary hearing was held in april.the circuit court heard testimony on all the issues and again denied relief.the michigan court of appeals affirmed.people spytma,wl.may.the michigan supreme court denied the application for leave to file an appeal.

statute of limitations 
the state claims that petitioner habeas petition is barred by the statute of limitations under d the state arrives at this position by arguing that the time during which petitioner claims were pending in state court counts against the time limitation for bringing a habeas petition.in other words,the state contends that there is no tolling of the period during the time between a lower state court decision and the filing of a notice of appeal to a higher state court on collateral review of a petitioner claims.
the state acknowledges that the statute of limitations is tolled when a properly filed application for state or other collateral review is pending.d.however,the state goes on to argue that the moment a state court rules on an application for collateral review,it is no longer pending and the statute of limitations is not tolled during the intervals between state court proceedings.specifically,the state maintains in this case that the statute was not tolled from may,when the michigan court of appeals affirmed the trial court decision to deny petitioner motion for relief from judgment,to june,the date on which petitioner properly and timely filed a delayed application for leave to file with the michigan supreme court.the state argues that when that period is combined with the period between april,the date on which the michigan supreme court denied leave to appeal,and april,the date on which petitioner filed his petition for habeas corpus,the petitioner petition violates the statute of limitations in d.
the statutory language of is ambiguous as to whether the limitations period should be tolled during the time between a lower state court decision and the filing of a notice of appeal to a higher state court on collateral review of a petitioner claims.the supreme court,however,recently clarified this issue,holding,as had every circuit court that had addressed the issue,that a petitioner claim is pending for the entire term of state court review,including those intervals between one state court judgment and the filing of an appeal with a higher state court.carey saffold,d.accord abela martin,cir.because petitioner timely filed his application and appeals on collateral review in the state courts,he falls within the statute of limitations under d.
waiver of juvenile court jurisdiction 
in december,michigan law required that the probate court,which served as the juvenile court in michigan at the time,hold a hearing to decide whether a juvenile defendant should be tried as an adult.petitioner claims that the waiver of jurisdiction by the probate court violated his constitutional due process rights because the probate court neglected to make sufficient factual findings as required by state law.
in kent united states,d,the supreme court recognized that a hearing to determine whether a juvenile should be tried as an adult was a critically important stage and therefore the proceedings must measure up to the essentials of due process and fair treatment.id.at.the court went on to state,however,that it did not mean by this to indicate that the hearing to be held must conform with all the requirements of a criminal trial or even of the usual administrative hearing and the court has never tried to prescribe criteria for,or the nature and quantum of,evidence that must support a decision to transfer a juvenile to adult court.id.so while the court made it clear that juveniles are entitled to some minimal level of procedural safeguards,such as legal representation and development of a reviewable record,the court did not specify the exact nature of the constitutional requirements of due process at a juvenile transfer hearing.oviedo jago,cir.
at the time of petitioner arrest,michigan had procedures in place to follow when conducting a juvenile transfer hearing.see juvenile court rules of,rules people white,jackson people.rule set out a process whereby the court first determined whether there was probable cause to believe that the child committed a felony offense,and then went on 
to determine whether or not the interests of the child and the public would be best served by granting a waiver of jurisdiction to the criminal adult court.in making the determination,the court shall consider the following criteria 
a the prior record and character of the child,his physical and mental maturity and his pattern of living 
b the seriousness of the offense 
c whether the offense,even if less serious,is part of a repetitive pattern of offenses which would lead to a determination that the child may be beyond rehabilitation under existing juvenile programs
