on the morning of november,annmarie kotowski kotowski was found in her apartment severely beaten and covered in blood.she survived,but could not remember the details surrounding the attack or the person who attacked her.after an investigation,police identified michael as the perpetrator.
a massachusetts superior court jury subsequently convicted of the following counts burglary and armed assault in a dwelling armed assault in a dwelling armed assault with intent to murder and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon.the superior court then sentenced to years on counts one and two years on count and years on count,ruling that the sentences were to be served concurrently.the intermediate massachusetts appeals court reversed the judgments holding that there was insufficient evidence to support the verdicts.commonwealth,hereinafter i.the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc reinstated the judgment reasoning that there was sufficient evidence to support the verdicts.commonwealth,hereinafter ii.
filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts on grounds that the sjc ruling was objectively unreasonable because there was insufficient evidence to support a guilty verdict and that the sjc violated his constitutional right to present a defense.the district court denied petition for habeas relief.after careful consideration,we reverse the judgment of the district court and order the district court to grant the petition.
background 
factual summary 
we must accept the state court findings of fact unless convinces us,by clear and convincing evidence,that they are in error.lynch ficco,cir quoting mccambridge hall,cir en banc see also e.we note that the sjc findings of fact may be supplemented with other facts from the record that are consistent with the sjc findings.lynch,at see also healy spencer,cir.thus,we recount the facts largely as they were presented in the sjc opinion.
in may,kotowski revealed to david kotowski kotowski,her husband of over years,that she was romantically involved with james finn.in september,kotowski moved out of her home into the fox hollow condominium complex in a neighboring town she resided alone,a member of fox hollow maintenance staff,lived two doors down from kotowski.like other members of the maintenance staff,he possessed a master key to all the buildings on the property,including a key to kotowski apartment 
the sjc noted that took some interest in kotowski prior to the attack.for example,when kotowski sister was visiting,stood outside her apartment and asked kotowski if there were any more good looking women in there.also,he referred to kotowski five or six times in conversations with acquaintances,citing her beautiful antique furniture in her apartment as evidence of her wealth and remarking that he was attracted to her body type.
the day before the attack,cashed a paycheck and made child support payment to his.also,the sjc stated that was agitated when he was unable to sell his trailer to his neighbor because the neighbor could not come up with.the neighbor paid him the next day.
on the night of the attack,the sjc described as n ervous,jittery,and paranoid this was typical behavior when he smoked crack cocaine,which had done earlier that evening at the home of a friend,mark puleri.
as the night wore on,was depleted of drugs and most of his cash.at or that evening,now at home alone,telephoned another friend,grover finkle,asking him for a ride to purchase drugs.finkle,who was at richard house,had previously smoked crack cocaine with and knew a drug dealer.finkle and,a taxicab driver,arrived at apartment an hour later.however,they soon left without giving a ride because was unable to secure money for cab fare 
in the early morning hours of november,between and,fourteen telephone calls were placed to or from apartment.the majority of these calls were placed to known drug dealers.
shortly before george whittemore,a neighbor living directly above kotowski,awakened to a woman screaming directly below and the sound of wood hitting wood.according to whittemore,a carpenter by profession,these sounds lasted for about thirty seconds.
whittemore dialed at.he stayed awake until the police arrived and flashed his apartment lights to indicate his apartment to the police.between the time he called and when the police arrived,whittemore did not hear any vehicles arrive or depart from the area.the police later conducted a reenactment of the call.based on this reenactment,they concluded that a person standing in kotowski bedroom could have heard whittemore footsteps as he walked to the telephone as well as whittemore voice,but would have been unable to make out what was being said.
officers william tierney and phillip skowron arrived six or seven minutes after whittemore call.they were unable to find apartment number,the apartment reported in the dispatch,because the apartment numbers at the complex had been recently renumbered.they did not note anything unusual,but observed walking from the building on a walkway leading from apartment number.was wearing only boxer shorts and officer tierney testified that appeared impervious to the temperature.
questioned the officers regarding what had happened and the officers answered that they were responding to a report of a woman screaming.when they asked him if he had heard any screaming,replied that he had been awakened by screaming,but believed it to be a raccoon trapped in a dumpster explained that he had placed a stick in the dumpster so that it could escape.officer tierney then looked inside the dumpster and saw a stick,but no animal.the sjc noted that during his conversation with the officers,seemed uneasy and distant,not making eye contact with them.the police further searched the area,but left after finding nothing suspicious.
whittemore testified that throughout the night he heard a woman moaning and crying directly below him he also testified that later in the morning,he heard the sound of glass breaking,banging,and a man outside kotowski apartment calling her name.the man subsequently yelled oh,my god.
the man whittemore was referring to was kotowski boyfriend,finn,who had arrived at at kotowski apartment.on weekdays,finn routinely joined kotowski for a morning coffee prior to starting his workday.on this particular morning,when finn knocked on the door,he only heard her say,who is it in a strange voice.after failing to reach her from a nearby public telephone,finn testified that he forced open a locked sliding glass rear door.although the living room appeared to be in order,he found kotowski lying on the floor next to the bed.he testified that there was just blood everywhere.finn dialed just before kotowski,who had severe wounds on her head,was taken to berkshire medical center.the police ruled out finn as a suspect because of his alibi which they confirmed,his reaction of shock upon discovering kotowski,and his cooperation with the police.
officers who arrived after finn call observed blood in the victim bedroom on the bed,the pillow,the floors,the walls,and on the door jambs of the bathroom and bedroom.the sjc noted that the crime scene contained quite a bit of blood that appeared to be splatters on the comforter.further,the bed rail was dented,with wood splinters on the ground beneath the dent.officer skowron testified that everything else was intact as the apartment was neat and nothing was displaced.kotowski purse was on the floor,however.officer skowron also testified that there were no signs that the front door or the rear sliding door had been forced open which contradicted a report by an earlier officer on the scene stating that the rear door was broken that the drawers were closed and that the light and figurines on the dresser were upright.kotowski testified that no items of value were missing from the apartment.these items,which were in plain view on top of the dresser,included diamonds,pearls,and an expensive watch in the bedroom.also,kotowski purse contained her credit cards,about in cash,and a checkbook.there was in cash in a dresser drawer.
constance cappel,a neighbor who lived in the apartment between and kotowski,testified that she heard voices outside kotowski apartment at about cappel went outside and saw kotowski being loaded into an ambulance.she knocked on door and told him that she thought someone had been murdered,who answered the door in his boxer shorts and looked like he had just awoken,responded what do you want me to do about it 
at came out of his apartment dressed for work,approached one of his and cappel,and inquired about what was happening.after his explained the situation,described his encounter with the police the previous night and how he had been awakened by the police cruisers.also informed his that he told the police that he thought raccoons had been in the dumpster making a kind of squealing sound.
at about,officers tierney and todd briggs talked with outside the apartment building and officer tierney noticed a scratch or a dig mark in left cheek,a small cut on his chin and a round,circular bruise just below his left ear.officer tierney was unsure about how fresh these marks were.
the sjc remarked that although was initially reluctant,he agreed to give a statement at the police station when informed that officer tierney would conduct the interview.arrived at the station at,but was told by chief ronald glidden to wait for officer tierney,who had yet to arrive.officer tierney arrived twenty minutes later and told that he would be right with him.however,when he returned five minutes later,had left 
returned to the police station twenty minutes later and was interviewed by chief glidden for about ten minutes.chief glidden testified that seemed agitated during the interview.in his statement to chief glidden,stated that he had been drinking before he went to bed and he just did think he was awake until he heard the cruisers at approximately two.he thought he may have heard foxes or raccoons before that,but was uncertain.said that he had seen the victim around,that he and a friend had joked about her boyfriend and that he had been in that apartment to repair a window.after the interview concluded,he went home.
state troopers david buell and brian berkel arrived at the complex around noon.trooper buell spoke to,who stated that he had been out with his friend,puleri,the previous night,returned at,went to sleep around,and was awakened by screaming,which he thought was a fox fighting with a raccoon.said that a short time later the police arrived and he went out to speak with them.after the officers left,he slept until,when he was awakened by his neighbor,who had informed him that there had been a murder.
trooper buell asked for consent to search his apartment in order to eliminate him as a suspect and because his apartment was in close proximity to kotowski apartment.consented,and allowed trooper berkel to take photographs and two police chemists to search for blood stains.trooper berkel photographed a red stain on a closet door near the kitchen area.a chemist who saw the stain asked if his consent included taking swabbings.responded that it did not.soon thereafter,asked the officers to leave his apartment.
outside the apartment,the police decided to apply for a search warrant.they returned to apartment and informed him of their intent to secure the apartment and obtain a warrant.replied that they did not need to pursue a warrant because he would allow them back into the apartment.he also told the officers that he had wiped the red stain off the closet door with his finger,and thought it was his own blood,but was not certain.told the police that he was concerned about a search because he was afraid police would find his drug paraphernalia and because he possessed money that he did not want taken.trooper buell asked to give him the drug paraphernalia,telling him that he would not be charged with drug possession.
when the chemists returned to the apartment,the red stain on the closet door was gone.however,the area,where the stain had been,tested positive for the presumptive presence of blood.the chemists collected a sample by swabbing 
a state trooper searched the area surrounding the apartment complex with a dog trained to search by scent.the dog found an aluminum bat about yards away from a building dumpster in the woods.it appeared to be covered in leaves and debris,but was otherwise clean.name was inscribed on the bat.
on november,called a friend and informed him that he was a suspect in the assault.the sjc noted that was upset while he told his friend that he was very happy that kotowski had survived s o that she could identify her assailant,but with his bad luck the assailant could have been wearing a nixon mask and entered with a baseball bat.
later that day was arrested.while in custody,told an inmate that although he owned the bat,he last saw it when he moved into his apartment 
the police recovered fourteen fingerprints and one palm print from kotowski apartment,none of which matched those of in addition,footprint impressions taken at the apartment did not match boots.state police lieutenant brian,trained in fingerprint analysis and bloodstain patterns,opined that a blood stain on kotowski pillow was caused by the transfer of blood from a person right hand,but the handprint was unidentifiable.he testified that the hand had to have had a significant amount of blood on it,not all of which would have been transferred.
a state police chemist examined the aluminum bat found in the woods.three small reddish brown stains on the bat tested positive for the presumptive presence of blood,only one of which tested positive for human blood.the three stains were swabbed and sent to the dna unit for further testing.there was contamination in the dna lab,and thus the tests consumed all the testable material without yielding results.an additional cutting from tape on the bat handle,an area where the presumptive presence of blood could still be detected,was submitted to the laboratory.a state police dna analyst concluded that while kotowski could not be excluded as a contributor,one in two of any randomly selected individuals could have been the contributor 
a surgeon who performed reconstructive surgeries on kotowski after the attack testified that she had sustained between fifteen to twenty blows that broke nearly every bone in her face and skull.the only exception was her jaw.she also had defensive wounds on her hands caused by five to ten blows.the surgeon gave an opinion that kotowski injuries were caused by a long,sturdy,hard,round object,consistent with an aluminum bat that was recovered in the woods on the day of the attack.
procedural history 
in december,a berkshire county grand jury charged with four offenses burglary and armed assault in a dwelling,see.laws ch,armed assault in a dwelling,see.laws ch,armed assault with intent to murder,see.laws ch,b and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon,see.laws ch,b.
following a jury trial in may,was convicted of all four charges.appealed.
the massachusetts appeals court opinion 
on appeal,the massachusetts appeals court concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury verdicts.the appeals court stated that while the government evidence demonstrated that had a motive of robbery,an opportunity to commit the crime,a means to commit the crime,and a consciousness of guilt,the evidence was not enough to establish guilt.the appeals court concluded that n othing in the record sufficiently links the defendant to the crime to permit the conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that he was the perpetrator and that p iling inference upon inference does not amount to proof beyond a reasonable doubt.i,at.in reaching its conclusion,the appeals court noted that the bat was only consistent with the weapon used in the attack that lies to the police concerning his whereabouts and his removal of the stain from his closet door,while certainly permissible to show a guilty conscience,can not fill the gap in the proof of identity that did not show physical strain in his appearance and demeanor when confronted by the police just about twelve minutes after the attack,which would have been consistent with someone who had just committed such a brutal attack and that the culprit evidence in this case detracted from the government case.id.at.thus,the appeals court reversed convictions and directed that judgments be entered in his favor.
the sjc opinion 
the commonwealth then sought and received further appellate review from the sjc.the sjc concluded that the evidence against had been sufficient and affirmed his convictions,stating that circumstantial evidence of motive,opportunity,means,and consciousness of guilt permissibly convinced the jury of the defendant guilt.ii,at.
the sjc stated that the jury could permissibly find that motive to break into kotowski apartment was robbery.id.it pointed to the fact that had taken drugs twice previously on the night of november,had run out of drugs and money,and was calling around as late as to purchase drugs,which the sjc noted was only twelve minutes before the victims upstairs neighbor telephoned the police department to report screams and banging sounds from downstairs.id.
the sjc further noted that had previously entered the victim apartment and had reason to believe that she was wealthy and might have cash or valuables.id.the sjc commented that needed money immediately and the victim was a nearby and likely source.id.accounting for the fact that nothing was taken from the apartment,the sjc pointed to a reenactment during trial demonstrating that the neighbor could be heard in the apartment below when he called the police.the sjc concluded that i t is a reasonable inference that the defendant was frightened off before he could steal anything when he heard the neighbor speaking.id.at.
the sjc also concluded that had the opportunity to commit the crime because he resided only two apartment doors away from kotowski and that he had a master key which gave him access to her apartment.id.at.in addition,the sjc pointed to whittemore testimony that he did not hear any cars going to or from the apartment complex in the interval between when he first heard the screaming and when the police arrived.id.
the sjc also reasoned that had the means to commit the crime by stating that the aluminum bat was found a short distance from kotowski apartment complex.id.the sjc stated that t he jury would certainly be warranted in concluding that the bat was the defendant.id.the sjc explained that h is surname,not a common one,was visible on the bat handle and he mentioned to someone in jail that he was the owner of the bat the police had found.id.the sjc further noted,however,that although the bat was covered by some leaves and debris,it was otherwise clean when discovered.id.it also acknowledged statement that he had not seen the bat since the day he had moved into his apartment.id.at.
most notably,the sjc indicated the significant evidence pointing to consciousness of guilt.id.at.first,the sjc referenced demeanor when the police first arrived on the scene and discovered outside in his boxer shorts in near freezing temperature.id.the sjc noted that when he talked with the police,he was uneasy and distant and did not make eye contact with the police officers.id.also,the sjc remarked that the differing versions gave to police as to the reason he woke up was indicative of his untruthfulness id.at.the sjc further noted that reluctantly participated in an interview with the police and seemed agitated when he spoke with them.id.at.
moreover,the sjc pointed to reaction to the police request when they asked for a swabbing of the red stain in the closet door of his apartment.id.although later allowed the police to return,the stain was gone and admitted to having removed it with his finger,saying that he believed that it was his own blood.the sjc concluded that t his evidence reflected not merely a general consciousness of guilt,but indicated that the defendant feared that the blood stain could be that of the victim,a fear he would have only if he were in fact the perpetrator.id.
finally,the sjc pointed to the fact that had a scratch or dig mark on his cheek,a small cut on his chin and a bruise on his neck.id.while acknowledging that the police officer could not discern whether the marks were fresh,the sjc concluded that it could be inferred that the injuries were sustained during a physical encounter with the victim.id.
in sum,the sjc stated that the evidence taken together was sufficient to permit the jury to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the perpetrator of the vicious attack on the victim.id.
in reversing the lower appellate court decision,the sjc distinguished its case law in commonwealth mazza,stating that in the instant case the prosecution presented more evidence linking to the assault.ii,at.furthermore,the instant case contained evidence of means as represented by the aluminum bat,significantly stronger evidence of consciousness of guilt,bruises on face,and the fact that was wearing only boxers when the police found him,which would be consistent with his having disposed of bloody outer garments.id.with respect to attire,the sjc added that t he jury could find that,had the defendant gone outside to check for animals in the dumpster as he claimed,it was implausible that he would have done so without putting on at least minimal clothing,not only for purposes of protection against the cold but also for purposes of decency.id.
the sjc disagreed with the weight placed by the appeals court on the fact that did not manifest any signs of recent physical exertion sweat,shortness of breath,wet hair or disarray twelve minutes after the attack.id.at.the sjc stated that this did not detract from the government case because twelve minutes after the attack there would be no reason for to show signs of this physical exertion.id.
also,the sjc disagreed with the appeals court that the culprit evidence presented in this case detracted from the government argument or affected the sufficiency of the evidence because it was not so overwhelming that no rational jury could conclude that the defendant was guilty.id.at.the sjc stated that the culprit evidence simply tended to contradict the commonwealth evidence it did not show it to be incredible or conclusively incorrect.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
habeas petition 
in his habeas petition before the district court,alleged that the evidence at trial was insufficient to prove that he was a perpetrator of the offenses for which he was convicted and the trial court violated his right to present a defense by excluding a handwritten note that,according to,supported his culprit defense.after briefing by the parties and a hearing,the district court denied petition reasoning that like the courts that have looked at this cold record before me,this is a close question.but the petition must be under federal law denied.
then filed a timely notice of appeal and requested a certificate of appealability coa as to his sufficiency and a defense claims.the district court granted a coa with respect to both issues.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court decision to grant or deny a habeas petition under.healy,at.under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat,a federal court shall not grant a petition for habeas relief with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.a state court findings on factual issues shall be presumed to be correct and the petitioner bears the burden of disproving factual findings by clear and convincing evidence.mccambridge,at quoting e.
sufficiency claims are generally evaluated under d and we look to whether the state court decision constitutes an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court case law.hurtado tucker,cir quoting williams matesanz,cir.
t he unreasonable application of prong of d reduces to a question of whether the state court derivation of a rule from the supreme court generally relevant jurisprudence appears objectively reasonable.id.at quoting matesanz,at.
habeas review involves the layering of two standards.the habeas question of whether the state court decision is objectively unreasonable is layered on top of the underlying standard governing the constitutional right asserted.id.
the constitutional right asserted in sufficiency of the evidence claims is set forth by the supreme court decision in jackson virginia,d.under jackson,due process requires that no person shall be made to suffer the onus of a criminal conviction except upon sufficient as evidence necessary to convince a trier of fact beyond a reasonable doubt of the existence of every element of the offense.id.at.more succinctly,the relevant test we take from jackson is whether,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.emphasis in original.
thus,for our purposes,we must decide whether the sjc application of jackson to case was objectively unreasonable.although t he term unreasonable is no doubt difficult to define,hurtado,at quoting williams taylor,d,we have explained that some increment of incorrectness beyond error is required.mccambridge,at quoting francis stone,cir.the increment need not necessarily be great,but it must be great enough to make the decision unreasonable in the independent and objective judgment of the federal court.id to be sure,the gap between erroneous state court decisions and unreasonable ones is narrow,evans thompson,cir,and it will be the rare case that will fall into this gap,id.citing williams,at.however,for an erroneous decision to be unreasonable,judicial incompetence is not necessary and a case will fall into this narrow gap precluding relief only when it is a close question whether the state decision is in error.id.at quoting mccambridge,at emphasis in original.it is enough if the supreme court general principles can be discerned and if,respectfully but with confidence,the federal court concludes that the state court unreasonably applied federal law.id.quoting white,at.
further,in our inquiry of objective unreasonableness the question is not how well reasoned the state court decision is,but whether the outcome is reasonable.hurtado,at.we note that just because an opinion is poorly reasoned does not mean that the outcome represents an unreasonable application,although it is certainly ground for further inquiry if the state court ignores material facts.id.internal citation omitted.it is not necessary that the federal court agree with every last detail of the state court analysis.by like token,state courts are not required to supply the specific reasons that a federal court thinks are most persuasive for upholding the judgment.healy,at cir quoting bui dipaolo,cir.
as a final note,we emphasize the great degree of deference state court judgments are due,especially those that uphold jury verdicts 
applicable law 
the jackson standard 
turning to the underlying constitutional right asserted here,maintains that his due process rights were violated because after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,no rational trier of fact could have identified him as the assailant beyond a reasonable doubt.see jackson,at.whether,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.emphasis in original united states ayala,cir identification of the defendant as the person who committed the charged crime is always an essential element which the government must establish beyond a reasonable doubt.quotation marks and citations omitted.
the jackson standard is as easy to articulate as it is difficult to apply.newman metrish,cir see generally jon newman,beyond reasonable doubt.discussing difficulty of defining term note,reasonable doubt an argument against definition,harv.same.this is particularly the case where we have no eyewitness to identify the perpetrator.in cases based on circumstantial evidence such as the instant case we face the disturbing truth that guilty verdicts rest on judgments about probabilities and those judgments are usually intuitive rather than scientific.stewart coalter,cir.
despite the lack of precision in determining what constitutes reasonable doubt and the inherent difficulty in defining the term,this court and others have attempted to explicate the standard.for example,we have stated that g uilt beyond a reasonable doubt can not be premised on pure conjecture.but a conjecture consistent with the evidence becomes less and less a conjecture,and moves gradually toward proof,as alternative innocent explanations are discarded or made less likely.id.at.
as we have stated on multiple occasions,b eyond a reasonable doubt does not require the exclusion of every other hypothesis it is enough that all reasonable doubts be excluded.id.at quoting united states oreto,cir see also united states dwinells,cir united states olbres,cir united states brown,cir the prosecution may prove its case by circumstantial evidence,and it need not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence so long as the total evidence permits a conclusion of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
we note that although the circumstantial evidence is permissible to discern the identity of the perpetrator,there are some limits to its probative value.a reviewing court should not give credence to evidentiary interpretations and illations that are unreasonable,insupportable,or overly speculative.leftwich,at quoting united states spinney,cir see also united states valerio,cir we are loath to stack inference upon inference in order to uphold the jury verdict.further,
i f the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict gives equal or nearly equal circumstantial support to a theory of guilt and a theory of innocence of the crime charged,this court must reverse the conviction.this is so because where an equal or nearly equal theory of guilt and a theory of innocence is supported by the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution,a reasonable jury must necessarily entertain a reasonable doubt.
united states,cir alterations,ellipses,and emphasis in original internal quotation marks omitted.
although we give great deference to jury verdicts,we have held that evidence may sometimes be insufficient to sustain a jury verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.see,united states,cir holding evidence insufficient to show proof beyond reasonable doubt that defendant knew he was aiding in drug conspiracy when participating in kidnapping and murder united states,cir holding evidence insufficient to support convictions of bank officer on four of five counts of misapplication of bank funds united states morillo,cir holding evidence insufficient to support inference of knowledge of conspiracy purpose united states czubinski,cir holding evidence insufficient to show defendant intended to carry out a scheme to defraud the irs under wire fraud statute united states de la,cir holding evidence insufficient to support conviction for aiding and abetting where prosecution failed to show defendant shared the specific intent of the principal valerio,at holding evidence insufficient to support a finding of intent to distribute cocaine.
analysis of the sjc opinion 
as our sister court has noted,a lthough circumstantial evidence alone can support a conviction,there are times that it amounts to only a reasonable speculation and not to sufficient evidence.newman,at.this is such a case.
the instant facts may support a reasonable speculation that was the assailant,but not sufficient evidence to establish his guilt.taken together,the circumstantial evidence in this case,even when drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the prosecution,does not permit any rational jury to conclude that was the assailant beyond a reasonable doubt.
specifically,the evidence that acted upon a financial motive to commit the attack is weak at best.a jury could permissibly conclude that he needed money to acquire crack cocaine,giving him reason to break into kotowski apartment,a person whom he knew had money.however,kotowski testified that nothing of value was taken and no items,not even expensive jewelry in plain view,were disturbed.the sjc accounted for this fact by stating that the jury could draw a reasonable inference that the defendant was frightened off before he could steal anything when he heard the neighbor whittemore speaking.ii,at.even if the assailant deduced that the neighbor was calling the police in response to the attack no rational juror could conclude that the placement of this phone call frightened him off given the volume and duration of kotowski screams.moreover,the assailant actions are inconsistent with purported financial motive in view of the savage beating kotowski suffered at the hands of the assailant,an attack involving at least fifteen to twenty blows that nearly broke every bone in her face and skull.if the assailant were motivated by money,a few blows to incapacitate her would have been sufficient.
with respect to the opportunity to commit the crime,had a master key and there were no signs of forced entry thus,one possible inference is that used his master key to enter kotowski apartment.it is notable,however,that several others on the maintenance staff possessed a master key.also,kotowski could have let someone familiar to her into the apartment.
with respect to the means for the attack,a jury could permissibly find that the aluminum bat found in the woods was bat given that his name was on the bat and that he admitted to owning the bat at one time.yet,there was little evidence connecting the aluminum bat,a item in a residential complex,to the crime scene apart from the fact that it was found yards from the residential complex the following day and the use of such an object was consistent with kotowski injuries of course,any bat likely would have been consistent with her injuries.also,whittemore,a carpenter,testified that he heard wood hitting wood,as opposed to hearing the sound of a hollow aluminum bat,when he was awakened.furthermore,wooden bats were found in kotowski estranged husband garage.
we next turn to consciousness of guilt,which the sjc considered the strongest evidence in favor of reinstating the conviction when viewed in context,this evidence is minimally probative on the question of whether was the assailant.
notwithstanding the fact that it was just after,the sjc cited to uneasy and distant demeanor and his unwillingness to look officers tierney and skowron in the eye when they confronted him just minutes after the attack.however,both officers,even though they were responding to reports of a possible assault,did not consider behavior suspicious at the time.indeed,they initially believed he was the reporting party and after asking him a few brief questions they left the area.even the fact that was only clad in boxers in temperature did not give them pause after he explained to them that he was awakened by animal screams and had gone outside to place a stick in the dumpster,a fact officer tierney promptly verified.also,the sjc explained that a jury could find it implausible that would have gone outside without putting on at least minimal clothing if his true reason for going outside was to check for animals.yet,officer tierney stated that appeared unfazed by the cold and alibi shows that he did not intend to stay outside for a very long time.
the other consciousness of guilt evidence cited by the reluctance to be interviewed by the police,the inconsistent versions of how he was awoken,his reaction to the neighbor report of an assault,the fact that he was agitated during the interview,and his reaction when the police wanted to swab his closet not helpful to his case,are not enough,even when considered in combination with other circumstantial evidence,to allow a jury to permissibly conclude guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
with respect to this evidence,the fact that was reluctant to come down to the police station and displayed some agitation during the interview has minimal probative value in determining whether was the assailant.although this behavior could indicate consciousness of guilt for some crime,such as possessing crack cocaine which the evidence shows he admitted to being concerned about,it is an impermissible inferential leap for a jury to find this behavior significantly probative of whether committed such a brutal attack likewise,his indifferent reaction to his neighbor informing him of the attack the following morning may bear on whether he was a compassionate person,but has little probative value in assessing guilt.
admittedly,the conflicting versions gave the police as to how he was awoken and his reaction to the police request to swab his closet door when they were searching his home could be probative evidence linking to the crime.however,in light of concerns that the police would discover his drug use,this evidence was insufficient to serve as the primary basis upon which the jury could rely to conclude guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
lastly,the sjc cited bruises and marks on face as evidence from which the jury could infer that an altercation occurred between and kotowski.however,these bruises and marks have minimal,if any,probative force given the fact that they were not even noted by officers tierney and skowron when they were responding to an assault just minutes after the attack.
it bears repeating that the prosecution had to rely on circumstantial evidence because no physical or dna evidence linked to the attack despite the copious amount of blood at the crime scene.considering the large amount of blood,it is difficult to fathom how was able to avoid having any blood or other dna evidence connect him to kotowski.given the insufficiency of the evidence,circumstantial or otherwise,tying to the attack,we conclude that a rational jury could not find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
objectively unreasonable standard for purposes of habeas review 
although we have identified several gaps in the sjc analysis,we are mindful that on habeas review under aedpa we are not permitted to grant a writ if we merely disagree with the jury verdict or if we identify an error in the sjc reasoning.the relevant inquiry is whether the sjc was objectively unreasonable in upholding the conviction.
we once again acknowledge the extremely high bar that must be overcome on habeas review to overturn a state court decision however,that bar is not insurmountable and on rare occasions we have held a state court decision to be objectively unreasonable.see,white,at holding on habeas review that state court unreasonably applied supreme court confrontation clause jurisprudence where state court barred petitioner from cross examining complainants regarding prior accusations.
this court has identified certain guidelines that it finds useful in analyzing sufficiency claims on habeas review in addition,we note that although we evaluate the state court decision in light of supreme court precedent,we are not precluded from looking at other federal court decisions that may help guide us in applying the jackson standard.indeed,d ecisions from the lower federal courts may help inform the aedpa analysis to the extent that they state the clearly established federal law determined by the supreme court.evans,at alteration in original quoting aspen bissonnette,cir.this is especially true when factually similar cases from the lower federal courts can provid e a valuable reference point when considering the reasonableness of a state court application of supreme court precedent to a particular set of facts.id.alteration in original quoting rashad walsh,cir.under d,we are not constrained in our ability to draw from any legal source in determining whether the state court decision rests on constitutional error or is an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent.section d only limits the grounds on which habeas relief may be granted.id.
with this in mind,we look to a recent case,newman metrish,where the sixth circuit held a state court ruling to be objectively unreasonable on grounds that the prosecution did not present sufficient evidence to support a prosecution for murder of a known drug dealer.at.in newman,the prosecution presented evidence at trial that the petitioner planned to rob drug dealers for drugs or money that the victim was a known drug dealer who kept drugs in his freezer that the petitioner and the victim were known to engage in drug transactions in the past that the victim freezer was open and empty after he was killed and that the petitioner had a motive for the killing because he had seen the victim make a pass at the petitioner girlfriend.id.at.furthermore,the prosecution presented evidence supporting an inference that newman had possessed and once purchased the murder weapon.id.this evidence included forensic evidence and the fact that the petitioner friend saw a gun similar to the murder weapon in the petitioner home a few weeks prior to the murder id.
in analyzing the evidence under jackson,the newman court stated that even when consider ing all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,there remains reasonable doubt because we are limited by what inferences reason will allow us to draw.id.at.it remarked that these limitations included its ability to infer only that the petitioner intended to rob a drug dealer and knew that the victim was a drug dealer,that a gun previously owned by the petitioner was used to kill the victim,and that a similar looking gun was seen in the petitioner home approximately two weeks before the murder.id.the newman court added that even assuming that the petitioner gun was indeed the one used in the homicide,there was no evidence of what happened to it between that date and the date of the homicide,and we need not speculate as to what might have happened.id.
the newman court reasoned that while there was a wealth of information showing that the petitioner owned the gun,evidence placing the petitioner at the scene was conspicuously absent.id.at.it pointed to the fact that there was no eyewitness testimony and the police did not recover any fingerprints from the crime scene.id.the newman court stated that w ithout additional evidence placing him at the scene of the crime,there is only a reasonable speculation that the petitioner himself was present.id.it concluded that where the evidence taken in the light most favorable to the prosecution creates only a reasonable speculation that a defendant was present at the crime,there is insufficient evidence to satisfy the jackson standard.id.accordingly,the newman court declared the state court ruling an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.id.
while newman reasoning certainly does not control our analysis,it is significant that our sister court ruled a state court decision to be objectively unreasonable under jackson on facts more probative of a petitioner guilt than what we have here.for example,like the petitioner in newman,was not connected to the crime scene by forensic evidence or eyewitness testimony however,unlike the petitioner in newman who had prior business dealings with the victim in that case,had minimal contact with the victim apart from a few casual conversations and a maintenance call.moreover,the petitioner robbery motive in newman was consistent with the the victim freezer,which was his storage place for drugs,was open and empty in the instant case,however,alleged motive of robbery to satisfy his need for crack cocaine does not align with the fact that nothing of value was taken from kotowski apartment or with how savagely she was beaten at the hands of her assailant.lastly,in newman,the petitioner owned a gun whose spent cartridges and bullets matched those found in the victim body.here,the aluminum baseball bat that owned was merely consistent with kotowski injuries,in the same way a metal pipe or some other long,sturdy object would be consistent with her injuries.
another decision from a sister court also informs our analysis as to whether the sjc unreasonably applied the jackson standard.in juan allen,the ninth circuit held that the state court decision was objectively unreasonable because there was insufficient evidence to conclude that a juvenile petitioner aided and abetted a principal in committing murder and attempted murder.at.
in juan,the state court had concluded that the petitioner had manifested consciousness of guilt because he fled from the crime scene he attempted to leave his home with his family after the shooting and he gave a false alibi to the police that he was in a trailer and not present during the shooting.id.at.also,as motive evidence,the state court cited petitioner gang gestures towards the victim and the fact that the petitioner had punched the victim on a prior occasion.id.
with respect to the evidence of flight,the juan court reasoned that n o reasonable trier of fact could find evidence of criminal culpability in the decision of a teenager to run home from the scene of a shooting,regardless of whether the home was in the same general direction as the car of a fleeing suspect.id.the juan court added that l ikewise,any rational factfinder would find little or no evidence of guilt in the fact that the petitioner attempted,along with the rest of his family,to leave his home as it was being surrounded by an angry mob of neighbors.id.
regarding the false alibi,the juan court remarked that it was bare conjecture to regard the petitioner untrue statements to the police as reflective of consciousness of guilt.id.the court explained that the petitioner might have made a false statement to law enforcement for any number of reasons,especially given that any statements he made as a witness would likely be used to prosecute his older brother,a member of his immediate family.id.the juan court stressed although we must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the prosecution,a reasonable inference is one that is supported by a chain of logic,rather than,as in this case,mere speculation dressed up in the guise of evidence.id.
finally,the juan court stated that the prosecution motive evidence was mere conjecture,reasoning that the interpersonal tensions between the petitioner and the victim do not create a sufficiently strong inference of motive to allow a reasonable trier of fact to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the petitioner had reason to aid and abet murder.id.at.
the juan court maintained that s peculation and conjecture can not take the place of reasonable inferences and direct or the petitioner through both guilty mind and guilty in consort with the principal.id.at.applying the jackson standard to the state court decision,the juan court ruled that only speculation supports a conclusion that the petitioner was guilty of aiding and abetting the murders.id.it concluded that s uch a lack of evidence violates the fourteenth amendment guarantee that an accused must go free unless and until the prosecution presents evidence that proves guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.id.citing in re winship,d.
admittedly,the facts in juan do not line up precisely with those of the instant case.however,we find instructive the juan court treatment of its consciousness of guilt evidence the juan court held that the petitioner lies about his presence at the crime scene and the fact that he fled the area were insufficient to support an inference that he aided and abetted the murderer,reasoning that a conclusion regarding the petitioner guilt from this evidence would be no more than bare conjecture.
the evidence in juan is far more reflective of consciousness of guilt than what we have here.unlike the petitioner in juan,was not caught in a lie about whether he was present at the crime scene and did not flee the scene of the crime.in fact,approached the police just minutes after the attack similar to the juan court reasoning,this consciousness of guilt evidence constituted bare conjecture regarding guilt and thus renders the sjc decision that relied primarily on this evidence,objectively unreasonable.
we reiterate that juan and newman,while not controlling,powerfully illustrate how federal courts,acting under the aedpa regime,can hold in appropriate circumstances state court decisions to be o
