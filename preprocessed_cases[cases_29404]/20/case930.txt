a jury in mecklenburg county,virginia,convicted robert yarbrough of the capital murder and robbery of cyril hamby,and sentenced him to death.the supreme court of virginia vacated his sentence because of an erroneous jury instruction.on remand,a second jury sentenced yarbrough to death again,and the supreme court of virginia affirmed.
after exhausting state procedures for relief,yarbrough filed the present petition for a writ of habeas corpus under,asserting six grounds for relief.the district court denied yarbrough petition,but granted him a certificate of appealability with respect to his claim that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective because he failed to request that the trial court appoint a dna expert at public expense.we expanded the certificate of appealability to include yarbrough claim that the trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for inadequately investigating and presenting evidence in mitigation at sentencing.
for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court dismissal of yarbrough two claims for which a certificate of appealability has been issued,concluding that in denying these claims on the merits,the supreme court of virginia neither unreasonably applied clearly established federal law nor made an unreasonable determination of the facts.see d.
the facts,as stated by the supreme court of virginia in yarbrough commonwealth yarbrough i,begin with yarbrough inviting his friend,dominic rainey,to join him in his plan to rob cyril hamby,the owner of hamby store,located a short walk from yarbrough and rainey homes on route in mecklenburg county,virginia.an eyewitness testimony placed the two men walking along the highway toward the store between and on may.the two then waited outside the store until there were no customers inside,entered the store,and locked the door behind them.
yarbrough,armed with a shotgun,ordered hamby to lie on the floor in an aisle,and,with rainey help,bound hamby hands behind his back.yarbrough shut off the store outside lights and demanded that hamby reveal where guns were hidden in the store.when hamby denied having any guns,yarbrough kicked hamby in the head and upper arms.yarbrough then forced open the cash register and took the money inside.after returning to hamby,he again demanded to know the location of the guns.hamby continued to deny having any guns,at which point yarbrough put down the shotgun,took out a pocketknife,and proceeded to cut deeply into the front and the back of hamby neck with a sawing motion.according to rainey,hamby pleaded with yarbrough to stop cutting him,but yarbrough did not stop and inflicted at least deep wounds before rifling through hamby clothing and taking his wallet.yarbrough and rainey then stole beer,wine,and cigarettes,as well as the money yarbrough had taken from the cash register,and exited the store from the rear.yarbrough gave rainey and kept the remainder of the money for himself.
the two proceeded to rainey residence,where they changed clothes,and then went to the nearby home of conrad dortch,where they drank the wine from hamby store and waited for dortch to arrive so they could buy marijuana from him.dortch came home at approximately and sold yarbrough a marijuana joint for.according to rainey,yarbrough was flashing his money.yarbrough and rainey then returned to rainey home,where they spent the rest of the night.the next morning,yarbrough threw his tennis shoes in a trash barrel behind rainey house and left.
after hamby body was discovered on may,and an autopsy was conducted,it was determined that hamby had bled to death from multiple deep wounds around his neck.the commonwealth medical examiner described the wounds as entirely consistent with an attempted beheading,but because no major arteries were cut,it likely took several minutes for hamby to bleed to death.the examiner also noted the blunt force injuries on hamby head and upper arm,which were consistent with having been kicked.
a day later,dortch informed the police of his encounter with yarbrough and rainey on the night of hamby murder,prompting the police to obtain and execute a search warrant at yarbrough home where they recovered clothing and a pocketknife,both stained with blood.police also recovered the tennis shoes from rainey home.
subsequent forensic analysis of the items recovered,the crime scene,and samples taken from hamby,yarbrough,and rainey,strongly supported the conclusion that both yarbrough and rainey were present at the scene of the murder and that yarbrough was most likely the person who inflicted the fatal wounds on hamby.dna tests of the shoes and clothing established a match with hamby blood,and the dna test of the knife established a mix of hamby and yarbrough dna on the blade.the blood stains on yarbrough clothes were consistent with a spray of blood resulting from trauma and were made in close proximity to the trauma that released the blood.prints from yarbrough tennis shoes were found near the circuit box in the store,behind the counter,and in the blood stains near hamby head.prints from rainey boots were found near hamby feet and in the living quarters of the store.
following a trial,at which the commonwealth presented the testimony of rainey,other witnesses,police investigators,and forensic experts,as well as extensive physical evidence,the jury convicted yarbrough of capital murder and robbery.in exchange for his testimony,rainey was charged with first degree murder rather than capital murder,and he later pleaded guilty,receiving a sentence of years imprisonment,of which were suspended.
at the sentencing phase,which followed immediately upon the completion of the guilt phase,the commonwealth argued that the death penalty was appropriate for yarbrough because his crime was outrageously or wantonly vile,horrible or inhuman in that it involved torture,depravity of mind or an aggravated battery to the victim.see ann.yarbrough presented mitigation evidence in the form of testimony from his mother.the jury sentenced yarbrough to death for the capital murder conviction and to life imprisonment for the robbery conviction.
on direct appeal,yarbrough assigned several errors,and the virginia supreme court rejected all but one.because the trial court failed to inform the jury during the sentencing phase that if it sentenced yarbrough to life imprisonment,he would be ineligible for parole,the court vacated the death sentence and remanded the case for a new sentencing trial.see yarbrough i,at.
the second sentencing trial took place before a newly empaneled jury.the evidence presented at that trial is summarized by the virginia supreme court in yarbrough commonwealth yarbrough ii.the commonwealth presented evidence that yarbrough stabbed hamby at least times in the neck and that the wounds penetrated to the junction between the neck and the skull at several locations on the rear of hamby neck.other evidence described several blows to the head,and indicated that hamby was still alive during the infliction of these wounds,remaining alive for up to minutes as he bled to death.the commonwealth also produced rainey,who testified that hamby begged for mercy while yarbrough continued his sawing motion on hamby neck.in addition,several family members and neighbors testified to hamby warmth,generosity,kindness,and thoughtfulness,as well as to the devastating impact his murder had on his family.
in mitigation,yarbrough again presented testimony from his mother,who indicated that yarbrough had lived with her his entire life except for two years when he lived with his grandmother.yarbrough also called a prison counselor to testify that he had not received any adverse disciplinary reports while incarcerated.in opening and closing arguments,yarbrough counsel,buddy ward,attempted to cast doubt on rainey veracity and urged the jury to stop the killing by sparing yarbrough life.
after less than an hour of deliberation,the jury sentenced yarbrough to death,finding explicitly that the murder was vile and that the mitigating evidence did not outweigh this aggravating factor.on his second direct appeal,the virginia supreme court affirmed,yarbrough ii,at,and the united states supreme court denied yarbrough petition for a writ of certiorari,yarbrough virginia,d.
seeking state relief,yarbrough filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus with the supreme court of virginia on july.the petition raised several claims,including,as relevant here,claims that yarbrough trial counsel was ineffective by failing adequately to challenge the commonwealth forensic evidence,specifically by failing to request appointment of a dna expert at public expense,and was ineffective by failing adequately to investigate and present relevant evidence in mitigation at the second sentencing trial.the virginia supreme court rejected yarbrough claims and dismissed his petition in an unpublished opinion.yarbrough warden yarbrough iii.may.
relying in part on the decision of the united states supreme court in wiggins smith,d,which was handed down on june,yarbrough petitioned the virginia supreme court for rehearing,claiming that his trial counsel was deficient in failing to investigate and present mitigation evidence.the virginia supreme court granted yarbrough petition for a rehearing limited to the mitigation evidence claim,and it ordered the circuit court of mecklenburg county to conduct an evidentiary hearing.see ann.c.
at the hearing,yarbrough presented testimony from his trial counsel,his mother,his father,his mother,his grandmother,his cousin,and his.the commonwealth recalled yarbrough trial counsel and presented testimony from his trial counsel investigator.following the hearing,the circuit court submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the virginia supreme court,recommending a finding that yarbrough trial counsel performance was constitutionally deficient but that it did not result in prejudice to the outcome of the case and therefore that yarbrough was not entitled to relief.yarbrough warden yarbrough iv.may.
the supreme court of virginia adopted most of the circuit court recommendations for findings of fact,as well as its recommendation that there was no prejudice,and it dismissed yarbrough petition.yarbrough warden yarbrough v.because the virginia supreme court found no prejudice,it did not review or adopt the circuit court recommended conclusion that yarbrough trial counsel was deficient.id.at.
yarbrough commenced the present action by filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under,raising six issues,including the ineffective assistance claims for failure to seek public funds for a dna expert and for failure to investigate and present mitigating evidence.the district court referred the petition to a magistrate judge,who submitted a report and recommendation that all six claims be denied and that yarbrough petition be dismissed.yarbrough johnson yarbrough vi,no.civ a,wl.the district court adopted most of the magistrate judge recommendations,modified others,and arrived at the same conclusion that all six of yarbrough claims should be denied.yarbrough johnson yarbrough vii,d.concluding that yarbrough dna evidence claim was his strongest argument,the district court granted yarbrough motion for a certificate of appealability on that issue.id.at.by order dated october,we expanded the certificate of appealability to include yarbrough mitigation evidence claim.
yarbrough contends first that he was denied effective assistance of counsel during the guilt phase of his state trial because dna evidence was critical to the prosecution and the defense in this case not involving a confession and his counsel fail ed to request funds to engage an expert in dna collection,testing and analysis.the failure to seek funds to hire an expert,he argues,fell below prevailing professional norms as they are defined by the american bar association guidelines for the appointment and performance of defense counsel in death penalty cases aba guidelines,which he asserts require that expert assistance should always be requested and provided for the proper preparation of capital cases emphasis added,and which are not to be taken as aspirational but as a minimum standard under the sixth amendment.
the commonwealth of virginia contends that the district court properly dismissed yarbrough habeas claim because yarbrough failed to establish that his trial counsel successfully could have moved for the appointment of such an expert.adopting the district court conclusion that public funds for a dna expert would be available only if yarbrough established a particularized need for the expert under husske commonwealth,virginia argues that because yarbrough could not establish such a need,his counsel failure to move for the appointment could not have been deficient.
yarbrough first presented his ineffective assistance of counsel claim to the virginia supreme court in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed on july,relying on strickland washington,d in dismissing the claim the supreme court ruled 
the court holds claim iii c satisfies neither the performance nor the prejudice prong of the test enunciated in strickland.petitioner has failed to allege any facts that would suggest that counsel performance was inadequate.petitioner has failed to show a particularized need for the assistance of an independent expert or that he was prejudiced by the lack of expert assistance.husske commonwealth.furthermore,petitioner has failed to identify the items that were not tested by the commonwealth or how testing of those items would disprove petitioner guilt.thus,petitioner has failed to demonstrate how counsel was ineffective for failing to obtain an independent expert and failing to request that the unspecified items undergo testing.furthermore,he has failed to demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel alleged error,the result of the proceeding would have been different.
yarbrough iii,op.at.
in considering this claim again on a petition under,a federal court owes considerable deference to the judgment entered in the state court proceeding.see d,e.section d provides 
an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
and e instructs that a determination of a factual issue made by a state court shall be presumed to be correct and that the petitioner shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.
a state decision is contrary to clearly established supreme court precedent if the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in the supreme court cases or confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of the supreme court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from its precedent.williams taylor,d meyer branker,cir.an unreasonable application occurs when a state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of a petitioner case.rompilla beard,d internal quotation marks omitted lenz washington,cir.in applying these standards when reviewing a state decision under d,the question,therefore,is not whether a federal court believes the state court determination was incorrect but whether that determination was substantially higher threshold.schriro landrigan,d citing williams,at.strong johnson,cir.
we review the district court dismissal of a habeas petition de novo.meyer,at 
in presenting his ineffective assistance of counsel claim to the district court,yarbrough argued that the performance of his trial counsel,buddy ward,was deficient because,inasmuch as the prosecution case depended on dna evidence,it was incumbent on competent counsel to make some attempt to,at the least,investigate the dna analysis and discredit the scientific evidence through an independent expert and education on dna analysis.yarbrough maintained,had the forensic evidence been tested and found to be flawed or even false,only the testimony of an admitted felon with a deal would have placed him inside hamby store that night.
identifying areas in which an expert could have assisted counsel,yarbrough pointed to multiple alleged errors or deficiencies in the commonwealth forensic analysis.for example,certain samples were tested at only genetic loci,instead of,because the state only had the capability to test at the.certain samples failed to yield interpretable results.with respect to certain results,no statistical probabilities were given.finally,certain items were not tested at all.but yarbrough never explained how the test results that were obtained and that pointed only at him as the murderer could be reversed or ignored,nor how an expert review might otherwise have helped him in the context of these alleged deficiencies.he simply hoped that the expert might find something to help his case.
yarbrough also never explained how he overcame the presumption that,under the circumstances,the challenged action of his attorney might be considered sound trial strategy,namely,a decision to focus on advancing arguments that counsel could actually make or reasonably found more persuasive.strickland,at.internal quotation marks omitted.this presumption was especially strong here in view of the fact that in virginia state funds were not available for an expert witness unless a defendant was able to show a particularized need for the expert testimony.see husske,at.and under state law,such a particularized need could not have been demonstrated by conclusory assertions,but rather had to be demonstrated by a specific showing of how expert testimony would assist in the defense.id.at see also commonwealth sanchez.in sanchez,the virginia supreme court denied a request for state funds for an expert specifically because the defendant demonstration of need was not particularized and rested on nothing more than the petitioner hope or suspicion.in accordance with strickland,we presume that ward knew of these barriers and developed a sound trial strategy in light of his inability to surmount them.and yarbrough has given us no basis to rebut that presumption.
yarbrough faced overwhelming forensic evidence that tied him to the scene,that corroborated rainey testimony,and that placed him yarbrough in the role of primary perpetrator.without any indication or theory about how the dna evidence might be wrong,any expectation of what benefit might be obtained from retaining a dna expert could only be characterized as a dim hope.ward was fighting an uphill battle for yarbrough,and he performed as ably as one could expect in the circumstances.this is meaningful when recognizing that ward was a seasoned criminal lawyer who had tried more capital cases than he could remember.
not only did the virginia supreme court have all of this information before it,the district court separately and exhaustively examined ward of the commonwealth forensic experts,noting that he effectively subjected the commonwealth evidence to adversarial testing such that the proper functioning of the adversarial process was not undermined and could be relied on to produce a just result.yarbrough vii,d at see also strickland,at.while the district court did acknowledge that ward made some errors,which revealed limits of his knowledge,it did not conclude that these errors in any way lessened ward ability to test the commonwealth case and to ensure that the trial was reliable.
in view of these facts,we can not say that the virginia supreme court conclusion that ward performance was not deficient was an unreasonable application of federal law,particularly strickland.see d.in determining whether ward performance was constitutionally deficient,a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance,in order to avoid the distorting effects of hindsight.strickland,at.as the supreme court in strickland stated 
a convicted defendant making a claim of ineffective assistance must identify the acts or omissions of counsel that are alleged not to have been the result of reasonable professional judgement.the court must then determine whether,in light of all the circumstances,the identified acts or omissions were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance.
in any ineffectiveness case,a particular decision not to investigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances,applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel judgments.
to argue that ward performance was outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance,yarbrough relies heavily,and almost exclusively,on the aba guidelines,which were originally drafted in and revised in.he argues that the aba guidelines establish prevailing professional norms that,when applied to measure ward performance,render it constitutionally deficient.he asserts that the aba guidelines require that expert assistance should always be requested and provided for the proper preparation of capital cases emphasis added,and that the rules are not aspirational,but minimum constitutional standards.the district court rejected this argument,holding that the failure to comply with the aba guidelines regarding the requesting of funds for expert assistance does not establish counsel performance as constitutionally deficient per se.see yarbrough vii,d at.
we agree.indeed,the aba guidelines themselves deliver a mixed message about whether they are aspirational or mandatory in every circumstance.on the one hand they would impose on defense counsel a mandatory,minimum requirement to request public funds and obtain expert assistance in the preparation of virtually every capital case,because everywhere that the guidelines direct what counsel should do,they advise that the term should is to be construed as a mandatory term.see aba guidelines intro.should is used throughout as a mandatory term and refers to activities which are minimum requirements.in this manner,the aba guidelines appear to mandate that u tilization of experts has become the rule,rather than the exception,in proper preparation of capital cases,id,and counsel should demand on behalf of the client all necessary experts for preparation of both phases of trial,id.cmt.on the other hand,the guidelines also seem to acknowledge that a defendant can not routinely have experts,because to have them requires calling upon local jurisdictions to authorize sufficient funds to enable counsel in capital cases to conduct a thorough investigation and to procure the necessary expert witnesses and documentary evidence,id,which suggests an aspirational nature to the guidelines.the guidelines observe that funds available to appointed defense counsel are substantially below those available to the prosecution and that t his inequity is unconscionable.id.in short,the aba guidelines say that defense counsel meaning only should try to use experts more routinely,but that this goal depends on government funding which,for now,does not allow this goal to be achieved routinely.this therefore can hardly be the mandated minimum standard,as yarbrough claims.
moreover,were we to treat the aba guidelines as establishing the minimum constitutional floor of prevailing professional norms for determining ineffective assistance of counsel,we would be forced to hold that a defense attorney who failed to obtain the expert assistance he should have secured was constitutionally deficient,even if the jurisdiction in question would not have provided funds for such an expert had the attorney asked for them.as the district court noted,the practice of providing defense attorneys few,if any,resources to hire experts has plainly been held to be constitutional and has continued for decades.yarbrough vii,d at.it simply is not the case that a lawyer who fails to request funds that are not available,or to which his client is not entitled under governing local law,has rendered ineffective assistance of counsel.
more fundamentally,to hold defense counsel responsible for performing every task that the aba guidelines say he should do is to impose precisely the set of detailed rules for counsel conduct that the supreme court has long since rejected as being unable to satisfactorily take account of the variety of circumstances faced by defense counsel or the range of legitimate decisions regarding how best to represent a criminal defendant.strickland,at.such a categorical holding would lead to needless and expensive layers of process with the unintended effect of compromising process.would it lead to the requirement,for example,that anytime the government uses a sample of dna in prosecuting a case,the defense lawyer would have to retain a dna expert,regardless of the expert likely contribution to the defense would such a rule similarly require a defense lawyer to retain experts every time the government introduces expert evidence that a substance is,for example,cocaine recognition of the aba guidelines as the minimum prevailing community standard would transform defense lawyers judgments into mindless defensive reactions to a potential habeas claim,divorced from the individualized needs of professional representation.those needs call for more nuanced responses than can be provided by following preestablished mechanical rules of representation.see roe,d strickland,at.cautioning against the fallacy of treating guidelines as a checklist for judicial evaluation of attorney performance meyer,at same id.at t he touchstone of effective representation must be sound,judgment,rather than a set of mandates counsel must programmatically follow without deviation walker true,cir noting that the strickland inquiry does not entail the application of per se rules derived from aba standards,vacated on other grounds,d.
while the aba guidelines provide noble standards for legal representation in capital cases and are intended to improve that representation,they nevertheless can only be considered as a part of the overall calculus of whether counsel representation falls below an objective standard of reasonableness they still serve only as guides,strickland,at,not minimum constitutional standards.
inasmuch as we conclude that the virginia supreme court application of strickland to this case was not unreasonable,we affirm the district court decision dismissing yarbrough claim that his counsel performance was deficient.
because yarbrough has not satisfied the prong of strickland,we only briefly discuss the prejudice prong.although an expert might have helped buddy ward poke a few more holes in the commonwealth case than he accomplished on his own,there is no basis to assume that any such minor victories would have created a reasonable probability that yarbrough would have been acquitted.short of expert testimony revealing gross incompetence or a criminal conspiracy to falsely implicate there is certainly no reasonable probability of is most unlikely that,even with an expert,yarbrough could have overcome the totality of evidence against him,which included not just forensic evidence,but also rainey testimony,eyewitness testimony placing him in the vicinity of the store,and dortch testimony regarding his actions after the murder.
at bottom,we hold that yarbrough has established neither the performance prong nor the prejudice prong of strickland,and his first claim for habeas relief was properly denied.
yarbrough also contends that his trial counsel performed below an objective standard of reasonableness because he failed adequately to investigate and present relevant evidence in mitigation at the second sentencing trial and that,but for this failure,there was a reasonable probability that the jury would not have sentenced him to death.see wiggins smith,d strickland,at.
when this claim was first presented to the supreme court of virginia,the court denied it on the merits,holding that yarbrough had satisfied neither the performance prong nor the prejudice prong of strickland because he had failed to allege that such mitigation evidence was available to counsel or that petitioner desired such evidence to be presented at sentencing.the court also gave as a reason the fact that such mitigation evidence could have been evidence capable of aggravation as well as mitigation.yarbrough iii,op.at citing barnes thompson,cir.
after the united states supreme court decided wiggins,the virginia supreme court granted yarbrough petition for rehearing and directed the circuit court of mecklenburg county to conduct an evidentiary hearing on the claim.the facts developed at this hearing are related by the virginia supreme court in yarbrough v,at.
the court described how yarbrough mother,lorraine mitchell,testified that when yarbrough was seven or eight years old,she became addicted to crack cocaine,first as a functional addict who managed to provide for herself and her children and later as a dysfunctional addict who permitted bills to go unpaid and the cleanliness of her home,herself,and her children to deteriorate.she and her and his dorian jenkins,who was six years yarbrough eventually evicted from their home in camden,new jersey,and forced to move to a housing project.also,dorian jenkins father,willis jenkins,eventually moved out of the home,leaving only mitchell and the two children in the house.
mitchell testified that after she hit rock bottom in the summer of or,when yarbrough was eleven or twelve years old,yarbrough father,robert yarbrough,arranged for yarbrough to live with relatives and attend school in illinois for a year.that same year,willis jenkins permanently removed dorian from mitchell care.when yarbrough returned from illinois the following summer,mitchell had substantially recovered from her addiction,and she and yarbrough thereafter lived in new jersey,the eastern shore of virginia,and finally mecklenburg county,virginia.during this period yarbrough sometimes lived with his grandmother in mecklenburg county.
willis jenkins,robert yarbrough,and yarbrough grandmother,annie mae riley,also testified and substantially supported mitchell testimony.all four witnesses agreed that mitchell had been addicted to crack cocaine and that she had neglected her parental responsibilities as a result.but they also testified that yarbrough had always been a relatively and responsible person and that there was never any indication,hint,or suggestion that yarbrough had been physically or sexually abused.evidence showed that when yarbrough mother was unable to care for herself or her children,yarbrough would often do so,seeing to it that his got something to eat or was safely near her mother before he left for school.
yarbrough final two witnesses,his cousin anthony riley and his dorian jenkins,gave testimony about events that occurred when they were young children,no more than and years old,respectively.their testimony roughly tracked that of the adults,although it painted an even harsher picture about conditions when yarbrough and his lived with mitchell in new jersey.
buddy ward,yarbrough trial counsel,testified that both he and his investigator interviewed yarbrough,mitchell,and mitchell mother extensively,and that they conducted a deep background check that involved school and medical records from new jersey and virginia.according to ward,none of the people interviewed were willing to say anything negative to him about yarbrough childhood or mitchell parenting.the picture ward got from his investigation was simply that mitchell had tried to be a good mother but encountered problems and hard times,so she sent yarbrough to live with her mother temporarily while she worked through her difficulties.in addition,ward testified that a psychologist,evan nelson,examined ward and obtained some clues as to mitchell drug problems and a possible mitigation case based on maternal neglect.but nelson also warned ward not to call him as an expert witness to connect yarbrough upbringing to his crime,because in his opinion yarbrough was dangerous.
in response to the testimony given at the hearing by the yarbrough family members,ward testified that he had been aware of most of the circumstances they
