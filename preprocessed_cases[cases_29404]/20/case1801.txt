in a jury in an indiana state court convicted petitioner stephenson of three murders.the judge sentenced him to death.after exhausting his state remedies,see stephenson state,affirming his conviction and sentence,and affirming denial of relief,he sought a writ of federal habeas corpus.the district judge ruled that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel during both the guilt and penalty phases of the trial and so she vacated both the conviction and the sentence,because his counsel had failed to object to the state making him wear a stun belt in the courtroom.in affidavits and a deposition introduced in the state postconviction proceedings,four jurors said they were aware that he was wearing a stun belt.
stephenson argued other grounds for relief as well,but the district judge did rule on any of them.that may have been a mistake,considering how protracted capital cases are.it means that if we reject the ground on which the court did rule,we must reverse and remand for consideration of the other grounds,while if those grounds for relief had been before us we might have agreed with one of them and thereby spared the parties a further proceeding in the district court,possibly followed by a further appeal.
one of those grounds,moreover,was that stephenson counsel had rendered ineffective assistance at the penalty phase of his trial by failing to obtain and present mitigating evidence had the judge addressed that ground,we would have a better sense of counsel performance as a whole.in williams lemmon,cir per curiam,we answered the question whether single oversights by counsel violate the sixth amendment no.the supreme court insists that judges must not examine a lawyer error of omission or commission in isolation.see,strickland washington.it is essential to evaluate the entire course of the defense,because the question is not whether the lawyer work was,or the best possible approach,or even an average one,but whether the defendant had the counsel of which the sixth amendment speaks.but williams goes on to explain that of course the supreme court has allowed for the possibility that a single error may suffice if that error is sufficiently egregious and prejudicial,murray carrier,as contended in this case.
it was stephenson who requested that the district judge review the stun belt claim separately from his other claims for relief.he may have been playing a delay game common enough in capital cases,for obvious reasons the judge was not required to join him in his play.
the indiana supreme court had ruled in stephenson state case that prevailing norms at the time of stephenson trial required counsel to object to visible restraints where there is no evidence suggesting escape,violence,or disruptive behavior,at,but that if stephenson lawyer had objected,the objection would have been overruled.and rightly so,the court thought,because these three murders were contended by both the defendant and the prosecution to have been related to organized drug activity.the murders appeared to have been premeditated and had characteristics of an assassination.there was testimony that the defendant had threatened to kill a critical witness.id.at.
it not easy to reconcile the two crucial statements that we have just quoted.if the objection to the stun belt would rightly have been overruled,how could a failure to make the objection be thought unprofessional see,rodriguez united states,cir hough anderson,and cir united states sanders,cir koch puckett,cir.overlooking the contradiction,the state does challenge the ruling that competent counsel would have objected to stephenson being required to wear a stun belt.
stephenson had turned himself in after hearing that the police were looking for him in connection with the murders,and he had been a model prisoner ever period of six months before the trial.although the sheriff said that the stun belt had been chosen as the best way to get stephenson in and out of the courtroom without the jury seeing him in shackles or handcuffs,he could have been brought in before the jury entered and taken out after the jury left,and then no physical restraint would have been visible to the jurors.none of the security personnel explained why any physical restraint as distinct from just the normal complement of armed guards would have been necessary once the defendant was seated at the defense table.apart from the murders themselves,the fact that they had grown out of a dispute among drug dealers,the capital nature of the case,and the state contention that after the murders stephenson had threatened a possible accomplice with death if he spilled the factors mentioned by the indiana supreme court in ruling that an objection to the stun belt would rightly have been was no reason to think that the defendant would have been likely to try to flee the courtroom or cause any other disturbance during the trial.
the factors relied on by the court to uphold the use of the stun belt were insufficient in light of the case law both then and now.well before,when stephenson trial began,the supreme court had said that shackling was the sort of inherently prejudicial practice that should be permitted only where justified by an essential state interest specific to each trial.holbrook flynn,emphasis added estelle williams,defendant in prison garb illinois allen,defendant shackled and gagged.but stephenson does argue that extending the holbrook dictum,and the holding of the other two supreme court cases that we just cited,to stun belts was clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,d emphasis added,in and therefore a ground for obtaining relief in a federal habeas corpus proceeding.gagging is a lot more extreme than a stun belt,and forcing a defendant to wear prison garb serves no security interest,though once in a while a defendant will prefer to appear in court to prison garb to reassure the jurors that they are safe from him,to evoke their sympathy,or out of sheer obstreperousness.stephenson argument is that the use of the stun belt was sufficiently questionable that,as federal and state law then stood,an objection to his being forced to wear it during his trial without a showing that he presented a security risk would,or at least should,have been granted,and so counsel was deficient in failing to make the objection.
the clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,that is relevant to this case is thus not that forcing a defendant to wear a stun belt deprives him of his constitutional right to a fair trial unless necessity for a physical restraint be shown.it could be argued that,read together,holbrook,estelle,and allen had by established a rule determined by the supreme court and therefore a ground of federal habeas corpus against unnecessary visible restraints that was broad enough to include the stun belt.but that is not the principle that stephenson invokes.he ca,because his counsel failed to invoke it in objecting to the stun belt at made no objection on any ground to stephenson having to wear a stun did try to raise the issue on direct appeal.the principle stephenson invokes is that of strickland washington,supra,at,entitling criminal defendants to effective assistance of counsel.
by,as deck missouri,and cases cited there make clear,the law was well settled,though perhaps not in the supreme court,that placing any kind of visible restraint on a defendant movement during a criminal trial was permissible only if the particular defendant was too dangerous to be allowed in the courtroom without such a is,only if less conspicuous security measures,such as seating one or two guards near but not too near the defendant,would be insufficient to ensure the safety of the persons in the courtroom and prevent the defendant from escaping.see united states fountain,cir harrell israel,cir per curiam marquez collins,cir united states hack,cir evans state,n,coates state,overruled on other grounds by hahn state.these decisions were based primarily on a concern,which continues to be expressed,see deck missouri,supra,at united states cooper,cir gardner galetka,cir hatten quarterman,cir,that jurors might infer from a visible restraint that the defendant was especially dangerous.that might lead them to prejudge his guilt,particularly in a trial for violent an inference of guilt derived from a gratuitous visible restraint would infringe his constitutional right to a fair trial.
the indiana supreme court seems to have thought that the requirement of evidence of a security threat specific to the defendant rather than to the crime could be relaxed when a defendant is on trial for multiple murders and the prosecution is seeking the death penalty.but that would produce the paradox that capital defendants would have less protection from the prejudice that visible restraints might induce in jurors than persons convicted of lesser crimes and facing milder punishment.the cases thus hold that the nature of the crime with which a defendant is charged,however heinous,is insufficient by itself to justify visible restraints.see deck missouri,supra,at wrinkles buss,cir cox ayers,wl,at,cir.july,lakin stine,cir.
even when a visible restraint is warranted by the defendant history of escape attempts or disruption of previous court proceedings,as in williams norris,wl,at cir.july,united states honken,cir,and bigby dretke,cir,it must be the least visible secure restraint,such as,it is often suggested,leg shackles made invisible to the jury by a curtain at the defense table.see united states brooks,cir united states brazel,cir lemons skidmore,cir.there should of course be a curtain at the prosecution table as well,lest the jury quickly tumble to the purpose of the curtain at the defense table.
but while curtained leg shackles might seem less conspicuous than a stun belt,actually this is unclear and underlines the difficulty of reconciling the interest in courtroom security with the interest in a fair trial for the defendant,and casts doubt on the ruling of the indiana supreme court that stephenson counsel should have objected to the stun belt.the clanking of leg chains is audible,and even without hearing it jurors may guess what the curtain is for.and when there is a sidebar in a criminal trial the defendant is entitled to participate,and if his legs are shackled there is no way he can join the sidebar without revealing his shackling to the jury.so the jury would have to be sent out of the courtroom every time there was a sidebar,which would slow down the trial and might irritate the jurors.the problem would be particularly acute in older courthouses that do not have good facilities for jurors.we have been told nothing about the size or floor plan of the indiana state courthouse in which stephenson was tried.
the stun belt is of course inaudible,and worn under the defendant shirt is visible only as a slight bulge at his back and thus does not reveal its purpose.but we know from juror affidavits solicited by stephenson postconviction counsel that one juror guessed that he was wearing a stun belt because the juror had seen a stun belt in a television show,and another juror inferred it from the bulge at stephenson back and the absence of handcuffs he apparently thought that stephenson had to be physically restrained in some way.one of these jurors may have reported their discoveries to the other two jurors whose affidavits state that they thought the defendant was wearing a stun belt but this is speculation.
so the stun belt is not the perfect solution to the trial dilemma but neither,as we said,are leg shackles,or a crowd of armed guards.this court has said that the stun belt is a method of restraint that minimizes the risk of prejudice,united states.brooks,supra,at stevens mcbride,cir,though several years after the trial in this case the indiana supreme court disapproved its use.wrinkles state.guards remain the preferred alternative to any physical restraint,holbrook flynn,supra,at lakin stine,supra,f d at hellum warden,cir,but too many guards can create the same impression of a dangerous defendant as a physical restraint.
not knowing the size or shape of the courtroom in which stephenson was tried,we find it difficult to place ourselves in the position of his counsel in deciding whether to object to the stun belt.counsel might have considered it superior to leg shackles and as for additional guards,a lot would depend on the size of the courtroom the smaller it is,the more that additional guards would create an impression that the defendant was dangerous.if a defendant lawyer went for broke and objected to any security beyond what would be required in a prosecution for kiting checks,he might be disserving his client by making the jury nervous to be confronting an accused triple murderer with no protection against his acting up.the lawyer might even be afraid of his client.
yet apart from the nature of the defendant crime,the only justification suggested by the indiana supreme court for the stun belt was stephenson having threatened to kill a prospective witness.but the prospective witness was a possible accomplice,told by stephenson naturally he was the murderer to shut up about the crime,and the threat was made before he turned himself in.that is different from a threat uttered in the course of a legal proceeding,a verbal act that the judge might fear would presage disruptive behavior in the courtroom.so under the case law as it had evolved in,the state may be correct to concede that the defense should have objected to the stun belt.we have our doubts but will still them and move on to the issue of a moment,because there are two further wrinkles to smooth out.
suppose that had counsel objected to the stun belt the judge would have overruled the objection,and suppose that had he done so,it would have been an error.the state supreme court,we know from its later decision,might have affirmed the ruling and suppose that had it done so,that it would have been an error too.the test of ineffective assistance is not whether the court system would have ruled correctly on a valid objection or other defense tactic it is whether the existing law would have required the courts to uphold the objection.the assessment of prejudice should proceed on the assumption that the decisionmaker is reasonably,conscientiously,and impartially applying the standards that govern the decision.it should not depend on the idiosyncrasies of the particular decisionmaker,such as unusual propensities toward harshness or leniency.strickland washington,supra,at see also fountain united states,cir wrinkles buss,supra,at.
another issue would have to be considered before one could conclude that an objection to the stun belt,had it been made,should have been sustained.to be timely,the objection would have had to be made before the trial began and the jurors saw the defendant.conceivably the judge would have ruled that the stun belt was insufficiently conspicuous to be visible to them.we do know what the defendant looked like with the stun belt on the jurors who said they thought he was wearing a stun belt may have been guessing.had the objection been overruled on the narrowly factual ground,based on the trial judge direct observation,that the stun belt was not visible,the appellate courts might have been justified in affirming his ruling.if so,there would have been no harm from defense counsel failure to object,although had it become known by the time of the appeal that some jurors had been aware of the stun belt the appellate court would have realized that the trial judge ruling had been based on an erroneous factual assumption.
the state has not made the argument that we just sketched against a finding of prejudice.it argues rather that the fact that several jurors realized that stephenson was wearing a stun belt is unlikely to have so prejudiced his defense that it deprived him of a fair trial,roche davis,cir,or in simpler terms to have changed the outcome of the trial.see strickland washington,supra,at,wrinkles buss,supra,at,fountain united states,supra,at marquard secretary for of corrections,cir wilkerson whitley,cir.
had stephenson challenged the stun belt on direct appeal,the state would have had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the stun belt had not influence
