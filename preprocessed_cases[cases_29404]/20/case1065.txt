miguel paredes,convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death,appeals the denial of his federal petition for writ of habeas corpus.specifically,he claims his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to object to certain testimony on confrontation clause grounds.he also seeks a certificate of appealability coa to present six other claims that the state violated his right under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to have a fair of the community on panels from which grand jurors are chosen his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to object to the state purportedly untimely request for a jury shuffle counsel was ineffective by failing to object to jury instructions that did not ensure juror unanimity counsel was ineffective by failing to object on grounds that texas special issue number violates the sixth amendment by not requiring the state to prove a lack of mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt the trial court violated his federal constitutional rights by not requiring the jury to agree unanimously on precisely which of the victims paredes could be held responsible for killing and an instruction used in his sentencing violated the eighth and fourteenth amendments by including vague words and by failing properly to channel the jury discretion.
in regard to the issues as to which coa was previously granted,we affirm the denial of habeas relief.we affirm in part and deny in part the application for a coa.
in,paredes,john saenz,and greg members of the hermanos pistoleros latinos hpl shot rival gang members adrian torres,nelly bravo,and shawn cain inside saenz house.paredes and several hpl members then disposed of the bodies and removed other physical evidence.paredes was indicted on three counts of capital murder.
several witnesses testified for the prosecution.john saenz brother,eric saenz,provided testimony concerning phone calls with john and a conversation with john in paredes presence,both of which incriminated paredes.first,eric testified that on the morning of the killings,john saenz telephoned and asked him to come over with a gun,because john was expecting trouble from torres.john also indicated he would seek help from paredes.eric said he would try to come over but never appeared.later in the day,john called again,saying paredes and alvarado had arrived with weapons.
john called a third time that day,saying they had taken care of the problem with torres communicated that john,paredes,and alvarado were at the house and asked eric to recruit hpl members to remove the bodies.given the context and the request to remove bodies,eric understood john statement that they had taken care of the problem to mean that they had killed torres,bravo,and cain.
eric also testified regarding a conversation with his brother later that night.around midnight,paredes,john,and john acquaintance,tomas ayala,drove to eric house.in paredes presence,john gave eric a detailed account of the day events,including that paredes,john,and alvarado had taken part in the killings and that paredes had shot bravo and cain.paredes did not dispute john details of the murders and cleanup and said that eric should have been there and that he would have had some fun.
ayala testified for the prosecution,mirroring eric saenz description of the conversation that took place at eric house.ayala testified that john related the details of the murders to that paredes had shot cain and bravo.according to ayala,paredes never interrupted to dispute the story.
the prosecution also offered testimony from paul alden,a neighbor of john saenz,who testified that he saw the victims arrive at the saenz house and heard a barrage of gunshots a few minutes after the victims entered.shortly thereafter,john saenz exited the house without a shirt.he looked nervous,took note of several neighbors nearby,went back inside,then came outside and briefly conversed with a neighbor.alden did not see any of the victims exit the house but did see several vehicles arrive at the house,one vehicle back into the garage,and a caravan leave the premises.in the days after the gunfire,he saw people cleaning the house,hosing down the bed of a pickup truck,and laying new tile.
at the conclusion of the phase,the court instructed the jury that it could find paredes guilty of capital murder as a shooter,a party,or a conspirator.during the punishment phase,the prosecution introduced evidence of other crimes paredes had committed,including another murder a shooting in which two people were wounded a kidnaping an instance in which paredes burned and disposed of the body of someone who had overdosed on drugs an arrest for driving while intoxicated,without a license,while unlawfully carrying a firearm and numerous lesser offenses.under texas special issue,the jury determined there was a probability that paredes would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society.on the second special issue,the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that paredes a caused the death of one of the victims or b intended to kill a victim or anticipated that a human life would be taken.regarding special issue,the jury found a lack of mitigating circumstances to justify a sentence of life imprisonment rather than death.
based on these findings,the court sentenced paredes to death.paredes appealed his conviction and sentence,and the texas court of criminal appeals tcca affirmed.paredes did not petition for writ of certiorari.
paredes filed a habeas application in state court,which held an evidentiary hearing,issued an opinion detailing its findings of fact and conclusions of law,and recommended that the tcca deny the application.the tcca adopted the findings of fact and conclusions of law and denied habeas relief.
after exhausting state remedies,paredes filed the instant federal habeas petition and requested an evidentiary hearing.the district court denied all habeas relief and the request for a hearing.it granted a coa on one issue whether trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to raise confrontation clause objections to those portions of eric saenz and ayala testimony in which they recounted their conversation with john saenz about the details of the killings.paredes appeals the denial on that issue and requests a coa on six additional grounds.
paredes argues that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to raise confrontation clause objections to eric saenz and ayala testimony.both testified to a conversation in which john saenz recounted the killings and stated that paredes was one of the shooters.ayala testified that as john saenz told his story,paredes never interrupted to dispute his role in the murders or otherwise to contest the account being given.according to eric,when john completed the story,paredes spoke up to say that eric should have been there,because he would have had some fun.
paredes attorney objected to those statements on hearsay grounds but did not claim they violated the confrontation clause.paredes was thus barred from pursuing the confrontation clause argument on appeal,and he assails his counsel performance in failing to raise the objection at trial 
to prevail on his habeas claim,paredes must show that his state court proceedings resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court.d.our inquiry,therefore,is whether the tcca rendered a decision contrary to,or unreasonably applied,the supreme court sixth amendment jurisprudence in deciding that counsel performance comported with the sixth amendment the opinion in strickland washington,d,sets forth the clearly established federal law for paredes claims paredes must show that counsel was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced him by calling the verdict into question.id.at.emphasis added.
the supreme court confrontation clause jurisprudence changed significantly during the pendency of paredes direct appeal when the court handed down crawford washington,d,on march,paredes trial was in october,and his direct appeals concluded on january.paredes state.
a conviction is final only when the defendant has exhausted his state appeals and either the time for requesting certiorari has passed or the supreme court has affirmatively denied such a petition.caspari bohlen,d.paredes did not petition for certiorari,so his conviction became final on april,when his time for petitioning for certiorari expired although crawford was announced before paredes sentence became final,we determine whether performance was deficient by making every effort to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel challenged conduct,and to evaluate the conduct from counsel perspective at the time.washington,at.thus,counsel performance is judged by the law that existed at the time of trial and not by reference to law that was then unavailable 
we therefore would look to ohio roberts,d,the governing confrontation clause standard at the time of paredes trial,to determine whether the attorney failure to raise a confrontation clause objection was deficient.under roberts,hearsay statements do not offend the constitution if the evidence comes within a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule or contains particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.id.at.
we need not,in this case,undertake a protracted historical inquiry to determine whether the exception was firmly rooted,however.assuming for the sake of argument,without holding so,that the testimony was inadmissible and paredes counsel was deficient in failing to object to it,parades is still not entitled to relief.washington calls for us to examine whether any potential deficiency in failing to object on confrontation clause grounds might have prejudiced paredes.in addition to eric saenz and ayala testimony,the state presented overwhelming evidence that paredes committed capital murder.the evidence was strong under two different legal theories that paredes was one of the shooters and was criminally responsible for the killings under texas law of parties.
first,the state presented cumulative evidence that paredes was one of the shooters.julio gonzalez testified that he helped john saenz and paredes dispose of the bodies and destroy other physical evidence of the crimes.he said that while paredes was cleaning the house,he admitted to shooting bravo and cain.
this direct evidence was supported by overwhelming circumstantial evidence.the jury heard testimony that john saenz was expecting trouble from adrian torres,so he asked an hpl member to come to his house and bring a weapon.when that member declined,john stated he would call paredes.furthermore,the jury heard testimony that paredes was at the house with a gun before the killings,that no one left through the front door during the killings,and that paredes remained at the house immediately after the killings.this combined direct and circumstantial evidence strongly supports the verdict.
second,the state presented a large amount of evidence showing that paredes was guilty under the law of parties.the court instructed the jury that it could find paredes guilty if,acting with the intent to promote or assist the commission of the offense,he solicit ed,encourage d,direct ed,aid ed,or attempt ed to aid another person to commit the offense.the jury was also instructed it could find paredes guilty if the killings came about as the result of a conspiracy to commit a felony,the offense was committed in furtherance of the unlawful purpose,the offense should have been anticipated,and paredes was a conspirator.
the evidence reviewed above showed that in response to john saenz call asking for help with torres,paredes brought a gun to john house and remained there during the killings.paredes assisted the killers by helping to dispose of the bodies and clean the house.at a minimum,these facts show paredes encouraged and aided the shooters.
therefore,even without saenz and ayala testimony of the conversation outside saenz house,the evidence against paredes was overwhelming.even if trial counsel was deficient in failing to raise a confrontation clause objection,that deficient performance did not prejudice paredes 
in addition to raising confrontation clause issues,paredes asks this court to grant a coa on six issues the district court rejected.we may issue a coa only if paredes makes a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.c.this standard requires paredes to demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.slack mcdaniel,d.in determining whether to issue a coa,we do not engage in full analysis of the factual and legal bases of paredes claims,neville dretke,cir,but instead conduct an overview of the issues presented and a general assessment of their merits,ortiz quarterman,cir,cert.denied,d.
paredes says the state violated his right under the sixth amendment,applicable to the states under the fourteenth amendment,to have a fair cross section of the community on panels from which grand jurors are chosen according to paredes,hispanics are disproportionate ly and consistent ly exclu ded from the pool of eligible persons to serve on a grand jury in bexar county.we decline to extend a coa on this issue,because paredes has defaulted the argument and the claim fails on its merits even if he had not defaulted.
the argument is unavailable because of procedural default.the general rule is that the federal habeas court will not consider a claim that the last state court rejected on the basis of an adequate and independent state procedural ground.busby dretke,cir.where a state court asserts a procedural bar,we presume that obstacle is adequate and independent,but the petitioner can overcome that presumption by showing that state courts do not strictly or regularly follow the rule.sones hargett,cir.there are exceptions where the petitioner can demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law or if the default would work a fundamental miscarriage of justice.id.at quoting coleman thompson,d.
the state habeas court explicitly stated that paredes had raised his sixth amendment claim for the first time in his state habeas proceedings.it concluded that because paredes failed to raise the objection in advance of his collateral attack,he waived the complaint paredes makes no attempt to overcome the presumption that this procedural bar is an adequate and independent state ground,nor does he offer cause to explain his failure to raise the argument earlier.he has therefore defaulted this claim.
even if paredes argument were not procedurally barred,it would fail on its merits.to establish a prima facie case,paredes must make three showings.first,he must demonstrate that the group alleged to be excluded is a distinctive group in the community.duren missouri,d.second,he must establish that the representation of this group in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community.id.he must finally demonstrate that this underrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the process.id.the parties stipulate to the first prong.
as for the second prong,paredes fails to show that hispanics are underrepresented on prospective grand jury lists.the requirement does not guarantee jur ies of any particular composition.taylor,at.rather,it only guarantees that the jury wheels,pools of names,panels,or venires from which juries are drawn must not systematically exclude distinctive groups.under both the commissioner system and the wheel two processes paredes claims were in place in bexar county during the relevant court selects grand jury panels from larger lists of prospective grand jurors nevertheless,paredes fails to present any data on the ratio of hispanics to on the lists from which grand jurors were chosen he provides only evidence pertaining to the composition of actual grand jury panels this data is irrelevant to the sixth amendment inquiry.
moreover,even if this data were relevant,we would decline to rely on it.paredes grand jury data consists of a table in his brief purporting to show the number of people with hispanic names on bexar county grand juries between and.the source of this data does not appear in the record.paredes provides no external citation for the data but instead claims it is compiled from the bexar county grand jury records.he also fails to explain his system for distinguishing hispanic from surnames.thus,in addition to being irrelevant to paredes sixth amendment claim,the data is unreliable.
paredes claim fails under the third prong of the analysis as well.paredes does not show that an underrepresentation is the result of a systematic exclusion of hispanics from the selection of grand juries.instead,he presents a string of bare assertions and conclusions that the large discrepancy of hispanics on grand juries indicates that the cause of the underrepresentation was systematic the particular system used in his case somehow adds to the source of the systematic exclusion and hispanics were therefore systematically underrepresented.
paredes provides no explanation or support for any of these conclusions.for example,he repeats his position that a large discrepancy exists but does not explain how that statement alone satisfies the requirements of the third prong,which requires an independent showing that the discrepancy is systematic.if any discrepancy sufficient to satisfy the second prong would also satisfy the third,the third inquiry would be superfluous.nor does paredes allege any specific deficiency in the particular system under which he was indicted.his bare conclusions are insufficient to satisfy the third prong.
paredes has not made a substantial showing of a denial of a constitutional right.jurists of reason would not debate the resolution of this issue or conclude the issues paredes presents warrant encouragement to proceed.we decline to issue a coa on paredes claim.
paredes requests a coa on three claims.under washington,at,he must show that his trial counsel performance was deficient and that the inadequate performance prejudiced him by calling the result of his trial into question.
paredes suggests that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to object to the state purportedly untimely jury shuffle request.we decline to issue a coa on this claim on two independent grounds we may not the state habeas court conclusion that the prosecution request was timely as a matter of state law,and paredes has not shown harm from the failure to object.
first,the supreme court has repeatedly held that a state court interpretation of state law binds a federal court sitting in habeas corpus.bradshaw richey,d.here,the state courts concluded,as a matter of state law,that the prosecution request was timely.accepting this conclusion,as we must,we find that paredes meets neither prong of washington.his counsel did not act deficiently by failing to raise a meritless objection moreover,the failure to make a meritless objection could not have prejudiced paredes 
second,even if the state courts had found the request untimely,we would decline to issue a coa,because counsel performance did not prejudice paredes.an error that is harmless as a matter of texas law is insufficient to satisfy the prejudice prong of washington the purpose of a jury shuffle is to ensure the compilation of a random list of jurors.ford state.as long as the panel is still random after the shuffle,the error that occurs when the court orders an untimely shuffle is harmless under texas law.see roberts state,pet.ref.the record contains no evidence that the final list was other than random.there is no prejudice we decline to issue a coa on the claim.
paredes claims his trial counsel was ineffective by failing to object to instructions that allowed the jury to convict him for the murder of torres and bravo,or torres and cain,or bravo and cain.paredes avers that counsel should have objected on due process grounds,because the instructions did not ensure the jury was unanimous as to precisely whom paredes murdered.for example,he claims some jurors could have concluded paredes caused the death of torres and bravo,but the remaining jurors might have believed he killed torres and cain.
for reasons we explain below,we grant a coa on the substantive issue of whether the trial court violated paredes constitutional rights by not requiring the jury to agree unanimously on precisely which of the victims he could be held responsible for killing.because the question whether counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to object to the instructions depends in part on whether the instructions were reversibly flawed,we grant a coa on this portion of paredes claim.
paredes contends he received ineffective assistance based on trial counsel failure to object to texas special issue number,which reads,state whether,taking into consideration all the evidence,including the circumstances of the offense,the defendant character and background,and the personal moral culpability of the defendant,there is a sufficient mitigating circumstance or are sufficient mitigating circumstances to warrant that a sentence of life imprisonment rather than a death sentence be imposed.
answer we,the jury,unanimously find and determine that the answer to this special issue is no.
or answer we,the jury,because at least jurors find that there is a sufficient mitigating circumstance or are sufficient mitigating circumstances to warrant that a sentence of life imprisonment rather than a death sentence be imposed answer this special issue yes.
paredes argues this special issue violates the sixth amendment,as interpreted in ring arizona,d,and apprendi new jersey,d,because it does not instruct that the state must prove a lack of mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt.
we have rejected this precise argument on previous occasions,holding that neither ring nor apprendi require s the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the absence of mitigating circumstances.an objection on this basis therefore would have been meritless failing to object was not deficient and did not harm paredes.we decline to issue a coa on this claim.
paredes argues that the trial court violated his federal constitutional rights by not requiring the jury to agree unanimously on precisely which of the victims paredes could be held responsible for killing.paredes was convicted under texas penal code a,which states that a person commits capital murder when the person murders more than one person a during the same criminal transaction or b during different criminal transactions but the murders are committed pursuant to the same scheme or course of conduct.the jurors were told they must reach a unanimous verdict.
paredes points out that based on the way the jury was instructed,it may have convicted him without reaching unanimity about which two or more persons he murdered.that assertion is far from meritless.for example,suppose that four jurors thought he murdered torres and bravo,another four thought he murdered torres and cain,and the last four thought he murdered bravo and cain.then,as to each respective victim,eight jurors thought paredes murdered that victim and four jurors thought he did not.this leads to the arguably perverse result that paredes could have been found not guilty of each of the three murders had they been charged individually none of which would have been a capital offense alone under the state statute,but guilty with the three charged together.
in resisting a coa,the state relies heavily on schad arizona,d,in which the court considered an arizona statute that defined murder as either premeditated murder or murder committed during the commission of another felony.the jury found the defendant guilty of murder but was not required to specify whether he committed premeditated murder or felony murder.id.at.the court held that a unanimity instruction was not constitutionally required.id.at.plurality opinion.scalia,concurring.
the plurality and concurrence in schad were careful to state the holding narrowly,mindful of the fluid conceptual boundary between calling two things different crimes and calling them different methods of committing the same crime.id.at.for the plurality,this raised due process concerns.id.at.it is an area wi
