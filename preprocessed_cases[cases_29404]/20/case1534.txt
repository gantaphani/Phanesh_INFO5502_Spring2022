factual and procedural background 
in,petitioner was tried and convicted of distribution of crack cocaine and sentenced to months imprisonment.he unsuccessfully appealed his conviction and sentence.united states soloman,case,wl cir.may,unpublished opinion.
on january,petitioner filed a motion in the district court requesting transcripts from his criminal case in order to file a section motion.attached to petitioner motion was a completed application to proceed in forma pauperis.petitioner indicated on this application that he was filing a motion pursuant to section.
on april,petitioner filed a motion in the district court entitled motion of notification of intent to file habus sic corpus to vacate,set aside,or correct sentence.in this motion,petitioner states that he intends to file a section motion but d ue to circumstances beyond his control,it is very unlikely that he will be able to file his motion before the april,deadline set by congress.petitioner explains those circumstances as follows 
the reason for inmate solomon delay in filing this motion is due to his transfer from the federal prison in marion,on march.at which time he was in the progress of completing his motion.he arrive d at the prison in memphis,on march,to secure his presence as a witness,for a trial that is to be held in memphis on april.due to inmate solomon presence at the federal prison at memphis,he w as separated him from his legal work at the prison in marion,until his return.also,due to inmate solomon being tran s fer red from a high security prison to a low security resulted in his being place d in segregated housing which has prevent ed him from any access to any legal material.
on april,petitioner filed a motion asking the district court to expedite its ruling on his previously filed motion for transcripts,which the district court had not yet addressed.in this motion,petitioner again states his intent to file a section motion,that he is attempting to file the motion by the april deadline,and that without the transcripts he must rely on his memory to present his arguments.the district court took no action on petitioner requests for transcripts.
on june,petitioner filed his section motion in which he raises eight claims challenging his conviction.petitioner signed and dated his motion on june.on august,the district court issued an order directing the government to file a response to the petition.the government filed its response on september,addressing only the merits of petitioner claims.
after petitioner filed a reply to the government response on november,he filed additional motions asking the district court to stay the proceedings,grant his request for transcripts,and allow him time to review the transcripts and amend his section motion if necessary.on march,almost fifteen months after petitioner filed his reply and without addressing the motions petitioner filed in the interim or his january and april,motions requesting transcripts,the district court referred petitioner section motion to a magistrate judge for disposition recommendation.
less than two weeks later,the magistrate judge filed his report and recommendation r r in which he sua sponte raised the aedpa statute of limitations and recommended that petitioner motion be dismissed because it was filed more than sixty days after expiration of the april,grace period for filing habeas petitions after the aedpa enactment the magistrate judge determined that the aedpa statute of limitations is subject to equitable tolling,but,applying the rare and exceptional circumstances test,concluded that petitioner failed to prove that he is entitled to relief.the magistrate judge reasoned 
petitioner has offered no explanation of why he delayed from may,to march,to prepare his motion,except his request for transcripts.there is no requirement that a motion be accompanied by transcripts,and solomon eventually filed his motion without them.he complains in his response that he does not have the transcripts,but then proceeds to tell his story of what happened in the crime and what happened afterwards between himself and his trial attorney,none of which would be reflected in the transcripts 
petitioner filed objections to the r r,contending that equitable tolling should apply under the circumstances presented.
on april,the district court issued a one and a half page order adopting and incorporating by reference the r r.in the order,the district court states that it conducted a de novo review of the record,especially in light of solomon objections.despite the fact that the r r did not address the merits of the petition,the court summarizes the magistrate judge opinion as conclud ing that none of the claims raised by defendant is meritorious and therefore recommend ing that defendant motion to vacate be denied on its merits.
petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration on april,in which he again asserted reasons for his delay in filing his section motion on november,the district court appointed counsel to represent petitioner.petitioner,through counsel,then filed a memorandum in support of petitioner motion for reconsideration on may.in this memorandum,petitioner pointed out that the magistrate judge r r never addressed the merits of the petition.petitioner further argued that he was entitled to equitable tolling,that the district court erred in not conducting a hearing to enable petitioner to develop and establish why he was entitled to equitable tolling,and that the district court should have tolled the running of the limitations period when petitioner filed his notice of intent to file a section motion.petitioner also asked the court to vacate its april order because,petitioner argued,the court apparently misconstrued and misinterpreted the r r as addressing the merits of the section motion.
on april,the district court conducted a status conference.at the conference,petitioner counsel apparently raised the issue of whether the court had the authority t j dismiss the petition on procedural grounds in light of scott collins,cir which had been issued in the interim.the status conference continued on may,and the following day the district court issued an order granting petitioner days to present additional evidence to support his motion for reconsideration,requiring the government to file a response days thereafter,and allowing petitioner to file a reply days later.
it does not appear from the record that petitioner presented additional evidence.there apparently was some confusion among the parties after the district court may,order,however,regarding the issues the district court wanted them to address in their supplemental pleadings perhaps because the magistrate judge recommended denial of the section motion based on the statute of limitations but the district court referred to the merits of the petition when it adopted the r r,or perhaps because of the discussion of scott at the status conference.the district court therefore scheduled an additional status conference for may.prior to the conference,on february,the government filed a supplemental response in which it argued that scott does not apply to section motions filed by federal prisoners.
on march,the district court issued an order denying petitioner motion for reconsideration.the court concluded that scott is inapplicable to section motions and that the magistrate judge therefore correctly recommended the dismissal of petitioner motion.the district court then identified the factors relevant to determining the appropriateness of equitable tolling set forth in dunlap united states,cir,but,without addressing those factors,concluded that petitioner was not entitled to equitable tolling.focusing on the merits of the claims raised in petitioner section motion,rather than on the statute of limitations issue,the district court also concluded that petitioner was not entitled to a certificate of appealability.
petitioner thereafter filed an appeal and moved this court for a certificate of appealability.on november,this court granted petitioner request for a certificate of appealability with respect to the following issues 
whether any issue regarding the timeliness of petitioner section motion was waived by the government failure to raise a limitations defense in its response 
whether any waiver by the government was cured by the opportunities that petitioner had to argue that his motion was timely 
whether the limitations period should be tolled for equitable reasons.
standard of review 
this court reviews a district court decision on the issue of equitable tolling de novo where the facts are undisputed.allen yukins,cir.
equitable tolling 
we apply the following factors to determine whether equitable tolling is appropriate the petitioner lack of notice of the filing requirement the petitioner lack of constructive knowledge of the filing requirement diligence in pursuing one rights absence of prejudice to the respondent and the petitioner reasonableness in remaining ignorant of the legal requirement for filing his claim.dunlap,at adopting factors set forth in andrews orr,cir.these five factors are not comprehensive,nor is each factor relevant in all cases.cook stegall,cir,cert.denied,d.the propriety of equitable tolling must necessarily be determined on a basis.truitt county of wayne,cir.this court has cautioned,however,that equitable tolling should be granted sparingly.dunlap,at.
petitioner concedes that he was aware of the aedpa grace period at the turn of.additionally,the government does not claim and the district court did not find any prejudice as a result of petitioner delay in filing his petition.we therefore must focus our inquiry on the third and fifth factors in the test set forth above.see vroman brigano,cir.again,those factors are petitioner diligence in pursuing his rights and his reasonableness in remaining ignorant of the legal requirement for filing his claim.
we will first consider petitioner reasonableness in remaining ignorant of the aedpa limitations period.as petitioner informs us,he was ignorant of congress adoption of a limitations period for habeas petitions from april,when the statute was enacted,until the turn of.this delay does not appear unreasonable in light of petitioner explanation that d ue to the circumstances that exist at marion,there is poor circulation of information on changing laws available to inmates.
with respect to petitioner diligence in pursuing his rights,petitioner provides the following description of his activities after learning of the aedpa limitations period.at the time,he was incarcerated in marion,illinois,where inmates gained access to the law library on a rotational basis petitioner explains that during the first few months of,there was great competitiveness amongst the inmates jocking sic for time in the small unit library at marion because of the aedpa time limitation.petitioner provides that he diligently worked day and night studying and preparing his until his unsuspected departure to memphis on march.it was during this time period,specifically on january,that petitioner filed a motion in the district court requesting transcripts he indicated he needs in order to file his section motion.
on march,petitioner was transferred without his legal materials to a facility in oklahoma,where he was placed in administrative detention pending his transfer to memphis,tennessee.upon learning that he was being transferred to memphis to secure his presence as a witness in an upcoming trial,petitioner immediately asked staff members at the oklahoma facility to provide him with the address or phone number of the clerk of the district court in cincinnati.according to petitioner,he wanted to inform the court of his situation.
when he arrived at the memphis low security was housed in segregated housing due to his maximum security classification.while he attempted to use the law library,he claims access was even more restricted than in marion.petitioner continued to seek the address or phone number of the clerk of the district court in cincinnati,and eventually a staff member arranged for petitioner to call the court.according to petitioner,he explained his predicament to one of the court clerks and was advised by the clerk to file a notification of intent to file his motion.petitioner claims that he called the court a second time to learn how to caption the motion and what he should state in the body of the motion.heeding that advice,on april,petitioner signed and forwarded to the district court his motion of notification of intent to file habeas corpus to vacate,set aside,or correct sentence.on may,petitioner was returned to marion and within a month completed his section motion.these facts demonstrate that petitioner diligently pursued his rights once he became aware of the aedpa statute of limitations.
relying on this court decision in cook,at,the government argues that petitioner is not entitled to equitable tolling because he has no excuse for sitting on his claims from the time his conviction and sentence became final sometime in until he began preparing his section motion in january.there are at least two reasons why cook is distinguishable from petitioner case.first,the petitioner in cook filed his habeas petition almost twelve years after his conviction became final.at.second,cook only excuse for filing the petition almost a month after the grace period expired was that the prison copier was broken a few days before the petition was due.id.at.here,petitioner was impeded from completing his petition more than one month before it was due and one month thereafter because of his transfer to other facilities to secure his testimony in a trial.additionally,prior to preparing his section motion,petitioner was not sleeping on his rights.instead,petitioner was taking steps he believed were necessary to craft his legal motion.as petitioner explains,based on the procedure for filing motions for habeas relief prior to congress adoption of a statute of limitations in the aedpa,he believed he had time to enhance his knowledge of the law,while raising his level of formal education.
we do not fault petitioner for any delay in pursuing his rights based on his lack the limitations period was enacted.as the magistrate judge noted in his r r,prior to the enactment of the aedpa,a habeas petitioner could file at any time.in fact,before the statute of limitations was adopted,even a year delay in filing a habeas petition did not bar its consideration,provided there was no prejudice to the government from the delay.see,buchanon mintzes,cir concluding that delay of years in mounting federal habeas corpus challenge to guilty pleas did not bar petitioner claim where state had not been prejudiced in its ability to respond to the claims see also strahan blackburn,cir surveying all appellate level cases applying former rule a of the rules governing section cases,which employ the doctrine of laches to determine whether a petition must be dismissed due to delay,and citing cases declining to dismiss petitions where delay was as lengthy as twenty years.
based on the above,we conclude that this is an appropriate case to equitably toll the aedpa statute of limitations.petitioner section motion therefore is not and should be reviewed on its merits.accordingly,the case will be remanded to the district court.
petitioner argues that on remand this case should be reassigned to a different district court judge.pursuant to,we have the authority to order the reassignment of a case on remand.reassignment,however,is an extraordinary power and should be rarely invoked reassignments should be made infrequently and with the greatest reluctance.sagan united states,cir quoting armco,united steelworkers of,local,cir.to determine whether reassignment is necessary,we consider whether the original judge would reasonably be expected to have substantial difficulty in putting out of his or her mind previously expressed views or findings whether reassignment is advisable to preserve the appearance of justice and whether reassignment would entail waste and duplication out of proportion to any gain in preserving the appearance of fairness.id.citation omitted.
we conclude that reassignment is not necessary in this case.there is a benefit to having the district court judge who presided over the defendant trial review the defendant subsequently filed section motion.it may not be necessary to call the district judge as a witness,as petitioner suggests,because a district judge simply may rely on his or her recollections of the criminal proceedings in deciding a section motion without testifying.see blanton united states,cir citing blackledge allison,d.while the district court handling of petitioner request for habeas relief was not correct,we do not find that it was based on any improper conceptions regarding the merits of petitioner claims.
accordingly,this matter is remanded to the united states district court for the southern district of ohio for consideration of the merits of the petition for habeas corpus relief.
congress imposed new and substantial restrictions on the writ of habeas corpus by its enactment of the landmark antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa.at issue in the present case is aedpa statute of limitations and its specific tolling provisions for petitions brought pursuant to.were it not for dunlap united states,cir,and our subsequent published decisions that have followed dunlap i would give effect to the plain language of and hold that solomon petition for habeas corpus relief is barred by the statute of limitations.furthermore,i would hold that the plain wording of does not provide for equitable tolling.
in,christopher solomon was convicted in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio of knowingly and intentionally possessing cocaine base crack with intent to distribute in violation of a.in connection with petitioner timely appeal to this court,transcripts of the trial court proceedings were prepared and furnished to petitioner his counsel.in may,this court affirmed petitioner conviction and sentence in an unpublished order,united states soloman,wl cir.may.
over four years later,on june,solomon filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to the rights afforded him by.solomon petition was a form furnished by the united states district court ao,revised.it alleged ineffective assistance of counsel,among other claims,and attached a typewritten argument.
solomon petition for a writ of habeas corpus was clearly untimely,pursuant to the plain language of.specifically,the habeas corpus provision under which petitioner seeks relief provides for the following period of limitation and tolling periods 
a period of limitation shall apply to a motion under this section.the limitation period shall run from the latest of 
the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final 
the date on which the impediment to making a motion created by governmental action in violation of the constitution or laws of the united states is removed,if the movant was prevented from making a motion by such governmental action 
the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the supreme court,if that right has been newly recognized by the supreme court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review or 
the date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.
congress added the statutory period and its specific tolling provisions as part of aedpa,effective april.because solomon filed his habeas petition after aedpa effective date,aedpa statute of limitations and its tolling provisions apply to this case.lindh murphy,d.
in the district court,and on appeal,petitioner does not argue any of the tolling provisions enacted by congress.rather,solomon asserts that his untimely habeas corpus petition should be excused because of the doctrine of equitable tolling.
recently,in arlington central sch.dist.bd.of ed.murphy,d,the supreme court emphasized the following fundamental principles of statutory construction 
we have stated time and again that courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.connecticut nat.bank germain,d.when the statutory language is plain,the sole function of the least where the disposition required by the text is not to enforce it according to its terms.hartford underwriters ins.union planters bank,d quoting united states ron pair enterprises,d,in turn quoting caminetti united states.internal quotation marks omitted.
as justice scalia has further elaborated 
the text is the law,and it is the text that must be observed.i agree with justice holmes remark,quoted approvingly by justice frankfurter in his article on the construction of statutes only a day or two counsel talked of the intention of a legislature,i was indiscreet enough to say i do care what their intention was.i only want to know what the words mean.and i agree with holmes other remark,quoted approvingly by justice jackson we do not inquire what the legislature meant we ask only what the statute means.
antonin scalia,a matter of interpretation federal courts and the law princeton.press.
to date,the supreme court has yet to rule whether the judiciary is authorized to rewrite to include other equitable grounds of tolling not provided for by congress.see pace diguglielmo,d.although justices stevens and souter have suggested that aedpa statutes of limitation may be subject to equitable tolling,duncan walker,d stevens,concurring,in part,joined by souter,the majority of the court has construed aedpa according to its text our task is to construe what congress has enacted.we begin,as always,with the language of the statute.duncan,at.
moreover,the court has rejected the argument that equitable tolling should apply to plain,specific,and detailed statutes of limitation.in united states brockamp,d,a unanimous court rejected the respondent invitation to rewrite for nonstatutory equitable reasons a statute of limitations enacted by congress for the filing of tax refunds.justice breyer,writing for all nine justices,explained 
the taxpayers rest their claim for equitable tolling upon irwin department of veterans affairs,d,a case in which this court considered the timeliness of an employee lawsuit charging his government employer with discrimination,in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,et.the court found the lawsuit untimely,but nevertheless tolled the limitations period.it held that the rule of equitable tolling applies to suits against the government,in the same way that it is applicable to title vii suits against private employers,at.the court went on to say that the same rebuttable presumption of equitable tolling applicable to suits against private defendants should also apply to suits against the united states,at.
the taxpayers,pointing to irwin,argue that principles of equitable tolling would have applied had they sued private defendants,had they sought restitution from private defendants for money had and received.see keigwin,cases in common law pleading ed.they add that given irwin language,there must be a presumption that limitations periods in tax refund suits against the government can be equitably tolled.and,they say,that presumption,while rebuttable,has not been rebutted.they conclude that,given irwin,the ninth circuit correctly tolled the statutory period for equitable reasons.
in evaluating this argument,we are willing to assume,favorably to the taxpayers but only for argument sake,that a tax refund suit and a private suit for restitution are sufficiently similar to warrant asking irwin negatively phrased question is there good reason to believe that congress did not want the equitable tolling doctrine to apply but see flora united states,d citing curtis administratrix fiedler,black.distinguishing suit against the tax collector from action of assumpsit for money had and received george moore ice cream rose.see also plumb,tax refund suits against collectors of internal revenue,harv.describing collector suit as a fiction solely designed to bring the government into court.we can travel no further,however,along irwin road,for there are strong reasons for answering irwin question in the government favor.
section sets forth its time limitations in unusually emphatic form.ordinarily limitations statutes use fairly simple language,which one can often plausibly read as containing an implied equitable tolling exception.see,c requiring suit for employment discrimination to be filed w ithin days of receipt of notice of final eeoc action.but uses language that is not simple.it sets forth its limitations in a highly detailed technical manner,that,linguistically speaking,can not easily be read as containing implicit exceptions.
to read an equitable tolling provision into these provisions,one would have to assume an implied exception for tolling virtually every time a number appears.to do so would work a kind of linguistic havoc.moreover,such an interpretation would require tolling,not only procedural limitations,but also substantive limitations on the amount of kind of tolling for which we have found no direct precedent.section detail,its technical language,the iteration of the limitations in both procedural and substantive forms,and the explicit listing of exceptions,taken together,indicate to us that congress did not intend courts to read other unmentioned,equitable exceptions into the statute that it wrote.
brockamp,at.emphasis added.
a year later,in united states beggerly,d,the supreme court followed brockamp and held that the statute of limitation contained in the quiet title act,was not subject to equitable tolling.in doing so,the court held,equitable tolling is not permissible when it is inconsistent with the text of the relevant statute.beggerly,at.
furthermore,as the supreme court cautioned in baldwin county welcome center brown,d 
procedural requirements established by congress for gaining access to the federal courts are not to be disregarded by courts out of a vague sympathy for particular litigants.as we stated in mohasco silver,d,in the long run,experience teaches that strict adherence to the procedural requirements specified by the legislature is the best guarantee of evenhanded administration of the law.
in the civil arena,the michigan supreme court has cited separation of powers concerns in rejecting the application of equitable tolling to a clear and unambiguous statute of limitation 
indeed,if a court is free to cast aside,under the guise of equity,a plain statute such as simply because the court views the statute as unfair,then our system of government ceases to function as a representative democracy.no longer will policy debates occur,and policy choices be made,in the legislature.instead,an aggrieved party need only convince a willing judge to rewrite the statute under the name of equity.while such an approach might be extraordinarily efficient for a particular litigant,the amount of damage it causes to the separation of powers mandate of our constitution and the overall structure of our government is immeasurable.
devillers auto club ins.ass n.see also secura ins.ins.
absent a constitutional violation,it is our role as judges to faithfully ascertain and give effect to the laws as written by congress.we must not succumb to the temptation to rewrite the law to comport with our subjective notions of fairness and equity.otherwise,our nation laws enacted by congress are meaningless.see robert bork,the tempting of america the political seduction of the law free press.
were i permitted to do so,i would apply the rationale of brockamp and beggerly to the limitation period of specified by congress in its enactment of aedpa.on this issue,i agree with the following observations of the district court for the eastern district of michigan,which stated 
section expressly lists four different events,the latest of which determines when the limitations period begins to run.the detail of and its direct and express determination of when the time limit begins indicates that congress did not intend to permit courts to read other unmentioned and equitable exceptions into the statute.
giles united states,d,overruled by dunlap.giles applies,in effect,the traditional and canon of statutory construction expressio unius est exclusio alterius the mention of one thing implies the exclusion of another.see cavanaugh cardinal local sch,cir,and ohio nemecek,cir.consistent with the analysis of brockamp and beggerly,should not be rewritten by the judiciary because it is a detailed statute of limitation containing specific tolling provisions agreed upon by congress.
in dunlap united states,our court did not cite or attempt to distinguish brockamp and beggerly.instead,after relying on irwin dep t of veterans affairs,d,for the proposition that there is a rebuttable presumption that equitable tolling applies to civil actions against the government,we summarily concluded that,because the limitation provision of is a statute of limitation,rather than a jurisdictional bar,it is subject to judicial tolling.in a footnote,the dunlap panel cited opinions from our sister circuits to the same effect.for the most part,these decisions contain little analysis and fail to acknowledge the limits of irwin subsequently established by the supreme court in brockamp and beggerly.harris hutchinson,cir,and calderon united states dist.court for the cent.dist.of cal.beeler,cir,overruled on other grounds,cir en banc,are two of the very few decisions that even attempt to distinguish brockamp beggerly.these circuit court decisions that attempt to confine the precedential effect of brockamp and beggerly to the tax code and quiet title cases are not persuasive.in my view,the decisions of our sister circuits should not be followed.
first,unlike irwin,the present case is not a civil action against the government seeking civil remedies,but rather a collateral attack on a criminal conviction through a petition for habeas corpus.the collateral review of criminal convictions involve considerations that are considerably different than actions against the government for damages or other civil relief.
second,the subsequent supreme court decisions of brockamp and beggerly have clarified the limited scope of irwin.in particular,brockamp held that judicial tolling is not permitted when congress has enacted a detailed and specific statute of limitations.later,in beggerly,the supreme court held that judicial tolling may not be imposed if such tolling is contrary to the text of the statute.brockamp and beggerly clearly restrain the use of judicial tolling envisioned and applied by some courts in all actions in which the government is a party.
third,and most fundamentally,the separation of powers mandated by our constitution is violated when,for perceived reasons of fairness or equity,the judicial branch rewrites clear and unambiguous laws enacted by the legislature.without pretense,and for reasons of equity,this is what the courts have done in imposing equitable tolling to the specific and detailed statute of limitations enacted by congress for habeas corpus petitions.
nonetheless,i recognize that in dunlap united states,cir,and subsequent published opinions,our court has concluded that the limitation period of is subject to the doctrine of equitable tolling.until these precedentially binding decisions are overruled,i am bound to follow and apply them.cir.c.
in andrews orr,cir,we established a test for judicial tolling in civil cases.later,in dunlap,a panel of this court
