in,a jury convicted donald middlebrooks of the kidnaping and murder of kerrick majors,a youth,and sentenced middlebrooks to death.the tennessee supreme court affirmed the convictions but vacated the death sentence in.in,a jury again sentenced middlebrooks to death after finding that the murder was especially heinous,atrocious,or cruel and after weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances.middlebrooks raised a number of constitutional claims in state postconviction proceedings and in a subsequent habeas petition in federal district court.the district court denied relief on all claims and denied a certificate of applicability coa.
this court granted a coa with respect to seven issues in three categories ineffective assistance of counsel due to a failure to investigate and present mitigating evidence of brain damage,b failure to investigate and present mitigating evidence of physical and sexual abuse,c failure to prepare adequately for the testimony of a expert witness,and d failure to investigate and present mitigating evidence of the relative dominance of a violation of the confrontation clause based on the trial court refusal to grant middlebrooks counsel access to a prosecution witness hospital records and prosecutorial misconduct based on the statements during closing argument that a the victim family wanted the jury to return a verdict of death,and b the bible teaches that the death penalty is the appropriate punishment for murder.after careful review,we now affirm the district court judgment denying middlebrooks habeas petition.
background 
in,a jury heard evidence of middlebrooks involvement in majors murder during the guilt phase of middlebrooks capital trial,summarized as follows by the tennessee supreme court 
o n the evening of sunday,april,around,the victim,kerrick majors,a black male,was with four friends on gallatin road in east nashville,tennessee,when they saw a table with a lot of stuff being set up across the street as a flea market by three homeless street persons the defendant,donald middlebrooks a white male his wife,tammy middlebrooks and their companion,roger brewington.the five boys ran across gallatin road and were looking at the flea market when tammy middlebrooks called out,hey,leave our stuff alone the boys started running.the defendant and brewington chased them until they caught majors.brewington grabbed majors in a sleeper hold around his neck and head.the defendant held his hand.when majors said,hey man,you know me,brewington responded,shut up,you nigger.shannon stewart and another of the boys,tony watson,saw the two men drag majors toward the table and observed the defendant strike him in the face,knocking him to the ground.frightened,the boys took off running.later that evening,they reported these events to the victim mother,who called the police.
the next afternoon,kerrick majors nude body was discovered lying face up in a dry creek bed under a foam mattress in a heavily wooded area behind a drugstore on gallatin road in the area where the defendant and brewington had caught majors.a bloodstained was tied around his neck.a red rope belt was tied around majors left wrist,and there was a laceration in his right wrist.abrasions,swelling,and bruising were present on the victim head,his left eye,his nose,his lips,and inside his mouth.an x with a vertical line running through it had been cut into his chest.the forensic pathologist,charles harlan,testified that these incisions had been made while majors was alive.there were two deep stab wounds in the center of the body.one of these penetrated the left lung and pulmonary artery and caused the victim to bleed to death over a period of ten to thirty minutes,during part of which majors was conscious.investigating officers noticed a smell of urine about the face,and there were bruises and skinned areas on the back.a wooden stick with blood stains on one end was found lying close to the victim head.
around on april,police investigators met brewington at a doughnut shop several miles from the gallatin road area.brewington directed the officers to the location of a knife with a brass knuckle handle,which was bloodstained.harlan testified that this knife could have inflicted the deep stab wounds on the victim body.brewington also directed the police to a wooded area between gallatin road and ellington parkway in nashville where,around on april,donald and tammy middlebrooks were apprehended at a small plywood shack.the defendant,who resisted the arresting officers,had a knife with him.he was arrested with the aid of police dogs,taken to the hospital for treatment of the dog bites,and later transported to police headquarters.
at that day,the defendant gave a lengthy statement about his involvement in the death of kerrick majors.the defendant admitted participating in the beating and mistreatment of majors,but described his role as minor and depicted roger brewington as the primary perpetrator of the offense.after majors was caught,middlebrooks said brewington suggested they have some fun,and the three of them took majors back into the woods.his hands were tied.brewington slapped him,beat him with the knife brass knuckles,hit him with a stick,and urinated into his mouth.the defendant admitted striking majors with his open hand and on the leg with a switch.defendant said that his wife tammy had slapped majors and burned majors nose with a cigarette lighter as brewington urged her on.brewington hit majors on his testicles,threatened to cut it open,stuck a stick up majors anus,hit him some more with the brass knuckles,wiped the victim blood on himself,beat his mouth and tongue with a stick,dropped the knife on him,gagged him,and slashed his wrist.finally,when the defendant asked brewington to stop because the victim crying and pleading were getting on his nerves,brewington gave the victim the kiss of death on the forehead.brewington then gave the defendant the knife and told him to stab majors.when the defendant refused,brewington stabbed majors.the defendant then reluctantly stabbed the victim,according to him,to prove to roger that i guess i was cooler and to put majors out of his misery.in a previous statement,however,the defendant had said that he had stabbed majors twice.the victim ordeal began at and ended at that night with the stabbing.
the next day,the defendant said he and brewington went back to where they had left the body.brewington kicked it and made the x lacerations at this time.the defendant said he then covered majors with a foam mattress.the defendant admitted that before beating and killing majors,he and brewington had drunk alcohol and smoked marijuana.
the defendant presented no proof.
state middlebrooks.on the basis of this evidence,the jury convicted middlebrooks of felony murder and aggravated kidnaping but acquitted him of premeditated murder,armed robbery,and aggravated sexual battery.during the penalty phase of his trial,the jury found two aggravating the murder was especially heinous,atrocious,and cruel in that it involved torture or depravity of mind,and that it was committed while middlebrooks perpetrated a that those aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors.the jury therefore sentenced middlebrooks to death.
on direct appeal,the tennessee supreme court affirmed middlebrooks convictions but vacated his death sentence because the second aggravating circumstance essentially duplicates the elements of the offense of felony murder and therefore does not sufficiently narrow the population of felony murder defendants under the eighth amendment to the constitution,and article i,of the tennessee constitution.id.at.
at the second sentencing proceeding,held in october,the state introduced evidence supporting the events and the following details 
according to the state proof,majors was small for his he was described as a good student who loved school.he was not a violent person,nor did he carry a weapon.since his murder,his mother health has deteriorated.she has been on medication and will not leave the house except for doctor appointments.she has had a nervous breakdown,suffers from panic attacks,and has not been able to sleep at night since the murder.majors older brother blames himself for majors death and now suffers from mood swings.
the autopsy indicated that kerrick majors was tall and weighed pounds.
shannon stewart testified that he had spoken with middlebrooks the morning of the murder.middlebrooks had told stewart that he was a member of the kkk,that he hated niggers,and that he punched a black man just for saying hello.stewart also testified that he overheard middlebrooks order majors to shut up nigger.
state middlebrooks.in mitigation,middlebrooks attorneys put forth the following evidence 
middlebrooks cousins,james and carol sue little,and his,sharon fuchs,testified about middlebrooks childhood.middlebrooks grew up in texas.his father died when he was four.his mother remarried and had another child,fuchs,before she again divorced.middlebrooks mother either left the children at night with relatives or else would take them to bars with her.
according to the proof,middlebrooks mother would often bring men to the house,and the children sometimes heard or saw their mother having sex.fuchs testified that sometimes these men would molest her while her mother watched.she further testified that she,middlebrooks,and other children in the family were molested by different family members.for example,middlebrooks was often left alone with a male relative who had sexually abused him,and middlebrooks mother would grab him between his legs and also watch him use the bathroom.according to sharon fuchs,the small town in which they grew up lacked counseling services or social service agencies where they could seek help for sexual abuse.according to her,no one in the family ever discussed or admitted the family problems.
the proof further indicated that middlebrooks was often angry and got into trouble.he was sent to a methodist home for children in waco for two years.later,he was twice sent to prison.between prison stays,middlebrooks started to have seizures.on one occasion he climbed a water tower and threatened to commit suicide.he was hospitalized more than once at a mental institution.
a psychologist,jeffrey smalldon,performed neuropsychological and psychological evaluations of middlebrooks.from these evaluations,interviews,testing,and prior education and medical records,smalldon concluded that middlebrooks has a severe borderline personality disorder.middlebrooks exhibited several characteristics of the disorder including inconsistent behavior,instability of mood,a marked identity disturbance,impulsive and reckless behavior,poor anger control,and recurring suicidal or acts.smalldon testified that the documents from other mental health professionals who have evaluated middlebrooks indicate that he suffers from substance abuse,psychotic personality disorder,and schizophrenia.middlebrooks also suffers a mild degree of organic brain impairment which causes him to be more impulsive and less able to delay his responses.finally,smalldon testified that middlebrooks has also exhibited characteristics of adults who were sexually abused as children.
during,smalldon admitted that middlebrooks confessed to a greater involvement in majors death than he had in the confession.for instance,smalldon disclosed that middlebrooks admitted to him that it was his idea to hold majors for ransom,that he helped tie majors up,and that he urinated on majors.in an attempt to resolve the discrepancies between the confession to the police and the confession made to him in the interview,smalldon explained that middlebrooks is a chronic liar.smalldon conceded that middlebrooks had never expressed any remorse to him.smalldon agreed that there were some indications in the medical records of middlebrooks malingering,but testified that these indications were not inconsistent with mental illness.
in rebuttal,the state introduced the testimony of two experts indicating that middlebrooks was exaggerating his mental illness symptoms,that he was competent to stand trial,that he did not have a defense of insanity,and that he was not committable.one expert testified that he could not say whether middlebrooks was mentally ill.the other expert testified that he made no finding of mental illness and did not consider a personality disorder to be a mental illness.
id.at.the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt the statutory aggravating circumstance that the murder was especially heinous,atrocious,or cruel in that it involved torture or depravity of mind.concluding that this aggravating circumstance outweighed middlebrooks mitigating factors,the jury reimposed a sentence of death.the tennessee court of criminal appeals and tennessee supreme court affirmed the sentence on direct appeal.state middlebrooks,wl,unpublished opinion middlebrooks.
in november,middlebrooks filed a petition for postconviction relief in state court,raising,inter alia,ineffective assistance of counsel based on trial counsel alleged inadequate performance during the resentencing proceeding.in may,while the petition was pending,the state trial court denied middlebrooks ex parte motion for funds to conduct brain scans on middlebrooks.after an evidentiary hearing at which middlebrooks resentencing attorneys testified,the trial court dismissed the petition in july.the tennessee court of criminal appeals affirmed.middlebrooks state,no,wl,unpublished opinion.
middlebrooks filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal district court in september,amending it in.the district court denied all sixteen claims with their multiple subclaims raised therein,concluding that some were procedurally defaulted and rejecting others on the merits.middlebrooks bell.may,unpublished opinion.the district court denied a coa and then,on remand from this court,issued a more particularized denial.middlebrooks bell,wl.we then granted a coa on the seven issues discussed below.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
this court reviews de novo a district court denial of a petition for writ of habeas corpus.white mitchell,cir.because middlebrooks filed his habeas petition after the effective date of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,that statute deference provisions apply.joseph coyle,cir.under aedpa,when a state court addresses the merits of a claim,a federal court can grant the writ only if the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court,or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts.d.when a state court does not address the merits of a claim,federal review is de novo.maples stegall,cir.
federal review is barred altogether by the doctrine of procedural default when a petitioner has defaulted his federal claims in state court pursuant to an independent and adequate state procedural rule.mitchell mason,cir.this doctrine applies only if the requirements laid out in maupin smith,cir,are met first,the procedural rule applied to the petitioner and he failed to follow it second,the state court actually denied his claim based on the state procedural rule and third,the rule constituted an adequate and independent state ground to deny relief,meaning that the rule was firmly established and regularly followed in the state courts.id.at mitchell,at.if these requirements are met,a petitioner can still overcome procedural default by either demonstrating cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law,or demonstrating that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.murphy ohio,cir internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.
ineffective assistance of counsel 
middlebrooks claims that trial counsel rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance in violation of his sixth amendment rights during his second sentencing proceeding.the benchmark for judging any claim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial can not be relied on as having produced a just result.strickland washington.the supreme court has separated this inquiry into two parts whether counsel performance was deficient and whether the deficiency prejudiced the petitioner defense.id.at.attorney performance is deficient if it is unreasonable under the prevailing professional norms.id.at.a strategic decision will not be the basis of a finding of deficient performance so long as that strategic decision was reasonable.id.at english romanowski,cir.a defendant can establish prejudice by showing that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland,at.
middlebrooks claim focuses on four alleged shortcomings failure to present evidence of brain damage,failure to present evidence of physical and sexual abuse suffered as a child,failure adequately to prepare smalldon for,and failure to present evidence of brewington relative dominance in majors murder.we address each in turn.
failure to investigate and present evidence of brain damage 
in claim a of his habeas petition,middlebrooks claims that his attorneys failed to investigate and present evidence of middlebrooks brain damage and related seizure disorder and mental illness that would have enhanced his mitigation case.the core of his argument is that counsel should have arranged for an mri or pet scan of middlebrooks brain.in support of his claim,middlebrooks presents an mri and a pet scan paid for by his habeas attorneys and affidavits from several neuroscientists stating that those scans reveal abnormalities in the areas of middlebrooks brain responsible for emotions,behavior control,and social judgment.
as a threshold matter,the state argues that this claim is procedurally defaulted.contrary to the district court opinion,middlebrooks did present this claim to the state courts,pleading in his petition for postconviction relief counsel failure to move for expert assistance of a neurologist who could have conducted necessary testing and provided expert testimony regarding the issue of brain damage and its effect upon petitioner.at.problematically,however,middlebrooks failed to offer any authority in support of this claim on postconviction appeal,in contravention of procedural rules.we consider the maupin factors to determine whether those rules now bar our review.
tennessee court of criminal appeals rule b provides that i ssues which are not supported by argument,citation to authorities,or appropriate references to the record will be treated as waived in this court.rule a of the tennessee rules of appellate procedure provides that an appellant brief must contain a n argument including the reasons why the contentions require appellate relief,with citations to the authorities and appropriate references to the record,and rule g requires attorneys to cite specific pages when citing the record.middlebrooks failed to comply with these court rules when he merely listed his claim among several others in an addendum to his appellate brief in an effort to preserve these issues as much as is possible.at.the state appeals court actually enforced the procedural rules when it held that all claims listed in the addendum are waived because middlebrooks failed to reference the record,cite any authority,or present any argument regarding these issues.see middlebrooks,wl,at citing.b and.a,g.finally,a review of tennessee cases indicates that these appellate court rules are firmly established,and middlebrooks does not argue otherwise.see state mccary,state thompson,state schaller,see also lewis tennessee,app x,cir unpublished opinion finding procedural default based on state court application of.b and.a killebrew bernhardt,wl,at cir,unpublished opinion same.
accordingly,claim a is procedurally defaulted unless middlebrooks can demonstrate cause and prejudice or that a miscarriage of justice will result.middlebrooks relies on the former exception,offering as cause the state postconviction court denial of his request for funding to hire a neuroscientist who could perform mri and pet scans.as the state points out,in support of his argument middlebrooks cites only cases holding that e does not prevent the district court from holding an evidentiary hearing when the petitioner failure to develop the record in state court resulted from the state courts denial of funds.these cases can help middlebrooks put his new evidence before a federal habeas court,but they do not help him establish cause for procedural default.notwithstanding the citation of inapposite cases,however,middlebrooks argument is properly directed at procedural default.he argues in his reply brief that he failed to present evidence relating to brain damage because he was denied funding to develop that evidence.reply br.at.in essence,he argues that he failed to brief the claim on postconviction appeal because he had no new evidence to support it,and he had no new evidence because the trial court denied him funding.the new evidence of brain damage came to light only when middlebrooks habeas attorneys drew on their own funds to conduct mri and pet scans.
though middlebrooks argument is not without force,we ultimately can not conclude that the trial court denial of funds excuses middlebrooks failure to comply with the tennessee court briefing rules in presenting his claim on postconviction appeal.middlebrooks could have argued deficient performance by providing evidence that it was standard practice among capital defense attorneys in the in tennessee to obtain an mri or pet scan when there are indications of brain damage.alternatively,he could have argued,as he does now,that smalldon observations should have led counsel to seek a brain scan.regarding prejudice,we acknowledge that middlebrooks would have had more difficulty without the scans than with them in convincing the state court that the jury might have sentenced him to life.nonetheless,middlebrooks at least could have argued that a brain scan confirming smalldon suspicion of organic brain damage would have made a stronger impression on the jury.thus,although the trial court denial of funds certainly explains why middlebrooks could not make his argument as forcefully as he could have with the brain scans,it does not explain his failure to make any argument at all.accordingly,middlebrooks has not demonstrated cause,and his claim for ineffective assistance of counsel by failure to investigate and present further evidence of brain damage is procedurally defaulted.
failure to investigate and present evidence of physical and sexual abuse 
in claim b of his habeas petition,middlebrooks argues that his trial counsel were constitutionally ineffective in failing to uncover and present evidence of the traumatic physical and sexual abuse that he endured as a child.specifically,middlebrooks states that the jury never learned that he was forced into child prostitution by his mother to make money for alcohol and drugs and was himself introduced to alcohol and drugs including marijuana and heroin by his mother at a very young age,or that he was repeatedly raped,beaten,and subjected to sexual torture by family friends,relatives,his own mother,his mother boyfriends,and his mother with his mother knowledge and permission.pet r br.at.furthermore,he alleges that the jury never learned that these traumatic childhood experiences resulted in ptsd,which,according to one expert,impaired middlebrooks from effectively conforming his behavior to the law at the time of the offense for which he has been sentenced to death.at.
in fact,the jury heard much of this evidence from middlebrooks sharon fuchs and from smalldon.they testified that middlebrooks mother sometimes took the kids to bars with her and sometimes left them there that she brought men home for sex that the children at times heard and saw her having sex and that fuchs was at times made to participate in the sex.fuchs and smalldon also testified that an uncle named edwards molested fuchs and middlebrooks that fuchs witnessed a pedophile cousin named john eugene little anally rape middlebrooks when middlebrooks was thirteen or fourteen years old that little raped middlebrooks multiple times that middlebrooks mother knew about little conduct but nonetheless had him babysit the children that she herself used to grab middlebrooks between the legs and watch him go to the bathroom and that she forced middlebrooks to perform sex acts on her on a frequent basis for two to three years.after reviewing these events,smalldon discussed common effects of childhood sexual abuse,including emotional numbing,tendency to devalue oneself and others,and repressed anger.smalldon explained that he observed many of these effects in middlebrooks and that he believed middlebrooks suffered from severe borderline personality disorder.
to be sure,middlebrooks now highlights details that his trial counsel did not bring out.middlebrooks presents evidence that he was raped by little at age eight,that little beat him and tortured his sexual organs,that his mother routinely had full intercourse with him beginning when he was ten years old,and that she prostituted middlebrooks to men who would orally or anally rape him.middlebrooks also provides a new diagnosis of ptsd.the critical question in our sixth amendment analysis is whether trial counsel were ineffective in failing to bring out these additional details.
we do not reach this question,however,because we conclude that middlebrooks has procedurally defaulted claim b.as with claim a,middlebrooks failed to brief this issue on appeal of the denial of his petition for postconviction relief,and the appeals court denied relief based on tennessee court of criminal appeals rule b and tennessee rules of appellate procedure a and g.for the reasons discussed above,this procedural ruling was an independent and adequate state ground for denying the claim.middlebrooks makes no attempt to demonstrate cause and prejudice or to argue that he meets the exception.the doctrine of procedural default therefore bars federal habeas review.
failure adequately to prepare for the testimony of jeffrey smalldon 
in claim e of his habeas petition,middlebrooks argues that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance in either putting smalldon on the stand or failing to prepare him to provide stronger testimony and avoid being devastated on.middlebrooks did not address this claim in his opening brief here.even after the state pointed out the omission,middlebrooks failed to argue the claim in his reply brief.the issue is therefore abandoned.geboy brigano,cir.
failure to investigate and present evidence of the relative dominance of roger brewington 
in claim hh of his habeas petition,middlebrooks argues that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to present mitigating evidence of brewington dominance over middlebrooks in majors murder.because the tennessee court of criminal appeals resolved this claim on the merits on postconviction review,it is properly before us.the state court declined to decide whether trial counsel performance was deficient and rejected the claim based on lack of prejudice.therefore,we review the performance prong of the claim de novo but the prejudice determination under aedpa deference.
middlebrooks sentencing jury did hear some evidence that brewington was the leader in the murder.this evidence came in through middlebrooks videotaped confession and smalldon testimony.in the confession,middlebrooks described brewington as the leader,recounting that brewington dragged majors into the woods,tied his hands and beat him with brass knuckles,tortured his genitals,repeatedly dropped a knife on him,and urinated in his mouth.middlebrooks explained that brewington challenged him to stab majors and that after refusing initially,middlebrooks did so only after brewington first stabbed majors.middlebrooks claimed that he stabbed majors to prove himself to brewington and to end majors ordeal.middlebrooks also said that he did not stop brewington from torturing majors because he was afraid of brewington.smalldon confirmed that middlebrooks claimed to have stabbed majors under pressure from brewington and that he feared brewington.smalldon also reported that,according to middlebrooks,brewington told majors that he would sacrifice majors to satan.based on his examinations,smalldon further opined that middlebrooks had a weak personality and could be egged on to commit crimes.in addition to advancing this evidence,trial counsel touched briefly on the theory of mitigation in closing argument,stating that o nly when roger brewington,bigger,not as old in the point of chronology,but when roger brewington shows up,that is when the trouble starts.at.
during postconviction proceedings,middlebrooks advanced several additional pieces of evidence supporting his theory of mitigation.these included a report by clinical psychologist kenneth anchor who examined brewington and wrote that brewington had poor impulse control,unsocialized,aggressive behavior,and a volatile temperament and that brewington showed no remorse for his role in majors murder,at foster care records repeatedly citing brewington tendency to manipulate others and to dominate the other students,at testimony by a police officer at brewington trial that brewington appeared to be twenty or years old and that brewington showed no remorse for his actions a signed statement by brewington swearing to serve the devil racist cartoons and writings by brewington documentation that brewington assaulted a juvenile detention center officer in admissions from brewington that he was under the influence of cocaine and had consumed a case of beer the day of the murder and brewington presentence report,reflecting the state argument for a sentencing enhancement because it is obvious that the actual acts which the defendant admitted inflicting upon the victim showed him to be a leader and not a follower,at.in addition,psychologist jay woodman testified at the postconviction evidentiary hearing based on a prison interview with brewington that brewington had a domineering personality and was impervious to peer criticism or peer pressure.postconviction hr g tr.at,dist.doc,addendum.woodman,who had also examined middlebrooks,testified that middlebrooks would be much more likely to follow someone else lead.id.at.
middlebrooks trial counsel testified at the postconviction evidentiary hearing that they knew that brewington looked older than he was,that they were aware of anchor report,that they had seen some but not all of brewington documents,and that they had reviewed the transcripts of brewington trial.although counsel intended to emphasize at resentencing that,of the players involved,middlebrooks was the lesser player,at,they did not present all of the evidence of brewington relative dominance that they did uncover or seek more evidence because they were concerned that the state would call brewington to the stand in rebuttal.that is,trial counsel made a strategic decision not to investigate and present further evidence of brewington dominant role in the murder.the record provides a basis for counsel concern about provoking harmful testimony from brewington.brewington had given a statement to the police indicating that middlebrooks told majors to remove his clothes,that middlebrooks made the decision to kill majors,and that middlebrooks was responsible for both stabs to majors body.see middlebrooks,wl,at.moreover,brewington maintained at his own trial that middlebrooks had dropped the knife on majors,seemed to enjoy himself while tormenting majors,and did all of the fatal stabbing.in light of these facts,we conclude that middlebrooks has not overcome the presumption that trial counsel strategy was reasonable.strickland,at.
middlebrooks makes a second,more compelling argument that his trial counsel rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance.at the postconviction hearing,middlebrooks trial counsel testified that they likely had not seen brewington presentence report and did not know that the state had requested a leadership enhancement for brewington.middlebrooks contends that had the jury been informed that the state had sought a sentencing enhancement based on role at brewington sentencing,and that brewington received a life sentence,the jury would not have returned the death penalty.
this argument is not without force.under lockett ohio,a sentencing jury is able to consider
