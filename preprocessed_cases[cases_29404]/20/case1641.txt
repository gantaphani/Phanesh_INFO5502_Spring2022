petitioner lewis williams filed this action in the district court challenging the method of administering the lethal injection of drugs at his execution as a constitutional violation of his right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment and seeking an injunction to postpone his execution scheduled for january.the district court treated petitioner complaint as a second,or successive,and transmitted it to the court.
the action challenging the method of administering drugs at his execution is,as he concedes,to be treated as a second habeas action under current sixth circuit decisions.the majority of the panel would deny permission to file a second habeas on the grounds presented.they have never been presented to the state court,so there has been no exhaustion.the affidavits in support of a preliminary injunction,in essence,state that if lethal injection is not administered properly,petitioner could experience severe pain without displaying any sign of it.responsive affidavits detailing the procedure indicate that the concern expressed by petitioner is so unlikely as to be immeasurable.
petitioner essentially bases his request for a stay of execution on the supreme court having granted certiorari in nelson campbell,d.nelson involves a case involving a prisoner facing the death penalty whose peripheral veins were unavailable and who had to be sedated through the central venous system.the state in nelson chose the cut down technique which allegedly requires more experience and medical training than the per cutaneous technique.the court granted certiorari to answer the following question 
whether a complaint brought under by a state prisoner,who seeks to stay his execution in order to pursue a challenge to the procedures for carrying out his execution,is properly recharacterized as a habeas corpus petition under 
the court has also acted on at least two cases involving similar challenges to the method of execution of by injection,both from the fourth circuit.in rowsey beck,cir,motion to vacate granted,beck rowsey,d,the court vacated the stay granted by the fourth circuit.in reid johnson,cir,motion to vacate stay denied,johnson reid,d,the district court had granted an injunction staying an execution.the court of appeals affirmed.the supreme court denied the states motion to vacate.of most relevance to the present petition,however,is the court denial of application for stay of execution in zimmerman johnson,d.in zimmerman,the fifth circuit affirmed the dismissal of the action on the procedural ground that is not an appropriate vehicle for challenges to the method of execution and held that applicant should have proceeded by applying for a writ of habeas corpus.the four justices that dissented from the denial of stay stressed that the court should stay execution until nelson was decided.the majority,however,clearly disagreed.we understand this decision to mean that this circuit is free to follow its prior precedent with regard to this question until the supreme court issues its decision in nelson.
accordingly,the majority of the panel is of the opinion that we should continue to follow sixth circuit precedent in in re sapp,cir and treat this case as a second,or successive,petition.the district court properly transferred the case as filed to this court so it could pass on it as a request for a second petition.we decline to permit the claim to be filed as a second petition.it has never been presented to a state court.indeed,petitioner does not seriously claim it meets the requirements for a second petition.
petitioner asks that we stay our decision to await the decision of the supreme court in nelson.he proffers affidavits from a physician who states that if thiopental sodium is not administered for a sufficient length of time to complete the other steps of the procedure,petitioner will suffer severe pain.a lay person who experienced this difficulty describes the pain in her affidavit.in response,the state submits an affidavit from an extremely physician explaining why,in the dose to be used by the state,two grams,the condition described by plaintiffs expert will almost certainly not occur.he notes that when thiopental sodium is commonly used for general anesthesia in surgery,it is normally administered in a dose of to milligrams.
petitioner motions for remand to the district court,for preliminary injunctive relief and for stay of execution are denied.
in order that petitioner have counsel to pursue any possible habeas relief from the order,stephen ferrell is appointed to represent petitioner on such proceedings.
i concur in judge kennedy opinion.however,i would simply direct the warden to carry out the execution in the manner advocated by the petitioners expert.the petitioners do not challenge the fact of their execution they challenge only the method currently employed by the state of ohio.by affidavit they have proposed an alternative method which they advocate does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.the affidavit of the petitioners expert,mark heath,which is incorporated into the petitioners motion to stay and abey proceedings,states in relevant part 
j the benefits of thiopental in the operating room engender serious risks in the execution chamber.based on the information i have available to me concerning ohio execution protocol,a two gram dose of sodium thiopental is apparently administered in a single injection from a single syringe.by contrast,based on my research and the research of others into the procedures for executing human beings by means of lethal injection,the original design of the lethal injection protocol called for the continuous intravenous administration of an barbiturate.based on my research and the research of others,the central elements of the procedure used in ohio is similar to the one adopted many years ago in oklahoma which,it appears,many states used as a model without substantive independent research.oklahoma requires the continuous intravenous administration of an barbiturate oklahoma statutes,title criminal procedure,chapter part.it does not appear that ohio protocol includes this continuous requirement.the use of a continuous administration of the barbiturate is essential to ensure continued and sustained unconsciousness during the administration of pancuronium and potassium chloride.it is my opinion based on a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the failure to require a continuous infusion of thiopental places the condemned inmate at a needless and significant risk for the conscious experience of paralysis during the excruciating pain of both suffocation and the intravenous injection of potassium chloride.
motion to stay and abey proceedings,at quoting heath affidavit.
if the warden is ordered to follow the method advanced by the petitioners chosen expert,then the procedural question of whether the claim is properly considered a action or a successive habeas petition will be moot,as the petitioners would have received the relief that they request.
i believe that the proper course of action is to grant the preliminary injunction staying the execution of williams.the supreme court grant of certiorari in nelson campbell,d,calls into question our decision in in re sapp,cir,upon which the district court relied in transferring the action to us as a second or successive habeas petition pursuant to.in sapp,a panel of this court held that a challenge to a method of execution brought as an action under constitutes a habeas corpus petition.sapp,at.sapp relied upon an earlier supreme court decision,gomez united states dist.for the dist.of,d,in reaching its decision.now,the supreme court has undertaken to resolve the following question whether a complaint brought under by a state prisoner,who seeks to stay his execution in order to pursue a challenge to the procedures for carrying out the execution,is properly recharacterized as a habeas corpus petition under nelson.at emphasis added.the supreme court ruling could directly overrule sapp,confirm the earlier high court holding upon which sapp relied,or reach some middle ground,but naturally we will not know the answer to this question for several months.
