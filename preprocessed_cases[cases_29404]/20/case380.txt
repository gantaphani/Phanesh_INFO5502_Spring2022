background 
in the early hours of july,a woman was assaulted in the harvard playground at place and jamaica avenue in queens county,new york.police officers and emergency medical personnel arrived at the scene at approximately after sunnita jagpal called,from her apartment overlooking the playground,to report an ongoing assault.police found the victim lying on the ground,naked,and seriously injured.at trial,an emergency medical technician testified that the victim told him that she had been raped by the same man who had beaten her in a deposition,the arresting officer stated that the victim said the same thing to the nurse who treated the victim when she arrived at the hospital 
moments after finding the victim,police saw gueits in another part of the playground with determined to be the victim on his shoes.an officer brought gueits to the victim as she was awaiting transport to a hospital and asked her if gueits was the man who had attacked her.the victim responded affirmatively by nodding her head.gueits was arrested and taken to a police precinct where he agreed to answer questions.gueits said that he had spent the evening of july and the early morning of july at a bar with a friend,and that he and his friend went to the harvard playground some time after gueits stated that,while he and his friend were there,an hispanic woman entered the playground with a black man.he stated that the man attacked the woman.the woman then ran to gueits,but gueits pushed her away.after making that statement,gueits provided the police with a sample of his dna and his clothing.
gueits was originally charged with both rape and assault.the prosecution later dropped the rape charge for lack of evidence.in particular,the dna from semen found on the victim did not match gueits dna.thus,the state tried gueits solely on the assault charge.he was convicted of first degree assault and sentenced to fifteen years of incarceration.
gueits appealed his conviction to the new york supreme court,appellate division,claiming insufficient evidence to support his conviction,erroneous admission of impeachment evidence,the use of impeachment evidence as,prosecutorial misconduct,and ineffective assistance of counsel.his ineffective assistance claim was based on the following claims that his trial counsel failed to present evidence of the dna match between the semen found on the victim and that of a black male wanted for the rape of a girl in maryland,notwithstanding trial counsel awareness of this evidence prior to trial failed to properly object to grand jury testimony that the prosecution used to impeach sunnita jagpal credibility failed to request a limiting instruction with respect to the introduction of this impeachment evidence and failed to object to alleged prosecutorial misconduct the appellate division denied gueits appeal in a brief order.people gueits.
gueits then sought leave to appeal to the new york court of appeals on two grounds.first,he argued that the prosecution should not have been permitted to impeach jagpal with her prior grand jury testimony.second,he argued that his trial counsel had been ineffective in failing to present the dna match evidence failing to properly object to the introduction of the grand jury impeachment evidence and acquiescing in the jury consideration of that impeachment evidence as.leave to appeal was denied.people gueits.
gueits then filed a timely habeas corpus petition in the district court for the eastern district of new york,arguing that the appellate division had unreasonably applied the strickland standard for determining ineffective assistance of counsel.reiterating his previous arguments,gueits claimed that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to put forth evidence of the dna match,in failing to properly object to the impeachment of jagpal,and in failing to request a limiting instruction with respect to the impeachment testimony.magistrate judge orenstein found that these grounds for relief were properly exhausted and warranted habeas relief.gueits also claimed that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the prosecutor injection of his personal views on jagpal credibility during jagpal examination and in failing to object to improper statements made by the prosecutor in summation.the magistrate judge assumed that these last two grounds were properly exhausted,but found that,standing alone,they did not warrant the requested relief.the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation in full,issued the writ,and ordered the state to retry gueits within days or release him from custody.gueits kirkpatrick,d.
the respondent appealed.
discussion 
our review of the district court decision to grant gueits petition for habeas relief is de novo.palacios burge,cir.under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,d,a federal court may not grant a state prisoner habeas application unless the relevant decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.see knowles mirzayance.where,as here,a state court fails to articulate the rationale underlying its rejection of a petitioner claim,and when that rejection is on the merits,the federal court will focus its review on whether the state court ultimate decision was an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court precedent.eze senkowski,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the respondent argues that the district court,in deciding whether state appellate review of the ineffective assistance of counsel claims was reasonable,failed to accord sufficient deference to the appellate division.under the ineffective assistance of counsel standard set forth in strickland,a petitioner must demonstrate both that counsel performance was deficient and that prejudice resulted from the deficient performance.id.at.to establish the former,the petitioner must show that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.id.at.we have recognized,however,that u nder strickland,there is a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.palacios,at quoting strickland,at.to establish prejudice,the petitioner must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland,at.furthermore,on habeas appeal it is not enough for gueits to show a constitutional violation.he must also show that the state court application of strickland was not merely incorrect,but objectively unreasonable.palacios,at internal quotation marks omitted see also brisco ercole,cir a federal habeas court can not issue the writ simply because that court concludes,in its independent judgment,that the state court applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly conflating unreasonableness with clear error is improper because t he gloss of clear error fails to give proper deference to state courts.internal quotation marks and citations omitted,alteration in original.
for the reasons that follow,we find that the appellate division denial of gueits ineffective assistance claims did not constitute an unreasonable application of the strickland standard for each of his trial counsel alleged failures.
trial counsel failure to object to the use of impeachment evidence 
the respondent argues that the appellate division reasonably applied strickland with respect to gueits claim that his trial counsel failed to properly object to the introduction of grand jury testimony used to impeach the prosecution witness,sunnita jagpal.the district court determined that jagpal grand jury testimony prejudiced gueits defense by undermining her trial testimony that she was unable to identify gueits as the victim attacker.
at trial,jagpal testified that she did not know the defendant or his family.she testified that,on july,she saw a woman and two men sitting in the playground when she arrived home around jagpal testified that around she heard screaming from the playground,and that from her apartment window she saw someone there kicking the victim.trial.she testified that there was one person kicking the victim,that she could no longer see a second man,and that she saw the attacker kick the victim four or five times,but was unable to describe the attacker because the playground was dark.
after eliciting that testimony,the prosecution attempted,over objections by gueits counsel,to contradict portions of jagpal trial testimony with statements she made to the grand jury.specifically,while jagpal testified at trial that she had not known anyone named john gueits,before the grand jury she indicated that she did know someone by that name.the prosecution then read to jagpal a portion of her grand jury testimony in which,contrary to her trial testimony,she stated that she saw john gueits kick the victim about,times.finally,jagpal trial testimony that she was unsure if the man she saw sitting on a park bench in the playground was the same man that had attacked the victim was contradicted by grand jury testimony in which she stated that she had told the dispatcher that she was observing the police speaking to the attacker as he sat on a park bench.
new york criminal procedure law states 
when,upon examination by the party who called him,a witness in a criminal proceeding gives testimony upon a material issue of the case which tends to disprove the position of such party,such party may introduce evidence that such witness has previously made either a written statement signed by him or an oral statement under oath contradictory to such testimony.
gueits counsel,after having reviewed the language of that statute with the trial court,objected to the introduction of jagpal grand jury testimony on the ground that there was no contradiction to her testimony.trial.the trial court disagreed,stating that i f she now gives testimony that she does know whatever,ca see,that is material testimony which tends to disprove the people position that the defendant was the person who attacked the victim.gueits counsel argued that the witness reluctance to testify was insufficient to establish a basis for impeachment under,but the trial court rejected this argument.
gueits argues that his trial counsel failed to lodge the proper objection to jagpal impeachment,namely that jagpal trial testimony did not tend to disprove the prosecution position.as gueits asserts,only permits impeachment where the trial testimony of a witness affirmatively damage s the case of the party calling that witness.gueits br.at citing people.fitzpatrick,holding that the testimony of a witness who states that he can not recall the events in question does not tend to disprove the prosecution case.
the propriety of the trial court decision to admit jagpal grand jury testimony is not the issue before us on habeas review.estelle mcguire,i t is not the province of a federal habeas court to reexamine determinations on questions.hawkins costello,cir.our inquiry is limited to whether gueits trial counsel failed to raise a proper objection on the basis of applicable state law if so,whether that failure was objectively unreasonable and prejudicial to gueits defense and whether the appellate division unreasonably applied strickland in answering those questions in the negative.
assuming that gueits counsel in fact failed to properly object on the grounds that jagpal trial testimony had not tended to disprove the prosecution position,the appellate division reasonably concluded that such a failure did not prejudice gueits defense.this is so because it was reasonable to conclude that any such objection would have been overruled by the trial court in this case.the trial court,after reading aloud to gueits trial counsel at sidebar,concluded that jagpal trial testimony met the standard provided in that statute.specifically,the trial court noted that jagpal trial testimony that she was unable to see into the playground and did not know whether gueits was the attacker was contradicted by her grand jury testimony.trial.it is clear from the trial record that the trial court understood the requirements of,and,specifically,its prerequisite of trial testimony tending to disprove the case of the party attempting the impeachment.thus,although gueits counsel never voiced the specific objection on which gueits now relies,it is apparent that had such an objection been made,it would have been overruled.assessing the propriety of such a ruling is a task left to the state courts,see hawkins,at,and for that reason we can not conclude that the appellate division unreasonably applied strickland prejudice prong with respect to any failure by counsel to object to the admission of jagpal grand jury testimony.
ii.gueits counsel failure to request a limiting instruction with respect to impeachment evidence 
gueits was entitled to a limiting instruction that jagpal grand jury testimony was to be considered by the jury only with respect to its impeachment value and not as direct evidence of gueits guilt.see.proc.law,gueits counsel,however,did not request such an instruction at the time of the introduction of jagpal grand jury testimony or prior to the trial court final jury charge.the district court determined that the appellate division unreasonably failed to conclude that this lapse by trial not requesting a limiting ineffective assistance under strickland.
although gueits was entitled to a limiting instruction under state law,we can not conclude that the appellate division unreasonably applied strickland prejudice prong with respect to trial counsel failure to request such an instruction,either at the time of the testimony presentation or prior to the final jury charge.considerable direct evidence inculpated gueits in the charged crime.specifically,police responding to the call testified that gueits was the only other person in the playground when the body of the beaten victim was found.at that time,the victim blood was on gueits shoes.before leaving the playground,the victim identified gueits as her assailant further,in a statement,gueits admitted knowledge of the beating and interacting with the victim in the playground,though his exculpatory account of his own actions and explanation for how he came to have the victim blood on him did not comport even with jagpal trial testimony,much less with her grand jury testimony.in light of this record strongly signaling gueits guilt,it was not unreasonable for the appellate division to conclude that failure to give a limiting instruction about the proposed use of jagpal grand jury testimony was not a sufficiently serious omission as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial,a trial whose result is reliable.strickland,at.
although,as gueits argues,new york law recognizes that jurors can understand the importance of distinguishing impeachment evidence from evidence in chief,see,we reiterate that our review is not focused on the proper application of new york law.our task is limited to assessing whether the appellate division unreasonably applied strickland in determining that the absence of a limiting instruction was not prejudicial,even assuming that the state courts erroneously applied state law.see hawkins,at see also brisco,at.we believe the appellate division application of strickland to trial counsel failure to request this limiting instruction was reasonable.
iii.trial counsel alleged failure to present dna match evidence 
the respondent challenges the district court holding that the appellate division unreasonably failed to find that his trial counsel was const
