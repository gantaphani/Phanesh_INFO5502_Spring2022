alvaro carvajal,a new york state prisoner,appeals from the denial of an application for habeas corpus relief in the united states district court for the southern district of new york mcmahon.he argues that his prosecution in new york for the unlawful possession of a controlled substance exceeded new york criminal territorial jurisdiction,and thereby violated his federal constitutional rights,because both he and the drugs that formed the basis for his prosecution for unlawful possession of a controlled substance were found in california.carvajal challenges the power of new york state to prosecute him for the possessory offenses for which he was convicted.but our power to grant relief is limited by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,stat,aedpa,which bars relief to a state prisoner who raises a federal constitutional claim unless the state court ruling was contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established supreme court precedent,and the claim was fairly presented to the state court.
carvajal contends that affirmance of his conviction by the new york court of appeals was contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established supreme court precedent that limits a state prosecutorial power to only those offenses that were committed within the prosecuting state or that were committed outside but had both an intended and actual detrimental effect within.
the new york court of appeals determined that the trial court exercise of territorial jurisdiction over carvajal was proper under state law,noted that carvajal had never challenged the state jurisdiction on constitutional grounds,and upheld his conviction.the united states district court for the southern district of new york dismissed the application for a writ of habeas corpus,but issued a certificate of appealability on the question of whether new york had territorial jurisdiction to prosecute carvajal for three counts of drug possession when he possessed the drugs at issue exclusively and was arrested in another state,but participated in a conspiracy to transport drugs into new york.
the force of carvajal argument notwithstanding,we must deem his claim procedurally defaulted and dismiss his application for a writ of habeas corpus.
background 
in,the new york state drug enforcement task force launched an investigation into a colombian narcotics trafficking organization set up to transport cocaine from the san francisco area to new york city.intercepted telephone conversations and other surveillance indicated that carvajal was in charge of the west coast end and that carvajal and his coconspirators in new york employed a network of individuals to drive,store,and otherwise take care of the drugs and equipment.people carvajal,app.div.dep t.carvajal made one trip to new york,in,but was not arrested at that time or found in possession of any drugs.
ultimately,california authorities recovered large quantities of drugs hidden in vehicles with secret compartments and a stash house used by the trafficking organization in california.carvajal was arrested in california and extradited to new york where he was charged with conspiracy in the second degree and three counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance.all of the drugs that formed the basis for these possession counts were found and seized in california.on his arrest,carvajal was in possession of numerous documents linking him to other members of the narcotics conspiracy,but no drugs were on his person or in his vicinity.under new york law,carvajal was deemed to be in constructive possession of the drugs seized in california because he exercised dominion over subordinate members of the conspiracy who were found in actual possession of the narcotics,and because he exercised control over the cars and stash house where the drugs were seized.see people manini.carvajal was tried,along with several of his new york coconspirators,in the state supreme court for new york county.
the trial evidence reflected numerous phone calls between carvajal and his new york coconspirators and emphasized carvajal role in supervising the distribution conspiracy from california.see carvajal artus,civ.cm ajp,wl,at.carvajal application for relief does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence linking him to the conspiracy.see.proc.law d.the issue is whether he is entitled to habeas relief with respect to the possession counts of his conviction because new york lacked the power to prosecute him for those offenses.
at the state trial,justice bonnie wittner informed the parties that,under people mclaughlin,the prosecution need not prove the existence of jurisdiction beyond a reasonable doubt unless the defense disputed the existence of proper jurisdiction.carvajal,wl,at.defense counsel undertook to raise the jurisdiction issue via of one of the prosecution witnesses.justice wittner emphasized her view that jurisdiction was established as to the possession counts by evidence of carvajal cell phone conversations with his new york coconspirators,because each of those conversations went through a cell s ite within the geographical territory of the state of new york.id.oddly,carvajal counsel said he did not disagree with the trial judge statement of the law on this point.id.nonetheless,the trial judge announced that,at the request of the defense,she would charge the jury on the question of whether the state had territorial jurisdiction.id.at.despite the fact that the trial judge was willing to give a charge on jurisdiction,carvajal and his codefendant subsequently withdrew their request for such a charge.id.apparently,this was done because defense counsel objected to the manner in which justice wittner intended to charge the jury on jurisdiction.it seems defense counsel sought to avoid the submission of six interrogatories to the jury,which would conform to the prosecution theory of jurisdiction,and which would require reading the overt acts in the indictment to the jury app.ex.d at.
carvajal was convicted on all counts of the indictment and sentenced to an aggregate indeterminate prison term of years to life.he was subsequently resentenced under the rockefeller drug reform act to a determinate sentence of to years on the conspiracy conviction,and thirteen years imprisonment for two of the possession counts,all to run concurrently,and a consecutive term of thirteen years imprisonment on the third possession count.but for the consecutive term of imprisonment imposed on the third possession count,carvajal would be immediately eligible for parole and removal to colombia.
represented by new counsel,carvajal appealed his conviction to the new york state appellate division,first department.in relevant part,carvajal argued that the question of new york territorial jurisdiction was because t erritorial jurisdiction refers to the power of the court to hear and determine the case,and that territorial jurisdiction was lacking on the possession counts because the acts of possession took place wholly outside of new york.app.ex.d at.carvajal brief to the appellate division cited the new york court of appeals decision of mclaughlin,which recognized that t he general rule in new york is that,for the state to have criminal jurisdiction,either the alleged conduct or some consequence of it must have occurred within the state.at see also.proc.law.
the appellate division agreed that b ecause the state only has power to enact and enforce criminal laws within its territorial borders,there can be no criminal offense unless it has territorial jurisdiction.carvajal,at.and,the appellate division remarked that it was aware of no other case in which a defendant was convicted of possession of a controlled substance when neither the drugs at issue nor the defendant was in new york at the time of the offense.id.at.nevertheless,the court held that the state had jurisdiction to prosecute carvajal under criminal procedure law section a.carvajal,at,see also.proc.law a providing for jurisdiction over an offense when conduct occurred within new york sufficient to establish an element of the offense.carvajal was deemed to have been in new york for jurisdictional purposes because of phone calls made to his new york coconspirators,and was deemed to have constructively possessed the drugs in new york because he exercised control over the drugs and his subordinates who held the drugs in california.carvajal,at see also.proc.law providing that a n oral or written statement made by a person in one jurisdiction to a person in another jurisdiction by means of telecommunications,mail or any other method of communication is deemed to be made in each such jurisdiction the appellate division upheld carvajal conviction on the ground that a n element of the possession offense s occurred within new york state carvajal,at,see also.proc.law a.
carvajal sought,and was granted,leave to appeal to the new york court of appeals.app.ex.citing new york law,carvajal merits brief argued that his trial suffered from a fundamental,nonwaivable defect in the mode of procedure,people patterson,that new york lacked jurisdiction to prosecute him for the possession offenses.app.ex.i at.starting from the proposition that territorial jurisdiction implicates the s tate inherent authority to prosecute and punish a suspect for alleged criminal conduct,the new york court of appeals held that,though a defendant may waive proper venue and the opportunity to require the prosecutor to prove the existence of jurisdiction to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt,the fundamental question a matter of law new york state has the power to hear the case can not be waived.people.carvajal,kaye.reaching the merits,however,the court upheld the state exercise of jurisdiction over the possession offenses.id.at.
the new york court of appeals declined to rest its decision on.proc.law a,on which the lower state courts had relied.perhaps because a requires that an element of the offense take place in new york the new york court of appeals instead founded jurisdiction on c,carvajal,at,which provides 
a person may be convicted in the criminal courts of new york state of an offense defined by the laws of new york state,committed either by his own conduct or by the conduct of another for which he is legally accountable when 
conduct occurred within this state sufficient to establish 
c a conspiracy or criminal solicitation to commit such offense,or otherwise to establish the complicity of at least one of the persons liable therefor provided that the jurisdiction accorded by this paragraph extends only to conviction of those persons whose conspiratorial or other conduct of complicity occurred within new york state.
proc.law c.the court determined that this jurisdictional requirement was satisfied because while he was present in new york both physically and by telephone,carvajal conspired with his accomplices and engaged in overt acts in furtherance of their possession of significant quantities of cocaine and their plan to transport the cocaine to new york.carvajal,at emphasis added.the court denied that this analysis amounted to jurisdictional bootstrapping.id.at.finally,the new york court of appeals observed that carvajal never alleged any constitutional violation,federal or state,concerning his prosecution by new york.id.the court thus indicated that its decision was grounded solely in an interpretation of the relevant provision of the state jurisdictional statute.
judge george bundy smith forceful dissent argued 
t he constitution of the united states,the constitution of the state of new york and the laws of the state of new york do not permit a person to be found guilty of criminal possession of a controlled substance on a theory of constructive possession rather than actual possession where both the substance and the defendant are in california.
carvajal,at,dissenting.the dissent also took the position that b ecause territorial jurisdiction goes to the authority of the court to try a defendant for the particular crimes in issue,no preservation is necessary.id.at.
following the affirmance by the new york court of appeals,carvajal filed pro se a motion to vacate his conviction.see.proc.law carvajal,wl,at.the state supreme court denied the motion,and the first department denied leave to appeal.carvajal,wl,at.next,carvajal filed a timely application pro se for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.magistrate judge peck issued a report recommending that carvajal application be denied but that a certificate of appealability should issue.id.at.
the magistrate judge proceeded on the basis that the state court had adjudicated carvajal federal constitutional claim on the merits.in so doing,the magistrate judge overlooked or discounted the statement in the court of appeals opinion that its decision was grounded solely in state statutory law.accordingly,the magistrate judge analyzed the jurisdictional merits,giving deference to the decision of the new york court of appeals.id.at see also jimenez walker,cir.the magistrate judge concluded that the decision of the new york court of appeals was not contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established supreme court precedent.carvajal,wl,at.the relevant supreme court precedent identified by the magistrate judge is strassheim daily,which held acts done outside a jurisdiction,but intended to produce and producing detrimental effects within it,justify a state in punishing the cause of the harm as if he had been present at the effect,if the state should succeed in getting him within its power.id.at.the magistrate judge concluded whether or not the new york court of appeals properly interpreted the state criminal procedure law provisions,as a matter of federal constitutional law,he could not say that the new york court of appeals decision was contrary to or an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent.carvajal,wl,at.
the district judge adopted the recommendation of the magistrate judge,observing in a supplemental memorandum that the majority opinion of the new york court of appeals specifically refused to entertain any discussion of federal constitutional law,on the ground that petitioner had failed to raise any federal constitutional challenge to the trial court exercise of jurisdiction.carvajal artus,civ.cm ajp,wl,at.the district judge recognized that the new york court of appeals interpretation of criminal procedure law section c is the last word on what that s tate statute means.id.still,the court considered that,although this procedural posture would normally bar relief unless carvajal could demonstrate cause for his default in state court and resulting prejudice,t he issue is more confusing than usual in this particular case given the state court ruling that jurisdiction can not be waived.id.thus the state court assertion that state statutory jurisdiction can never be waived was treated by the district court as a sub silentio determination of federal constitutional law despite the state court disclaimer that it was not considering any such issue.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,the district court issued a certificate of appealability limited to the issue of whether new york lacked territorial jurisdiction to try petitioner for the three counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance.id.at.
discussion 
we review de novo a district court denial of a writ of habeas corpus.cotto herbert,cir.the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa provides that a state prisoner may seek habeas corpus relief in federal court on the ground that he is in custody in violation of the constitution.of the united states.a.however,before a federal court can consider a habeas application brought by a state prisoner,the habeas applicant must exhaust all of his state remedies.id.b a.e xhaustion of state remedies requires that a petitioner fairly present federal claims to the state courts in order to give the s tate the opportunity to pass upon and correct alleged violations of its prisoners federal rights.duncan henry,per curiam citing picard connor,internal quotation marks and alterations omitted see also lurie wittner,cir.the exhaustion requirement is animated by notions of comity between the federal and s tate judicial systems.strogov attorney of,cir.true,a state prisoner is not required to cite chapter and verse of the constitution in order to satisfy this requirement,daye attorney of,cir in banc still,he must present his challenge in terms that are likely to alert the state court s to the claim federal nature.lurie,at quoting daye,at.a petitioner may satisfy the fair presentation requirement by 
a reliance on pertinent federal cases employing constitutional analysis,b reliance on state cases employing constitutional analysis in like fact situations,c assertion of the claim in terms so particular as to call to mind a specific right protected by the constitution,and d allegation of a pattern of facts that is well within the mainstream of constitutional litigation.
if a habeas applicant fails to exhaust state remedies by failing to adequately present his federal claim to the state courts so that the state courts would deem the claim procedurally barred,we must deem the claim procedurally defaulted.aparicio artuz,cir noting the apparent salve of deeming a claim not presented in state court exhausted is cold comfort.our dismissal of an application for habeas relief on the ground of procedural default amounts to a disposition of the habeas claim on the merits.id.an applicant seeking habeas relief may escape dismissal on the merits of a procedurally defaulted claim only by demonstrating cause for the default and prejudice or by showing that he is actually innocent of the crime for which he was convicted.id.
when a habeas applicant fails to exhaust his federal constitutional claim in state there has been no showing of cause and prejudice or actual court will generally be barred from granting habeas relief.see gray netherland.here,however,carvajal argues that the prosecution forfeited any defense that would be based on his procedural default by its failure to rely on this ground before the district court.the prosecution acknowledges that it did not rely on a procedural default defense in the district court but urges us nonetheless to consider whether carvajal failed to raise his jurisdictional challenge in federal constitutional terms in the state courts,and is thus barred from obtaining relief in this court.
prior to aedpa,a state was normally obligated to raise and preserve the procedural default defense.trest cain,internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.at the same time,it was clear that a federal appellate court was not obligated to regard the prosecution omission of the defense as an absolute waiver of the claim.granberry greer,see also washington james,cir.aedpa expressly provides that the s tate shall not be deemed to have waived the exhaustion requirement or be estopped from reliance upon the requirement unless the s tate,through counsel,expressly waives the requirement.b emphasis added.other courts of appeals have been persuaded that b applies with full force in cases where the procedural bar arises only as a direct result of the petitioner failure to exhaust his state law remedies.mcnair cambell,cir see also ellis hargett,cir franklin johnson,cir,concurring.we are persuaded that when a state procedural default argument is predicated on a habeas applicant failure to exhaust as is the case here,we may consider such an argument for the first time on appeal unless it was expressly waived in the district court.see franklin,at.this is a stringent requirement.waiver by nature must be knowing and intentional express waiver would seem to require that these features be made manifest.
the prosecution brief before the district court seems to make an erroneous concession regarding exhaustion.doc.at.but it then goes on to a section of its brief entitled if this court were to overlook the procedural bar,petitioner claims present no basis for habeas relief that carvajal claim does not present a basis for habeas relief because a lleged errors of state substantive law are not reviewable in a federal habeas proceeding.doc.at.
we reasoned 
e ven if the government erroneous concession regarding exhaustion can be taken as a concession regarding procedural default,we believe that where such a concession constitutes merely an innocent error,there is no analytical or policy reason to treat it any differently than a failure to raise the defense at all.
washington,at.that analysis applies with incremental force circumstances may be considered in deciding whether waiver is sufficiently categorical.see magouirk phillips,cir stating that the nature of the state alleged waiver should be given consideration in assessing whether sua sponte reliance upon a procedural default is appropriate.as other courts have observed,aedpa does not explain how a state expressly waives the exhaustion requirement,but w aiver is traditionally defined as an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.bagley,cir.we join the reasoning of at least one other sister court of appeals in requiring a stringent standard for proving waiver of exhaustion because such a standard is squarely in line with the underlying purposes of the exhaustion requirement.dreher pinchak,app x,cir unpublished opinion.indeed,p rinciples of comity and federalism bear on the relations between court systems,and those relations will be affected whether or not the litigants have raised the issue themselves.washington,at see also acosta artuz,cir.
in light of the equivocal wording in the prosecution brief before the district court,and recognizing that aedpa disfavors a state waiver of exhaustion,lurie,at,we decline to read the prosecution concession as waiver express within the meaning of b.see,at whatever counsel was saying,we do not read it as an express waiver of the exhaustion requirement.see also carty thaler,cir the touchstone for determining whether a waiver is express is the clarity of the intent to waive.internal quotation marks omitted.true,the prosecution did not press the procedural default defense before the district court nevertheless,the prosecution is not estopped from reliance upon the requirement before this court.b.
the state courts evidently understood carvajal jurisdictional argument as a challenge to the state statutory jurisdiction under new york criminal procedure law section.applying the daye factors,we conclude that no federal claim was fairly presented to the state courts carvajal challenge was consistently expressed as an argument that the new york courts erred in construing the pertinent state jurisdictional statutes.he pointed to no federal constitutional provision that might alert the state courts that his claim was federal in nature.rather,he relied on state court decisions interpreting state statutory law.carvajal did not invoke pertinent federal cases employing constitutional analysis,nor did he seek support for his contention from state cases employing constitutional analysis in like fact situations.daye,at.of course,it is hard to fault carvajal for failing to point to a like fact situation.as the appellate division recognized,this was an unusual use of criminal procedure law section.carvajal,at.however,i t is not the province of a federal habeas court to reexamine determinations on questions.s tate courts are the ultimate expositors of state law.mannix phillips,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also tunick.safir,cir th e question of the extent to which the state court can go when interpreting its own laws is paradigmatically one of state law.internal quotation marks omitted.even if this court views the state court interpretation of its state statute as unwise,or even as jurisdictional overreaching,this does not entitle carvajal to habeas relief.see swarthout cooke,wl,at,per curiam.
the new york court of appeals ruled that the question whether new york had jurisdiction to prosecute carvajal could not be waived.carvajal,at.we do not understand this conclusion as a ruling on federal law.read in context,the new york court of appeals was evidently opining on a matter of state law put simply,the new york court a matter of state the power of a state court to act is not an issue that can be waived even if a defendant waives the right to require the prosecution to prove the jurisdictional element to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.it is within the province of the new york court of appeals to construe the jurisdictional statute passed by the new york state legislature.see people kassebaum.the new york court of appeals has made plain that it understands the statutory jurisdictional provision to have supplanted the territorial principle and to have broaden ed the territorial scope of criminal jurisdiction.id.at see also people stokes,stating t he starting point for the s tate jurisdiction in criminal cases is of course the territorial principle derived from the common law,but that t his principle has been supplanted by s tate statutes broadening the territorial principle of criminal jurisdiction.whether we agree with new york interpretation and application of its state jurisdictional statute is neither here nor there our disagreement would not in any event entitle carvajal to relief.
the supreme court doubt s that a defendant citation to a decision predicated solely on state law ordinarily will be sufficient to fairly apprise a reviewing court of a potential federal claim.anderson harless,per curiam.in light of that guidance,in recognition of our dual judicial system,and out of concern for harmonious relations between the two adjudicatory institutions,we can not find that carvajal properly presented his federal claim to the state courts in a manner that would allow this court to grant relief.daye,at see also disimone phillips,f d,cir galdamez keane,cir.
the failure of carvajal counsel to press his jurisdictional objection in federal constitutional terms does not constitute cause for a procedural default.murray carrier,u.and,carvajal has not argued that he is actually innocent meaning factually innocent of the crime for which he was convicted bousley united states.accordingly,we must dismiss carvajal application for habeas relief.aparicio,at.
carvajal appeal relies heavily on the dissenting opinion of judge bundy smith,which took the view that new york law permits criminal prosecution for a drug possession offense only when the criminal some consequence of the within the state.carvajal,at,dissenting.this argument has substantial appeal.indeed,carvajal conviction in new york for a crime committed wholly in another state seems anomalous to us,as it did to judge bundy smith.however,we have no occasion to decide whether there was error in the state court statutory interpretation because i t is well established that a federal habeas court does not sit to correct a misapplication of state law,unless such misapplication violates the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.ponnapula spitzer,cir.i t is only noncompliance with federal law that renders a s tate criminal judgment susceptible to collateral attack in the federal courts.wilson corcoran,wl,at,per curiam.
judge bundy smith dissent is in major part directed to new york law.it does appear that the court of appeals ruling in this case may have been a pivot.compare mclaughlin,at providing t he general rule in new york is that,for the s tate to have criminal jurisdiction,either the alleged conduct or some consequence of it must have occurred within the s tate emphasis added,and kassebaum,at characterizing the jurisdictional inquiry as whether the people established that defendant and his accomplices engaged in conduct within new york sufficient to establish an element of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance,with carvajal,at finding jurisdiction over possession offense because there was evidence of defendant conduct in new york sufficient to establish his conspiracy to commit first degree criminal possession of a controlled substance emphasis added.
in,cardozo concluded that when a plan to commit larceny was hatched in new york,but the execution was in other lands,new york lacked jurisdiction to prosecute a participant in that conspiracy for larceny committed abroad.people werblow.at the same time,werblow made it clear that the court construction of the statute was not a consequence of some inherent limitation upon the power of the legislature.id.as a matter of state statutory interpretation,the werblow court concluded that the jurisdictional statute was not intended to provide for an extension of jurisdiction until now unknown to our law.id.but even if the decision of the new york court of appeals were deemed contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,prior state precedent,this would not aid carvajal position before this court.w e do not defer to the new york court of appeals interpretation of federal law,but we are bound by its construction of new york law.portalatin graham,f d,cir in banc.
judge bundy smith dissent also states that carvajal conviction for criminal possession of a controlled substance was obtained in violation of the federal constitution.it argues that new york exercise of jurisdiction over the possession counts was a violation of article iii,and the sixth amendment.carvajal,at,dissenting.however,the supreme court has made it clear that article iii and the sixth amendment are understood as venue provisions.united states cabrales,williams florida.venue,unlike jurisdiction proper,is subject to waiver.see,united states calderon,cir people moore.moreover,it appears that the supreme court has not decided whether the sixth amendment vicinage clause applies to the states.stevenson lewis,cir see also people goldswer,stating i n federal prosecutions undoubtedly district means the federal judicial districts established by congress but,i t is not entirely clear what this means in s tate prosecutions,or whether in fact it imposes any obligations on the s tate to create or designate subdivisions limiting venue and vicinage within the s tate.one thing is clear carvajal never challenged his prosecution for criminal possession of a controlled substance on the ground that it was in violation of his federal constitutional right to proper venue.
on appeal,carvajal also invokes strassheim identified by the magistrate judge as the relevant supreme court precedent,which holds that a state may punish a cts done outside a jurisdiction,but intended to produce and producing detrimental effects within it.at emphasis added.but it is not evident that this passage from strassheim is prescriptive,and that actual effects are required to support jurisdiction.so even if carvajal had relied on strassheim before the state he did are not convinced that he would be entitled to relief from this court.as the supreme court of california has observed,the constitutional limits of state courts extraterritorial jurisdiction in criminal matters have not been precisely delineated,but it is clear that states may extend their jurisdiction beyond the narrow limits imposed by the common law.people betts,cal,cert.denied.in fact,new york has upheld the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction in scenarios that do not fall within the strassheim test,and no one has suggested that doing so was a violation of the federal constitution.for example,new york recognizes a theory of protective jurisdiction,pursuant to which the jurisdiction of the s tate,or one of its counties,may be exercised over conduct outside its geographical borders where such conduct was intended to have a deleterious effect within its territory.people.fea.
ultimately,even if carvajal had fairly presented to the state courts a federal constitutional challenge to new york exercise of jurisdiction,and the state courts had rejected that claim on its merits,it is not clear that we would be empowered to grant relief.see cockrell,stating aedpa constrains a federal court power to disturb convictions.we can not grant relief with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in s tate court proceedings unless the adjudication of that claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.the supreme court has not had occasion to say how far a state may go in expanding its criminal jurisdiction.we therefore can not say that the state court interpretation of new york crimin
