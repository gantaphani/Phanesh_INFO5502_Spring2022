opinion of the court 
the commonwealth of pennsylvania appeals from the order of the district court dated may,granting the petition of martin daniel appel for a writ of habeas corpus.the district court granted the writ of habeas corpus after it determined that appel had been constructively denied his sixth amendment right to counsel in violation of the supreme court decision in united states cronic,d.the district court vacated appel conviction and sentence,but stayed execution of the writ for days in order to permit the commonwealth to provide appel a new trial within that time.
the parties agree that the district court memorandum and order of may,accurately sets forth the factual background,and we will accordingly accept these facts as accurate and summarize them here,supplemented by other uncontested facts of record.
on june,appel and stanley hertzog,pursuant to a prearranged plan,robbed the first national bank of bath in east allen township,pennsylvania.appel killed two tellers and a bank official,and both robbers shot at others,injuring two other persons.appel and hertzog were arrested later that day and charged with murder,robbery,and related crimes.on june,while being held in prison,appel confessed to certain law enforcement officers 
on june,appel filed an application for appointment of counsel with the public defender.it is the period between june,and june,that is critical to the writ of habeas corpus.on june,the public defender assigned ellen kraft and lorenzo crowe to serve as appel attorneys and they entered appearances on appel behalf.when kraft and crowe visited appel in the northampton county prison on june,however,appel immediately told them that he did not want them to serve as his attorneys.kraft later testified that appel had only requested a public defender after being told that he would need a lawyer in order to receive visitors while he was in that prison.
kraft and crowe nevertheless accompanied appel to a hearing before the trial judge on june.during that hearing,the trial judge referred to kraft and crowe as appel counsel and they did not dispute this characterization.at the hearing,appel told the judge,i would like to represent myself.i feel i am best able to project my own thoughts and express my desires speaking for myself in the case.app.ii at.after being told the charges against him and the possible penalties he faced,appel again told the judge,my choice is to represent myself.i have no objection to kraft and crowe as advisors.app.ii at.he explained that having counsel would slow down the wheels of justice,the prosecution case against me.app.ii at.the judge did not accept appel waiver of counsel at that time,stating that before he did so,he would order appel to undergo a psychiatric examination in order to assist the judge in determining appel competency to waive counsel.
on june,appel was examined by janet schwartz,a psychiatrist on the staff of northampton county mental health and mental retardation unit.before that examination,schwartz met with john weaver,a social worker on that staff,who had interviewed appel following the crime and had received from him some background information.schwartz received no information from either kraft or crowe and,after spending an hour with appel,found appel to be competent to waive his right to counsel.schwartz report to the court stated,appel appears to have made a rational and well thought out decision that he would like to receive the death penalty and would like this to occur as soon as possible.on the basis of my examination i feel that he is competent to make this decision and to refuse counsel.app.ii at.on appeal,appel makes the point that his competency evaluation was only schwartz second competency evaluation in a felony case,and her first capital one.she was,however,board certified in psychiatry and neurology.
the judge held a second hearing on june.the judge questioned appel again,and appel repeated his intention to proceed without an attorney.kraft and crowe were present at this hearing,but provided no information relevant to appel competency and specifically advised the court in response to its inquiry that they had nothing to put on the record at that time.they did not challenge the psychiatrist conclusion.the judge then accepted appel waiver of counsel based on schwartz report and appointed kraft and crowe as standby counsel pursuant to.d renumbered rule d and amended march,effective april,
appel pled guilty on july,to three counts of criminal homicide,two counts of attempted homicide,one count of robbery,two counts of aggravated assault and various other charges.see commonwealth appel,hereafter appel i.under pennsylvania law,following the defendant plea of guilty to criminal homicide,the court fixes the degree of guilt after a hearing.in appel case,the hearing was held august through august.at that hearing,appel reiterated his waiver of counsel and stated,inter alia,
i would like to state for the record,that during the entire proceedings hearings in this matter,i have been very much aware of what is going on.that is to say,i am rational,sane,competent and alert.i have had plenty of opportunities to discuss and consult with counsel,crowe and kraft.and i have consulted with them on various occasions.
i feel that by cooperating with the prosecution and by pleading guilty to all charges,that i have done the honorable thing.and,i hope that i have set a precedent here today for all future defendants in so doing.
the only mitigating factors that i wish to enter into the record,would be 
one,that i have had no prior felony convictions against me and,
two,that i was gainfully employed at the time of my arrest.
i would also like to say that i will not appeal your decision or any decisions that you made.furthermore,i trust that the american civil liberties union will not interfere with this matter and that no other outside legal aid groups will make any appeal on my behalf.
commonwealth appel,brackets in original quoting degree of guilt hearing tr,at hereafter appel ii.
the trial court found appel guilty of three counts of first degree murder for the deaths of the three bank employees.see id.
on august,after the degree of guilt hearing,appel was examined at the request of kraft and crowe by paul kenneth gross,another psychiatrist.gross found no evidence of any psychosis,severe depression,agitation or paranoia,app.ii at,and stated in his written report that there was no evidence that appel was suffering from any mental disease or defect at the time of the crime and that,at that time,he was fully aware of his behavior,could appreciate the nature and quality of it,and knew the wrongfulness of his behavior.app.ii at.
at sentencing,appel again waived his right to counsel and requested that he be sentenced to death.the court imposed three sentences of death on september.appel did not file any motions but the pennsylvania supreme court reviewed appel conviction and sentence based on an automatic direct review,see.ann.h,and affirmed,finding that the evidence supports beyond a reasonable doubt the trial court findings that defendant was guilty of three counts of first degree murder.appel i,at,at.
governor tom ridge signed appel death warrant on february,which set the execution date for the week of april.however,shortly after the death warrant was signed,appel requested counsel and filed a petition under pennsylvania post conviction relief act pcra.ann.et,in which appel argued,among other things,that he was mentally ill and incompetent during the proceedings resulting in his guilty plea and death sentence,and that he was denied effective assistance of counsel during the proceedings.
the pcra trial court conducted hearings from may to.at these hearings,appel presented a number of psychologists and physicians who examined appel eight or nine years after the murders.they testified that he had suffered from graves disease,a form of hyperthyroidism,during the summer of.this condition is characterized by an enlarged thyroid,a rapid pulse,and increased metabolism due to excessive thyroid secretion.appel experts testified that the graves disease caused him to become paranoid and delusional.he told them that the bank robbery had been part of a cia mission to eliminate cia moles and that he was bound to keep his mission secret.appel had also repeatedly told them that he was part of a special operations unit of the military.see,pcra tr,at testimony of james merikangas pcra tr,at testimony of henry dee pcra tr,at testimony of frank dattilio pcra tr,at testimony of jethro toomer.appel mother,girlfriend,and other acquaintances corroborated that appel had acted strangely in.
in support of appel ineffective assistance of counsel claim,which appel based on the failure of kraft and crowe to investigate appel mental illness in that allegedly would have led them to discover his mental illness from his family,friends,and employment records,appel presented kraft and crowe as witnesses at the pcra hearing.they testified that they did not consider themselves to be appel counsel at either the june,or june,hearings,and never considered themselves to be his counsel.kraft testified that appel waived counsel from day one.pcra tr,at testimony of ellen kraft.she stated that they refrained from investigating appel background because we were not his attorneys.pcra tr,at.crowe also testified that no investigation was made because w e were,i felt that we were standby counsel.i did think investigation was necessary.pcra tr,at testimony of lorenzo crowe.
the commonwealth introduced evidence that appel motive for the robbery was to get money fast,and that he had rational reasons for wanting to plead guilty and be executed.specifically,the commonwealth introduced excerpts of an interview appel gave in for a television documentary entitled in the mind of a murderer,in which he admitted that his motive for the crimes was to get money and kill potential witnesses.the commonwealth also introduced a transcript of a taped interview with appel in in which he explained that he robbed the bank to get money for his girlfriend,sought the death penalty so that she could get the insurance proceeds,enjoyed being in control of the court proceedings and assisting the commonwealth,and got the idea to use graves disease as the basis of an appeal from a former death row inmate.see appel ii,at,at.
the trial court denied appel pcra petition on june.the pennsylvania supreme court later affirmed this denial.see appel ii.appel then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.the district court granted the writ on may,but stayed the execution of the writ for days in order to permit the commonwealth to provide appel a new trial.see appel horn,wl.may,hereafter district court memorandum the commonwealth filed a timely appeal.
discussiona.standard of review 
the commonwealth argues that the district court erred in failing to apply the standards contained in the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,stat.because appel habeas petition was filed after april,the effective date of aedpa,aedpa applies here.
aedpa precludes habeas relief on a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the petitioner has shown that the state court proceedings resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.factual issues that the state court determined are presumed to be correct,and the burden is on the petitioner to rebut that presumption by clear and convincing evidence.see e.aedpa increases the deference federal courts must give to the factual findings and legal determinations of the state courts.werts vaughn,cir,cert.denied,d.
the supreme court recently clarified how these standards should be interpreted in its decision in williams taylor,d,where it considered a federal habeas claim in which petitioner williams contended that he was denied effective assistance of counsel.with respect to legal determinations made by the state court,the williams court explained that the contrary to and unreasonable application clauses in d should be viewed independently.id.at.a state court decision will be contrary to supreme court precedent if it is substantially different from the relevant precedent.id.a state court decision will be an unreasonable application if the state court identifies the correct governing legal rule from the court cases but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular state prisoner case or the state court either unreasonably extends a legal principle from our precedent to a new context where it should not apply or unreasonably refuses to extend that principle to a new context where it should apply.id.at.the court held that williams was entitled to habeas relief because the state supreme court decision was both contrary to and involved an unreasonable application of federal law clearly established in strickland washington,d.much of the inquiry since williams has focused on the application of one or both of these clauses.see,werts.
however,by its own terms d applies only to claims already adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings.it follows that when,although properly preserved by the defendant,the state court has not reached the merits of a claim thereafter presented to a federal habeas court,the deferential standards provided by aedpa and explained in williams do not apply.see weeks angelone,cir,aff,d when a petitioner has properly presented a claim to the state court but the state court has not adjudicated the claim on the merits,however,our review of questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact is de novo.fisher texas,cir declining to apply d deferential standards because the texas state courts had dismissed petitioner claim on procedural grounds rather than on its merits moore parke,cir a prerequisite for applying d is that the state court adjudicated the issue before us on the merits.
in such an instance,the federal habeas court must conduct a de novo review over pure legal questions and mixed questions of law and fact,as a court would have done prior to the enactment of aedpa.see mccandless vaughn,cir.however,the state court factual determinations are still presumed to be correct,rebuttable upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence.see e.
the district court recognized that aedpa was applicable to appel habeas petition.because the district court opinion was filed before the supreme court opinion in williams taylor,the district court proceeded under the interpretation of aedpa that this court applied in its decision in matteo superintendent,sci albion,cir en banc.nevertheless,nothing in williams would change the district court determination that the aedpa deference standard is inapplicable in appel habeas proceeding.
the district court first determined that the claim at the center of appel habeas petition,that he was constructively denied his sixth amendment right to the assistance of counsel during the time before the trial court accepted his waiver of counsel,was presented to the pennsylvania supreme court and therefore appel exhausted his state court remedies.district court memorandum at.in fact,the pennsylvania supreme court expressly recognized that it must resolve w hether appel is entitled to relief because he was denied assistance of counsel during the original trial court proceedings.appel ii,at,at.however,the pennsylvania supreme court analysis of this claim always characterized the claim as alleging ineffective assistance of counsel,and not constructive denial of counsel.the two claims,of course,are different.the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must be evaluated from a federal constitutional basis under the standards set forth in strickland washington,d.the constructive denial of counsel analysis,on the other hand,stems from the supreme court decision in united states cronic,d.
in rejecting appel pcra petition,the pennsylvania supreme court described appel claim as one for ineffective assistance of counsel asserting that his counsel were deficient because they did not investigate appel background spoke to no one who knew appel did not obtain records about appel and provided no information about appel alleged history of mental illness to the psychiatric experts or to the court itself.appel ii,at,at.then,the court,relying on its precedent in commonwealth griffin,held that claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are not cognizable during proceedings,when the defendant has previously insisted on representing himself.appel ii,at,at emphasis added.
nevertheless,the court considered the substance of appel claim and rejected appel argument that counsel must ignore the pleadings of their criminal defendant clients and undertake an exhaustive survey of the client personal background in an attempt to establish incompetency.id.at,at.the court accordingly concluded that appel standby counsel did not act unreasonably in respecting their client wishes not to investigate his competency.
the district court recognized that because the pennsylvania supreme court recharacterized appel claim as arguing that counsel were ineffective and consistently referred to kraft and crowe as only counsel,it failed to adjudicate appel denial of counsel claim on the merits.see district court memorandum at.as the district court stated,t he state courts thus condoned kraft and crowe conduct based on the trial court finding that appel was competent,when the relevant questions were whether they were counsel or counsel prior to june,and what they were obligated to do when faced with a potentially incompetent client on june,who might be unable to make the rational,strategic choices which pennsylvania law accords to criminal defendants including waiver of counsel,and for whom a competency hearing had been scheduled by the trial judge for june.id.at.
our reading of the pennsylvania supreme court opinion leads us to agree with the district court that the pennsylvania supreme court never considered appel claim that the actions of kraft and crowe from june,to june,constituted a constructive denial of counsel.id.at.as the district court stated,the pennsylvania supreme court failed to address appel arguments that kraft and crowe were actually his counsel during the time leading up to the trial court competency hearing.id.while the allegations that crowe and kraft failed to investigate appel background are relevant to appel habeas claim before us,their relevancy is not in the context of ineffective assistance of counsel,as the pennsylvania supreme court treated them,but in the constructive denial of counsel,the issue that the state courts did not consider.it is informative that throughout its opinion,the pennsylvania supreme court failed to cite to cronic,the relevant supreme court case on constructive denial of counsel.
it follows,as the district court held,that aedpa standards are inapplicable to appel constructive denial of counsel claim,and this court must examine,without special heed to the underlying state court decision,whether appel was constructively denied his sixth amendment right to counsel during the time before the trial court accepted his waiver of counsel.district court memorandum at.therefore,the district court did not err by conducting a de novo review of this claim.we will conduct a plenary review over questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact 
b.the issue before the habeas court 
the commonwealth argues that the district court erred in analyzing the merits of appel claim under the supreme court decision in cronic,and contends that it should instead have analyzed appel claim pursuant to strickland.in cronic,counsel representing the defendant indicted on federal mail fraud charges withdrew shortly before trial and the district court appointed as a substitute a young real estate lawyer.however,the court allowed him only days to prepare for trial even though it had taken the government four and a half years to investigate and review thousands of documents.it was a difficult case for the defense because two agreed to testify for the government and their testimony proved that cronic had conceived and directed the entire check kiting scheme.cronic did not testify so as to avoid impeachment with a prior conviction nor did he put on a defense,but his counsel did the government witnesses.cronic was convicted on of the counts and sentenced to years imprisonment.the court of appeals reversed because it inferred that cronic sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel had been violated.see cronic,at.
although the supreme court did not agree that the circumstances in cronic justified the inference drawn by the court of appeals,it is the court discussion of the circumstances in which there would be such a sixth amendment violation that stands at the center of the cronic doctrine.the court began its discussion with the statement that a n accused right to be represented by counsel is a fundamental component of our criminal justice system,id.at,and quickly explained this meant the right to the effective assistance of counsel,id.at.at stake is the defendant right to assistance for his defence.id.quoting const.amend.vi.if no actual assistance for the accused defence is provided,then the constitutional guarantee has been violated.id.quoting const.amend vi.further,a trial is unfair if the accused is denied counsel at a critical stage of his trial.id.at.
in one of the key passages,the court stated that t he right to the effective assistance of counsel is the right of the accused to require the prosecution case to survive the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.id.at.no specific showing of prejudice is required when counsel entirely fails to subject the prosecution case to such testing.in such an event,ineffectiveness of counsel is properly presumed without inquiry into actual performance at trial.id.at.
courts have found constructive denial of the right to counsel under cronic where counsel offered no assistance to defendant at plea proceedings,see childress johnson,cir acted as a mere spectator at defendant sentencing,see tucker day,cir failed to object to a directed verdict against the defendant,see harding davis,cir and deliberately stressed the brutality of his client crime,see osborn shillinger,cir.
the commonwealth contended at oral argument that cronic is inapplicable because appel had declined to be represented by counsel and invoked his right to represent himself under faretta california,d.in faretta,the supreme court examined the historical underpinnings of the right to,and ruled that a court can not compel a defendant to accept a lawyer he does not want if he voluntarily and intelligently chooses to represent himself.id.at.the court concluded that a defendant right to is protected in the sixth amendment.
we are not unaware that a trial court may believe that it is caught between the scylla and charybdis of cronic and faretta.we acknowledge that the court must sometimes walk a narrow line between the sixth amendment requirement that a defendant be provided with counsel and its requirement that a defendant be given the right of.this is not such a case because the issue is focused on the short period of time before the trial court accepted appel waiver of counsel.it is that a waiver of the right to counsel is not effective until the court accepts that it is made voluntarily,knowingly,and intelligently.see brewer williams,d see also faretta,at.noting that the defendant was voluntarily exercising his informed free will to decline representation by counsel johnson zerbst.requiring a waiver of counsel to be an intelligent and competent waiver by the accused.
moreover,a defendant waiver can not be knowing or intelligent unless the defendant is competent.see pate robinson,d.pennsylvania own procedures provide that w hen the defendant seeks to waive the right to counsel,the judge shall ascertain from the defendant,on the record,whether this is a knowing,voluntary,and intelligent waiver of counsel.c renumbered rule c.it follows that faretta does not displace appel right to effective assistance of counsel under the sixth amendment in the period before he was deemed competent to waive counsel on june.
kraft and crowe were appel counsel between june,and june.they were assigned to be appel attorneys on june,and entered appearances on his behalf.under the pennsylvania rules of criminal procedure,once an attorney has entered an appearance with the court,c ounsel for a defendant may not withdraw his or her appearance except by leave of court.b renumbered rule c and amended march,effective april.moreover,as the district court recognized,kraft and crowe were not standby counsel for appel until june,when the trial court accepted appel waiver.see district court memorandum at see also.crim d allowing appointment of standby counsel after the court accepts a defendant waiver of counsel renumbered rule d.the commonwealth reliance on faretta does not relieve us of our obligation to examine whether appel constitutional rights were properly preserved before the trial court accepted his waiver.
the commonwealth next argues that the district court should have examined appel claim under strickland ineffective assistance of counsel analysis rather than the constructive denial of counsel analysis of cronic.it contends that appel can not prove that his trial counsel alleged failures prejudiced the defendant,as required by strickland.see br.of appellant at.
strickland,decided on the same day as cronic,held that the sixth amendment right to counsel was violated if counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,and the deficiencies in counsel performance were prejudicial to the defense.strickland,at.the court further stated that j udicial scrutiny of counsel performance must be highly deferential that is,the defendant must overcome the presumption that,under the circumstances,the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.id.at.citation and quotation omitted.
both strickland and cronic address the adequacy of counsel performance.and it is indeed true that the majority of sixth amendment right to counsel cases are,and should be,analyzed under the ineffective assistance standard of strickland which requires a showing of prejudice.see childress,at noting that strickland governs most right to counsel claims united states gambino,cir noting that the cronic analysis should be used for particularly egregious circumstances.the district court similarly recognized that cronic should be applied sparingly.district court memorandum at quotation omitted.
the district court was acutely aware of the distinction.the court,however,stated that appel claims that he was denied that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.id.at capitalization omitted accordingly,we will limit our consideration to the issue on which the district court appel was constructively denied counsel in the period before the trial court accepted his waiver of counsel.
constructive denial of appel right to counsel 
we turn finally to review the merits of the basis for the district court grant of the writ of habeas corpus.the district court granted appel petition for habeas corpus based on its conclusion that appel sixth amendment right to counsel was constructively denied during the period from june,when counsel was appointed to june,when the trial court accepted his waiver of counsel and appointed kraft and crowe as standby counsel.
the district court viewed the cronic precedent as applying when counsel utterly failed to function as counsel by providing no assistance to the defendant.id.at.it noted that other courts of appeals have applied cronic in accordance with these principles,citing,inter alia,rickman bell,cir applying cronic when counsel combined a total failure to actively advocate his client cause with repeated expressions of contempt for his client for his alleged actions childress,at applying cronic when counsel offered no advice to defendant at a plea hearing and conducted no investigation to assist the defendant tippins walker,cir presuming prejudice when defense counsel slept through a substantial portion of trial,thereby suspending the adversarial nature of the process.
appel competency hearing was a critical stage of his trial.the district court noted that kraft and crowe had the obligation to act as counsel at appel competency hearing by subjecting the state evidence of competency to meaningful adversarial testing.district court memorandum at quoting cronic,at.and,in the dispositive finding,the district court found t he record is undisputed that they failed to do so they did not investigate his background,speak to his family or friends,or obtain his health or employment records.id.we have examined the record and see no reason to disagree.the commonwealth did not disagree in the district court but stated at oral argument that kraft and crowe did speak with appel parents between june and june.however,both kraft and crowe testified that these conversations concerned paying bills and handling property,not appel competency.
kraft and crowe testified repeatedly at the state pcra hearing that they believed they were not appel counsel in the short period before june.that repetition prompted the court to remark during kraft testimony 
the court well,i think attorney kraft has made clear that she was not authorized as appel attorney throughout this proceeding there is no need each time the question is asked to remind us that you were not his attorney,we understand.
we see nothing in the record that disputes the following facts set forth in appel brief on appeal 
believing that they were never appel counsel,the attorneys never even offered to investigate and never did any investigation of any type,regarding the offense or appel competency they never spoke to anyone or obtained any records about appel background and history they never asked anyone in appel family about the offense or appel background,although they knew how to contact appel parents they never asked appel girlfriend,yvonne duggan,about the offense or appel background,although they knew how to contact her they never spoke to any of appel,although they knew where he had worked they never sought or obtained appel military records,although they knew he had been in the military and had had problems there they never looked into the codefendant views about appel mental state they never sought or obtained appel employment records,although they knew that he had had problems in his employment at the lehigh county jail they never sought or obtained from the prosecution any police reports prior to the june,competency decision they never spoke to the police investigator about what he had learned about appel mental state 
in short,attorneys kraft and crowe,because they did not believe they were counsel,never conducted any investigation did not provide schwartz or the court with any information about appel and did not attempt to litigate the competency determination in any way.attorneys kraft and crowe testified that,instead of investigation or acting as counsel in the case,they did personal things for appel such as transferring car titles and making sure bills had been paid they did nothing to investigate or prepare for the competency determination.they did not subject the crucial competency determination in this capital case to any adversarial testing.
br.of appellee at emphasis in original.
it follows that there is ample support for the district court conclusion that kraft and crowe abandoned their duty to both the court and their client when they decided not to conduct any investigation on appel competency.district court memorandum at.
the commonwealth argues that the district court misapplied the law by relying on hull freeman,cir.in hull,we held that an attorney abdicated his professional obligations by failing to contest his client competency to stand trial when there were psychiatric reports of his client incompetency.notably,we were analyzing hull claims under the strickland test for ineffective assistance of counsel.see id.at.nevertheless,the district court here cited to hull in support of its ruling that kraft and crowe failed to meet their obligations as appel counsel,amounting to a violation of cronic.see district court memorandum at.contrary to the commonw
