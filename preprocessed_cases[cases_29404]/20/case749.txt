paul george schlueter,iii,is a pennsylvania inmate serving a sentence of life in prison for first degree murder.he appeals from an order of the district court entered september,dismissing his petition for a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that the applicable period of limitation barred the petition.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm the district court order.
background 
in,schlueter was arrested and charged in northampton county,pennsylvania,with the criminal homicide of carol ann bonney.the northampton county public defender office assigned public defenders george blasco and lorenzo crowe to represent schlueter and the district attorney assigned james narlesky,a assistant district attorney to prosecute the case.relying on his attorneys advice,schlueter entered a plea of nolo contendere to a charge of open degree homicide the trial court subsequently conducted a hearing to determine schlueter degree of guilt at which schlueter presented a diminished capacity defense based on his level of intoxication and drug use on the night of the homicide.the trial court found schlueter guilty of murder in the first degree and sentenced him to life in prison on may.
following his conviction,schlueter met with his attorneys to discuss whether to pursue a direct appeal.blasco and crowe advised schlueter that he would be eligible for parole in approximately years and that there were no appealable issues that could reduce his degree of guilt.accordingly,schlueter decided to forego a direct appeal.blasco died about one year later on may.schlueter contends that his attorneys parole advice was erroneous as he never will be eligible for parole.apparently in part because of having found out his actual parole situation,on august,schlueter contacted crowe requesting information for the purpose of pursuing state review.crowe,however,did not respond to schlueter request.
meanwhile,in march,the victim family initiated a wrongful death action against schlueter,who initially represented himself in the civil proceedings.based on schlueter criminal conviction,the trial court entered a directed verdict against him.in june schlueter parents retained attorney philip lauer of easton,northampton county,to represent their son in his civil appeal from the judgment against him and to explore possible challenges to his conviction under pennsylvania post conviction relief act pcra.lauer advised schlueter to postpone pursuing pcra remedies until the conclusion of the civil proceedings.the superior court affirmed the judgment against schlueter on his civil appeal and his civil appellate proceedings were terminated unsuccessfully when the pennsylvania supreme court denied his petition for allowance of appeal on november.
two years later,prior to schlueter filing a pcra petition,he and his parents learned that the pennsylvania legislature had amended the pcra to prescribe a filing deadline of january,in older cases such as schlueter by letter dated november,schlueter informed lauer of the deadline and asked him to file a timely pcra petition.lauer replied by letter dated december,that he was well aware of the deadline and would file a petition before year end.app.at.by letter dated december,lauer also informed schlueter parents that he was anticipating filing a pcra petition prior to the end of this year.app.at.nevertheless,lauer did not file a pcra petition and did not communicate further with schlueter or his parents.on march,the clerk of the northampton county court of common pleas advised schlueter in response to his inquiry that no one had filed a pcra petition on his behalf.
on may,the schlueters retained his current attorneys law firm to explore the possibility of filing a pcra petition.after repeated attempts,the new attorneys retrieved schlueter files from lauer on october.upon reviewing the files,they discovered that they did not include certain files from the public defender office.at schlueter new attorneys request,the public defender office located schlueter files and arranged for them to review the files and to interview crowe on december.during the interview with crowe,they learned that george blasco and assistant district attorney narlesky had been civil law partners in easton prior to blasco death 
relying on this information,his attorneys filed a pcra petition on schlueter behalf on february,alleging a conflict of interest arising from the civil law practice.recognizing the apparent untimeliness of their pcra petition,they attempted to invoke a statutory exception to the pcra period of limitation by arguing that the facts of the arrangement had been unknown and could not have been ascertained through the exercise of due diligence they subsequently reviewed court records and filings and learned that blasco and narlesky practiced and shared fees in civil cases,together owned and shared their office space,and shared operating expenses and personnel.
on june,more than years after he was convicted and while his pcra petition was pending,schlueter filed a motion seeking restoration of his appellate rights nunc pro tunc,arguing that the court should restore his right to a direct appeal due to his trial attorneys erroneous parole advice.after conducting a hearing,the pcra court dismissed the pcra petition as untimely and,in the same opinion,denied schlueter motion to restore his right to appeal nunc pro tunc because schlueter had knowingly and voluntarily waived his appellate rights.app.at.on appeal,the pennsylvania superior court affirmed the dismissal of schlueter pcra petition as untimely without mentioning his motion to restore his right to file a direct appeal from his conviction nunc pro tunc the pennsylvania supreme court denied schlueter petition for allowance of appeal without explanation on august.
through his attorneys,schlueter filed a federal habeas corpus petition in the district court on october,the respondents moved to dismiss the habeas petition as barred by the applicable period of limitation.the case was referred to the chief magistrate judge who rejected schlueter arguments for equitable and statutory tolling,and recommended dismissing the habeas petition as untimely.after hearing oral argument,the district court adopted the chief magistrate judge report and recommendation and dismissed schlueter habeas petition as untimely.the court,however,granted a certificate of appealability on the issue of equitable tolling.the district court subsequently amplified the certificate of appealability to include the statutory tolling issues as well.
schlueter has filed a timely appeal.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to and and our jurisdiction is based on and.we exercise plenary review over the district court order dismissing schlueter habeas petition as time barred.see douglas horn,cir.
period of limitation 
in the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa congress prescribed a period of limitation for the filing of federal habeas corpus petitions by state prisoners.see douglas,at.effective april,the aedpa provides in relevant part 
a period of limitation shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court.the limitation period shall run from the latest of 
a the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review or 
d the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.
we first determine the date on which the period began running.ordinarily under section d a,schlueter period of limitation would have begun running on april,because his conviction became final well before the effective date of the aedpa.see burns morton,cir allowing a grace period to petitioners whose convictions became final prior to the enactment of the aedpa.schlueter asserts,however,that the period began running under section d d on december,the date on which his current attorneys discovered the arrangement.appellant br.at.
by its language,the period of limitation commences under section d d when the factual predicate of a claim could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence,not when it actually was discovered.see owens boyd,cir.due diligence does not require the maximum feasible diligence,but it does require reasonable diligence in the circumstances.moore knight,cir quoting wims united states,cir.section d d provides a petitioner with a later accrual date than section d a only if vital facts could not have been known.owens,at.
we are convinced that if schlueter had exercised due diligence,he could have discovered the arrangement long before the aedpa became effective.lauer testified at the pcra hearing that it was common knowledge in the legal community in northampton county that blasco and narlesky shared office space.lauer also testified that he personally was aware of the arrangement when he represented schlueter in.indeed,in our view,it is inconceivable that blasco and narlesky could have hidden their arrangement from the relatively small legal community or the public in northampton county 
moreover,schlueter current attorneys learned of the arrangement simply by interviewing crowe who,with blasco,represented schlueter in the criminal proceedings.certainly,if he had exercised due diligence,schlueter would have had crowe interviewed many years before december,as it is apparent in view of his incarceration that schlueter had every incentive to have crowe,his surviving trial attorney,interviewed.after all,as early as august,he had written crowe requesting information for the purpose of pursuing state review.we also point out that the factual basis for the claim of impropriety based on the arrangement was hardly obscure for,after interviewing crowe and discovering the arrangement,schlueter current attorneys learned the details of the arrangement merely by reviewing court records and filings,all of which were matters of public record.appellant br.at.
we realize that lauer advised schlueter to postpone pursuing pcra review until the civil proceedings were concluded.but by the time that his parents retained lauer almost six years had elapsed since the time that schlueter first contemplated bringing review proceedings.clearly,in allowing this time to pass schlueter was not diligent.moreover,lauer advice,at most,could have delayed schlueter for only about five months from lauer retention in june until november,when the pennsylvania supreme court refused to allow him to appeal.
overall,we are satisfied that through the exercise of due diligence,schlueter could have learned the factual predicate of his conflict of interest claim well before april.therefore,the period of limitation began running under section d a on april.inasmuch as schlueter filed his federal habeas corpus petition four and years later on october,in the absence of tolling of the period of limitation,his habeas corpus petition was untimely.
in reaching our result,we recognize that schlueter is and has been incarcerated for many years and that physical confinement can limit a litigant ability to exercise due diligence.see moore knight,at.we observe from the record and references in schlueter brief,however,that schlueter parents have been involved actively in their son case for several years.thus,schlueter,unlike many other incarcerated litigants,has enjoyed the benefit of his family assistance,involvement and resources.we also point out that schlueter parents must be well educated as they both are referred to as doctor in the record in this case.therefore,schlueter incarceration does not change our view that if he had exercised due diligence he would have discovered the facts supporting his pcra claims before april.
tolling of the period of limitation 
the aedpa period of limitation is not an absolute limit.see douglas,at.rather,it is subject to two possible tolling exceptions both of which schlueter advances statutory tolling under d while a properly filed application for review is pending in the state courts and equitable tolling.see merritt blaine,cir.we examine first the period of time from april,the date on which the period began to run,through december,the date on which schlueter current attorneys discovered the arrangement,to determine whether there should be equitable tolling during any portion of this period 
the period should be equitably tolled only in the rare situation where equitable tolling is demanded by sound legal principles as well as the interests of justice.jones morton,cir.equitable tolling is appropriate 
only when the principles of equity would make the rigid application of a limitation period unfair.generally,this will occur when the petitioner has in some extraordinary way been prevented from asserting his or her rights.the petitioner must show that he or she exercised reasonable diligence in investigating and bringing the claims.
miller new jersey state dep t of,cir internal citations and alterations omitted.
schlueter bases his equitable tolling argument on what he characterizes as attorney malfeasance.specifically,he argues that the delay in filing his pcra petition and by extension his federal habeas corpus petition was due to lauer misconduct in affirmatively misrepresenting that he would file a timely pcra petition on schlueter behalf.in this regard we point out that if lauer had filed the pcra petition by the state deadline of january,there would have been a period of tolling under section d.in addition,schlueter contends that blasco and narleskys alleged misconduct in not disclosing their arrangement compounded the unfair effect of lauer failure to file a pcra petition after representing that he would do so.
generally,in a case such as schlueter,attorney error is not a sufficient basis for equitable tolling of the aedpa period of limitation.see johnson hendricks,cir.nevertheless,we have held,albeit outside the habeas context,that there are narrow circumstances in which the misbehavior of an attorney may merit equitable tolling.seitzinger reading hosp.med,cir.seitzinger involved a title vii plaintiff who asked her attorney prior to the expiration of an applicable period of limitations if he had filed a complaint on her behalf.id.at.the attorney falsely stated that he had done so whereas,in fact,he did not file a complaint until one day after the limitations period expired.id.we held that the attorney affirmative misrepresentation to his client,coupled with the plaintiff extreme diligence in pursuing her claim and the absence of prejudice to the defendant,created a situation appropriate for tolling.id.at.
we find that the material facts of seitzinger are distinguishable from those presented here.in seitzinger,counsel misrepresented to his client that he already had filed a timely complaint and by the time the client discovered that her attorney had not done so the period of limitations had expired.here,in december,lauer informed schlueter and his parents that he anticipated filing a pcra petition before the end of the year.when the year ended,schlueter could have learned,as he did later,that lauer had not filed a pcra petition.if he had done so he still would have had a small window of time in which to file a pro se petition and save his pcra claims from dismissal as untimely.thus,his situation differs sharply from that of the seitzinger plaintiff who was misled by what the attorney said he had done,not by what he said he would do.
moreover,it is apparent that schlueter was fully aware of his pcra rights in when he retained lauer schlueter knew that lauer had done little,if anything,to pursue pcra relief for more than two years.notwithstanding this knowledge,neither schlueter nor his parents took affirmative steps to ensure the timely filing of a pcra petition until schlueter wrote his november,letter to lauer advising him of the pcra deadline and asking him to file a timely petition.then after the end of schlueter did not attempt to ascertain from lauer prior to the january,deadline of which he was well aware whether lauer,in fact,had filed a pcra petition.we also find it significant that the period of limitations at issue in seitzinger was a brief days and that the attorney filed the complaint only one day late.thus,the attorney misconduct warranted equitably tolling one day of a short period of limitations.here,the aedpa limitation period is one year,and did not begin to run until april,nearly nine years after schlueter conviction became final in.schlueter did not initiate state proceedings until and did not pursue federal habeas corpus relief until even though he had been convicted in.the circumstances in schlueter case simply do not warrant the application of equitable tolling after such lengthy periods of time had elapsed following his conviction before he sought state and federal relief 
schlueter also relies on spitsyn moore,cir,and baldayaque united states,cir,for the proposition that attorney malfeasance constitutes an extraordinary circumstance sufficient to warrant equitable tolling of the period of limitation.as these cases amply demonstrate,however,a finding that attorney malfeasance is an extraordinary circumstance,without more,is not sufficient to warrant equitable tolling.spitsyn holds that egregious attorney misconduct may justify equitable tolling,but also requires district courts to examine the petitioner due diligence in pursuing the matter under the specific circumstances he faced.spitsyn,at.likewise,baldayaque holds that an attorney conduct,if it is sufficiently egregious,may constitute the sort of extraordinary circumstances that would justify the application of equitable tolling.baldayaque,at.baldayaque,however,expressly states that the presence of extraordinary circumstances is not enough a petitioner must also show that he acted with reasonable diligence,and that the extraordinary circumstances caused his petition to be untimely.id.at citation omitted.in other words,neither spitsyn nor baldayaque holds that attorney malfeasance,standing alone,warrants equitable tolling 
for these reasons,we conclude that the circumstances presented in schlueter case do not warrant equitable tolling.we are convinced that if schlueter had exercised reasonable diligence,he could have brought his claims in a timely fashion,lauer alleged misconduct notwithstanding accordingly,we can not equitably toll the period of time from april,until december,or during any portion thereof.we conclude,therefore,that the aedpa period of limitation expired before schlueter filed his pcra petition,his motion to reinstate his direct appeal nunc pro tunc,or his federal habeas corpus petition 
in view of our disposition we address only briefly schlueter arguments for equitable or statutory tolling while either his pcra petition or his motion to reinstate his direct appeal nunc pro tunc was pending in the state courts.we do note that merritt blaine,at,forecloses schlueter argument for statutory tolling during the time his untimely pcra petition was pending as it holds that a federal habeas court for purposes of section d defers to a state court ruling dismissing a pcra petition as untimely accordingly it is clear that his untimely state pcra claim can not possibly help him.
we also reject his claim that somehow filing his motion to restore his appellate rights on june,more than one year after the aedpa period of limitations had run,should lead to statutory tolling on the basis that the motion was a properly filed application for review under section d.while he predicates this argument on the theory that his motion was denied on the merits,appellant br.at,inasmuch as the state court pointed out that schlueter had knowingly and voluntarily waived his appellate rights,it is clear that the appeal was not permitted because it would have been untimely and there was no basis to circumvent the time bar and not because schlueter could not have demonstrated that there had been a reversible error in the trial proceedings so that an appeal would have been futile.we decline to adopt a construction of the aedpa that permits a petition for habeas corpus to be deemed timely on the basis of section d providing for tolling for properly filed application s for state review merely because the petitioner unsuccessfully has sought the right to appeal nunc pro tunc years after his unexercised right to file a timely direct appeal has expired.see douglas,at.
finally we recognize that the dissent contends that there is a strong argument for equitable tolling predicated on various pennsylvania state appellate decisions based on schlueter filing of the pcra petition and his motion to reinstate his direct appeal nunc pro tunc.dissenting opinion at.this point is critical in the dissent analysis as it points out that equitable tolling during the period from april,until december,saves schlueter claim only if we also toll pending resolution of the proceedings.id.we need not discuss these state decisions as he pursued both forms of relief after the aedpa period of limitations already had run.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that the district court properly dismissed schlueter habeas corpus petition as time barred by the period of limitation.accordingly,we will affirm the district court order entered september.
it is an underlying assumption of our legal system that attorneys actively pursue the best interests of their clients.all too often,attorneys make mistakes.the sad reality is that there are not enough willing defense attorneys to represent competently the interests of the many criminal defendants who cycle through the courts.and thus,necessarily,we afford substantial leeway to attorneys when it comes to mere attorney error.roe,d.
but the distinction between mistake and malfeasance is profound.there can be little semblance of justice when an attorney assigned to protect a defendant ignores a blatant conflict of interest,and another counsel does nothing while promising more than once to protect the defendant rights.if the facts are as paul schlueter has portrayed them,his trial counsel george blasco disregarded his civil law partnership with the prosecutor james narlesky,and his appellate counsel philip lauer affirmatively misrepresented that he would timely file a petition for relief in order to forestall the inevitable accounting for his and legal services irony becomes kafkaesque when the latter act of malfeasance shelters from review the former act of malfeasance.
i can not in good conscience bury schlueter case before it sees the light of day.aedpa confers on federal courts the authority equitably to toll its limitations period in the interest of justice.if any case is ripe for exercise of that power,this one is.accordingly,i respectfully dissent.
as the majority explained,schlueter habeas petition would ordinarily have been due on april.see douglas horn,cir.he did not file his petition,however,until october.thus the petition was timely only if the limitations period was tolled.
the aedpa filing deadline is subject to equitable tolling when the principles of equity would make the rigid application of a limitation period unfair.miller state dep t of,cir internal quotation omitted.while this principle on its face is broad,it is to be applied sparingly.equitable tolling is appropriate when the petitioner has in some extraordinary way been prevented from asserting his or her rights.the petitioner must show that he or she exercised reasonable diligence in investigating and bringing the claims.id.at internal quotations omitted see also jones morton,cir.
we have concluded,as a general matter,that attorney error is not so extraordinary as to justify equitable tolling.see,johnson hendricks,cir.this rule makes sense,as attorney error is normally attributed to the client.see,united states boyle,d.but it does not follow that tolling based on deception of the kind alleged by schlueter in this case is also foreclosed.
schlueter and his parents wrote to and called lauer on many occasions over a period of several months.he falsely assured them that he was preparing a pcra petition and would timely file.but he made no such preparations.after allowing the deadline to pass,he ceased all communication with the schlueters.he did not return their many phone calls or letters,nor did he timely return schlueter files despite repeated requests from schlueter and his new counsel.lauer intentional abandonment of schlueter case can not plausibly be labeled error.his behavior,i believe,was sufficiently egregious to bring it within the narrow line of cases in which lawyer misconduct justifies equitable tolling.seitzinger reading hosp.med,cir.
the law of agency provides a useful framework for understanding the distinction between error and misconduct.see baldayaque united states,cir jacobs,concurring.ordinarily,a ttorney ignorance or inadvertence does not excuse a petitioner with aedpa,because the attorney is the petitioner agent when acting,or failing to act,in furtherance of the litigation.coleman thompson,d rejecting attorney error as cause for procedurally defaulted habeas claims see also mccarthy recordex,cir it is,of course,beyond cavil that the relationship is an relationship.we assume,for better or worse,that a lawyer is acting as the petitioner agent,and the petitioner therefore bear s the risk of attorney error.coleman,at.link wabash,d e ach party is deemed bound by the acts of his.
but it is a fundamental principle of agency law that the knowledge of an agent is not attributed to the principal when the agent is acting in a manner adverse to the interests of the principal.restatement third of agency tentative draft notice is not imputed to the principal of a fact that an agent knows or has reason to know if the agent acts adversely to the principal in a transaction or matter for the agent own purposes.mere attorney error does not constitute an extraordinary circumstance because a circumstance,to be extraordinary,must be beyond the prisoner control.harris hutchinson,cir.thus,we have explained,a client who relies on the faulty advice of his lawyer has not encountered an obstacle to filing that is external to his conduct.johnson,at.conversely,when,as here,an attorney ceases altogether to serve the interests of his client,the law of agency is clear that the attorney acts alone.
this central attorney malfeasance should not be attributed to the any number of parallel paths to tolling in this case.we might conclude that schlueter,had lauer not represented that he was acting on the case,would timely have filed a petition under pennsylvania relief act pcra.ann,et,prior to the deadline that would have presented blasco clear conflict as trial counsel.thus we might equitably toll the statute from april,the day it began to run,to december,the day that schlueter new counsel was put on notice of the relationship between blasco and narlesky we might hold that equity requires us to toll the statute to the day that schlueter habeas petition was finally filed.or we might even conclude that schlueter falls within the ambit of d d,because the conflict of interest,though discoverable by lauer based on his alleged knowledge of blasco and narlesky office sharing arrangement,was not reasonably ascertainable by an incarcerated inmate who was forestalled from pursuing his case by the false assurances of a third party 
other courts have applied equitable tolling under circumstances like these.in baldayaque,at,for example,an attorney failed timely to file a motion requested by his client and made inadequate efforts to communicate with him.the second circuit held that the attorney,b y refusing to do what was requested by his client on such a fundamental matter,violated a basic duty of an attorney to his client.his actions,the court continued,were far enough outside the range of behavior that reasonably could be expected by a client that they may be considered extraordinary and thereby justify the application of equitable tolling to the limitations period of aedpa.id.at.see also spitsyn moore,cir based upon the unique facts of this case,where an attorney was retained to prepare and file a petition,failed to do so,and disregarded requests to return the files pertaining to petitioner case until well after the date the petition was due,we agree that equitable tolling of the deadline is appropriate.united states wynn,cir wynn allegation that he was deceived by his attorney into believing that a timely motion had been filed on his behalf presents a rare and extraordinary circumstance beyond petitioner control that could warrant equitable tolling of the statute of limitations.doherty teamsters pension trust fund of phila.vicinity,cir tolling based on the death of the petitioner attorney.
in our circuit,the principal case on point is seitzinger.it involved a title vii claim,though we have since applied its reasoning to habeas cases.see,brown shannon,cir.the supreme court has cautioned that in the title vii context the principles of equitable tolling do not extend to what is at best a garden variety claim of excusable neglect.irwin dep t veterans affairs,d.our task in seitzinger was to decide whether misconduct by the plaintiff attorney was merely garden variety or,rather,was something more egregious.the plaintiff alleged that she repeatedly asked her attorney whether he had filed a complaint,and each time he misrepresented to her that he had.under these circumstances,we concluded that equitable tolling was appropriate.seitzinger,at.
of course,seitzinger also requires that the client be reasonably diligent in pursuing his or her claims.but the facts of seitzinger leave little doubt that schlueter has met that burden.in concluding that the plaintiff in seitzinger was diligent,we emphasized that she hired an attorney to file her civil complaint contacted him before the filing deadline,which she knew about in broad terms,to ensure that he had filed the complaint and repeatedly called him in order to obtain a copy of the complaint and monitor the status of her case.id.at.all of these factors are true in schlueter case as well.in fact,schlueter and his family were,if anything,more diligent.they apprised their attorney of the precise filing deadline whereas seitzinger was aware,in broad terms,that a deadline existed with ample time to prepare a petition.in addition to their phone calls,the schlueters wrote several letters seeking to ensure that the pcra petition would be filed prior to the deadline.and they received written assurances that a petition would timely be filed.
once the deadline had passed,the schlueters did everything that could reasonably be expected of them.when their phone calls from lauer were not returned,they wrote to the clerk office directly.that office did not respond until march.the time between the schlueters discovery of lauer failure to file and their retaining new counsel was just over two months.after that,matters were largely out of schlueter and his counsel hands.lauer simply did not turn over the files for many months.
the majority dismisses schlueter efforts as inadequate.they suggest that he was not entitled to rely on the two written assurances by the attorney whom he had hired to pursue his case rather,on new year day of,he should have ascertained whether lauer had indeed filed as promised.never mind that lauer had ceased to return phone calls on schlueter behalf.never mind that when the schlueters,having received no word from lauer for months,inquired with the clerk office whether a petition had been filed,it was nearly forty days before they received a response.schlueter,says the majority,might have done more.
this,i suppose,is theoretically true.but it blinks reality to suggest that schlueter might have retained substitute counsel willing to prepare a petition within the two short weeks between the end of and the pcra filing deadline.still,he might have filed his own pcra petition pro se,just in case.that would have been supremely diligent.
but supreme diligence is not required.on the contrary,the standard is a relatively modest one.schlueter diligence need only have been reasonable under the circumstances.baldayaque,at the standard is not extreme diligence or exceptional diligence,it is reasonable diligence.emphasis in text.i believe that schlueter protracted efforts handily qualify.but if the majority is not convinced,it seems to me better to remand for the district court to consider this issue in the first instance rather than dismiss outright his habeas petition.see id.
still,the majority insists,seitzinge
