on january,jessie derrell williams murdered karen ann pierce.the killing was gruesome.pierce likely was alive when williams cut out her genitals.he then stabbed her in the chest and slit her throat.williams does not dispute that he murdered pierce nor does he dispute the manner in which he committed the murder.after a trial and conviction for capital murder,a jury sentenced williams to death.after exhausting his state remedies,williams sought habeas relief in federal district court.the district court denied his petition.williams now seeks a certificate of appealability coa.williams argues that his constitutional rights were violated because there was insufficient evidence presented to support a kidnaping conviction the prosecutor failed to turn over potentially exculpatory information and the jury that williams after his first not his been reversed was not instructed on the elements of kidnaping.to obtain a coa,the defendant must make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.c.williams has not made such a showing with respect to any of his claims.we therefore deny his application for a coa.
on the night of january,pierce went with a date to the scoreboard lounge in gautier,mississippi.throughout the night,pierce consumed beer and drugs.her date left the scoreboard early in the evening after she refused to go home with him.sometime after her date left and before williams arrived,pierce was.after the rape,pierce and the rapists remained at the bar.toward the end of the evening,williams,michael norwood,and terrell evans arrived.evans and pierce began talking,and evans convinced her to go for a ride with williams,norwood,and himself.on the way out of town,they stopped at a convenience store,bought some beer,and continued on to a secluded spot off interstate.they smoked marijuana and drank beer.norwood and williams proceeded to have sex with pierce a number of times in the bed of the truck.during one of the times with williams,pierce asked him to stop.he did not.pierce then asked to go back to the scoreboard to pick up some of her things.the men refused to take her back to the bar.at some point during the night,pierce and williams exited the truck.pierce started to run away from williams.williams then tackled her and dragged her into the woods.after waiting awhile,evans went searching for williams and pierce.evans saw williams with a knife standing over pierce mangled and cut body.as evans began to walk away,williams said i am not leaving until i sure she is dead.fifteen minutes later,williams returned to the truck.the three men left the scene.ten days later,pierce body was found.her blood contained percent alcohol and traces of drugs.the cause of death was a knife wound.the location of the wound was the area between pierce vagina and her rectum,a wound inflicted while pierce apparently was still alive.
in december,a mississippi jury found williams guilty of committing murder during the course of a kidnaping,a capital murder offense in mississippi.code ann.e.the jury sentenced williams to death.williams appealed his conviction and sentence.in this first of several appeals,williams asserted numerous claims before the mississippi supreme court.on,the court affirmed his conviction but found reversible error at sentencing when the trial court allowed the prosecutor to comment on the possibility of parole and the lengthy appellate review process.the court remanded the case for a new sentencing hearing.williams state,so d.at this hearing,a second jury specifically found three aggravating circumstances that weighed in favor of the death penalty that williams was previously convicted of a felony involving the threat of violence to a person that the capital offense was committed while williams was engaged in the commission of a kidnaping and that the capital murder of pierce was especially heinous,atrocious,and cruel.the jury also found that there were no mitigating circumstances to outweigh the aggravating circumstances.accordingly,the second jury,like the first jury,sentenced williams to death.williams directly appealed this sentence.the mississippi supreme court rejected all of williams claims and affirmed the sentence of death.williams then sought relief from the united states supreme court.the court denied williams petition for writ of certiorari.williams mississippi,d.
while williams was pursuing these extensive direct appeals,he was also attacking his conviction collaterally in the state courts.in january,williams filed an application with the mississippi supreme court under the collateral relief act pccra.the application sought to set aside his conviction and sentence.williams argued that the state had violated certain state discovery rules when it withheld information regarding a plea agreement between the state and evans,the key witness in this case.the mississippi supreme court denied the application and held that williams was procedurally barred from making this claim collaterally.williams state,so d.in november,williams filed an application seeking leave to apply for relief a second time,claiming ineffective assistance of counsel.the mississippi supreme court denied the application.williams state,so d.
williams next turned to the federal courts.in january,williams filed a petition for relief in the southern district of mississippi,in which he raised four claims related to the guilt phase of the trial,six claims related to the sentencing phase of the trial,and an overarching claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.the district court denied relief,and williams sought a certificate of appealability.the district court denied this request.
finally,almost eighteen years after the night williams killed and mutilated pierce,this case comes before us.
before turning to the three claims upon which williams bases his request for a coa,we will first address the relevant standard of review.williams filed his federal petition on january.the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa became effective on april.aedpa therefore governs this case.as we have previously noted,under aedpa a petitioner is entitled to a coa if he makes a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.c.to make such a showing the petitioner must demonstrate that reasonable jurists could debate or for that matter,agree that the habeas petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.barrientes johnson,cir quoting slack mcdaniel,d,cert dismissed,d.
our task in this case is to decide whether the district court assessment of williams constitutional claims is either debatable or wrong.see slack,at.the district court assessment of the constitutional claims of state prisoners in a habeas petition is restricted.under aedpa,federal courts must first decide the contours of clearly established federal law as determined by the united states supreme court,and second,decide whether the state court decision was contrary involved an unreasonable application law.d.
just as section d restricts the district court assessment of williams constitutional claims,it also limits our review in this coa request.we engage in the following double barreled reasonableness inquiry with respect to each constitutional claim is the district court determination that the state court did not unreasonably apply clearly established federal law debatable among reasonable jurists see barrientes,at t he determination of whether a coa should issue must be made by viewing williams arguments through the lens of the deferential scheme laid out in d.
with this standard of review in mind we will assess,in turn,williams claims that his constitutional rights were violated because there was insufficient evidence to support a conviction for kidnaping the prosecutor failed to turn over potentially exculpatory evidence and the sentencing jury was not instructed on the elements of kidnaping.
both the state trial court and the mississippi supreme court found that there was sufficient evidence to support williams conviction of kidnaping.the district court concluded that this determination was not c
