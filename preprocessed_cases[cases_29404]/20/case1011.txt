petitioner willie brown,filed a petition for habeas relief in the district court under west supp,challenging a sentence of death imposed after his conviction in north carolina for the armed robbery and murder of vallerie ann roberson dixon.brown asserts that his death sentence is constitutionally infirm because the state trial court instructed the jury that unanimity was required to find mitigating circumstances,a practice struck down by the united states supreme court in mckoy north carolina,d.brown also contends that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to investigate and present additional mitigating evidence during the sentencing phase of his trial.
the district court dismissed brown habeas petition,but granted brown application for a certificate of appealability on the unanimity issue.see west supp.brown now seeks a certificate of appealability from this court granting him permission to appeal the district court dismissal of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim as well.
for the following reasons,we reverse the district court holding that brown unanimity claim is procedurally barred and remand to the district court for consideration of the merits of that claim.we deny,however,brown application for a certificate of appealability on the ineffective assistance of counsel claim.
in november,a north carolina jury convicted brown of the armed robbery and murder of vallerie ann roberson dixon.the facts leading to brown conviction are fully set forth by the north carolina supreme court in state brown.given the more narrow issues before us,a brief summary will suffice here.
at approximately on the morning of march,a zip mart convenience store on main street in williamston,north carolina,where dixon was supposed to be working as a clerk,was reported empty.a patrolling police officer had seen dixon in the store less than thirty minutes prior to the report.money from the cash register and a store safe was missing,as was dixon automobile.a search for dixon was immediately begun.
at about,a police officer spotted dixon automobile traveling on a nearby road.the automobile was stopped by police officers,and brown,who was driving alone in the vehicle,was immediately placed under arrest and advised of his rights.a caliber revolver,a paper bag containing approximately in cash and change,and a change purse containing dixon drivers license and social security card were found in the automobile.a pair of ski gloves and a toboggan cap with eye holes cut out of it were found on brown person.the exterior of the car was partly covered with fresh mud.according to the police officers,brown admitted that he robbed the zip mart and fled in dixon car,but claimed that dixon was unharmed when he left the store.
at approximately that afternoon,dixon body was found on a muddy logging road in a rural area outside williamston.forensic pathology and firearm tests revealed that dixon had been shot six times with the caliber revolver that police had found in dixon car at the time of brown arrest.
brown testified at his trial and disputed the police officers version of the events that day.brown testified that,while he was jogging near the zip mart,a man ran past him and away from a parked car with an opened door.brown testified that he saw a gun and bag of money on the seat of the car,sat down in the vehicle,and was arrested by police before he could get out of the vehicle.brown denied robbing or killing dixon,and denied making any admissions to the police.on,brown admitted that he had been previously convicted in north carolina of breaking and entering and in virginia for five armed robberies and the assault of a police officer.he denied,however,that he was guilty of committing those crimes.
following the presentation of all the evidence,the jury convicted brown of murder and robbery with a dangerous weapon.a capital sentencing proceeding was then held,see,during which additional details of brown prior convictions in north carolina and virginia were presented to the jury.brown had been convicted in in north carolina of six counts of felonious larceny and six counts of breaking or entering.in,brown was convicted in virginia of five counts of armed robbery and one count of felonious assault.the victim of the assault was a virginia police officer,who testified at the sentencing hearing that he was shot and paralyzed when brown shot him three times in an attempt to avoid arrest.
in mitigation,brown presented the testimony of law enforcement officers who testified that he offered no resistance to his arrest for murder,that he was not disrespectful during interrogation,and that he had an intense emotional reaction,crying and shaking,when questioned about dixon.brown also presented testimony from his mother,who testified that brown was the second of seven children,that he was born and raised in williamston,that he was not a good student,that his father died in,that she had visited him regularly in prison,and that he had treated her with respect when he returned to live at home after his release from prison.brown school records documenting his poor scholastic record were also presented.
at the conclusion of the sentencing phase of the trial,three potential aggravating circumstances were submitted for consideration by the jury that brown had previously been convicted of a felony involving the use of threat or violence to the person that the murder was committed by brown while he was engaged in the commission of or flight after committing a robbery and that the murder was especially heinous,atrocious or cruel.the jury found all three aggravating circumstances to be present.
the trial court submitted seven possible mitigating circumstances for the jury consideration that brown had no significant history of prior criminal activity that brown was a person of limited intelligence and education that brown was under the age of at the time he committed any previous felonies for which he had been convicted that brown had not been convicted of any criminal offense for years that brown surrendered at the time of his arrest without resistance to law enforcement officers that brown confessed soon after his arrest to robbing the zip mart and any other circumstances which the jury deemed to have mitigating value.
the jury found no mitigating circumstances and returned a recommendation that brown be sentenced to death for the murder conviction.following the recommendation,the trial court imposed the sentence.the north carolina supreme court affirmed brown conviction and death sentence,see brown,at,and the united states supreme court denied brown petition for writ of certiorari.see brown north carolina,d.
on march,brown filed a motion for appropriate relief mar,see,in martin county superior court,asserting for the first time that the trial court had erroneously instructed the jury that it must unanimously find any mitigating circumstances,in violation of his rights under the eighth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution.brown also alleged that his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel was violated by trial counsel failure to adequately investigate and present mitigating evidence.
on november,superior court judge charles winberry concluded that brown was procedurally barred from raising all issues set forth in his mar,including the unanimity issue,except for those alleging ineffective assistance of counsel.on march,brown the unanimity issue in an amended mar,and sought reconsideration of the november order shortly thereafter,citing the intervening supreme court decision in mckoy north carolina,d on january,however,the state mar court concluded that the november order,procedurally barring the unanimity claim,constituted a final judgment and was the law of the case.in,after having conducted an evidentiary hearing on brown claims of ineffective assistance of counsel,the state mar court entered an order denying brown motion for appropriate relief and his amendments to that original motion.brown apparently raised the unanimity claim yet again in a second mar filed in august,which in november was likewise rejected as procedurally barred.brown attempts to seek review of the state court mar orders by the north carolina supreme court and the united states supreme court were ultimately unsuccessful,and brown turned to the federal habeas court for relief.
brown petition raised eleven constitutional challenges to his conviction and sentence,including the unanimity issue and ineffective assistance of counsel claim.following an evidentiary hearing,the district court granted the state motion for summary judgment,denied brown motion for summary judgment,and dismissed the petition.brown subsequent motion to alter or amend the judgment was also denied.the district court refused to review the merits of brown unanimity claim because the state court had procedurally barred him from raising it,and rejected brown ineffective assistance of counsel claim on the merits.
in may,brown filed an application for a certificate of appealability with the district court,seeking an appeal of the district court conclusion that it was procedurally barred from considering the unanimity claim and the district court denial of brown ineffective assistance claim.see.the district court found that brown had made an adequate showing that reasonable jurists could debate the application of procedural default to his unanimity claim and granted brown application for a certificate of appealability as to this claim.however,the court denied a certificate of appealability as to brown ineffective assistance of counsel claim.
accordingly,the issues pending before us are whether the district court erred in concluding that brown has procedurally defaulted federal habeas review of the merits of his unanimity claim because the north carolina state court concluded it was procedurally barred and whether brown application for a certificate of appealability,seeking permission from this court to appeal his ineffective assistance of counsel claim,should be granted.
we begin with brown appeal of the district court conclusion that he procedurally defaulted federal habeas review of the merits of his claim that his constitutional rights under the eighth and fourteenth amendments were violated because the trial court instructed the jury during his sentencing phase that it must unanimously find the existence of any mitigating circumstances.the district court held that it was procedurally barred from considering the merits of this unanimity claim because brown had failed to raise the issue on direct appeal to the north carolina supreme court and the north carolina mar court procedurally barred review of the claim on this basis.
in,the united states supreme court held that north carolina requirement that a jury unanimously find the existence of a mitigating circumstance before weighing it against aggravating circumstances impermissibly prevented each juror from considering all of the mitigating evidence.see mckoy,at.however,just six months prior to brown november conviction,the north carolina supreme court had found no error in a trial court instructions concerning a requirement of unanimity for mitigating circumstances.see state kirkley.five years after kirkley was decided and brown was convicted,however,the united states supreme court reversed a death sentence imposed in maryland because there was a substantial probability that reasonable jurors well may have thought they were precluded from considering any mitigating evidence unless all jurors agreed on the existence of a particular such circumstance.mills maryland,d.the north carolina supreme court attempted to distinguish the maryland instruction at issue in mills from north carolina unanimity requirement,see state mckoy,but the united states supreme court ultimately held that north carolina requirement likewise failed to pass constitutional muster,see mckoy,at.the constitution,the court held,requires that each juror must be allowed to consider all mitigating evidence in deciding whether aggravating circumstances outweigh mitigating circumstances,and whether the aggravating circumstances,when considered with any mitigating circumstances,are sufficiently substantial to justify a sentence of death.id.at.see also williams french,cir.
shortly after the united states supreme court issued its decision in mckoy,the north carolina supreme court ruled that it would not apply the plain error standard to direct appeals of capital defendants who had failed to object at trial to a mckoy error,at least for all trials conducted after kirkley but before mills.see state sanderson.such errors would,however,be subjected to a harmless error analysis.see id.at see also state mcneil.
in march,a panel of this court held that the unanimity holdings in mills and mckoy were exceptions to the general rule that new rules do not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review.see williams dixon,cir citing teague lane,d.two years later,in june,the north carolina supreme court adopted the retroactivity standard announced in teague,and likewise held that mckoy would be applied retroactively to final cases on state review,at least where the defendant assigned the instruction as error on direct review.state zuniga.
brown initially challenged the trial court unanimity instruction in his first mar,filed in march.in november,the state mar court ruled that brown was procedurally barred from raising the claim because he was in a position to adequately raise the issue before the north carolina supreme court on direct appeal and had failed to do so.see.a providing that an mar may be denied when u pon a previous appeal the defendant was in a position to adequately raise the ground or issue underlying the present motion but did not do so.this ruling,of course,the north carolina supreme court kirkley decision upholding the unanimity instruction,but predated the united states supreme court decisions in mills and mckoy,as well as the decisions in williams and zuniga regarding retroactivity.however,as set forth above,brown attempts to the unanimity issue in the wake of mills and mckoy,and to obtain reconsideration of the mar court november order,were unsuccessful because the mar court concluded that the november order constituted a final judgment and was the law of the case.
under the doctrine of procedural default,a federal habeas court is precluded from reviewing the merits of a constitutional claim that the state refused to consider on the merits pursuant to an independent and adequate state procedural rule,unless the petitioner can demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law,or demonstrate that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.coleman thompson,d see also harris reed,d.
the assessment of whether a particular state procedure is independent and adequate,so as to bar consideration of the merits of a federal constitutional claim,is a question of federal,not state,law.see johnson mississippi,d see also edwards carpenter,d breyer,concurring.a state rule is adequate if it is firmly established and regularly or consistently applied by the state court,see johnson,at,and independent if it does not depend on a federal constitutional ruling,ake oklahoma,d.see also yeatts angelone,cir.
the basis for the district court determination that brown procedurally defaulted federal habeas review of his unanimity claim is.a,which sets forth the following procedural bars to the state court review of issues raised in a motion for appropriate relief 
upon a previous motion made pursuant to this article,the defendant was in a position to adequately raise the ground or issue underlying the present motion but did not do so 
the ground or issue underlying the motion was previously determined on the merits upon an appeal from the judgment or upon a previous motion or proceeding in the courts of this state or a federal court,unless since the time of such previous determination there has been a retroactively effective change in the law controlling such issue.
upon a previous appeal the defendant was in a position to adequately raise the ground or issue underlying the present motion but did not do so 
the defendant failed to file a timely motion for appropriate relief as required by a.
section was amended in june.prior to that time.b provided that a lthough the court may deny the motion under any of the circumstances specified in subsection a,in the interest of justice and for good cause shown it may in its discretion grant the motion if it is otherwise meritorious.b.the amended version of section b now provides that 
b the court shall deny the motion under any of the circumstances specified in subsection a,unless the defendant can demonstrate 
good cause for excusing the grounds for denial listed in subsection a of this section and can demonstrate actual prejudice resulting from the defendant claim or 
that failure to consider the defendant claim will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.
b emphasis added.therefore,the amendment to section b made the state procedural bars established under section a mandatory,rather than discretionary,unless the petitioner can demonstrate good cause or a fundamental miscarriage of justice.see rose lee,cir.
brown asserts that the state mar court did not review and reject his mckoy claim based upon an independent and adequate state law ground because,although the procedural bars available under subsections a and a have generally been found to be adequate to preclude federal habeas review of other types of defaulted constitutional claims,the state procedural bars have not been regularly and consistently followed by north carolina courts which have been presented with alleged unanimity claims 
as correctly noted by the parties,we have on a number of occasions held that subsections a and a are independent and adequate state law grounds for finding that a claim has been procedurally defaulted.see,fisher lee,cir boyd french,cir williams,at ashe styles,cir.however,as the parties also correctly note,this general observation does not end our inquiry.see,bacon lee,cir,cert.denied,d mccarver lee,cir.where the procedural bars available in subsections a and a have not been regularly and consistently applied by the state court to a particular type of federal constitutional claim,they can not be considered an adequate state law ground barring federal court review of the merits of that claim.see mccarver,at see also hathorn lovorn,d state courts may not avoid deciding federal issues by invoking procedural rules that they do not apply evenhandedly to all similar claims.otherwise,state courts would be able to engage in an arbitrary application of state procedural rules to thwart federal habeas review of constitutional issues that the adequacy requirement was designed to prevent.
thus,as we have previously held,t he question we must ask is whether the particular procedural bar is applied consistently to cases that are procedurally,cases in which the particular claim raised could have been raised previously but was not.mccarver,at second emphasis added.c onsistent or regular application of a state rule of procedural default does not require that the state court show an undeviating adherence to such rule admitting of no exception so long as the rule has as a general rule been applied in the vast majority of cases.mueller angelone,cir internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted see also yeatts,at.
in this case,our precise inquiry is to determine whether the procedural bars in subsection a or a have been applied consistently to cases in which a unanimity claim could have been raised on direct appeal but was not.to support their respective positions on this issue,the parties have directed our attention to ten capital defendants in north carolina who first raised a claim that their sentencing jury was improperly instructed that it must unanimously find the existence of any mitigating circumstances after the completion of their direct appeal,in motions for appropriate relief brought under section.of these ten capital defendants,six received an adjudication of the merits of their unanimity claim and four found their claims to be procedurally barred under section a.
we begin with those cases,relied upon by brown,in which the state mar courts did not apply the procedural bars available at the time for discretionary application under subsections a and a.
michael van mcdougall was convicted of capital murder in.he raised his unanimity claim in a second mar filed june,just days after the supreme court decision in mills was issued.at the time,mcdougall had already filed a federal habeas petition,and this court delayed issuing our opinion pending the supreme court decision in mckoy.on december,we held that mckoy did not apply to mcdougall instruction.see mcdougall dixon,cir.we also stated,in dicta,that even if mckoy applied,it would represent new law not applicable retroactively to cases on collateral review.see id.thus,mcdougall received an adjudication on the merits of his unanimity claim,albeit an unsuccessful one.shortly thereafter,the state mar court ruled upon mcdougall second mar which had also raised the unanimity claim.the state argued that mcdougall mckoy claim was procedurally barred by section,but the state mar judge refused to so rule,noting that g iven the state of the law in north carolina regarding capital sentencing procedure during the period of mcdougall direct appeal and the decision on his first mar,and the impossibility of predicting future appellate decisions on federal constitutional law,this c ourt declines to conclude that mcdougall claim is procedurally barred.the court then proceeded to also address,but ultimately reject,mcdougall unanimity claim on the merits.
the case of douglas williams,who was convicted in,is also apposite.by order dated june,the state mar court addressed the merits of a unanimity claim first raised by williams in his mar,but held that the jury was properly charged in accordance with the north carolina supreme court kirkley decision which was still controlling precedent in north carolina at the time.the claim had not been presented on direct appeal from williams conviction,but we find no indication in our record as to whether the state mar court was presented with a claim that williams had procedurally defaulted the issue by not raising it on direct appeal.in,on appeal from the district court denial of williams petition for writ of habeas corpus and contrary to the dicta in mcdougall,we expressly held that the rules applied retroactively to cases on collateral review.see williams,at.accordingly,we vacated williams death sentence and remanded the case to the district court.see id.at.
in,the state mar court specifically rejected the contention that alton garner green,convicted in also after the kirkley decision was issued,was procedurally barred from raising a unanimity challenge by his failure to raise the issue at trial or on direct appeal from his conviction.noting that a t the time of green trial,and on appeal,no lawyer or judge in north carolina had reason to believe there was error in the unanimity instruction that required correction,the court ruled that green failure to raise the issue did not bar him from raising it on state review.in addition,the court found that in the interests of justice and for good cause shown,green should be allowed to raise the mckoy issue in th e proceeding.thus,the state mar court again invoked its discretion under section b to address the merits of an otherwise procedurally defaulted unanimity claim.
two additional capital defendants,francis marion anthony and andrew craig,also obtained state mar review of the merits of unanimity claims that had not been raised on direct appeal.in the craig case,an order was entered by superior court judge davis in august,ruling that craig unanimity claim,raised in a second mar,was procedurally barred pursuant to section.however,the unanimity claim,as well as others raised in the second mar,was later reheard by senior resident superior court judge beale.judge beale issued an order dated july,denying a number of claims,but not the unanimity claim,as being procedurally barred pursuant to section.instead,judge beale rejected the unanimity claims of both craig and anthony on the merits and not on the basis of a procedural bar in section.
the final case cited by brown does not speak directly to the regularly and consistently applied issue because we can find no indication that the state court was even presented with the unanimity claim in an.it is,however,indirectly supportive of brown contention that he should obtain a decision on the merits.in,a federal magistrate judge refused to accept north carolina claim that david lawson,who was convicted in,should be procedurally barred from raising his unanimity claim under section a,noting that it would not be appropriate to presume that such a claim would be procedurally barred by a state mar court in view of the discretion available to the state judges to address the merits of such claims under the version of section b.however,the magistrate judge concluded that lawson lost on the merits of his unanimity because mckoy had no retroactive application,and the district judge adopted the magistrate judge recommendations and entered judgment dismissing lawson petition on january.two months later,of course,we reached the contrary conclusion on retroactivity.see williams,at.in lawson appeal to this court,and without discussion of the default or retroactivity issues,we addressed the merits of lawson claim and found no mckoy violation.see lawson dixon,cir.
in contrast to these cases,in which similar defendants received review of the merits of their unanimity claims,the state has directed us to the cases of four capital defendants whose unanimity claims were found to be procedurally barred under section a by a state mar court.
we begin with the case of larry darnell williams,convicted of capital murder in.although we have not been provided with the state court order,williams appears to have first raised his unanimity claim before a state mar court.see williams,at.the state court denied the claim on november,as being procedurally barred,but it is not clear whether williams even contested the bar at the state court level.on federal habeas,williams acknowledge d this claim was procedurally defaulted under subsection a because,as the state court held,the claim could have been raised on direct appeal.id.however,williams did contend that he could show cause and prejudice to excuse the procedural default,starting with the claim that his counsel was ineffective for failing to pursue the unanimity claim on direct appeal.concluding that the instruction given by the trial court did not run afoul of the principles in mckoy,we held that williams had failed to establish cause to excuse the procedural default and denied habeas relief.id.at.thus,unlike brown,williams did not contend on federal habeas that subsection a was an inadequate state law ground to preclude federal habeas review of the merits of his claim.the issue was not presented to us and the amended version of section b,in effect by the time of our review,made denial of a ground for relief under subsection a mandatory by the state court unless the defendant could show cause and prejudice or a miscarriage of justice.
the state next relies upon the case of kermit smith,who was convicted of capital murder in.it too has a lengthy history.see smith dixon,cir en banc.however,it suffices for our purposes to observe that,following our split over the issue of whether the state court had in fact procedurally barred smith unanimity claim,the state mar court held on january,that the claim,then raised in a third mar,was procedurally barred under subsections a and a due to smith failure to raise the issue on direct appeal and,alternatively,because smith unanimity claim had been addressed and rejected on the merits by the federal court.in our prior opinion,a majority of the court had also rejected the unanimity claim on the merits,concluding that smith sentencing hearing was not tainted with mckoy error.id.at see id.at hall,concurring.
the third case relied upon by the state is that of david earl huffstetler,convicted of capital murder in.in that case,by order dated october,the state mar court clearly ruled that huffstetler unanimity claim,raised in a second and third mar,was procedurally barred under subsections a and a.however,the court went on to specifically note that it need not address whether,in the interest of justice and for good cause shown it should exercise its discretion to grant the motion if it is otherwise meritorious,see.b,noting that w hile the rule in mckoy north carolina is a change in the law,it is not to be given retroactive application.because this order predated the contrary holdings on retroactivity expressed by the north carolina supreme court in zuniga,and by our court in williams,it is of limited utility in resolving this case.
finally,the state relies upon the case of phillip robbins,also convicted of capital murder in.on february,the state mar court ruled,without elaboration,that robbins unanimity claim was barred pursuant to subsection a.there is no discussion of the discretion afforded under subsection b,although the state mar court order in robbins also predates zuniga and williams.for that matter,it our decision in mcdougall indicating that we would not apply mckoy retroactively 
to summarize,brown has pointed us to five defendants convicted in north carolina of capital murder who obtained judicial review of the merits of their constitutional unanimity claim,first raised in a motion for appropriate relief,by the state mar court.two were ultimately successful in obtaining relief on the merits,and three were not,but all obtained review of the merits.a sixth capital defendant obtained review of the merits on federal habeas,even though it had not been raised on direct appeal to the state court.
the state has pointed us to four cases in which the capital defendants unanimity claims were found to be procedurally barred under subsection a.two of those defendants,however,received a judicial determination that there was no constitutional error in the challenged instruction,albeit within the procedural bar context,and the remaining two cases involved unanimity claims that were procedurally barred during the time that state mar courts were afforded discretion to review the merits of procedurally defaulted claims that might otherwise be meritorious,but prior to north carolina determination that mckoy would not be applied retroactively to cases on state collateral review.
as we have previously discussed,brown ability to obtain federal habeas review of the merits of his unanimity claim rests upon our resolution of the question of whether the particular procedural bar has been applied consistently to cases that are procedurally,cases in which the particular claim raised could have been raised previously but was not.mccarver,at second emphasis added.having reviewed the evidence presented by the parties on this more precise issue,we are satisfied that the state mar courts have not regularly and consistently applied section a to unanimity claims made by defendants in procedural postures similar to brown.brown has made a colorable showing that,although subsections a and a have been generally held to be adequate and independent state procedural grounds to bar federal habeas review of a claim,the state mar courts have not consistently applied the bar to unanimity claims raised by defendants in the wake of mills and mckoy.we suspect that this may well have been due to the fact that state mar courts,prior to,had discretion in their ability to reach the merits of otherwise procedurally defaulted claims but,in the end,it matters little why the bar has not been regularly and consistently applied by state mar courts to unanimity claims.because it has not been,the state mar court decision barring review of brown claim on the merits was not based on an adequate and independent state law ground.and,because we hold that there is no procedural bar to federal habeas review of the merits of brown unanimity claim,we must remand the case to the district court for the purpose of conducting such review in the first instance.
brown has also sought permission to appeal the district court dismissal of his claim that his attorneys were constitutionally ineffective under the sixth and fourteenth amendments for failing to ad
