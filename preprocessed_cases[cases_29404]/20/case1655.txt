mark hansen,district director of the immigration and naturalization service ins,appeals the grant of habeas corpus to hoang minh ly,a deportable criminal alien.ly,a citizen of vietnam,challenged the constitutionality of c of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,which requires the attorney general to detain immigrants who have committed certain crimes,pending removal proceedings.c west.ly alleges that the section violates substantive and procedural due process under the fifth amendment because it does not allow criminal aliens individual bond hearings to determine their suitability for release pending removal proceedings.because the supreme court,in zadvydas davis,d,determined that iirira should be interpreted to avoid the constitutional questions raised by indefinite detention of aliens awaiting removal from the united states,we affirm the result below for reasons different than those relied on by the district court.brown tidwell,cir.
hoang minh ly entered the united states as a refugee in.in,ly was convicted of credit card fraud,and sentenced to four months in prison,with two years of supervised release.in,ly was involved in a scheme,wherein he deposited counterfeit cashier checks into a bank account,knowing that someone else would withdraw the money and split the proceeds.he was convicted of bank fraud.ly has fully served his criminal sentences on both convictions.
the ins issued ly a notice to appear on may.the ins took ly into custody,under the mandatory detention provisions of iirira c,on may.overall,ly was kept in detention for days,before his release at the order of the district court.the ins asserted that ly was subject to from the united states because he was an alien convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude,and he was an alien convicted of an aggravated felony.on august,ly filed a habeas corpus petition in federal district court,challenging his detention.the ins supplemented the charges against ly on august,with another charge that ly was an alien convicted of an aggravated felony.at an august,hearing,ly requested a continuance to permit his counsel additional time to review the supplemental charges.the hearing was rescheduled for september.at the september,hearing,the immigration judge found that ly was removable.ly then filed applications for relief from deportation on various grounds,including asylum,admission,withholding of removal,deferral of removal,and permanent resident status.on january,the ins issued a notice of decision denying ly application for permanent resident status.the immigration judge set a merits hearing for ly other applications for relief for march,but the hearing was continued to april.in september,the magistrate judge recommended that habeas relief be granted.the district court adopted this recommendation,granting habeas relief unless a bond hearing was held.the ins timely appealed the district court decision.one month later,on october,the immigration judge entered a written decision,ordering ly removal to vietnam and denying his remaining applications for relief.on april,the board of immigration appeals issued a final decision,and affirmed the immigration judge order.based on the final administrative removal order,the government filed a motion with us to remand the case to district court.
the ins,in accordance with the district court order,conducted a bond hearing.at that hearing,on november,the immigration judge determined that he did not have the statutory authority to release ly from detention.nevertheless,on november,the ins released ly on his own recognizance and subject to specified conditions.
substantive due process and.standard of review and jurisdiction 
we review the grant of habeas corpus,and the constitutional questions inherent in such a grant,de novo.staley jones,cir.we have jurisdiction to consider both substantive and procedural due process challenges to c,despite the jurisdictional limitations set out in iirira.iirira states n o court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by the attorney general to commence proceedings,adjudicate cases,or execute removal orders against any alien g west.in pak reno,cir,we held that this jurisdictional limitation did not extend to the habeas power of federal courts,in order to avoid the constitutional issue of whether or not such a limitation would violate the suspension clause of the constitution,which states that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended,unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.const.art.i cl.the supreme court has also upheld the jurisdiction of courts to consider habeas claims arising out of immigration detention.see zadvydas davis,d courts have jurisdiction to hear habeas claims arising out of iirira detention provisions.
the parties here ask whether ly may be indefinitely incarcerated,under iirira mandatory detention statute,c,pending his removal to vietnam,given that such removal is not currently foreseeable due to the lack of a repatriation treaty between the united states and vietnam.section of iirira requires the attorney general to detain,among others,aliens convicted of either an aggravated felony or two crimes involving moral turpitude such as fraud,pending removal proceedings.c.the ins asserts that because aliens detained under are prima facie deportable,they have no liberty interest and may be detained indefinitely,without a bond hearing,until an order of removal is entered.ly contends that the constitution requires an immediate bond hearing for all criminal aliens awaiting removal.
while the appeal in the case was pending,the supreme court held in zadvydas davis,d,that indefinite detention of a removable criminal alien after a removal proceeding would violate a due process right to liberty under the fifth amendment.id.at.zadvydas therefore construed iirira as not requiring indefinite incarceration,by imposing a reasonable time limit six months,supervised by the federal courts in habeas proceedings,on the amount of time that a deportable criminal alien may be detained after a determination as to removability has been made,unless the government asserts a strong special justification for the detention.id.at.
zadvydas addressed the prospect of indefinite incarceration of deportable aliens created by the iirira detention statute.the question remaining before us is whether the holding of zadvydas extends to the mandatory detention statute.most aliens may be released on bond or paroled until their removal hearing.a west.however,because certain types of criminal aliens pose extraordinarily high flight risks,congress has ordered that aliens who have been convicted of an aggravated felony or two crimes involving moral turpitude including fraud must be detained pending removal proceedings,based on a prima facie determination of removability by the government.c.if an order of removal is not entered or not entered promptly,the result is mandatory indefinite detention for criminal aliens,which is prohibited by zadvydas.
circuit decisions 
the question of indefinite detention under is one of first impression in this circuit.our sister circuits have split on the issue.the ninth and tenth circuits have adopted a approach,holding that is unconstitutional as applied to lawful permanent residents,no matter the length of actual detention.hoang comfort,cir,rev,d kim ziglar,cir,rev,d.the third circuit has held that mandatory detention is unconstitutional if the detained alien seeks to avoid removal via administrative remedies.patel zemski,cir.the fourth circuit adopted a approach,requiring an individualized determination of dangerousness,welch ashcroft,cir,and the seventh circuit has held that indefinite detention under is entirely constitutional.parra perryman,cir.
we adopt none of these approaches.our logic is simple.zadvydas prohibits only one thing permanent civil detention without a showing of a strong special justification that consists of more than the government generalized interest in protecting the community from danger.zadvydas,at.zadvydas establishes a specific rule a habeas court must ask whether the detention in question exceeds a period reasonably necessary to secure removal.id.at.since permanent detention of permanent resident aliens under would be unconstitutional,we construe the statute to avoid that result,as did the court in zadvydas.zadvydas also made clear that limited civil detention,without bond,is constitutional as applied to deportable aliens.id.at.therefore,we hold that the ins may detain prima facie removable aliens for a time reasonably required to complete removal proceedings in a timely manner.if the process takes an unreasonably long time,the detainee may seek relief in habeas proceedings.with this standard in mind,we turn to the decisions of the magistrate judge and the district court.
level of scrutiny 
the magistrate judge opinion recommending the grant of habeas relief,as adopted by the district court,found that deportable aliens have a fundamental liberty interest under the fifth amendment,the protection of which requires an individualized bond hearing.instead of characterizing the issue as one of reasonable limitation on the period of incarceration,as did zadvydas,the magistrate judge stated the issue thus presented is whether violates petitioner fifth amendment right to due process by removing discretion on the part of the attorney general to provide individualized bond hearings for those aliens against whom deportation proceedings are ongoing.
the level of scrutiny to be applied in determining whether or not a restriction on a substantive due process right should be upheld varies with the nature of the right.the magistrate judge opinion noted that courts are to apply strict scrutiny the law must be narrowly tailored to a compelling state interest to governmental conduct that interferes with rights implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.united states salerno,d quoting palko.the ins argued there,as here,that immigration decisions should be subject to the more deferential rational basis test,since deportable aliens have no liberty interest in being at large in the united states.
the magistrate judge applied neither the strict scrutiny or rational basis tests in pure form rather,he likened the detention of criminal aliens to the detention of criminals,and adopted the excessive to its purpose test of salerno for regulatory legislation not designed for punishment.in weighing the competing interests,courts consider the length of detention to which the petitioner has already been subjected,the likelihood of deportation,the potential length of the detention into the future,the likelihood that release will frustrate the petitioner actual deportation,and the danger to the community posed by the petitioner if released.hermanowski farquharson,d.on balancing these factors,the magistrate judge determined that ly extended incarceration was not justified in light of the minimal danger he posed to the public.
zadvydas used a different analytical approach.although the opinion quoted salerno with approval,zadvydas noted that removal proceedings were civil,not criminal,and held that if the government wished to indefinitely detain a removable alien,it must show a strong special justification for such detention.zadvydas,at.a general goal of preventing danger to the community is insufficient to support indefinite civil detention w e have upheld preventive detention based on dangerousness only when limited to specially dangerous individuals and subject to strong procedural protections.id.at.in cases in which preventive detention is of potentially indefinite duration,we have also demanded that the dangerousness rationale be accompanied by some other special circumstance,such as mental illness,that helps to create the danger.id.at,citing kansas hendricks,d emphasis in original.furthermore,zadvydas noted that where detention goal is no longer practically attainable,detention no longer bear s a reasonable relation to the purpose for which the individual was committed.zadvydas,at,quoting jackson indiana,d.
the ins argues that because ly is prima facie removable,he has no liberty interest at all,and can not therefore complain that he is not at liberty within the united states.while it is true that a removable alien has no right to be in the country,it does not mean that he has no right to be at liberty.zadvydas established that deportable aliens,even those who had already been ordered removed,possess a substantive fifth amendment liberty interest,and that the interest was violated by indefinite detention.the ins relies on the seventh circuit decision in parra perryman,cir.in that case,the seventh circuit found that violated neither procedural or substantive due process,on the logic the ins asserts here a criminal alien who insists on postponing the inevitable has no constitutional right to remain at large during the ensuing delay,and the united states has a powerful interest in maintaining the detention in order to ensure that removal actually occurs.parra,at.to the extent that parra holds that a criminal alien does not possess a fifth amendment liberty interest impacted by indefinite civil detention,it has been overruled by zadvydas,at.
the ins final argument is that congress exercises plenary control over immigration,and that we should therefore not question the judgment of congress by ourselves placing limits on mandatory detention.one point of difference between this case and zadvydas is that the statute is permissive,whereas the statute,as applied to specified criminal aliens,is mandatory.compare c the attorney general shall take into custody with a an alien ordered removed may be detained beyond the removal period emphasis added.the ins argues that the mandatory nature of detention reveals a clear congressional intent to keep criminal aliens detained for as long as it takes to deport them,even if such detention is effectively perpetual.
there are two reasons to reject this argument.first,although criminal aliens may be incarcerated pending removal,the time of incarceration is limited by constitutional considerations,and must bear a reasonable relation to removal.as the zadvydas court stated detention pending a determination of removability has an obvious termination point.zadvydas,at.the mandatory nature of the detention does not alter the constitutional limitations to which it is subject.congress plenary control must still be exercised within the bounds of the constitution.ins chadha,d.second,while congress did express a desire to have certain criminal aliens incarcerated during removal proceedings,it also made clear that such proceedings were to proceed quickly.d west in the case of an alien who is convicted of an offense which makes the alien deportable,the attorney general shall begin any removal proceeding as expeditiously as possible after the date of the conviction.in short,imposing a reasonable time limitation on the period both saves the statute from constitutional challenge,and is consistent with congress directions as to how the statute should be applied.
we must also assess the constitutional impact of the presence or absence of hearings.in zadvydas,the court found it significant that the detainees were afforded administrative,rather than judicial,proceedings,at which the alien bore the burden of proof.zadvydas,at.such process,the court determined,would be insufficient to permit indefinite detention.similarly,in this case,the magistrate judge noted i t is highly significant that the statutory scheme affords petitioner no opportunity to convince an immigration judge that he is not a danger to the community,but,rather,is irrebutably presumed to be so.in both cases,procedural protections rights to a hearing at which the alien could argue that he did not pose a danger to the community were too limited to justify an indefinite detention.however,zadvydas did not mandate extra procedural protection in order to constitutionalize the imposition of indefinite civil detention rather,it held that indefinite deprivation of liberty would require extensive procedural protection and therefore construed the detention statute to avoid the specter of permanent detention.zadvydas,at.
we do the same by construing the detention statute to include an implicit requirement that removal proceedings be concluded within a reasonable time,we avoid the need to mandate the procedural protections that would be required to detain deportable aliens indefinitely.although we affirm the grant of habeas corpus and the district court finding that incarceration for months pending removal proceedings is unreasonable,we do not require the united states to hold bond hearings for every criminal alien detained under.ly case is not the norm,in that he is not actually removable.in the majority of cases,where an order of removal is promptly entered and removal is effected within the time allotted under zadvydas,bond hearings are not required.as zadvydas made clear,the liberty interest of deportable criminal aliens is adequately served by the reasonableness limitation on the period of incarceration 
intervening decisions 
our consideration of the question of ly liberty interest is complicated by two decisions that have come down since this case was briefed and argued.in demore kim,d the supreme court held that c was not unconstitutional in requiring the detention of deportable aliens pending their deportation.it specifically indicated that such detentions were usually relatively brief,see id.at,but it did not specifically hold that any particular length of time in a specific case would be unreasonable or unconstitutional.the case is distinguishable to the extent that kim was a deportable alien for whom deportation,to south korea,was a real possibility,and he could avail himself of such liberty at any time.that is not the case with ly.
in holland,cir en banc,decided shortly before kim,our circuit held that even an excludable alien presumptively a person with less rights than ly could not be held beyond six months without an individual hearing,by extension of the holding in zadvydas,in the case of an excludable alien who could not be removed to cuba.the cross currents of the two decisions are somewhat complex.if stands for the proposition that any alien facing the process of deportation is entitled to a specific hearing within six months absent special justification,the decision is inconsistent with kim,which specifically authorized such detention in the circumstances there.to the extent that kim would appear to authorize indefinite detention for persons in proceedings,it could compel a conclusion contrary to in this case.however,the court discussion in kim is undergirded by reasoning relying on the fact that kim,and persons like him,will normally have their proceedings completed within in a short period of time and will actually be deported,or will be released.that is not the case here.
because of the differences between ly case and these opinions,we hold that neither of them affirmatively compels a different decision here.
finally,we note that the government has not offered a strong and special justification,exceeding a mere desire to protect the community,that would justify indefinite detention.if,as is not the case here,the government were to attempt to justify indefinite detention by means of a showing of a strong and special justification under zadvydas,then due process would require a hearing on that issue.
reasonable time limitation 
we must next define a reasonable time limitation for detention,and finally determine whether or not the ins acted reasonably in this case.a time limitation,as imposed in zadvydas,would not be appropriate for the period hearing schedules and other proceedings must have leeway for expansion or contraction as the necessities of the case and the immigration judge caseload warrant.in the absence of a set period of time,courts must examine the facts of each case,to determine whether there has been unreasonable delay in concluding removal proceedings.
in this case,the district court determined that incarceration for one and years as part of a civil,nonpunitive proceeding when there was no chance of actual,final removal,was unreasonable.we agree.as of the september,opinion and recommendation of the magistrate judge,ly had been imprisoned for a year and a half with no final decision as to removability in the case.that decision as to removability was not made until nearly a month later,after the magistrate judge recommended granting the writ of habeas corpus.ly served criminal sentences for his two convictions of a total of months he spent considerably more time than that in ins custody awaiting a determination on removal.
further,any detention under iirira must be reasonably related to the goal of the statute.zadvydas,at.the goal of incarceration must be to ensure the ability of the government to make a final deportation.the danger is that a criminal alien,upon receiving notice of deportation proceedings,will flee.the actual removability of a criminal alien therefore has bearing on the reasonableness of his detention prior to removal proceedings.zadvydas,at.because ly was not removable,a imprisonment awaiting removal proceedings was especially unreasonable.
the ins incorrectly asserts that it has an interest in ensuring that a final removal order is actually entered against an individual who is prima facie removable because of multiple criminal convictions.the ins does not need the alien to be physically present in order to enter a final removal order.iirira penalizes aliens who fail to appear at a removal proceeding with both an automatic entry of an order of removal in absentia,b,and prevents such aliens from applying for cancellation of removal or adjustment of status,remedies normally available to an alien who has been ordered removed.b west.
as the ins points out,ly is at least partially responsible for the length of the proceedings.ly applied for cancellation of removal and for change of status,and was responsible for at least one rescheduled hearing,due to the late filing of briefs by ly counsel with the immigration judge.we are not unsympathetic to this argument however,we conclude that the ins must still act promptly in advancing its interests.in this case,the magistrate judge found that the time taken without a decision was exceptional indeed,the immigration judge only rendered a decision after the magistrate judge acted,and an additional month had passed,even though the hearing before the immigration judge had been months earlier.
under the rule we adopt today,courts must be sensitive to the possibility that dilatory tactics by the removable alien may serve not only to put off the final day of deportation,but also to compel a determination that the alien must be released because of the length of his incarceration.without consideration of the role of the alien in the delay,we would encourage deportable criminal aliens to raise frivolous objections and string out the proceedings in the hopes that a federal court will find the delay unreasonable and order their release.
however,appeals and petitions for relief are to be expected as a natural part of the process.an alien who would not normally be subject to indefinite detention can not be so detained merely because he seeks to explore avenues of relief that the law makes available to him.further,although an alien may be responsible for seeking relief,he is not responsible for the amount of time that such determinations may take.the mere fact that an alien has sought relief from deportation does not authorize the ins to drag its heels indefinitely in making a decision.the entire process,not merely the original deportation hearing,is subject to the constitutional requirement of reasonability.
finally,there is a question of institutional competence.by not requiring individualized bond hearings,federal courts undertake to supervise the reasonability of detention only via the habeas process.this is the approach recommended by zadvydas of course,there the court was able to establish a rule that is easily administrable by courts.certainly the ins is best situated to know which criminal aliens should be released,and federal courts are obviously less well situated to know how much time is required to bring a removal proceeding to conclusion.however,three factors tip the balance in favor of court supervision.first,zadvydas requires it.second,those aliens not granted bond hearings would still file habeas petitions since habeas review of detention is not foreclosed by iirira,federal courts will still be asked to review detention.third,although an easily administrable rule can not be based on time,given the inevitable elasticity of the period,courts are familiar with and regularly assess reasonableness as a legal standard.our rule requires the ins to act reasonably when actual removal is not reasonably foreseeable,criminal aliens may not be detained beyond a reasonable period required to conclude removability proceedings without a government showing of a strong special justification,constituting more than a threat to the community,that overbalances the alien liberty interest.zadvydas,at.although it lacks a bright line,this rule is administrable by courts hearing habeas petitions arising from mandatory detention under.
procedural due process 
ly also asserts that he has received insufficient process to protect his fifth amendment liberty interest.were we to construe the statute as permitting indefinite detention,additional process would be required.zadvydas,at.if the ins were to assert a strong special justification,consisting of more than convenience in removal or general community protection,to support indefinite detention,then a hearing would be required.id.at.however,the ins makes no such showing here.because we construe the statute to include a reasonable time limitation in bringing a removal proceeding to conclusion,additional process to protect that liberty interest is not required.
we hold that the ins may detain prima facie removable criminal aliens,without bond,for a reasonable period of time required to initiate and conclude removal proceedings promptly.when actual removal is not reasonably foreseeable,deportable aliens may not be indefinitely detained without a government showing of a strong special justification,constituting more than a threat to the community,that overbalances the alien liberty interest.the reasonableness of the length of detention is subject to review by federal courts in habeas proceedings,as stated by zadvydas.because there is no strong special justification in this case,because the period of time required to conclude the proceedings was unreasonable,and because actual removal was not foreseeable,we affirm the grant of the writ of habeas corpus.
i concur in the majority holding that ly incarceration for almost a year and a half was unreasonable and justifies issuance of the writ of habeas corpus.yet,for several reasons,i respectfully dissent from the majority reasonableness standard,due to its lack of any numerical time limitations for the detention of those lawful permanent resident aliens who object to their removal under c.in sum,supreme court and sixth circuit precedents have set time limits on the detention of aliens who have been ordered to be deported or aliens who have been declared excludable.time constraints,consistent with the supreme court and this circuit decisions,should be set for the detention of lawful permanent resident aliens who are object to their removal proceedings.the majority substantial reliance upon zadvydas davis,d is misplaced because demore kim,d is the controlling decision for the detention of lawful permanent resident aliens,such as ly.
ly was born on april,in saigon,vietnam.his family members include soldiers in the south vietnamese army who fought with united states military forces during the vietnam war.refusing to serve in the communist army in cambodia and avoiding persecution,ly fled to thailand where he remained in a refugee camp for approximately two years.the united states attorney general granted ly refugee status when he entered the united states.ly became a permanent united states resident on december,and has since lived in the united states with other family members who are also permanent residents.
on may,the immigration and naturalization services ins initiated removal proceedings against ly based upon a conviction for use of a counterfeit credit card to purchase in excess of of goods and services.ly pled guilty and the district court sentenced him to four months incarceration and two years supervised release.the district court also approved the prosecution recommendation to reduce ly sentence for his minor role in the criminal transaction,his cooperation,and his immediate confession.ly successfully completed his supervised release on april.
in,ly had another conviction for bank fraud because he passed a fraudulent bank check in a scheme.in the pretrial proceeding of his second conviction,the district court determined that ly was neither a serious flight risk nor a threat to the community and released ly on a personal bond.for this conviction,ly was sentenced to eight months and ordered to make restitution to the victim.ly fully completed that criminal sentence.
these two convictions provide the basis for his removal for crimes of moral turpitude under a a ii of iirira.ly asserts that he would have been eligible for cancellation of removal under the former c waiver because prior to,ly conviction was not considered an aggravated felony under the immigration and naturalization act ina.at the time of his plea,an aggravated felony was defined under a m of the ina,as a crime causing a loss to the victim for a crime of fraud or deceit.in,three years after ly plea,congress retroactively expanded the definition of aggravated felony under a m of the ina by requiring only a loss to the victim,thereby retroactively classifying ly as an aggravated felon and thus,rendering him ineligible for cancellation of his removal.the immigration court found ly removable as an aggravated felon under section a u of the ina.
vietnam,ly native country,does not have an repatriation treaty with the united states and ly has not been removed.as a result of his removal proceeding,ly had been detained for over days prior to the district court order granting the writ.with the lack of a repatriation treaty with vietnam,ly removal is unlikely for the reasonably foreseeable future.
in kim,the supreme court held that mandatory detention of lawful permanent aliens residents who are subject to removal under c the illegal immigration and immigrant responsibility act of iirira is constitutionally permissible for the brief period of time necessary for their removal proceedings.the supreme court core conclusions were.first,the court held that congress,justifiably concerned that deportable criminal aliens who are not detained continue to engage in crime and fail to appear for their removal hearings in large numbers,may require that persons such as kim be detained for the brief period necessary for their removal proceedings.at.emphasis added.with this limitation,d etention during removal proceedings is a constitutionally permissible part of that process.id at.thus,a criminal alien who has conceded that he is deportable,for the limited period of his removal proceedings,is governed by these cases.id.at.citations omitted.in other parts of its opinion,the majority in kim emphasized that the detention was under section c for a limited period id.at and very limited time of detention,id at.
kim holding clearly was premised,in significant part,upon its finding that the initial detention under section c was for a brief period necessary for their removal proceeding id.at.the majority in kim specifically cited the average length of time of a section c detention prior to a disposition of the removal issue 
in the majority of cases it lasts for less than the days we considered presumptively valid in zadvydas.the executive office for immigration review has calculated that,in of the cases in which aliens are detained pursuant to section c,removal proceedings are completed in an average time of days and median of days.brief for petitioners.in the remaining of cases,in which that alien appeals the decision of the immigration judge to average of four months,with a median time that is slightly shorter,at.
kim,at emphasis added.
to be sure,kim addressed only the constitutionality of sectio
