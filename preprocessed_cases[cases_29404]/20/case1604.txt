larry pat souter souter appeals the district court dismissal of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.souter,currently incarcerated in a michigan correctional facility,was convicted in of the murder of kristy ringler.in,souter filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to,challenging his conviction.the district court granted the state of michigan motion for summary judgment,finding that the petition was barred by the statute of limitations set forth in d.we granted souter a certificate of appealability on two issues whether his petition was timely filed within one year of his discovery of new evidence and whether he is entitled to equitable tolling because he is actually innocent of the crime for which he was convicted.because we find that souter has demonstrated a credible claim of actual innocence,he is entitled to equitable tolling,and the district court dismissal of his habeas petition is hereby reversed.
background 
on august,around,kristy ringler ringler was found unconscious,lying on highway in newaygo county,michigan.she was lying with her arms by her side,across the roadway,perpendicular to vehicular traffic,with a small pool of blood beneath her head.she died later that morning.steven bauserman,a neuropathologist,performed an autopsy on ringler and discovered a severe laceration on her forehead and a similar one on the right side of her head.he concluded that the lacerations were caused by two separate blows with a instrument,which caused injury to the brain resulting in death.bauserman theorized that ringler death could have been either a homicide or the result of being hit by a car.
souter was the last known person to see ringler prior to her being discovered unconscious in the road.ringler and souter met and became friendly at a bar that evening.when the bar closed around,the two left with several others to continue the party at the home of anna mae carpenter,which is located off of.most of the people at the party were drinking heavily,including souter,who was drinking canadian club whiskey out of a bottle the bottle that he had bought earlier in the evening.souter told police that while everyone else was inside,he and ringler went out into the front yard of the house where they became amorous.according to souter,at some point ringler stood up abruptly,stated she was going home and began walking northbound along souter testified at trial that he followed her for approximately feet trying to persuade her to come back to get a ride home,but then ultimately gave up and returned to the party.joint appendix at trial tr.upon his return to the carpenter house,he ran into three people leaving the party.one of the three,marvin carpenter,testified at trial that souter did not appear to be sweating,breathing hard,or acting abnormally.at trial tr.moreover,there was no blood visible on souter clothing.at trial tr.
at trial,two drivers testified that they traveled down around and did not see either ringler walking down the road or her body in the roadway.at,trial tr.five minutes later,at approximately,two truckers driving southbound on saw a car in the opposite lane blinking its lights and a woman waving her arms to draw attention to the body lying in the road.one of the truckers testified at trial that he was struck by how clean ringler clothes were and noted that her shirt was still tucked into her jeans.at trial tr.once word reached the party that ringler had been hit,souter and the rest of the partygoers made their way to the location of the body,approximately feet from the carpenter house.on his walk there,souter discarded the bottle on the side of the road.at the scene,deputy sheriff john sutton sutton interviewed souter and after he finished his initial investigation of the incident,drove souter back to his friend house.sutton testified at trial that souter was significantly intoxicated and there was no blood on him.at trial tr.
the following day,the police recovered the bottle from a ditch along near the carpenter house.souter acknowledged that the bottle belonged to him,denied any wrongdoing in ringler death,and turned over the boots he was wearing that night to the police.the laboratory analysis of the bottle revealed a trace of blood on the label,which turned out to be type same type as ringler,souter,and of the american population.the presence of blood on the label could be explained by the fact that souter had cut his finger earlier that night on a jagged door handle at the carpenter house otherwise,there was no blood or hair on the bottle or on souter boots.the only other physical evidence recovered in the investigation was particles of glass found on ringler jeans and in the gauze bandages around her wounds.the state police crime laboratory analyzed the particles and found that they were inconsistent with automobile headlight glass.furthermore,the particles were not brown in color like the bottle.lawrence simpson,a forensic pathologist consulted by the police on the matter,stated his belief that ringler injuries were consistent with being struck by a car rather than a homicide.based on the evidence the police collected at the time,the newaygo county prosecutor declined to press charges against souter or anyone else.
despite simpson contrary opinion,detective charles foster foster,the chief investigating officer,concluded that ringler could not have been hit by a car because i her body appeared to be placed on the roadway ii there was very little blood at the scene and iii there was an absence of blood,debris,or other foreign material found on her clothes.four years later,in,foster presented the case to ronald graeser,the newaygo county medical examiner,and suggested that the bottle might be the murder weapon.reviewing the autopsy slides,graeser agreed with bauserman analysis that the lacerations were caused by a instrument which cut the skin but did not fracture the skull.graeser projected the autopsy slides to scale onto a wall and compared the wounds with the bottle.graeser concluded that the bottle matched the shape of the wounds and issued a report which stated that the injuries may well have been inflicted by the canadian club pint whiskey bottle.at.the report also indicated that stephen cohle,a forensic pathologist,agreed with this opinion.the county prosecutor reviewed graeser report and the other evidence in the case but declined to bring charges against souter in.
no further investigation was done on the ringler case until,when a sheriff,who committed his office to reviewing unsolved homicides,revived the effort to solve the case.though sheriff deputies many of the original witnesses,no new evidence was discovered.the old evidence was once again presented to graeser,who this time wrote a stronger report which concluded that ringler injuries were caused by the bottle and that it was virtually impossible that a side mirror on a car could have caused the injuries.at.cir.remand op.an arrest warrant was issued for souter in november,twelve years after ringler death.other than graeser new report,the evidence presented at trial was the same as that which was collected in.graeser testified on behalf of the prosecution,along with bauserman,who performed the autopsy,and cohle,who testified as an expert witness.critical to the prosecution argument was the testimony of graeser that the bottle had a very sharp edge in,which i f you would take your hand and rub it across it hard,you probably cut yourself.that can cause the cutting that i see in the photographs.at,trial tr.graeser testified that the bottle as it existed at trial in,had lost the sharpness of its edge,which it had back in and even in november at the time of the preliminary examination.at trial tr.bauserman and cohle,who supervised graeser medical training,opined that ringler injuries were consistent with being struck by the bottle.at,trial tr.simpson,the original forensic pathologist consulted by the police,testified for the defense,and stated his opinion that the bottle could not have been the murder weapon because it lacked a sharp edge and reiterated his belief that ringler was struck by a passing vehicle.at,trial tr.
after reviewing the evidence,the jury convicted souter of murder on march.the trial judge sentenced him to a term of to years imprisonment.the michigan court of appeals affirmed the jury verdict,rejecting souter claim that the year delay between ringler death and his arrest denied him due process of law.on march,in lieu of granting leave to appeal,the michigan supreme court remanded the case to the trial court to conduct an evidentiary hearing to address souter claim that he was prejudiced by the delay.on september,the trial court issued its opinion,finding that though souter was prosecuted with essentially the same evidence that was available in,the delay was not deliberate and it did not prejudice his case.at.cir.remand op.the michigan supreme court denied leave to appeal on december.
three years later,on november,souter filed a motion for a new trial in the newaygo county circuit court pursuant to,based on a claim of newly discovered evidence.applying.d,the court denied the motion,finding that the new evidence could have been presented at trial and did not demonstrate a reasonably likely chance of acquittal.on july,the michigan court of appeals denied souter application for leave to appeal because of his failure to meet the burden of establishing entitlement to relief under mcr.at.the michigan supreme court reached the same conclusion on january.
one year later,on january,souter filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the western district of michigan,claiming violation of his right to due process and ineffective assistance of counsel.in support of his petition,souter provided what he claimed was new evidence collected over the years,including 
an affidavit from stephen pletcher,a private investigator,who interviewed the bottle manufacturer and a forensic technician,both of whom stated there was no sharp edge on the bottle in as graeser contended.
an affidavit from cohle,recanting his trial testimony and concluding that it is unlikely that the wounds on kristy ringler could have been inflicted by the bottle at cohle aff.
an affidavit from bauserman,retreating from his trial testimony and claiming that my testimony as to the object causing the external wound s would be speculative.at bauserman aff.bauserman defers to cohle as to what object caused the wounds and discredits graeser forensic expertise.
an affidavit from edward gundy,the former police laboratory technician,stating that the bottle did not have a sharp edge in and that the blood found on the bottle label is of little evidentiary value because of americans have the same blood type as souter and ringler.
photographs,which souter claims were not available at trial,which show that ringler clothes were soaked in blood.
the state of michigan moved for summary judgment on the ground that souter petition was barred by the limitations period applicable to habeas actions.the district court referred the case to a magistrate judge,who found that souter had failed to file his habeas petition timely.the magistrate judge recommended that the district court deny the state motion,however,because souter demonstrated credible new evidence of actual innocence which is sufficient for the limited purpose of equitably tolling the statute of limitations and permitting the court to reach the merits of the claim.at magis.judge report rec.the magistrate judge found that souter new evidence chip s away at the rather slim circumstantial evidence upon which petitioner was convicted.at magis.judge report rec.the state timely filed objections to the magistrate judge recommendation.
the district court did not reach the issue of whether an actual innocence exception to the statute of limitations exists,but instead found that souter had failed to demonstrate his actual innocence.the court noted that while the new evidence was undoubtedly favorable to souter,it fails to establish factual innocence because none of his evidence conclusively establishes that the bottle could not have inflicted the wounds on the victim.at.moreover,the court found that the evidence itself was not new but merely a restatement of souter trial defense based upon the changed opinions of some of the prosecution expert witnesses.at.therefore,the district court rejected the magistrate judge recommendation of equitable tolling and granted the state motion for summary judgment on the ground that souter petition was untimely.this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
this court applies de novo review to the decision of the district court in a habeas corpus proceeding.harris stovall,cir,cert.denied,d allen yukins,cir,cert.denied,d.furthermore,t he dismissal of a habeas petition by the district court as barred by statute of limitations is reviewed de novo.cook stegall,cir,cert.denied,d.we review for clear error a district court factual findings.lucas,cir.
in this appeal,we address the same two issues as were addressed by the district court below whether souter petition for writ of habeas corpus was filed timely and if the petition was untimely,whether the doctrine of equitable tolling should apply.upon review,we conclude that souter petition was untimely,but that he has demonstrated a credible claim of actual innocence,which is sufficient for equitably tolling the statute of limitations and enabling a court to reach the merits of his underlying constitutional claims.
statute of limitations 
souter first argument is that his petition for a writ of habeas corpus,which was filed on january,was timely filed.
before reaching the merits of the timeliness argument,we must first address whether souter may even raise the issue on appeal.though the overall recommendation favored souter,the magistrate judge found that the petition was not filed within the limitations period.souter did not file any objections to the magistrate judge report and recommendation,and accordingly,the district court did not address the timeliness issue below.in its brief,the state claims that by failing to object to the portion of the magistrate judge report which found that his petition was not timely filed,souter waived this argument.resp.br.at.we have long held that with regards to a magistrate judge recommendation,a party shall file objections with the district court or else waive right to appeal.united states walters,cir.by operation of this supervisory rule,only those specific objections to the magistrate report made to the district court will be preserved for appellate review.smith detroit fed of teachers,local,cir.the united states supreme court affirmed the walters rule,holding that it is a valid exercise of the supervisory power of the court of appeals.thomas arn,d.while we have regularly enforced the walters rule,we have also noted that i t plainly is not a jurisdictional rule the court of appeals retains subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal regardless of the untimely filing or nonfiling of objections.kent johnson,cir.in thomas arn,the supreme court emphasize d that,because the walters rule is a nonjurisdictional waiver provision,the court of appeals may excuse the default in the interests of justice.at.
in this case,we conclude that it would be inappropriate to apply the walters rule to bar review of souter timeliness argument.when the magistrate judge issued his report,we had yet to decide abela martin,cir en banc,cert.denied,d,which clarified the limitations period under d and which is potentially dispositive of the issue in this case.the magistrate judge reasoned that the limitations period commenced on the date of the last new affidavit,september,from which point souter had one year to file his habeas petition.the limitations period is tolled while or collateral proceedings are pending.d.because souter filed a motion for a new trial in state court on november,the limitations period was tolled days after the date of the new affidavit the collateral proceedings continued until the michigan supreme court denied leave to appeal on january.the petition for a writ of habeas corpus was filed exactly one year later,on january,days beyond the limitations period.thus,the magistrate judge concluded that souter petition was untimely.
since that decision,we held in abela that proceedings are considered to be still pending during the time for seeking supreme court review of the state final judgment on that application independent of whether the petitioner actually petitions the supreme court to review the case.at.the effect of abela is to toll the limitations period for an additional ninety days beyond the date of the final judgment to account for the certiorari window,regardless of whether a petition for a writ of certiorari is ever filed.therefore,in this case,the limitations period would have been tolled until april,ninety days after the michigan supreme court decision to deny souter leave to appeal.assuming that the limitations period commenced on september,and tolling the period consistent with the abela holding,souter petition for habeas relief would have been filed approximately days from the date of the last days prior to the expiration of the limitations period.because we did not clarify the issue until after souter objection period had passed,he should not be barred from raising this issue on appeal.
furthermore,we have held that a party,who substantially prevails in a magistrate judge recommendation,does not waive the right to appeal secondary issues resolved against him by failing to object to the recommendation.in a similar case,we stated that 
a lthough the magistrate judge proposed that the secondary issue of the admissibility of the writings be resolved in the appellant favor,he nonetheless concluded that the appellee should prevail on its motion for summary judgment.if we were to require a party in the appellee position to present objections to a magistrate judge proposed adverse resolution of a secondary issue,we would force that party to articulate objections to a recommendation that it prevail.such a requirement would only frustrate the judicial economy and litigant expense policies that underlie the walters rule.
turpin kassulke,cir,cert.denied,d.in this case,the magistrate judge found that souter petition was untimely,but recommended that the state motion for summary judgment be denied on the ground of equitable tolling.the interest of judicial economy would be frustrated by requiring that souter file objections to all the adverse portions of the report,even though he prevailed on the overall recommendation.therefore,we deem the walters rule inapplicable and the issue of timeliness not waived in this appeal.
on the merits of the timeliness issue,we conclude,however,that souter has failed to make a persuasive argument that his habeas petition was timely filed.the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa established a limitations period during which a state prisoner can bring a federal habeas corpus petition.d.the statute of limitations begins to run from the latest of four events,one of which is the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.d d.souter claims that several pieces of new evidence,which he has collected over the past several years,form the factual predicate for his habeas corpus claim.the most recent piece of this new evidence is the affidavit of edward gundy,the former police laboratory technician,which is dated september.as was demonstrated above,if the gundy affidavit is considered new evidence forming a factual predicate for his habeas claim,souter petition would have been filed thirty days prior to the expiration of the limitations period.the state argues,however,that the gundy affidavit does not provide any new evidence,but merely reexamines the bottle physical characteristics yet again.resp.br.at.
there are two statements in the gundy affidavit upon which souter relies for his habeas claim.gundy states that based on his observations of the bottle in,it did not have a sharp edge,and therefore,graeser statement to the contrary is not a statement of fact.at gundy aff.furthermore,gundy states that the blood stain on the label of the bottle provides very little evidentiary value because of the american population has the same type of blood.at gundy aff.the state is correct that neither of these two statements can be considered new evidence creating a factual predicate for a habeas petition.first,with regards to the value of the blood evidence,at trial gundy himself testified that both ringler and souter have type a blood and that he could not determine which one,or if someone else with type a blood,left the stain on the label.at trial tr.second,with regards to whether the bottle had a sharp edge in,simpson testified for the defense at trial that the bottle did not currently have a sharp edge and that there were no signs that the edge had been worn down over time.at trial tr.thus,both of the statements in the gundy affidavit are not new evidence,but rather merely cumulative to the evidence already presented by the defense at trial.therefore,the gundy affidavit can not form the newly discovered factual predicate,which commences the statute of limitations period.
the next most recent piece of new evidence which souter claims provides the factual predicate of his habeas petition is the affidavit of bauserman,the medical examiner,which is dated july.at trial,bauserman testified that the two wounds on ringler head were consistent with being struck by the bottle.at,trial tr.specifically,bauserman stated t he question was proposed to me could these and do these photographs incriminate this bottle,and my conclusion is that they are strong evidence in support of that bottle causing those to the exclusion of all other possible bottles.at trial tr.in his affidavit,bauserman no longer stands by his trial testimony about the bottle,stating that my opinion as to damage to the brain and cause of death would be informed my testimony as to the object causing the external wound s would be speculative.at bauserman aff.moreover,bauserman states that cohle education,training and experience make him highly qualified as a forensic pathologist,especially as to the causation of skin wounds,and i would defer to his conclusions on such issues in this case,since this is more his specialty than mine.at bauserman aff.we need not reach a conclusion about whether or not the bauserman affidavit should be considered new evidence,because assuming arguendo that it is,souter has failed to file his petition within of its discovery.
the bauserman affidavit was signed on july,which would have commenced the limitations period.one hundred and eleven days elapsed before souter filed his motion for a new trial in state court on november,which tolled the limitations period.the state court proceedings were pending until the certiorari window closed on april.two hundred days passed from that date until souter filed his petition for habeas corpus in district court on january.thus,a total of three hundred days elapsed from the receipt of the bauserman affidavit to the filing of the habeas petition.therefore,even if we were to conclude that the bauserman affidavit was new evidence providing a factual predicate for souter habeas claim,he failed to file his petition within the limitations period set forth in d d.the district court was correct to hold that souter petition for habeas relief was untimely.
equitable tolling for actual innocence 
souter next argument is that,even if his petition for a writ of habeas corpus was untimely,he should be entitled to equitable tolling because the newly discovered evidence establishes a credible claim of actual innocence.
we have held that b ecause aedpa statute of limitations is not jurisdictional,a petitioner who misses the deadline may still maintain a viable habeas action if the court decides that equitable tolling is appropriate.allen,at dunlap united states,cir,cert.denied,d.we have cautioned,however,that equitable tolling relief should only be granted sparingly.cook,at dunlap,at.in determining whether equitable tolling should apply,a court must consider the following five factors 
the petitioner lack of notice of the filing requirement the petitioner lack of constructive knowledge of the filing requirement diligence in pursuing one rights absence of prejudice to the respondent and the petitioner reasonableness in remaining ignorant of the legal requirement for filing his claim.
dunlap,at citing andrews orr,cir.by satisfying the five andrews factors,a petitioner demonstrates good cause for the procedural default.we have stated,however,that t hese factors are not necessarily comprehensive and they are not all relevant in all cases.ultimately,the decision whether to equitably toll a period of limitations must be decided on a basis.miller collins,cir citing cook,at.
in the present case,souter is not arguing for equitable tolling based on any of the andrews factors instead,he argues that because he has made a credible showing of actual innocence,equitable tolling should be applied to allow a court to consider his constitutional claims.pet.br.at.the united states supreme court has held that a claim of actual innocence can be raised to avoid a procedural bar to the consideration of the merits of the petitioner constitutional claims.schlup delo,d.i n an extraordinary case,where a constitutional violation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent,a federal habeas court may grant the writ even in the absence of a showing of cause for the procedural default.murray carrier,d.in schlup,the supreme court held that a credible showing of actual innocence was sufficient to enable a court to reach the merits of an otherwise habeas petition.schlup,at.the actual innocence claim in schlup is not itself a constitutional claim,but instead a gateway through which a habeas petitioner must pass to have his otherwise barred constitutional claim considered on the merits.id.at.citing herrera collins,d.
following schlup,congress codified an actual innocence exception to the procedural bar on successive habeas petitions in aedpa,but did not include an exception with regards to the new limitations provisions.b b ii.neither the supreme court nor this court has specifically addressed the issue of whether an actual innocence exception to the limitations period exists.in workman bell,on a motion for rehearing en banc as to which this court divided equally,judge siler,joined by six other judges,wrote in dicta that if a prisoner purposefully or by inadvertence lets the time run under which he could have filed his petition,he can not file a petition beyond the statutory time,even if he claims actual innocence,cir en banc siler,opinion opposing reh g en banc,cert.denied,d emphasis added.a number of panels of this court have addressed arguments regarding an actual innocence exception,without specifically resolving the issue see,townsend lafler,wl,at cir.may,allen,at whalen randle,wl,at cir,channels mclemore,wl,at cir,cert.denied,d owens stine,wl,at cir,cert.denied,d saylor mack,wl,at cir.in each of these cases,we adopted the reasoning of the second circuit which declined to reach the question of whether the constitution requires an actual innocence exception to d unless the petitioner was able to demonstrate that he was actually innocent of the charges for which he was convicted.whalen,wl at citing lucidore state div.of parole,cir,cert.denied,d.in lucidore,as well as all the cited cases before this court,the habeas petitioner failed to demonstrate actual innocence,and therefore,the court never had to reach the constitutional issue.adhering to this principle of judicial restraint,we too will resolve the issue of whether souter has put forth a credible claim of actual innocence before addressing the existence of the exception itself.
the united states supreme court has held that if a habeas petitioner presents evidence of innocence so strong that a court can not have confidence in the outcome of the trial unless the court is also satisfied that the trial was free of nonharmless constitutional error,the petitioner should be allowed to pass through the gateway and argue the merits of his underlying claims.schlup,at.thus,the threshold inquiry is whether new facts raise sufficient doubt about the petitioner guilt to undermine confidence in the result of the trial.id.at.to establish actual innocence,a petitioner must show that it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have found petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.the court has noted that actual innocence means factual innocence,not mere legal insufficiency.bousley united states,d.to be credible,such a claim requires petitioner to support his allegations of constitutional error with new reliable it be exculpatory scientific evidence,trustworthy eyewitness accounts,or critical physical was not presented at trial.schlup,at.the court counseled however,that the actual innocence exception should remain rare and only be applied in the extraordinary case.id.at.
we conclude that souter conviction is such a rare and extraordinary case.in his habeas petition,souter has presented new evidence collected over the past several years that does raise sufficient doubt about his guilt and that undermines confidence in the result of his trial.the only evidence which directly ties souter to ringler death is the bottle.at trial,the state relied on three pathologists,graeser,bauserman,and cohle,all of whom testified to varying degrees of certainty that the bottle was the cause of ringler wounds.since that time,bauserman,who performed the autopsy and who was the only one who actually viewed ringler body,has retreated from his trial testimony and stated he was only speculating when he testified that there was strong evidence that the bottle caused the injuries.at bauserman aff.cohle,the only one of the three that is a certified forensic pathologist,has recanted his trial testimony,and he now states that,based on his education and experience and examining autopsy slides which he had not seen previously,it is unlikely that the wounds on kristy ringler could have been inflicted by the bottle.at cohle aff.emphasis added.moreover,cohle states that he was strongly influenced in to opine that the bottle caused the injuries,because graeser had claimed that the bottom of the bottle was sufficiently sharp that if one ran one finger over it,it would cut the skin.while he did not observe such an edge on the bottom of the bottle in,he relied on graeser statement that such a sharp edge did exist in.at cohle aff.
the existence of the sharp edge in is critical in linking the bottle to the uniqueness of the wounds souter has interviewed the director and the senior vice president of operations from hiram walker sons,hiram walker,the manufacturer of the bottle,who state that t he structure of the molds used in manufacturing of the bottle precludes the creation of spurs or sharp edges occurring at the bottom,or any other location on the bottle.at steven pletcher aff.emphasis added.moreover,the hiram walker officials state that t here is nothing in the of the glass that would cause,during manufacturing,the creation of a sharp edge or spur on the glass.at pletcher aff.hiram walker has distributed over one hundred million similar bottles,but has never received any complaints,or any information indicating cuts or injury arising from sharp edges or glass spurs extant on the bottom of the canadian club pint bottle container.at pletcher aff.souter also presented evidence from thomas kubic,a forensic scientist,who examined the bottle and autopsy photos and found there is no and never was any sharp edge or protuberance as described in the statements,that could have caused the wounds shown in the photos.at kubic.edward gundy,the police laboratory technician who examined the bottle in,states that graeser testimony of an edge sharp enough to cut a finger is not a statement of fact according to my observations in august and september of.at gundy aff.
finally,souter has submitted three color photos of the victim clothing that he argues were unavailable at trial,and which show large dark,reddish stains on the back,which he claims to be blood.the existence of these photos is relevant for several reasons.first,the clothes which ringler was wearing the night she died were unavailable at trial twelve years later.at trial tr.second,several of the witnesses testified that there was very little blood on her clothes.at,trial tr.third,witnesses who saw souter that evening,including sheriff deputy sutton who drove him back to his friend house,testified that there was no blood visible on him,and the police laboratory found no blood on his boots.at,trial tr,police lab.at trial,the state argued that the absence of blood on souter was consistent with the absence of blood on ringler these photos,however,show that the injuries did in fact cause substantial bleeding,thereby undermining the state argument.the photos depict large stains on the back of the shirt which would be consistent with eyewitness accounts of an absence of blood visible while the victim was lying on her back in the road,but inconsistent with the state theory of the absence of blood on souter.the photographs are even more damaging to the state case given graeser theory that the small amount of blood on the road indicates that the victim was hit elsewhere,then carried and placed at the scene.at trial tr.given the size of the stain visible in the photos,it is implausible that souter would have been able to transport the victim without getting significant blood on himself.
we conclude that this new changed testimony of bauserman and cohle,the statements from the bottle manufacturer,the additional evidence of the forensic scientist and police laboratory technician,the photos of the bloody taken together chip s away at the rather slim circumstantial evidence upon which souter was convicted.at magis.judge report rec.both the state and the district court claim that the evidence presented in the habeas petition can not form the basis of an actual innocence claim.in finding the claim of actual innocence incredible,the district court stated that much of this evidence is not new,but rather merely restates souter trial defense.the state argues that the evidence fails to meet the exacting standard of actual innocence on habeas review.resp.br.at.we disagree and will address each of their arguments in turn.
first,with regards to the affidavit of cohle,the state argues that it can not be used to support an actual innocence claim because his changed opinion is not based on new evidence,but rather a second look at the same bottle he handled.resp.br.at.that argument,however,mischaracterizes the nature of cohle testimony.cohle was testifying at trial as an expert witness,and therefore,it is his opinion itself,rather than the underlying basis for it,which is the evidence presented.see.permitting an expert to testify in the form of an opinion at trial.therefore,if cohle has changed his expert opinion,the evidence itself has changed,and can most certainly be characterized as new.by analogy,if an eyewitness subsequently remembered additional details,those new details would form the basis of new evidence.this new opinion is even more reliable than an eyewitness account,however,because it is not merely based on a renewed look at the bottle,but rather it is a result of his increased education,training,and experience,as well as examination of autopsy slides which he had not seen before.furthermore,the state argument is belied by the fact that the underlying basis for cohle opinion has indeed changed.he states that his trial testimony was strongly influenced by graeser statement that the bottle had a sharp edge in,which was not present at trial in.at cohle aff.with the existence of the sharp edge now called into question,however,cohle concludes that it is unlikely that the bottle caused the victim wounds.
the state dismisses the value of cohle changed testimony,arguing that it is merely cumulative to the trial testimony of simpson.resp.br.at.while it is true that simpson already testified for the defense that the bottle was not the cause of the injuries,cohle affidavit is not merely an additional expert opinion reaching the same conclusion.the retractions of cohle and bauserman not only serve to bolster the defense argument,but also undermine the state side by withdrawing their original trial opinions.put another way,the new affidavits do not merely add to the defense,but also deduct from the prosecution.as a result,the affidavits can be consider new reliable evidence upon which an actual innocence claim may be based 
similar to the state argument,the district court found the changed opinions of cohle and bauserman were insufficient to support a showing of actual innocence because graeser opinion still stands.at.the district court conclusion fails to recognize the relative weight of the three expert witnesses testimony.of the three,bauserman was the only one who actually examined ringler body.at closing,the state argued to the jury the importance of bauserman opinion 
t he doctors sic that had the best opportunity to observe and an opinion as to what had happened in terms of whether or not this bottle caused those injuries was bauserman.he did the autopsy.he was saw the wound.it is not just the pictures of the wound.
at trial tr.the trial court also noted the importance of bauserman opinion,because he had the opportunity to examine the body of the victim,and,as pointed out by the defense,photographs are not a complete substitute for the opportunity to actually observe the injuries.at.cir.order denying new trial.bauserman now states that his opinion that the bottle caused the wounds was speculation,and he defers to cohle as to the true cause.with regard to cohle,he is the only one of the state three medical experts that is a,forensic pathologist.cohle states that his testimony at trial was based on a limited review and that the wound edges could be stretched to confirm such a shape or the bottle could be positioned and laid over the wound in such a position to suggest that it might have fit the wound,but after a more thorough examination of the autopsy photographs,it is clear that the shape of the wound on the forehead does not confine precisely to the edge of a pint whiskey bottle.at cohle aff.
with bauserman and cohle withdrawing their expert opinions that the bottle caused the injuries,the prosecution sole remaining expert witness is graeser,who was trained by bauserman and cohle and is the most inexperienced of the three.at trial,after being asked about graeser qualifications,both bauserman and cohle testified to the deficiencies in his educational progress,and noted that he did not sit for the pathology boards.at cohle aff,bauserman aff.both describing their trial testimony.bauserman states in his affidavit that graeser was not absorbing the body of knowledge necessary to pass his examinations,and r ather than allow him to take the boards and fail,which would have been a black mark against him and against our program at blodgett,he was placed on probation or his residency time was extended.at bauserman aff.given the deficiencies in graeser education and training,the state justifiably relied on the concurring opinions of bauserman and cohle to bolster graeser conclusions.see at trial tr.arguing to the jury the importance of the opinions of bauserman and cohle.with those two supporting opinions withdrawn,however,a reasonable juror would have difficulty adopting graeser theory over the conclusion of simpson and cohle,both of whom are forensic pathologists.
with regards to the absence of a sharp edge on the bottom of the bottle,the district court found that it was a significant,if not the central,issue at trial.at.the district court correctly noted that the bottle was examined by both prosecution and defense witnesses,the absence of a sharp edge was brought to the attention of the jury,and the bottle was in the jury room during deliberations.at.as a result,the district court concluded the shape and condition of the bottle is not new evidence.at.the district court failed to consider,however,that the central issue in this case was not whether the bottle at trial had a sharp edge which the jury could discern from examining it in deliberations,but rather whether one existed twelve years earlier.the prosecution theory rested on graeser assertion that at the time of the incident the bottle had a sharp edge,which if you would run your hand across it quickly,i think you would cut it.at trial tr.simpson,the defense expert witness,disputed that account,finding that the bottle lacked a sharp edge and that nothing indicated that it might have had one twelve years earlier.at trial tr.in convicting souter,the jury obviously credited graeser over simpson.the new affidavits from thomas kubic,a forensic scientist,and edward gundy,the police laboratory technician,shed no new light on the issue,but are merely cumulative to simpson testimony at trial.by contrast,the pletcher affidavit does provide new that the shape of the molds used in manufacturing the bottle precludes the creation of spurs or sharp edges occurring at the bottom,or any other location on the bottle.at pletcher aff.emphasis added.this is not simply another expert witness testifying as to what he can discern existed in from examining the bottle edge,but rather evidence of the manufacturing process of the bottle itself.according to the hiram walker executives,it is factually impossible that the bottle,as it existed in,could have had a sharp edge as graeser contended.furthermore,over one hundred million similar bottles have been distributed worldwide without any complaints of injuries.these new facts provided by the manufacturer severely undermine the prosecution theory that the bottle could have caused the injuries to the victim.while the district court is correct that the edge of the bottle was a central issue at trial,it erred in finding the pletcher affidavit did not provide any new insight on the issue.
finally,the district court also dismissed the significance of the photos of the victim bloody clothes,finding them consistent with the investigating detective theory that ringler was attacked in the roadway.at.the detective theory,however,was not the one put forth to the jury.at trial,the prosecution argued that the absence of blood on the roadway indicated that ringler was attacked elsewhere and carried several hundred yards onto the road.at,trial tr.in its brief,the state concedes that the photos are inconsistent with that theory but argues that they only prove that the detective view was the correct one,not that souter was innocent of the crime resp.br.at.of course accepting the detective view raises the question,which motivated the prosecution to dismiss the theory in the first place,of why there was not more blood in the roadway.moreover,the substantial blood on the victim clothes is probative of more than just the location of the attack.the state has failed to reconcile the substantial blood on the victim clothes with the absence of blood on souter.even accepting sutton view that ringler was attacked in the roadway,a reasonable juror would conclude that the blows caused severe bleeding which should have spattered onto the attacker or at least on the label of the bottle used to inflict them 
in sum,after evaluating the totality of the evidence offered at trial and the new evidence presented in his habeas petition,we conclude that souter has met his burden of establishing a gateway actual innocence claim.this court must make a probabilistic determination about what reasonable,properly instructed jurors would do.schlup,at.if it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,the petitioner may pass through the gateway and argue the merits of his underlying claims.id.at.in this case,there are several circumstantial facts which implicate souter in the murder of ringler it was in a rural area of michigan he was the last person to be seen with the victim they were engaged in amorous activities until she walked off he admitted to following her down the road before turning around and returning to the party the victim body was discovered neatly laid out in the middle of the road and her clothes were not torn or tattered,suggesting she was not hit by a car.the facts exculpating him from the crime are as follows he was severely intoxicated that night there was no blood on his clothes or his boots there was no blood or hair evidence on the bottle except the trace amount on the label and pieces of glass were found in the gauze bandages around her head and on her jeans that do not match the bottle.the circumstantial facts,when taken together,are insufficient to establish souter guilt.the only direct evidence linking souter to ringler death is the bottle.in light of the new recanted testimony of bauserman,the changed opinion of cohle,the shape of the molds used in the manufacturing process,hiram walker history of distributing the bottle without incident,the photos of the bloody find that it surely can not be said that a juror,conscientiously following the judge instructions requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt,would vote to convict.schlup,at.souter has presented new evidence which raises sufficient doubt about his guilt and undermines confidence in the result of his trial.
having determined that souter has put forth a credible claim of actual innocence,we must next resolve the issue of whether an actual innocence exception to aedpa statute of limitations exists the majority of the courts of appeals which have addressed this question have allowed for equitable tolling based on actual innocence under certain circumstances.see gildon bowen,cir adopting the eighth circuit approach in flanders flanders graves,cir,cert.denied,d requiring that equitable tolling based on a claim of actual innocence be accompanied by some action or inaction on the part of the respondent that prevented the petitioner from discovering the relevant facts in a timely fashion,or,at the very least,that a reasonably diligent petitioner could not have discovered these facts in time to file a petition within the period of limitations gibson klinger,cir holding that equitable tolling is appropriate when a prisoner is actually innocent and diligently pursue s his federal habeas claims felder johnson,cir,cert.denied,d finding that a claim of actual innocence does not constitute a rare and exceptional circumstance,but suggesting that a showing of actual innocence might.but see david hall,cir,cert.denied,d holding that prisoners who may be innocent are constrained by the same explicit statutory or deadlines as those against whom the evidence is overwhelming.to answer the question of whether an actual innocence exception to the statute of limitations exists,we begin our analysis with the text of the statute itself.
the supreme court has long held that the power to award the writ of habeas corpus by any of the courts of the united states must be given by written law,and the judgments about the proper scope of the writ are normally for congress to make.felker turpin,d internal citations omitted.the eighth circuit has noted correctly that d says nothing about actual innocence,even though other parts of aedpa,enacted at the same time,do refer to this doctrine.flanders,at compare d with b b ii and e b.the court held that i t is not our place to engraft an additional exception onto congressional language that is clear on its face.id.even the flanders court realized,however,that such a reading of the statute implies too much,and that court allowed for an exception in certain limited circumstances.id.at.while it is true that congress included an actual innocence exception to the procedural bars on successive habeas petitions and evidentiary hearings but not to the limitations period,that does not give rise to the negative implication that the absence of an exception was intended.
by analogy,we note that despite the fact that the statute fails to mention tolling,the majority of the courts of appeals which have addressed the issue,including this one,have held that the doctrine of equitable tolling applies to the limitations period.see,dunlap,at harris hutchinson,cir taliani chrans,cir davis johnson,cir,cert.denied,d miller state dep t of,cir miller marr,cir,cert.denied,d calderon united states dist.court,cir,cert.denied,d.in dunlap,we held that the inclusion of the four detailing the operation of the limitations period did not imply that congress intended to preclude equitable tolling of the limitations period.see also harris,at holding that the inclusion of the four statutory provisions does not give rise to the inference that the application of the limitation period must otherwise be absolute.moreover,though congress included a tolling period in a parallel limitations provision in aedpa governing capital prisoners represented by competent counsel in state proceedings,b b the inclusion of a provision in that section does not imply that the absence of a similar one in d was intentional.calderon,at.the ninth circuit concluded that the inclusion of the tolling provision in b b signaled congress intent to limit tolling to thirty days in that one specific circumstance,but not to upset the normal default rule allowing longer tolling periods for other habeas situations.id.
in interpreting a statute,we presume that congress legislates against the background of existing jurisprudence unless it specifically negates that jurisprudence.young united states,d private truck council.tax comm n,d united states shabani,d.because at the time aedpa was enacted there was a rebuttable presumption that equitable tolling applied to statutes of limitations and no indication that congress intended otherwise,we concluded that the limitations period in aedpa was subject to equitable tolling.dunlap,at.similarly,in enacting aedpa,congress was working against the jurisprudential background of murray carrier and schlup delo,in which the supreme court held that a showing of actual innocence,defined as more likely than not that no reasonable juror would vote to convict,was sufficient to overcome a habeas petition.congress adopted a more stringent actual innocence exception in aedpa and provisions,requiring that the factual predicate of the claim could not have been discovered earlier and a showing by clear and convincing evidence that,but for constitutional error,no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.b b e.the fact that congress adopted a narrower actual innocence exception in these two provisions is indicative,not of congress desire to exclude the exception with regards to the limitations period,but rather of its intent to limit the scope of the exception in those two specific areas.the more reasonable inference to be drawn from the absence of an exception in d is that congress intended not to alter the existing jurisprudential framework which allowed for a showing of actual innocence to overcome a procedural default.
following the passage of aedpa,the courts of appeals,including this one,have continued to apply the schlup actual innocence exception to cases involving other types of procedural default,such as where the default is based on adequate and independent grounds.see,williams bagley,cir hubbard pinchak,cir jaramillo stewart,cir.of course,these procedural limitations existed prior to aedpa,and therefore,congress,which did not address them in the statute,did not alter the application of the schlup actual innocence exception to them.by contrast,aedpa limitations provisions were an entirely new legislative creation,and thus,the determinative issue is whether congress,in creating this new procedural limitation,intended for the existing jurisprudence governing habeas procedural limitations to apply.while the limitations provisions were new federal law,many states had already established statutes of limitations in proceedings.moreover,the supreme court had already held that where a habeas petitioner had defaulted on his federal claims in state court by failing to file timely in proceedings,federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.coleman thompson,d.thus,five years prior to the enactment of a federal statute of limitations,it was already well established that a procedural default resulting from an untimely filing could be excused by a federal habeas court where a constitutional violation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent.carrier,at.absent evidence of congress contrary intent,there is no articulable reason for treating habeas claims barred by the federal statute of limitations differently.similar to our holding in the equitable tolling context,we conclude that against the backdrop of the existing jurisprudence and in the absence of evidence to the contrary,congress enacted this new procedural limitation consistent with the schlup actual innocence exception.therefore,equitable tolling of the limitations period based on a credible showing of actual innocence is appropriate.
furthermore,the inclusion of an actual innocence exception to the limitations provisions is consistent with the underlying principles of aedpa.as the conference report stated,one of the purposes of the act was to curb the abuse of the statutory writ of habeas corpus,and to address the acute problems of unnecessary delay and abuse in capital cases.conf,at,reprinted in.inclusion of an actual innocence exception to the limitations provisions does not foster abuse and delay,but rather recognizes that in extraordinary cases the societal interests of finality,comity,and conservation of scarce judicial resources must yield to the imperative of correcting a fundamentally unjust incarceration.carrier,at.internal citations omitted.as the supreme court has stated,t he miscarriage of justice standard is altogether consistent with aedpa central concern that the merits of concluded criminal proceedings not be revisited in the absence of a strong showing of actual innocence.calderon thompson,d.any concerns that recognition of an actual innocence exception to the limitations period will result in a deluge of untimely frivolous constitutional claims is belied by this court experience that a credible claim of actual innocence is extremely rare.see supra text accompanying note.moreover,the existing availability of an actual innocence exception to other procedurally defaulted claims has not resulted in abuse and delay.it is only the extraordinary case,such as the present one,in which the habeas petitioner can present new evidence which undermines this court confidence in the outcome of the trial and therefore requires assurance that it was free of constitutional error 
the state argues that recognition of an actual innocence exception would be inconsistent with d because it would render the new evidence scenario of the limitation provision superfluous.resp.br.at.we find this argument to be wholly unpersuasive.the new evidence scenario states that the limitations period begins to run from the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.d d.the state argues that if this court recognizes an actual innocence exception,d d would be rendered a nullity.resp.br.at.this argument fails to recognize the difference between timely claims brought under d d and gateway actual innocence claims.a claim filed within one year of the discovery of new evidence proceeds directly to the district court for a determination of the merits of the habeas petitioner constitutional claims.by contrast,under the schlup actual innocence gateway,the petitioner must clear the procedural bar of demonstrating a credible claim of actual innocence before a court will reach the merits of his constitutional claims.because one must meet a significantly greater burden to pass through the gateway,no petitioner would forego filing within the period under d d if possible.the actual innocence exception would be limited to the rare and extraordinary case where a petitioner can demonstrate a credible claim of actual innocence and the limitations window has closed therefore,an actual innocence exception would not be inconsistent with the aedpa limitations provision itself 
finally,we conclude that constitutional concerns counsel in favor of upholding equitable tolling based on a credible claim of actual innocence.several courts have recognized that denying federal habeas relief from one who is actually innocent would be constitutionally problematic see wyzykowski dep t of,cir noting that barring a habeas petitioner who can demonstrate actual innocence raises concerns because of the inherent injustice that results from the conviction of an innocent person,and the technological advances that can provide compelling evidence of a person innocence footnotes omitted triestman united states,cir finding serious eighth amendment and due process concerns if aedpa procedural limitations barred a habeas petitioner claiming actual innocence from collateral review in re dorsainvil,cir were no other avenue of judicial review available for a party who claims that is factually or legally innocent we would be faced with a thorny constitutional issue.miller,at noting that where a petitioner claims actual innocence,the limitations period raises serious constitutional questions which possibly renders the habeas remedy inadequate and ineffective holloway,d at holding that the use of aedpa limitations period to preclude a petitioner who can demonstrate that he or she is factually innocent of the crimes that he or she was convicted of would violate the suspension clause as well as the eighth amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment.indeed,concern about the injustice that results from the conviction of an innocent person has long been at the core of our criminal justice system.that concern is reflected in the fundamental value determination of our society that it is far worse to convict an innocent man than to let a guilty man go free.schlup,at.quoting in re winship,d harlan,concurring.in light of these grave constitutional concerns,we believe equitable tolling of the statute of limitations based on a credible showing of actual innocence is appropriate.
in sum,we hold that where an otherwise habeas petitioner can demonstrate that it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,the petitioner should be allowed to pass through the gateway and argue the merits of his underlying constitutional claims.
iii.conclusion 
based on the foregoing,we conclude that though souter habeas petition is,he has demonstrated a credible claim of actual innocence,such that he is entitled to equitable tolling and may proceed to argue the merits of his ineffective assistance of counsel and due process claims.the district court dismissal of his habeas petition is hereby reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

one district court in this circuit has resolved the issue and found that an actual innocence exception exists to the statute of limitations contained within d.holloway jones,d.see also brooks mckee,d,at least one judge in this district,however,has held that an actual innocence exception exists that would toll the one year limitations period contained in d.grayson grayson,d,relying on the holloway holding that an actual innocence exception exists.in holloway,the district court concluded that to use the aedpa statute of limitations to preclude a petitioner who can demonstrate that he or she is factually innocent of the crimes that he or she was convicted of would violate the suspension clause contained in const.art.i,cl,as well as the eighth amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment.d at.
in aedpa,congress adopted a more stringent actual innocence exception in the and provisions,requiring that the factual predicate of the claim could not have been discovered earlier and a showing by clear and convincing evidence that,but for constitutional error,no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.b b e.the adoption of a narrower actual innocence exception in these two specific instances did not alter the general schlup actual innocence standard applicable in cases involving other types of procedural default.accordingly,after aedpa,we have continued to apply the schlup actual innocence standard unless the case falls within one of the two areas requiring the heightened standard.see williams bagley,cir.furthermore,the united states supreme court has continued to apply the more lenient schlup standard in defining a miscarriage of justice in other circumstances,which reinforces the conclusion that congress was not acting to alter the actual innocence standard beyond the two specific provisions in aedpa.see calderon thompson,d it is true that the miscarriage of justice standard we adopt today is somewhat more lenient than the standard in b b.though we have not previously determined whether an actual innocence exception exists,we have concluded previously that the schlup more likely than not standard was the proper approach in evaluating a claim for equitable tolling based on actual innocence.allen yukins,cir,cert.denied,d.as the second circuit recently stated,b ecause the interests that must be balanced in creating an exception to the statute of limitations are identical to those implicated in the procedural default context,we see no reason not to apply the schlup standard in the tolling context.doe menefee,cir.
at the preliminary examination,graeser explained that t he wound is unique.it has cutting characteristics,and yet,the injuries are also those of severe blunt force,and that is uniquely the same.if you look at the very bottom of that bottle,it has about a one sixteenth of an inch rim that very sharp.if you would take your hand and rub it across it hard,you probably cut yourself.that can cause the cutting i see in the photographs,and yet,if it were just a sharp instrument like a hatchet,it would have cut clear through the skull.the skull was damaged,or at least it was broken or cut.so that the rest of the bottle,once the sharp part had cut through the tissue,then the blunt part of the bottle connected with the head or can connect with the head and part a lot of force to cause all of the damage to the brain that was seen at the saying that in my experience that the only object i can think of that would produce.at.in its closing argument at trial,the state urged the jury to r emember how graeser said that it was much sharper back in november than it is now.well,if you look at that closely with a magnifying glass,you will see little chips are out of it so it has been worn down.at trial tr.
