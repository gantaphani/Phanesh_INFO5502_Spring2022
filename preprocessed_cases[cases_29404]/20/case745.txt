curtis long appeals from an order of the district court which denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus after concluding that,even though the commonwealth failed to raise the statute of limitations defense,d,in the answer to the petition,it had not waived the defense because it advanced it after the magistrate judge sua sponte flagged it in her report.this appeal requires us to decide whether this holding is consistent with robinson johnson,cir,cert.denied,d a case in which we stressed the importance of early interposition of the least where the petitioner,as here,is not prejudiced by the delay.we hold that it is,that the commonwealth did not waive the statute of limitations defense,and that the petition was untimely.we will therefore affirm the order of the district court denying the petition on that ground.
facts and procedural history 
long was found guilty by a jury in indiana county,pennsylvania,of involuntary manslaughter in violation of.ann.a west,complicity to commit second degree murder in violation of.ann.b,a c west,and complicity to commit robbery in violation of.ann.a i west,a c in july.his motions were denied and he was sentenced to life in prison.the pennsylvania superior court affirmed the judgment,and the state supreme court denied allowance of appeal on march.long did not petition for certiorari to the united states supreme court.
in august new counsel was appointed under the pennsylvania post conviction relief act.ann.et.west,and long,through that counsel,filed his first state petition on december.it was denied the superior court affirmed,and the state supreme court denied allocatur on august.long filed a state petition for writ of habeas corpus on july.it was denied as an untimely state petition.ann.b,and as raising previously litigated claims.ann,on november.long did not appeal.
long then filed,pro se,an in forma pauperis petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to in united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania,raising thirteen grounds for relief.as the merits of long claims are not at issue here we will not provide an exhaustive list.as a general matter,long alleged that he was deprived of a fair trial in that his motion for severance was denied and in that witnesses were not sequestered his statement to police was admitted in violation of miranda arizona,d he received ineffective assistance of counsel in presenting a coercion defense the prosecutor committed misconduct in the handling of a key witness and the police violated his constitutional rights in stopping and arresting him.the assigned magistrate judge granted long in forma pauperis status and ordered the commonwealth to respond to the habeas petition.the magistrate judge order stated that the commonwealth shall address both the merits of the petition and exhaustion of state court remedies as required by b and c.picard connor,d rose lundy,d united states ex rel.trantino hatrack,cir zicarelli gray,cir.the answer shall comply with the requirements of rule of the rules governing section cases in the united states district courts.the order,however,made no mention of the habeas corpus statute of limitations,d 
on june,the commonwealth answered the habeas petition,provided a complete state procedural history of long claims,and asserted,citing appropriate authority,that any habeas claim that could fairly be said to have been raised at all levels either on direct appeal or in the first state petition was exhausted.any habeas claim that was raised for the first time in the state second petition or was omitted on appeal to the superior court during the original proceedings was,of course,barred due to procedural default,and cause and prejudice could not be shown.the commonwealth then addressed on the merits the severance claim and an ineffective assistance of counsel claim although the commonwealth asserted that the miranda claim was barred due to a procedural default,it addressed this claim on the merits.
long filed a reply,in which he urged the court to address his claims notwithstanding his state procedural defaults.thereafter,there was no activity on the docket until january,when long case was reassigned to a new united states district judge following the original judge retirement.in may,the magistrate judge filed a report and recommendation,in which she recommended that the habeas petition be denied as untimely under d,which is set forth in the margin,and which provides that a petition be filed within one year of the date on which a judgment becomes final 
in deciding the timeliness issue under d,the magistrate judge reasoned that long conviction became final days after march,when the pennsylvania supreme court denied allocatur,see d a swartz meyers,cir judgment becomes final after time for seeking discretionary review expires when discretionary review is not sought kapral united states,cir if defendant does not file certiorari petition,judgment of conviction becomes final when time for seeking certiorari review expires,and thus before the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa went into effect on april.pursuant to burns morton,cir,long had until april,to file his habeas petition 
section d provides,however,that t he time during which a properly filed application for state or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation under this subsection.d.thus,the statute was tolled when long filed his first state petition on december,started to run again on august,when the state supreme court denied allowance of appeal of that petition,see stokes district attorney of county of philadelphia,cir time during which state prisoner may file certiorari petition from denial of state petition does not toll statute of limitations,and expired well before he filed his federal habeas petition on april,the state habeas petition had no effect on tolling,because an untimely state petition is not properly filed for purposes of tolling,merritt blaine,cir,cert.denied,d,and,in any event,the limitations period had already run when it was filed.in addition,no other statutory exceptions applied,and there was no basis under our decisions in miller new jersey state dep t of,cir,fahy horn,cir,or johnson hendricks,cir,cert.denied,d,for equitable tolling.
the magistrate judge then addressed the issue we are required to decide in this appeal.she noted that the commonwealth had not raised the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense,which presented the question whether the defense was waived under our decision in robinson johnson.relying on acosta artuz,cir,she concluded that a federal magistrate judge could raise the habeas corpus statute of limitations issue sua sponte because it implicated values beyond the concerns of the parties.she cited a footnote in our decision in banks horn,cir,rev on other grounds,d,which predates robinson,wherein we noted,in reliance upon acosta,among other cases,that a court of appeals could review the aedpa statute of limitations issue sua sponte even if it were not properly before the court.she further observed that we stressed in robinson that there is more than one reason why affirmative defenses should be raised as early as is practicable,and one of them is to promote judicial economy,to which she clearly believed she was contributing.
long,who was not represented by counsel in the district court,timely filed objections,in which he argued that the court should apply the miscarriage of justice exception to the aedpa statute of limitations in his case the putative miscarriage of justice was a fundamentally unfair trial.importantly for our purposes here,the commonwealth filed an answer to the objections a week later and within three weeks of the filing of the report and recommendation in which it endorsed the magistrate judge view that the habeas petition was untimely,stating the magistrate judge determined that the petition was barred by the statute of limitation provided under d.respondents submit that the magistrate judge was correct for the reasons set forth in the following paragraphs.respondent answer to petitioner objections to the magistrate judge report and recommendation,at.the commonwealth also expressed its agreement with the magistrate judge analysis as it related to calculating when the habeas petition should have been filed,id.at,and then asked the district court in the final unnumbered paragraph of this answer to dismiss the petition as untimely,stating wherefore,respondents respectfully request your honorable court to overrule petitioner objections and to adopt the magistrate judge report and recommendation.
the district court did just that.in a memorandum order entered on june,the district court denied the habeas petition as untimely and adopted the report and recommendation as the opinion of the court.the court stated 
the magistrate judge report and recommendation,filed may,recommended that the petition be denied as untimely and that a certificate of appealability be denied.petitioner has filed objections to the report and recommendation in which he asserts that he has demonstrated cause for his procedural default and prejudice therefrom the magistrate judge recommended that the petition be dismissed because it was not timely filed within the limitations period provided for under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,d.the magistrate judge did not find any procedural default so the cause and prejudice standard does not apply to this case in her report and recommendation the magistrate judge discussed the doctrine of equitable tolling which can toll the running of the aedpa statute of limitations,and properly determined that petitioner has not shown a basis for tolling.after de novo review of the pleadings and documents in the case,together with the objections to the report and recommendation it is hereby ordered that the petition be denied as untimely.
memorandum order of the district court,at citation omitted.
long appealed,and we appointed counsel and granted a certificate of appealability as follows 
w hether the respondent to a habeas petition must raise the statute of limitations defense,d,in the answer to the habeas petition or be deemed to have waived it.robinson johnson,cir.put another way,may the magistrate judge in a report and recommendation recommend dismissal on the basis of untimeliness when the respondent has failed to raise the defense in its answer,and may the state thereafter raise the statute of limitations defense in a supplemental pleading to avoid being deemed to have waived the defense,and whether the respondent here may be deemed to have raised the statute of limitations defense in its answer to petitioner objections to the magistrate judge report and recommendation.
order of court,
we have jurisdiction pursuant to.the district court analysis of the statute of limitations issue,which in long case does not involve disputed facts,is subject to plenary review,see swartz meyers,at,except to the extent that the district court impliedly permitted the commonwealth to amend its answer.that decision is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.see heyl patterson int l,rich housing of virgin islands,cir.
ii.the amendment to the answer 
robinson johnson 
our discussion must necessarily begin with robinson johnson,supra.robinson,whose first federal habeas petition was dismissed for failure to exhaust state remedies,filed a second federal habeas petition,which was referred to a magistrate judge who ordered a responsive pleading.the commonwealth filed a letter response,arguing that the petition should be transferred to the court of appeals for authorization because it was a successive petition.at.the magistrate judge recommended denying the petition on that basis,and the district court accepted the magistrate judge recommendation.
robinson appealed,and we ordered the commonwealth to show cause why the order dismissing the petition should not be summarily reversed in light of christy horn,cir where federal habeas petition has been dismissed without prejudice for failure to exhaust state remedies,petitioner need not apply to court of appeals for authorization to file a second habeas action.the commonwealth filed a letter brief,in which it conceded that robinson second federal habeas petition was not successive.the commonwealth did not present any alternative legal grounds for affirming the district court.we then summarily reversed and remanded.
on remand,robinson filed a motion to strike his original petition and for permission to file an amended petition.the commonwealth then filed a pleading,asserting for the first time that robinson second federal habeas petition was by aedpa statute of limitations,d.robinson,in rebuttal,argued that the commonwealth statute of limitations defense was untimely.the magistrate judge endorsed the commonwealth argument,and the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation over robinson renewed objection that the commonwealth had waived its limitations defense.
on appeal,we held first that,because the statute of limitations is not jurisdictional in nature,see miller new jersey state dep t of,at,the state may waive the defense.robinson,at.because the federal rules of civil procedure are applicable to habeas petitions to the extent that they are not inconsistent with the habeas rules,we then considered whether federal rule of civil procedure c requires that a defendant plead an affirmative defense,such as a statute of limitations,in its answer.robinson,at.we explained parties are generally required to assert affirmative defenses early in litigation,so they may be ruled upon,prejudice may be avoided,and judicial resources may be conserved.habeas proceedings are no exception.id.we further emphasized the purpose of requiring the defendant to plead available affirmative defenses in his answer is to avoid surprise and undue prejudice by providing the plaintiff with notice and the opportunity to demonstrate why the affirmative defense should not succeed.id.at citing,of,d.
nevertheless,we expressly held that a limitations defense does not necessarily have to be raised in the answer.id.at.we surveyed several cases involving federal rule of civil procedure a and amendments to answers.in venters city of delphi,cir,for example,the seventh circuit held that the defendant had waived the statute of limitations defense,and that the district court had abused its discretion in permitting an amendment to the answer.the court explained that,if the relevance of a statute of limitations defense becomes apparent only after discovery,the defendant should promptly seek leave of court to amend the answer and a district court should grant the motion,but that the district court should not countenance an invocation of the defense,and that raising the statute of limitations for the first time in a reply memorandum in support of a motion for summary judgment was an impermissible invocation.the parties had completed an exhaustive discovery process,trial was a month away,and the plaintiff had been denied the opportunity to file a surreply.
after discussing venters and other cases,the panel explained that all of the cases surveyed reflected attempts by the courts to keep the consideration of affirmative defenses consistent with at least the purpose,if not necessarily the language,of rule c.robinson,at.thus,although an affirmative defense need not be raised in the answer,it must be raised as early as practicable thereafter.id.we reasoned that affirmative defenses must be raised as early as is practicable,not only to avoid prejudice to a plaintiff or petitioner,but also to promote judicial economy.we wrote if a party has a successful affirmative defense,raising that defense as early as possible,and permitting a court to rule on it,may terminate the proceedings at that point without wasting precious legal and judicial resources.id.we then stated that affirmative defenses under aedpa should be treated the same as affirmative defenses in other contexts,and,if not pleaded in the answer,they must be raised at the earliest practicable moment thereafter.id.
applying this rule,we went on to hold that the commonwealth assertion of its affirmative defense of the statute of limitations was not untimely.we opined that the commonwealth letter response to robinson habeas petition seeking transfer to the court of appeals was equivalent to a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is a favored defense,id.at citing.h,and we opined that the commonwealth did not have to include the statute of limitations defense in its original motion to transfer,and was not required to raise the defense when the case was on appeal for the first time,id.at and the normal rules regarding the waiver of defenses under.c did not apply until the threshold issue of successiveness was resolved.we then stated that the defense was not waived because the commonwealth raised it in its first pleading on remand.id.at.
this reference to the first pleading on remand was descriptive of the procedural circumstances of robinson case,a construction of our holding that the aedpa statute of limitations defense should,if not pleaded in the answer,be raised at the earliest practicable,or possible,or feasible,moment thereafter.robinson,at.what the earliest practicable or possible or feasible moment after an answer has been filed might be in another case where the procedural circumstances were different we necessarily left open.
federal rule of civil procedure a prejudice and the role of delay and inadvertence 
we turn to long arguments on appeal.long concedes that robinson does not impose an absolute requirement that the aedpa statute of limitations defense be asserted in the answer.however,he argues that he suffered undue prejudice as a result of the delay in raising the defense,and that the commonwealth should have a compelling reason for failing to assert the defense in the answer.long argues that robinson was not meant to grant extra time to those litigants who fail to assert the defense in the answer as a result of inadvertence.
long relies on a decision from the second circuit,strauss douglas aircraft,cir,which we cited in robinson,at.in strauss,the district court granted the defendant leave to amend the answer to plead the statute of limitations defense.on appeal the court reversed,holding that,since the complaint had apprised the defendant of an implied warranty claim,and since the defendant from prior experience should have been aware of the choice of forum issue inherent in the case,the limitations defense should have been raised in the original answer,or at a minimum,within a reasonable time thereafter.the court found that the defendant conduct in raising the defense four years late was inexcusable,and that the plaintiff was substantially prejudiced in that,had the statute been timely pleaded,he might have been able to bring another action in a jurisdiction where his suit would not have been.
we do not doubt that strauss correctly states the law,but it provides only general support for long argument.first,it does not hold that inadvertence on the part of a defendant establishes undue prejudice sufficient to deny an amendment under rule a.second,the length of the delay in strauss was extremely long.third,and perhaps most important of all,the plaintiff suffered actual prejudice in that his action might not have been in another jurisdiction had he known about the statute of limitations defense sooner.with respect to the latter basis for strauss s holding,we note that long habeas petition unquestionably was untimely under d.thus he suffered no prejudice of the type discussed in strauss.the frustrated expectation of not having an untimely habeas petition heard on the merits does not establish prejudice sufficient to defeat an amendment to an answer.
the delay here presents a closer question.as long points out,the commonwealth took months to assert the defense.long filed his habeas petition in april,and the commonwealth did not raise the statute of limitations defense until june.the passage of time factors into the analysis of whether a plaintiff has suffered prejudice by a delay in amending an answer to assert an affirmative defense.see robinson,at citing venters,at strauss,at hayden ford motor,cir and int l of boilermakers,local transue williams,cir.we conclude,however,that the commonwealth can not fairly be said to have unduly delayed in raising the aedpa statute of limitations defense.
the commonwealth answered the complaint one month after being ordered to do so,and raised the statute of limitations defense one week after long filed his objections and three weeks after the magistrate judge filed her report and recommendation.the inactivity on the docket from july until january when a new district judge was assigned,and again from january until may when the magistrate judge filed her report and recommendation,is not attributable to the commonwealth under the circumstances indeed,in a case referred to a magistrate judge,once a habeas petition is filed and answered,it seems reasonable for the parties to wait for a report and recommendation to be filed before engaging in further pleading.with respect to the question of inadvertence,the commonwealth concedes in its brief on appeal that it made a mistake in not raising the defense in the answer.it argues,however,that it in effect made a timely and proper amendment of its answer in accordance with federal rule of procedure a,and that the district court,in effect,allowed the amendment in its discretion.we agree.
the commonwealth relies on block first blood associates,cir,also from the second circuit,where the defendants first raised a statute of limitations defense in a motion for summary judgment four years after the complaint was filed.the district court treated the motion for summary judgment as a motion to amend the pleadings and dismissed the action as.on appeal the second circuit affirmed,holding that there was no showing of prejudice to the plaintiff and no bad faith on the part of the defendant.the court noted in particular the complete absence of bad faith and the fact that the suit was untimely on the day it was commenced.id.at.the court rejected the plaintiff argument that his frustrated expectations constituted undue prejudice sufficient to overcome the rule a right to amend a pleading.id.
block elaborates a standard for judging prejudice that is compatible with robinson,at,and rule a jurisprudence in this circuit.the second circuit reasoned that,generally,the longer the unexplained delay,the less the plaintiff must show in terms of prejudice.at citing advocat nexus.in determining what constitutes prejudice,the second circuit considers whether the assertion of the new claim would i require the opponent to expend significant additional resources to conduct discovery and prepare for trial ii significantly delay the resolution of the dispute or iii prevent the plaintiff from bringing a timely action in another jurisdiction.id.internal quotations and citations omitted.the court also emphasized the absence of bad faith.we endorse the second circuit approach.none of these considerations are present in long case.he was not forced to undertake discovery or additional discovery,and he could not have brought his habeas action in another jurisdiction.moreover,the commonwealth amendment did not delay resolution of the case and was not the product of bad faith.
rule a requires that leave to amend the pleadings be granted freely when justice so requires.fed.civ.pro.a.we have held that motions to amend pleadings should be liberally granted.see,adams gould,cir u nder the liberal pleading philosophy of the federal rules as incorporated in rule a,an amendment should be allowed whenever there has not been undue delay,bad faith on the part of the movant,or prejudice to the nonmovant as a result of the delay.in lundy adamar of new jersey,cir,we stated this court has often held that,absent undue or substantial prejudice,an amendment should be allowed under rule a unless denial can be grounded in bad faith or dilatory motive,truly undue or unexplained delay,repeated failure to cure deficiency by amendments previously allowed or futility of amendment.id.at quoting bechtel robinson,cir emphasis in original.the plain terms of rule a do not discriminate on the basis of type of
