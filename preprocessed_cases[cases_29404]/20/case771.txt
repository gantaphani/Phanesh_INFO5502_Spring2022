opinion of the court 
this matter comes to us on appeal from the district court denial of appellant charles thomas lewis application for writ of habeas corpus,seeking relief from his state conviction on grounds his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel was violated.specifically,lewis contends that his trial counsel failure to file a notice of appeal constituted performance within the meaning of strickland washington,d,and roe,d,and deprived him of his first appeal of right.in accordance with the foregoing,we reverse the district court order denying habeas relief and remand with instructions that a writ be issued conditioned on the commonwealth reinstating nunc pro tunc lewis right of first appeal.
background 
trial proceedings 
lewis is presently an inmate at the state correctional institution at pittsburgh where he is serving a to year sentence imposed by the pennsylvania court of common pleas of allegheny county trial court following his conviction on six counts of robbery and nine other criminal offenses.lewis pleaded guilty to the charges on january,and was sentenced on march.lewis was sentenced to six consecutive to year terms for each robbery count,to be followed by eleven years of probation for the bad checks and firearms charges.lewis was represented by john elash,a attorney,during the guilty plea and sentencing proceedings.following the announcement of the sentence,the trial judge informed lewis of his right to file motions challenging the validity of his guilty plea or requesting modification of the sentence within days of the proceeding.
on march,nine days following his sentencing,lewis filed a timely motion pro se in the trial court challenging the validity of his guilty plea on several grounds,including ineffective assistance of counsel.on april,trial counsel filed a motion for leave to withdraw guilty plea,which the trial court summarily denied without opinion.the trial court did not rule on lewis pro se motion and the parties indicate that it remains pending.no appeal was taken from either the judgment of sentence or the trial court ruling denying the counseled motion to withdraw the guilty plea.
first petition for relief under state law 
on february,lewis filed his first petition pro se pursuant to the pennsylvania post conviction hearing act pcha.et seq in the common pleas court of allegheny county.counsel was appointed and an amended petition was subsequently filed.among the issues raised in the pcha petition was ineffective assistance of counsel based on trial counsel failure to move to withdraw lewis guilty plea when the trial court did not accept the alleged plea agreement and sentence lewis to to years on each robbery count running concurrently rather than consecutively failure to appeal the trial court denial of lewis motion for leave to withdraw the guilty plea despite having a meritorious argument that the guilty plea was unlawfully induced and failure to file a direct appeal from the denial of the motion and judgment of sentence appendix,vol.at.lewis pcha petition was denied following an evidentiary hearing.lewis appealed the decision to the superior court,which addressed the sole of issue of whether lewis was denied his right of direct appeal.the superior court concluded that its prior decision in commonwealth dockins,which holds that trial counsel can not be found ineffective for failing to file a direct appeal when not requested to do so,was controlling.the court affirmed the denial of lewis petition for relief under the pcha based on its conclusion that 
t rial counsel admitted discussing the possible grounds for appeal and mentions that none of the grounds were of appellate merit.the only evidence indicating the desire to appeal was provided in the appellant testimony at the hearing on the pcha petition.however,in reviewing the transcript of the hearing,we find nothing in the record to support the appellant testimony.the pcha court resolved the issue of credibility in favor of trial counsel.that determination will not be disturbed on appeal.we therefore adhere to the holding in dockins,providing that trial counsel can not be found ineffective for failing to file a direct appeal when not requested to do so.
appendix,vol.ii at.lewis petition for allocator to the pennsylvania supreme court appealing the superior court ruling was denied.
second petition for state relief 
lewis,represented by counsel,filed a second petition for relief on february,pursuant to pennsylvania relief act pcra.lewis again contested the validity of his guilty plea and alleged trial counsel was ineffective on a number of grounds,to include for failing to take direct appeal from the judgment of sentence which,lewis contended,was contrary to the terms of his guilty plea.another evidentiary hearing was held,and the pcra petition denied thereafter.lewis appealed the decision to the superior court.the court disposed of the question of lewis right to a direct appeal in a footnote,holding that his claim was meritless since the court had previously decided the claim against him when it adjudicated his first petition under the pcha,and held that dockins precluded relief.appendix,vol.ii at citing commonwealth lewis,pittsburgh.filed july.lewis petition for leave to appeal this decision to the pennsylvania supreme court was denied.
federal habeas petition 
following the exhaustion of his state remedies,lewis filed a timely pro se petition for writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania on august.in his petition,lewis alleged,inter alia,that the decisions of the commonwealth courts ran counter to clearly established federal law.specifically,lewis contended that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to file a direct appeal from the trial court denial of his motion for leave to withdraw his guilty plea and the judgment of sentence.the district court referred the case to the magistrate judge who addressed only the question of whether trial counsel was ineffective for causing lewis to enter a guilty plea that was not voluntary and intelligent.concluding that the state courts resolution of this question was not contrary to clearly established law,the magistrate judge recommended that lewis petition for habeas relief be denied.
lewis timely filed objections to the magistrate report and recommendation,arguing that the magistrate judge failed to review his claim of ineffectiveness arising from trial counsel failure to take a direct appeal,and made no determination as to whether the record supported the state courts finding that he had not asked trial counsel to take an appeal.lewis further argued that counsel denied assistance by unconstitutionally abandoning his assignment to my case during critical judicial proceedings without filing an appeal.appendix,vol.iii at.in support of his objections,lewis cited to the supreme court decisions in and douglas california,d.by order,the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation and denied lewis petition for federal habeas relief.
lewis filed a timely notice of appeal in this court.we granted lewis application for a certificate of appealability to consider whether trial counsel was ineffective for failing file a direct appeal.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
our jurisdiction to review a district court order denying a state inmate petition for habeas relief is derived from.where,as in this case,the district court relied exclusively on the state court record and did not hold an evidentiary hearing,our review of its decision is plenary.moore morton,cir citation omitted.lewis,a state inmate seeking relief from his state court conviction,filed his federal habeas petition in thus our adjudication of this case is governed by the provisions of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,which,in relevant part,provides 
an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.the aedpa modifie d the roles of federal habeas courts in reviewing petitions filed by state prisoners.williams taylor,d.under this new statutory rubric,w e are to review the state court determinations on the merits only to ascertain whether the court reached a decision that was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court law,or whether it made an unreasonable determination of the facts.marshall hendricks,cir.t he determination whether or not a rule is clearly established at the time a state court renders its final judgment of conviction is a question as to which the federal courts must make an independent evaluation.williams,at.quoting wright west,d,concurring in judgment.the aedpa does,however,confine the authorities on which federal courts may rely in making this determination to the decisional law of the supreme court,that is,the federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.id.at.quotation omitted.
the question in this case is whether lewis trial counsel was ineffective for not filing a notice of appeal.lewis relies on the supreme court decision in,which held that criminal defense attorneys have a constitutional duty to consult and advise defendants of their appellate rights.was decided after lewis conviction was finally adjudicated,thus we certified two questions in our order granting lewis appeal.the first asks whether,in light of strickland and,the commonwealth courts application of the rule of commonwealth dockins,supra,to appellant claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.as an antecedent to this question,we instructed that the parties first address the question to what extent the holdings of constitute clearly established federal law.see williams taylor,supra.we begin our inquiry addressing this latter question.
teague analysis 
the threshold question under the aedpa is whether the petitioner seeks to apply a rule of law that was clearly established at the time his conviction became final.williams,at.in williams,the supreme court held that this limiting provision of the aedpa bears only a slight connection to the nonretroactivity principle articulated in teague lane,d,and its progeny except to the extent that whatever would qualify as an old rule under our teague line of cases will constitute clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states under d.williams,at.citation omitted.the nonretroactivity principle prevents a federal court from granting habeas corpus relief to a state prisoner based on a new rule announced after his conviction and sentence became final.caspari bohlen,d.
as we have explained,teague teaches that the federal courts in habeas corpus proceedings should be reluctant to apply new rules of federal jurisprudence in state court cases decided before such new rules were handed down.principles of comity and finality counsel that we maintain a circumscribed scope of habeas review.banks horn,cir,rev on other grounds by horn banks,d,and reaff by banks horn,cir hereinafter banks iii citing teague,at.the supreme court has acknowledged that discerning whether a rule is old or new for retroactivity purposes is not without difficulty,b ut teague established some guidance for making this determination,explaining that a federal habeas court operates within the bounds of comity and finality if it applies a rule dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendant conviction became final.williams,at.quoting teague,at.conversely,a new rule is one which breaks new ground or imposes a new obligation on the states or the federal government.id.the question of whether a rule is old or new for teague purposes remains one which the federal courts must make an independent evaluation.id.at.quoting wright,at,concurring in judgment.in accord with the aedpa,federal courts may rely only on the precedents of the supreme court in making this determination.id.at.
teague outlines a analysis for determining whether the nonretroactivity principle prevents a habeas petitioner reliance on a particular rule first,we must determine when the defendant conviction became final.second,we must survey the legal landscape to determine whether or not the case in question announced a new rule of constitutional law.finally,if we determine that the case did announce a new rule,we must consider whether it fits into one of the two exceptions to nonretroactivity.banks iii,at citing caspari,at.there is no dispute in this case that the final adjudication of lewis conviction and the two exceptions to the teague bar do not apply.thus we focus our inquiry on step two,reviewing the legal landscape to determine whether the duty to consult announced in was dictated by precedent clearly established at the time lewis conviction became final williams,at.
in the supreme court addressed the question of whether counsel may be found deficient for failing to file a notice of appeal absent specific instruction from the defendant.because the question concerned whether counsel representation was constitutionally defective,the court held that the familiar test announced in strickland governed its inquiry at.applying the strickland standard to the particular facts before it,the court held that counsel had a constitutionally imposed duty to consult with the defendant about an appeal when there is reason to think either that a rational defendant would want to appeal for example,because there are nonfrivolous grounds for appeal,or that this particular defendant reasonably demonstrated to counsel that he was interested in appealing.at.the court further explained that it employ ed the term consult to convey a specific the defendant about the advantages and disadvantages of taking an appeal,and making a reasonable effort to discover the defendant wishes.id.at.additionally,the supreme court instructed that courts undertaking this inquiry,as with all ineffective assistance claims,take into account all the information counsel knew or should have known.id.at.citing strickland,at.with respect to strickland s prejudice prong,the court held that the harmless error inquiry applied and that relief could not be granted unless the defendant could demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel deficient failure to consult with him about an appeal,he would have timely appealed.id.at.
the parties do not dispute that strickland s reasonableness test was clearly established law in when lewis conviction became final,and that it governs the adjudication of this case.see williams,at.it is past question that the rule set forth in strickland qualifies as clearly established federal law.rather,the point of contention rests with the court second holding in respecting the duty to consult.lewis contends the second holding of was dictated by precedent,and urged at oral argument that the supreme court merely clarified the law as it applied to the facts before it.conversely,the commonwealth argues that this holding imposed a new burden on the states by set ting forth a new standard for the appellate process and is barred by teague from application in this case.
we note as an initial matter that the commonwealth has provided little analysis and cites no authority for this position.when pressed at oral argument,counsel for the commonwealth could only point to language in the court opinion announcing the decision,t oday we hold and the standard we announce today,at,language which counsel took to mean a new rule,if you announce the rule today.see also appellee br.at.this language is hardly dispositive or even persuasive.the point of the teague analysis is to determine whether a rule which the state final adjudication of a habeas petitioner conviction may,without offending principles of comity and finality,be retroactively applied.the language on which the commonwealth relies merely states the obvious that the case announced a rule on a particular day and does not inform the second prong of our teague inquiry.further,we note that case law need not exist on all fours to allow for a finding under teague that the rule at issue was dictated by supreme court precedent.strickland is a rule of general applicability which asks whether counsel conduct was objectively reasonable and conformed to professional norms based on the facts of the particular case,viewed as of the time of counsel conduct.at.emphasis added.this standard provides sufficient guidance for resolving virtually all claims.williams,at.
for these reasons,the commonwealth emphasis on the particular duty identified by the constitutional obligation to consult with her client regarding appeal a basis for classifying this rule as new for teague purposes is misplaced.that the strickland test of necessity requires a examination of the evidence,obviates neither the clarity of the rule nor the extent to which the rule must be seen as established by this supreme court.id.quoting wright,at.kennedy,concurring in judgment.justice kennedy concurrence in wright west is instructive on this point 
if the rule in question is one which of necessity requires a examination of the evidence,then we can tolerate a number of specific applications without saying that those applications themselves create a new rule where the beginning point is a rule of this general application,a rule designed for the specific purpose of evaluating a myriad of factual contexts,it will be the infrequent case that yields a result so novel that it forges a new rule,one not dictated by precedent.
at.emphasis added.our review of the legal landscape,at the time lewis conviction became final,compels us to conclude that did not yield a result so novel that it forge d a new rule,and that application of the strickland standard was dictated by precedent and merely clarified the law as it applied to the particular facts of that case.
indeed we need look no further than strickland in making this determination.in announcing the objective reasonableness standard,the strickland court identified certain basic duties that its precedents and professional norms established criminal defense attorneys must carry out to perform competently within the meaning of sixth amendment.the court included among these duties counsel obligation to function as assistant to the defendant and the overarching duty to advocate the defendant cause and the more particular duties to consult with the defendant on important decisions and to keep the defendant informed of important developments in the course of the prosecution.strickland,at.emphasis added.the decision whether to appeal is unquestionably one such important decision.see,at.souter,concurring in part and dissenting in part evitts lucey,d wainwright sykes,d burger,concurring noting the question of whether to appeal is a critical procedural decision rodriquez united states,d.it follows then that since the decision to appeal can not be made intelligently without appreciating the merits of possible grounds for seeking review,and the potential risks to the appealing defendant,a lay defendant needs help before deciding,at.souter,emphasis added citations omitted.
this proposition that a defendant requires the advice of counsel to make an informed decision respecting his right of hardly novel in.it was clearly established that the sixth amendment guarantee of effective assistance of counsel extended to the first appeal as of right,and the strickland standard applied to appellate representation.see generally jones barnes,d evitts,d.the supreme court cases respecting attorney competence on appeal recognized that lay defendants may not even be aware of errors which occurred at trial,rodriquez,at,and required the superior ability of trained counsel in the examination into the record,research of the law,and marshalling of arguments on appeal just as at trial.jones,at.quoting douglas california,at.thus,though the accused has the ultimate authority to make certain fundamental decisions regarding the case,including whether to plead guilty,waive a jury,testify in his or her own behalf,or take an appeal,id.at.citing sykes,at.burger,concurring aba standards for criminal justice,ed,counsel was constitutionally obligated to advise the defendant respecting those decisions to allow for intelligent exercise of the particular right.see,rock arkansas,d right to testify on one behalf hill lockhart,d guilty plea waiver of right to jury trial.broke no new ground in holding the duty to consult also extended to counsel obligation to advise the defendant of his appellate rights.
as justice souter concurring opinion in evidences,this view comports with the prevailing professional norms existing in,to the extent these norms are denoted in the published standards of the american bar association aba,at,quoting aba standards for criminal justice b ed.defense counsel should advise a defendant on the meaning of the court judgment,of defendant right to appeal,and of the probable outcome of appealing.promulgated in,the aba standards strickland.the supreme court has cited with approval the use of p revailing norms of practice as reflected in the american bar association standards and the like as guides to determining what is reasonable,but only guides.strickland,at,at.in light of the foregoing supreme court precedents respecting the constitutional standard for appellate representation,we believe reasonable jurists applying the strickland standard to lewis claim would have concluded that the court previous precedents did not simply inform,or even control or govern the analysis,but instead compel led the rule in.banks iii,at quoting saffle parks,d add l citation omitted.
accordingly,we hold that s application of the strickland standard did not forge new ground or otherwise impose a new obligation upon the states in announcing the duty to consult,and this holding constitutes an old rule which may be retroactively applied to lewis claim of ineffectiveness 
merits analysis 
having concluded that the duty to consult as announced in constitutes an old rule for retroactivity purposes and clearly established law,we now move to the merits of lewis claim and consider the second question certified on this appeal whether,in light of strickland and,the state courts application of the rule of commonwealth dockins resulted in a decision that was contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.in williams taylor,justice,writing for the majority,held that the terms contrary to and unreasonable application have independent meanings,each of which must be given effect to accord with congressional intent.at.justice read contrary to employ its common which is diametrically different,opposite in character or nature,or mutually opposed,id.at.concluded that a decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in the supreme court cases,or the state court confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of the supreme court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from the court precedent.id.at.
justice found the unreasonable application clause of the aedpa no doubt difficult to define,id.at,but held generally that this provision is contravened if a decision correctly identifies the governing legal rule but applies it unreasonably to the facts of a particular prisoner case.id.at.the unreasonableness of a state court decision must be judged from an objective standard a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.rather,that application must also be unreasonable.id.at.mitchell esparza,d unreasonable application is an objectively unreasonable application of clearly established law as opposed to incorrect.finally,we
