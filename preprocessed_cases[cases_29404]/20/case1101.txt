factual and procedural background 
trial and direct appeal 
at about on june,houston police officer james irby was on motorcycle patrol when he stopped a car for a minor traffic violation.after parking his motorcycle,irby approached the driver side of the car and spoke briefly with the driver,who had already exited the vehicle.irby and the driver,still conversing,walked toward the rear of the car.irby then walked back to the driver side of the car,looked in the car,and spoke briefly with buntion,who was the only passenger.irby then returned to the rear of the car,where he continued speaking with the driver.buntion then exited the car from the passenger side.irby motioned to buntion to get back in the car,but buntion proceeded toward irby.when he was about five feet from irby,he raised a revolver with both hands and fired a shot into irby forehead.irby died almost instantly.the police arrested buntion later that day.
on june,buntion was indicted for the capital murder of a peace officer.judge william harmon of the district court for harris county presided over the trial,appointing three local criminal defense attorneys,phillip scardino,allen tanner,and john keirnan,to represent buntion.based on the unprecedented amount of publicity buntion trial was receiving,judge harmon granted a change of venue,moving the trial to gillespie county.
voir dire began in early november,and was apparently a very slow process by december,the parties had only selected eight jurors.during the voir dire proceedings,the defense at one point ran out of peremptory challenges.judge harmon then granted the defense fifty additional peremptory challenges,an action that the prosecution challenged with a bill of exceptions.the next day,judge harmon reversed himself,withdrawing the remaining additional challenges and granting the defense only four more.the defense objected to the change.
on december,based on judge harmon comments,behavior,and rulings during voir dire,the defense filed its first recusal motion.specifically,buntion alleged that judge harmon made an statement in open court that he was doing god work to see that defendant buntion gets executed judge harmon criticized the texas criminal court of appeals tcca decision in gribble state,en banc relating to the presentation of mitigating evidence in death penalty cases and judge harmon acted capriciously in withdrawing the fifty additional peremptory challenges.buntion also raised additional claims that are not relevant to this appeal.
in a recusal hearing before judge ables of the district court,judge harmon admitted that he made the comment that he was doing god work in seeing the defendant executed but claimed that everyone except buntion realized that it was a joke.he also stated that his criticism of the gribble decision was related to his belief that the opinion provided a lack of guidance to trial judges.finally,judge harmon testified that while he had an opinion as to what the outcome of the case would be,he would not let this prediction affect his trial rulings.judge ables denied the recusal motion.
the court,still in jury selection,recessed from december,until january.on christmas eve,judge harmon called scardino and told him that he could no longer represent buntion.the dismissal of defense counsel was widely reported in the texas media,with judge harmon making statements to the press that he believed defense counsel scardino was attempting to derail the proceedings.on december,judge harmon again contacted the media,saying that scardino would not be removed as buntion counsel.judge harmon made this decision after a state prosecutor and one of buntion other attorneys visited him at home and presented him with a tcca decision prohibiting the arbitrary removal of counsel.the judge stated that he was still convinced that scardino was attempting to sabotage the trial.
when the court reconvened on january,all of the jurors except for the alternates had been selected.defense counsel requested that,in light of the intense media attention given to the trial during the recess,the jurors be questioned regarding their exposure to the reports.judge harmon allowed questioning of those two jurors who indicated that they were aware of the attempted removal of scardino.neither of these jurors were removed,and the alternates were chosen.
on january,the defense again filed a motion to recuse judge harmon and for a mistrial.this recusal motion was based on the granting and withdrawal of the peremptory strikes,the god work comment,and the attempted removal of scardino,along with other bases not relevant to this appeal.the defense motion also alleged that judge harmon placed a postcard depicting judge roy bean,an infamous texas hanging judge,on the bench during portions of jury selection.judge harmon had altered the message on the postcard to read judge bill harmon law west of the perdernales.judge jordan of the district court presided over the hearing on the recusal motion.
during this hearing,judge harmon admitted to contacting the harris county district attorney office to discuss the peremptory challenges.he stated that he had contacted the office on numerous occasions when he had a legal question,but that he had only briefly discussed the issue of the peremptory strikes with the office.he admitted that he placed the judge roy bean postcard on the bench during the voir dire process,but he did not believe that any prospective jurors saw the postcard.he did not state why he placed the postcard on the bench.
defense counsel keirnan also testified about an ex parte meeting between the judge and defense counsel tanner one night at a convenience store.all three of buntion lawyers drove to a convenience store around midnight.after kiernan and scardino had left,judge harmon approached tanner and accompanied him back to his hotel room.at this point in the hearing,because kiernan was testifying,the judge stopped the testimony because of the hearsay nature of relating the discussion between tanner and judge harmon.buntion alleges that judge harmon told tanner that he would accuse the defense attorneys of possessing drugs if they continued to challenge his behavior.judge harmon admitted that he accompanied tanner to his hotel room but denied making any kind of threats.judge jordan denied the recusal motion.
the trial began on january.the phase of the trial lasted until january.at some point during the trial,buntion alleges that a sheriff in the courtroom told a juror wearing a suit that the juror was dressed to kill.this comment was not objected to at the time it was made.
the jury found buntion guilty of capital murder.after listening to the evidence and testimony during the punishment phase of the trial,the jury made the requisite findings on the special issues to sentence buntion to death.the defense filed motions,including one seeking a new trial and the recusal of judge harmon.the recusal motion was denied by judge montgomery of the district court,and judge harmon then denied the motion for a new trial.on direct appeal,buntion again challenged judge harmon impartiality,but his challenge was rejected and his conviction and sentence were affirmed.
state habeas proceedings 
in his state habeas proceedings,buntion again alleged that his due process rights were violated because of judge harmon lack of impartiality.he specifically complained about judge harmon prejudging his guilt,the god work comment,the commentary about the gribble decision,the grant and recision of the peremptory challenges,the display of the postcard,the attempted removal of defense counsel scardino,and the alleged threatening of defense counsel tanner.judge harmon,the state habeas judge found that there was no evidence of bias on the part of the trial judge.he also noted that defense counsel often did not object at trial to the behavior complained about in the habeas petition.judge harmon denied habeas relief.the tcca relied on the findings of the lower court and also denied habeas relief.
federal habeas proceedings 
buntion alleged numerous grounds of error in his federal habeas petition.however,the sole issue before this court is buntion claim that he was denied due process because judge harmon was not impartial.buntion points to the following facts as establishing bias the judge pretrial suggestion that buntion was guilty the god work comment the statements about the gribble decision the display of the postcard the judge ex parte interactions with defense counsel tanner the attempted removal of defense counsel scardino the grant and removal of the additional peremptory challenges and the actions of the trial judge considered as a whole.
the district court interpreted buntion bias argument as being based on a consistent pattern of egregious judicial behavior therefore,the court considered multiple error allegations to determine if judge harmon was biased.the district court held that the state court erred in requiring specific evidence of a reversible error nature in the judicial misconduct because buntion claim is not one of actual bias.instead,reliance on the record alone suffices to establish those apparent biases that rise to the level of a constitutional violation.according to the district court,the state court therefore unreasonably applied federal law by refusing to consider buntion federal claim because of a lack of specific evidence of bias.additionally,the district court found that the state habeas court determination of facts was unreasonable because the state court considered the claims as individual events,rather than as an overarching,flawed trial proceeding.
based on the above determinations,the district court concluded that buntion fulfilled his burden under aedpa.the district court went on to determine whether there was a violation of buntion constitutional rights by viewing each of judge harmon comments and actions in the aggregate.the district court found bias demonstrated by the postcard the god work comment statements indicating that judge harmon had prejudged the facts in the case the comments about the gribble decision judge harmon ex parte interactions with state attorneys on legal matters his pattern of reversing himself at the urging of prosecutors and his interactions with defense counsel.the district court denied habeas relief on all of buntion other claims buntion does not appeal those determinations.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
this court reviews the district court legal determinations and application of aedpa de novo.foster quarterman,cir.factual findings are reviewed for clear error.id.aedpa provides in relevant part that 
an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.
d.a decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than the court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.gardner johnson,cir alterations in original quoting williams taylor,d.where the state court has identified the proper legal principle but unreasonably applied it to the case,that court determination represents an unreasonable application of federal law.id.quoting williams,at.
the question under aedpa is not whether a federal court believes the state court determination was incorrect but whether that determination was substantially higher threshold.schriro landrigan,d citing williams,at.the factual findings of the state habeas court are to be given deference unless they are based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.
in the present case,because the state habeas courts relied heavily on the direct appeal determination by the tcca,ex parte buntion,ex parte buntion,which in turn relied heavily on the legal conclusions of the recusal hearings,buntion state.may,all of these findings are entitled to deference under aedpa.e see also guidry dretke,cir implying that evidence adduced at state suppression hearings is relevant to the aedpa determination.
b.the district court application of aedpa 
on appeal,the director argues multiple points of procedural error,all based on his contention that the district court did not correctly apply aedpa.the first of these challenges is that the district court actually considered buntion bias claims de novo instead of under aedpa stricter standard.additionally,the director urges that the district court applied a more lenient standard when reviewing the state court factual determinations than is required by aedpa.finally,the director contends that the district court incorrectly relied on sources other than clearly established law as determined by the supreme court.
in applying aedpa to this case,the district court determined that the state court application of the law was objectively unreasonable.the district court finding constitutes legal error for two reasons.first,the district court relied on sources outside of clearly established supreme court precedent as required by aedpa.the district court evaluated judge harmon behavior using the texas code of judicial conduct stating that the provisions of the code track the protections guaranteed by the constitution,as well as opinions from the fifth circuit and other circuits.reliance on these sources is misplaced under aedpa,which allows federal review only if the state habeas court rendered a decision contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,federal law as determined by the supreme court.d williams,at.holding that aedpa allows reliance only on the holdings,not dicta,of supreme court opinions.second,even if the district court had considered only supreme court case law,there is not a basis under supreme court precedent for finding that the state court ultimate determination is objectively unreasonable.see infra part.
finally,it should be noted that the district court determined that the state court factual findings were also unreasonable.see d.this is a clear legal error because very few factual determinations are in dispute even for those that are,such as whether or not judge harmon threatened defense counsel,buntion would be required to present clear and convincing evidence that the state court factual determinations were incorrect.id.at e.buntion has not done so.the district court found that the factual findings were unreasonable because the state court considered buntion claims of judicial bias as individual,secluded events.while it arguably may have been legal error for the state court to analyze the bias claims in isolation rather than cumulatively there is no unreasonable factual determination that the district court relies on to justify its finding that buntion has satisfied d.therefore,this determination is incorrect as well,although because the facts are basically agreed on,this error does not have much effect on the outcome of this case.
judicial bias analysis 
having determined that the district court improperly applied aedpa,we now analyze buntion claim under the appropriate aedpa standard.
defendants in the american judicial system have the right to a fair trial,and part of this right is fulfilled by a judicial officer who impartially presides over the trial.see,bracy gramley,d.however,most questions concerning a judge qualifications to hear a case are not constitutional ones,because the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment establishes a constitutional floor,not a uniform standard.id.at.a judge will,however,violate a defendant due process
