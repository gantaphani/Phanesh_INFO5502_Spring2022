background

substantive facts 
the michigan court of appeals outlined the facts underlying johnson convictions as follows 
defendant convictions arise from the fatal shooting of carlos davis and shooting assaults of james mathis,larry lewis and robert richards outside a dance hall in hamtramck on march.the shootings occurred after the victims and several other persons left the hall after a large brawl broke out among partygoers.only two persons,robert richards and damon ramsuer,reported seeing the shooter.
richards told the police that he saw the shooter,and he gave a detailed description of his clothing.the police obtained photographs taken by a hired photographer before the fight broke out,and showed the photographs to richards,who identified defendant as the shooter from one of these photographs.richards identified johnson at the preliminary examination,but richards was killed before defendant trial.his preliminary examination testimony was read to the jury at trial.
the police also interviewed ramsuer,who signed a statement declaring that he saw the shooter.ramsuer also identified defendant from the party photographs.ramsuer failed to appear for the preliminary examination.when he testified at trial,he denied seeing the shooter,denied telling the police that he saw the shooter,and denied making an identification.the prosecutor impeached him with the signed statement,and with the testimony of the officer who took the statement 
at the start of trial,the prosecutor moved to close the courtroom to spectators during the testimony of three prosecution witnesses,mathis,lewis,and ramsuer,who were afraid to testify publicly.the prosecutor explained that two other prosecution witnesses had been killed under suspicious circumstances richards was killed in his bed,and elvin robinson was killed before the preliminary examination.defense counsel agreed to exclude spectators for these witnesses,but asked the trial court not to do so in the jury presence.the trial court never removed anyone from the courtroom,but instead instructed defendant relatives not to arrive before on the day that mathis,lewis,and ramsuer testified,and to remain outside the courtroom until permitted to enter.
following his conviction,johnson filed a motion for a new trial claiming denial of the right to a public trial.in denying the motion,the trial court noted that counsel agreed to the suggested closure and that counsel asked members of johnson family not to appear in the courtroom until after the following day.after exhausting this claim and an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in the state courts,johnson filed a petition for habeas relief in federal district court pursuant to.among other claims,johnson claimed that his right to a public trial was violated and that counsel was ineffective for failing to assert that right.in the district court opinion denying habeas relief,the court held that johnson claim was procedurally defaulted,providing the following explanation 
i n this case,respondent procedural default argument is not based upon defendant failure to object,it is based upon his consent,through counsel,to the courtroom closure.respondent argues that this acquiescence constituted a waiver of this claim.the court finds that petitioner waived his right to a public trial by his acquiescence,through his attorney,to the closure.
at.the district court also explained,in the alternative,that the claim would fail on the merits 
the court finds that the state court conclusion was a reasonable application of waller.while the trial court findings could have been more clearly articulated on the record,it was,as observed by the michigan court of appeals,a reasonable conclusion that the suspicious deaths of two witnesses had,in the trial court opinion,sparked enough fear in three witnesses and sufficiently placed their at risk to override petitioner right to a public trial.the trial court limited the closure to just three witnesses and ensured that the closure would not be evident to the jury.considering these circumstances,the court finds that the state court application of the waller factors was not unreasonable.
with respect to johnson ineffective assistance of counsel claim,the michigan court of appeals concluded that trial counsel acquiescence was neither objectively unreasonable,nor.at.the district court agreed,holding that because the decision to close the courtroom for a limited time was not an unreasonable application of waller petitioner has failed to establish that the failure to object to the closure fell outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance as required by strickland washington,d.at.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
because johnson filed his habeas petition in,his petition is governed by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa.see benge johnson,cir.under the aedpa,johnson may obtain relief only if he can show that the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,d,or that the state court relied on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding,d.in reviewing a district court decision to grant or deny habeas relief,this court reviews questions of fact under a clearly erroneous standard and questions of law de novo.carson burke,cir.
johnson appeal presents two interrelated issues whether his sixth amendment right to a public trial was violated when the court closed the courtroom during the testimony of three prosecution witnesses and whether trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to object to the closure.
the sixth amendment to the united states constitution guarantees that,i n all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial.const.amend.vi see also in re oliver.holding this right to be binding on the states through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.the requirement of a public trial is for the benefit of the accused that the public may see he is fairly dealt with and not unjustly condemned,and that the presence of interested spectators may keep his triers keenly alive to a sense of their responsibility and to the importance of their functions.waller georgia,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted.because of the great,though intangible,societal loss that flows from closing courthouse doors,the denial of a right to a public trial is considered a structural error for which prejudice is presumed.id.at.quoting people jones.in light of these concerns,to justify the closure of a courtroom over the objections of a defendant,the party seeking to close a public hearing must advance an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced,the closure must be no broader than necessary to protect that interest,the trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding,and it must make findings adequate to support the closure.id.at.applying the test set forth in superior court,d,to a sixth amendment public trial claim 
in the instant case,the prosecution moved to close the courtroom during the testimony of three prosecution witnesses.the prosecutor informed the court that two witnesses had been killed under very suspicious grounds near the time of the preliminary examination and that a number of the remaining witnesses were afraid to testify at trial.at.the trial court expressed concerns regarding the closure,stating that the prosecutor was treading on some very dangerous ground,and inquired w ell,if these persons are essentially being protected what is their concern about at.nonetheless,defense counsel acquiesced to the closure,stating 
judge,let me make this very simple.johnson and i have discussed this issue since the prosecution brought it to my attention.if the court wants to do that,close the courtroom,we do really have any objection to it for those certain witnesses.the only thing i concerned about is that we do it well away from the jury that either we excuse,you know,so it does look like it some weird circumstance.i mean,i do have any problem.
at.the court accepted defense counsel position without making further inquiry or findings,and defense counsel instructed members of johnson family to remain outside of the courtroom during the testimony at issue.
johnson concedes that his attorney acquiesced to the closure,but argues that because the right to a public trial is a fundamental constitutional right and a structural guarantee,his attorney statements were insufficient to constitute waiver.while we agree that the right to a public trial is an important structural right,it is also one that can be waived when a defendant fails to object to the closure of the courtroom,assuming the justification for closure is sufficient to overcome the public and media first amendment right to an open and public trial proceeding.see freytag commissioner,d t he sixth amendment right to a trial that is public,provide s benefits to the entire society more important than many structural guarantees but if the litigant does not assert it in a timely fashion,he is foreclosed.collecting cases see also peretz united states,d citing levine united states,d.because johnson failed to object to the closure,his claim is procedurally defaulted unless he can show cause and prejudice for the default.coleman thompson,d.
the doctrine of procedural default provides 
in all cases in which a state prisoner has defaulted his federal claims in state court pursuant to an independent and adequate state procedural rule,federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law,or demonstrate that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.
id.here,it is undisputed that johnson failed to make a contemporaneous objection to the closure,which is required by an independent and adequate state procedural rule.united states frady,d.it is also evident that the last state court from which johnson sought review invoked the state procedural rule as a basis for its decision to reject review of the claim.see at state court of appeals stated that johnson expressly waived his right by assenting to the trial court decision to close the courtroom during the three witnesses testimony.citations omitted.thus,the district court found that johnson claim was denied based on an independent and adequate state procedural rule 
under these circumstances,federal habeas review of johnson public trial claim is barred unless johnson can demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law,or demonstrate that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.coleman,at.johnson argues that he has demonstrated cause for the default because his counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the closure of the trial.consequently,both of johnson claims on appeal turn on whether his counsel was constitutionally ineffective 
in order to establish ineffective assistance of counsel,a defendant must demonstrate that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,and that the deficient performance prejudiced his defense.strickland,at.in the instant case,we agree that defense counsel failure to object to the closure of johnson trial may have fallen below an objective standard of reasonableness as required in strickland.courts have been clear that while the closure of a trial may be justified in certain cases,s uch circumstances will be rare and the balance of interests must be struck with special care.waller,at.see also,at.holding that a closure may be justified only by an overriding interest based on findings that closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest owens united states,cir holding that the failure to object to the courtroom closure for a day of jury selection deprived defendant of a substantial fair trial right.counsel failure to object to the closure of the courtroom during the testimony of three key prosecution witnesses,arguably the most important phase of johnson trial,denied johnson a substantial fair trial right and counsel should have approached the issue with caution.
given the absence of findings by the trial court,it is difficult for us to discern whether it was necessary for the courtroom to be closed to all spectators for the testimony at issue.however,on the record before us,we are far from convinced that this was the rare circumstance where closure was justified,or that the closure was no broader than necessary to protect the interest advanced by the state under waller,at.while the prosecution made general allegations that two prosecution robinson and robert been murdered,johnson stresses that another individual was charged with the stabbing of elvin robinson,and the prosecution offered no proof that johnson or any member of johnson family was involved in the death of those individuals.see waller,at.requiring the party seeking the closure to provide specific evidence of an overriding interest that was likely to be prejudiced.the prosecution presented no witnesses or evidence in support of the closure,and did not point to any incidents in which the witnesses at issue had been threatened or otherwise contacted by any member of johnson family.in fact,both the court and the prosecution acknowledged that the request was on thin or dangerous ground notwithstanding these circumstances,defense counsel made no effort to limit the closure to less than three witnesses,or to ensure that the excluded individuals be limited to those individuals who might be perceived as a threat to the witnesses.under these circumstances,defense counsel acquiescence to the closure appears unjustified 
to be sure,counsel decision would be owed deference if it could be viewed as strategic,and counsel may have been privy to information of which we are unaware.see strickland,at.explaining that a defendant must overcome the presumption that,under the circumstances,the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.for example,defense counsel may have known that johnson family members had a history of contact with the relevant witnesses or he may have known more about the nature of the alleged witness killings than the record revealed.howeve
