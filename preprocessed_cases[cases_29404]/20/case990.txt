waine timely sought appeal of the district court order.as previously stated,we granted waine a certificate of appealability with respect to his claim that his counsel was ineffective based on his failure to object to a jury instruction defining the government burden of proof in regard to reasonable doubt using willing to act language without any indication that the evidence had to be sufficient to make one willing to act without hesitation or without reservation.we denied waine a certificate of appealability and dismissed his appeal with respect to all other issues.
the only claim before us is waine claim that his counsel was ineffective based on his failure to object to a jury instruction defining the government burden of proof in regard to reasonable doubt using willing to act language without any indication that the evidence had to be sufficient to make one willing to act without hesitation or without reservation.
at waine trial,the trial court instructed the jury as follows regarding reasonable doubt 
the burden of proof in this case,as in all criminal cases,rests upon the state.here the state has a different and greater burden than does a plaintiff in a civil case.in the latter,the plaintiff must prove his case by a mere preponderance of the evidence.in a criminal case,the state must prove every element of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty.the jury must not assume that the accused is guilty merely because he is being prosecuted and because criminal charges have been proffered against him.he comes into court presumed to be innocent,and this status remains with him throughout the trial.
the plea of not guilty is all the denial of the commission of the crime that a defendant need make.the state has the burden of proving him to be guilty by evidence which produces an abiding conviction of guilt in the minds of the jury beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty.
now,this does not mean that the state has the burden of proving to a mathematical certainty that he is guilty,and that there is no other possibility beyond the evidence than that of guilt.if the evidence is of such a character as to persuade the jury of the truth of the charges with the same force that would be sufficient to persuade a member of the jury to act on that conviction of truth in his own important business affairs or important affairs in his own life or career,then the jury may conclude the state has met the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty.
the verdict must represent the considered judgment of each juror.in order to return a verdict it is necessary that each juror agree thereto.your verdict must be unanimous.
if,after consideration of the whole case,any juror should entertain a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the defendant,it is the duty of the juror so entertaining such doubt not to vote for a conviction.
for reasons that follow,we affirm the district court denial of federal habeas relief on waine claim of ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to counsel failure to object to the trial court jury instruction defining the government burden of proof in regard to reasonable doubt using willing to act language without any indication that the evidence had to be sufficient to make one willing to act without hesitation or without reservation.
