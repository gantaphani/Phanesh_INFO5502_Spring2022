john graves was convicted of first degree murder in january.his conviction was affirmed by the iowa court of appeals.he was later denied postconviction relief,and that decision was also affirmed by the iowa court of appeals.graves then petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court,arguing that his counsel was ineffective for failing to obtain a toxicology expert to test and explicate the results of a blood sample graves submitted hours after the murder,failing to object to prosecutorial misconduct that occurred during the state closing argument,failing to preserve error on an unlawful jury instruction,and failing to present a expert at trial.the district denied the writ,and graves appealed.we affirm.
graves was released early from work on july.once home,graves drank most of a bottle of red wine.he then went to a bar where he drank more.later,in the early morning hours of july,two police officers observed graves at a convenience store with a known prostitute,darlene avant.graves purchased food for himself and avant at the convenience store,and he also made cash withdrawals from automated teller machines that night.
avant accompanied graves to his home.the two began to engage in sexual activity until graves,who had a girlfriend at the time,was stricken with remorse.graves contends that when he asked avant to leave,she lunged at him with a knife.he acknowledges that she was naked and seated on the floor at that time.in,he claims,graves struck her in the head with a dumbbell.after striking avant in the head multiple times,graves believed she could not breathe.he took the knife avant employed in her alleged attack and he used it to cut a hole in her attempting an emergency tracheotomy.the knife wound was inches deep it missed avant trachea,cut her jugular vein,and impacted her vertebra.
graves then loaded avant naked body into the trunk of his car,drove to a relatively secluded location,and discarded the body near the road.at some point,he also tried to use bleach to remove avant blood from the carpet in his home.when graves girlfriend inquired about the stains on the carpet later that day,he told her he had spilled red wine.
later on july,passersby found avant naked body where graves had discarded it.graves was questioned by police the same day,and he initially denied knowing avant.later,graves admitted to meeting avant and causing her death.
graves was charged with first degree murder.he asserted defenses of justification and diminished capacity due to alcohol intoxication.at trial,defense counsel marshaled evidence of graves intoxication on the night of the murder,but did not introduce scientific evidence of graves blood alcohol content.the court provided the jury with a general verdict form,allowing the jury to convict graves of first degree murder on either of two theories.the instruction allowed the jury to convict graves if he a willfully,deliberately,and with premeditation killed avant or b caused avant death while participating in the forcible felony of willful injury.the jury found graves guilty of murder in the first degree,and the district court sentenced graves to a mandatory term of life in prison.
graves appealed.along with other arguments,graves contended that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to call an expert to testify regarding graves blood alcohol level following his arrest.the iowa court of appeals affirmed the conviction,and the supreme court of iowa denied further review.
subsequently,graves filed an application for postconviction relief in iowa district court.in support of his claim for postconviction relief,graves argued that his trial counsel was ineffective by,inter alia,failing to object to prosecutorial misconduct that occurred during closing argument when the prosecutor referred to graves as having lied at trial.graves also asserted that his counsel on direct appeal was ineffective for the same reasons.the postconviction trial court rejected graves claims,and graves appealed.of the claims argued to the postconviction trial court,graves pursued only the claim on appeal.in addition,graves asserted for the first time that his counsel at trial,direct appeal,and postconviction relief proceedings were each ineffective for failing to object to parts of the state closing argument.the iowa court of appeals affirmed the state district court denial of postconviction relief.the supreme court of iowa denied further review.
graves filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.he argued that his trial counsel was ineffective when counsel failed to object to prosecutorial misconduct that occurred during closing argument when the prosecutor referred to graves as having lied,to object to the instruction using willful injury as the predicate felony,to present an intoxication defense at trial,and to present a expert at trial.
before resolution of the petition for a writ of habeas corpus,graves moved the federal district court to provide for expert witness fees and to allow an evidentiary hearing.he requested fees for toxicology and blood spatter experts.the district court denied both requests.the court held that an intoxication expert would not have changed the outcome of the trial.the court also held that the claim based on the failure to obtain a blood spatter expert was procedurally defaulted.
after a hearing on the petition,the district court rejected each of graves claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.graves appeals to this court.

graves argues that the iowa court of appeals rejection of his direct appeal was based upon an unreasonable determination of a material fact,entitling him to relief under d.specifically,graves points out that the iowa court of appeals rejected his claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to have an expert test and explicate the results of blood samples taken hours after the murder,based on the court mistaken belief that a state criminalist had testified that graves had alcohol in his system totaling grams per milliliter.iowa graves,wl,iowa.may.graves also continues to argue that he should be allowed to acquire and introduce expert testimony supporting his intoxication defense.the state argues that the first argument is procedurally barred and the second is meritless.we agree.
the authority of federal courts to entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in state custody is limited by.one limitation currently codified in prescribes that a n application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted unless it appears that the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the state.b a.comity dictates that when a prisoner alleges that his continued confinement for a state court conviction violates federal law,the state courts should have the first opportunity to review this claim and provide any necessary relief.boerckel.
graves did not give the state courts an opportunity to review his claim that the iowa court of appeals decision was based upon an unreasonable determination of the facts in violation of d.on direct appeal,he argued that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to retain an expert to test a sample of blood taken hours after the murder.in the course of rejecting graves argument,the appellate court made the statement about graves blood alcohol content.graves subsequently applied to the iowa supreme court for further discretionary review of the iowa court of appeals decision but did not mention his counsel performance with respect to his diminished capacity failing to take issue with the blood alcohol content statement.subsequently,graves applied for postconviction relief but again failed to take issue with the iowa court of appeals statement regarding his blood alcohol content.similarly,graves again overlooked the issue on appeal of the denial of postconviction relief.plainly,the iowa state courts did not have a fair opportunity to review the claim centered on the iowa court of appeals factual statement regarding graves blood alcohol content consequently,graves is barred from bringing the claim in this court.
graves also continues to argue that he should be allowed to acquire and introduce expert testimony supporting his intoxication defense.graves raised arguably comparable issues in iowa state court,arguing that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to test blood samples allegedly taken from him hours after the murder and for failing to retain an expert to explicate the results of any such test.we assume,without deciding,that his requests to develop expert testimony are sufficient to advance that ineffective assistance of counsel claim in this court,but we conclude that the state court adjudication of that issue is not contrary to clearly established federal law.
as is,to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim,graves must establish that his counsel failed to perform an essential duty and that the failure prejudiced graves.strickland washington.to demonstrate prejudice,graves must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.considering the other evidence presented to the jury,we see no reasonable probability that the result would have been different had trial counsel secured an expert to test the blood and opine on the results.
graves testified that he drank most of a bottle of wine between approximately and and then drank an estimated eight beers and three shots of whisky at the bar before it closed at multiple eyewitnesses,including two police officers and the bartender,testified to graves demeanor in the early morning hours.the jury heard graves testify about the night in question,and they witnessed his ability to remember certain details of the evening along with his inability to recall other details.
the record is unclear as to when authorities obtained the blood sample that graves argues should have been independently tested.nonetheless,the sample could not have been drawn until after noon on the day following the night of avant death.thus,at best,any expert would be testifying about the hypothetical effects of graves estimated blood alcohol level.in the face of the record evidence,there is no reasonable probability that the result of graves trial would have been different had counsel proffered the requested expert testimony 
graves also argues that his counsel provided ineffective assistance when counsel failed to object to prosecutorial misconduct that graves believes occurred during closing arguments.graves argues that the prosecution made four improper statements during closing arguments now,defense counsel is going to say it is too embarrassing to call the police when you got a prostitute in your house.ladies and gentlemen,that so weak.trial tr.vol.iv at.ladies and gentlemen,consider what he does after he kills her.everything he does is an attempt to cover up.he cleans up so that he does get caught he lies to his girlfriend.he lies to the police.and i submit he lies to you,ladies and gentlemen.trial tr.vol.iv at.you know,ladies and gentlemen,and i going to tell you right now,you ca believe a word this defendants sic says.he a convicted felon,and he got an interest in this case.trial tr.vol.iv at.he comes home and cleans up,tries to clean up the blood,lies about it,does all those things.and do you think he is going to come in here and tell you the truth no.he did tell you the truth.trial tr.vol.iv at.
graves first complained of these statements in his postconviction relief proceedings.the state postconviction relief district court held that two of the statements were improper,but that the statements were not so prejudicial that graves was denied a fair trial.the postconviction appellate court agreed.graves then filed his federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus which generates this appeal.the federal district court held that the record did not show sufficient prejudice to establish a claim of prosecutorial misconduct under federal law.
we lack authority to grant the writ based on a reexamination of the iowa court of appeals determination that no prosecutorial misconduct occurred under state law d middleton roper,cir,cert.denied.consequently,trial counsel could not have been ineffective for failing to raise a state law claim with no merit,see dyer united states,cir holding claim of ineffective assistance of counsel fails when underlying claim rejected as meritless,and our analysis is limited to a resolution of whether trial counsel was ineffective in failing to raise a prosecutorial misconduct claim based on federal constitutional law.
a test determines whether prosecutorial misconduct has occurred first,the prosecutor conduct or remarks must have been improper,and second,the remarks or conduct must have prejudicially affected the defendant substantial rights by depriving the defendant of a fair trial.united states white,cir.even if one or more of the comments was improper,reversal is appropriate only when we determine that the jury verdict reasonably could have been affected by the improper comment.united states peyro,cir.thus,if graves can not show the comments deprived him of a fair trial,we need not decide whether they were improper we have looked to three factors to determine whether prosecutorial misconduct deprived the defendant of a fair trial.united states beeks,cir.first,we consider the cumulative effect of the misconduct.second,we examine the strength of the properly admitted evidence of the defendant guilt.last,we review the curative actions taken by the district court.id.
the cumulative effect of the alleged misconduct could not have been great.first,defense counsel had himself pointed out in his opening statement that graves lied in an attempt to conceal his role in avant death.additionally,before closing arguments,the evidence at trial had already destroyed graves credibility.the evidence showed that graves initially told police that he did not know about avant death,then changed his story.the jury also already knew that graves falsely told his girlfriend that he spilled red wine on the carpet.and graves testimony regarding how many times he struck avant with the dumbbell was directly contradicted by a government evidence technician and demonstrative evidence addressing blood spatter.finally,there are only four challenged statements,and each took place during closing arguments.thus,there was no improper prosecutorial theme pervading the entire trial.see anderson goeke,cir noting particular importance of considering the frequency and pervasiveness of improper comments.
the cumulative effect of any misconduct is also outweighed by the strength of the properly admitted evidence of graves guilt.graves admitted that he caused avant death,and his defense focused on theories of diminished capacity and justification.graves principal argument that the prosecutorial misconduct prejudiced his defense is that the success of his defenses turned on the jury favorable evaluation of his credibility,and the misconduct was directly aimed at destroying that credibility.with regard to graves diminished capacity defense and inversely,with regard to proof of graves specific intent to assault and murder avant,numerous witnesses testified as to what alcoholic beverages graves consumed and his resulting demeanor.those witnesses included two police officers and a bartender.graves was able to drive,engage in commercial transactions,and operate an atm.he also chose right over wrong when he ended the sexual encounter with avant due to feelings of guilt.finally,the nature of the weapons and the reckless character and manner of the assault suggested his intent.see united states warbonnet,cir quoting people nickolopoulos.
the evidence likewise strongly discounted graves justification defense.avant was naked and seated on the floor when she was repeatedly struck in the head with a dumbbell,an unlikely time for the smaller woman to attempt to stab graves with a knife.avant also suffered a inch stab wound to her neck.whi
