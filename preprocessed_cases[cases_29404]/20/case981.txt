juanita pope reid seeks review of a district court order denying her motion for reconsideration of an order denying her application for habeas corpus relief.we hold that reid must obtain a certificate of appealability as a prerequisite to our consideration of her claims.see c west supp.in addition,we grant a certificate of appealability as to the only claim that reid seeks to appeal,vacate the decision of the district court,and remand with instructions.
in november,reid appeared in a virginia state court and pled guilty to larceny.the court accepted her plea,revoked the probation she was serving for a prior offense,and sentenced her to a total of six years years for the probation violation and two years for the new offense with an additional three years suspended.reid ensuing appeals were unsuccessful,and she did not seek collateral review in state court.
in july,reid filed an application for habeas corpus relief pursuant to west supp.the district court dismissed this application without prejudice for failure to exhaust state remedies.
reid subsequently filed a second habeas application.after the commonwealth filed its answer,however,reid moved to withdraw her application without prejudice so that she could pursue a state habeas action.the district court denied this motion and dismissed reid application with prejudice.
the district court construed reid application to present three claims 
petitioner did not understand the nature of the charges and the consequences of pleading guilty her attorney led her to believe she would only receive a ten month sentence.
petitioner conviction was obtained by the unconstitutional failure of the prosecution to disclose evidence to petitioner,specifically that no presentence report was prepared despite the judge request for one.
petitioner conviction was obtained by a violation of her privilege against when the judge heard evidence from the probation officer concerning her participation in treatment for substance abuse and kleptomania.
the court determined that claims and were procedurally defaulted and that claim,the ineffective assistance claim,was meritless in light of reid representations at the plea hearing that she was entering the plea voluntarily,that nobody forced her into entering the plea,that she understood the maximum penalty for the crime and that she was satisfied with her attorney performance.id.at.
reid then moved for reconsideration,asking the district court to vacate dismissal with prejudice prayerfully asking to be without prejudice,and to also vacate judgement of denial of withdraw a l of petition based on petitioner mental health issues.id.at.reid further asked the court to grant also the remand for resentencing.id.the court construed this as a motion for relief from the judgment under federal rule of civil procedure b and denied the motion.reid now appeals this order.
the initial question before us is whether reid needs a certificate of appealability coa to appeal the denial of her rule b motion.under c a,a coa is required in order for a habeas applicant to obtain appellate review of the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a state court.thus,we must decide whether the order denying reid rule b motion was the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding.
to interpret this statute,we begin by examining its plain language.see ramey director,cir.we must give the relevant terms their common and ordinary meaning.mapoy carroll,cir internal quotation marks omitted.and,to the extent that there is any ambiguity in these terms,we must consider other indicia of congressional intent,such as the legislative history,see concrete pipe prods.of,constr.laborers pension trust,d.it is also appropriate in cases of ambiguity to consider which interpretation of the statute would best give effect to the underlying legislative purpose.see united states goines,cir.
the final order 
we begin with the phrase the final order.it is undisputed that an order denying relief under rule b is a final order for purposes of appellate review.see united states holland,cir.reid maintains,however,that the order denying her rule b motion was not the final order in this case.she asserts that because congress used the definite article the,rather than a broader term like a or any,c applies only to the order denying relief on her habeas application.
reid is correct about the meaning of the word the.see webster third new int l dictionary stating that the word the is used to indicate that a following noun refers to someone or something that is unique.thus,because congress used the definite article the,we conclude that,in every habeas proceeding,there is only one order subject to the requirements of c.
proceeding 
the conclusion we have just stated does not end our inquiry.instead,we must determine whether the order denying reid rule b motion was issued within the same habeas corpus proceeding as the order denying her application.we conclude that it was not on the contrary,a single habeas action may embrace multiple habeas proceedings,and more than one of these proceedings may give rise to a final order subject to the coa requirement.
the term proceeding is indeterminate 
the word proceeding may be used synonymously with action or suit to describe the entire course of an action at law or suit in equity from the issuance of the writ or filing of the complaint until the entry of a final judgment,or may be used to describe any act done by authority of a court of law and every step required to be taken in any cause by either party.
black law dictionary ed see also black law dictionary ed defining proceeding alternatively as t he regular and orderly progression of a lawsuit,including all acts and events between the time of commencement and the entry of judgment and as a n act or step that is part of a larger action.but even under the more expansive definitions quoted above,a proceeding terminates with a judgment.since rule b motions are used to challenge final judgments,a proceeding involving a rule b motion is necessarily separate from the proceeding giving rise to the underlying judgment.holland,at noting that the denial of a rule b motion is appealable as a separate final order.
the language of rule b confirms this understanding of the word proceeding.the rule allows a party to seek relief from a final judgment,order,or proceeding.b emphasis added.this indicates that filing a rule b motion initiates a new proceeding that is separate from the proceeding from which the movant seeks relief or,as in this case,the proceeding giving rise to the judgment from which the movant seeks relief.
to the extent that any ambiguity remains,it may be resolved through examination of procedures.congress enacted c in its current form as part of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa.before the aedpa,provided in pertinent part 
an appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding where the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a state court,unless the justice or judge who rendered the order or a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of probable cause.
west.although the aedpa substantially revised this provision,it retained the phrase relevant to our analysis the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding.because congress did not change this phrase,we presume that congress intended to ratify any settled judicial interpretation regarding the scope of the certification requirement.see fogerty fantasy,d.it is therefore of great significance that courts consistently required a certificate of probable cause cpc when reviewing orders denying rule b motions in habeas actions.see lynch blodgett,cir per curiam order see also waye townley,cir per curiam noting that habeas applicant was granted cpc for appeal from rule b order.
habeas corpus proceeding 
there is one question remaining under c if an order denying rule b constitutes the final order in a discrete proceeding,is that rule b proceeding a habeas corpus proceeding for purposes of c we hold that it is.
a rule b proceeding,however distinct from the underlying proceeding,can never be entirely independent of the underlying proceeding after all,if not for that underlying proceeding,there would be no judgment to give rise to a rule b motion.thus,it is appropriate to treat a rule b proceeding as a habeas corpus proceeding one of multiple proceedings within the larger habeas action.
this conclusion is supported by supreme court precedent applying the rules governing habeas proceedings to rule b motions challenging habeas judgments.see,pitchess davis,d per curiam applying the exhaustion requirement to a claim presented in a rule b motion seeking additional relief beyond the judgment in the original habeas proceeding.we therefore hold that litigation relating to a rule b motion in a habeas action constitutes a habeas corpus proceeding and that the order denying rule b relief is the final order in such a proceeding.
policy considerations 
for the reasons stated above,we are persuaded that c requires that a habeas petitioner obtain a coa in order to appeal the denial of a rule b motion.nevertheless,in the interest of thoroughness,we will address reid policy arguments against requiring a coa in this circumstance.
we note initially that the purpose of the coa requirement is to enable the courts of appeals to winnow out frivolous appeals in habeas cases.see barefoot estelle,d explaining the purpose of the cpc requirement see also slack mcdaniel,d noting that the aedpa largely codified the standards set forth in barefoot.as the second circuit has noted,it would be rather anomalous for congress to have intended to screen out unmeritorious appeals from denials of habeas corpus petitions and yet not have wished to apply this same screen to b motions seeking to revisit those denials.kellogg strack,cir per curiam 
reid argues that there is no anomaly in declining to apply c to appeals from rule b orders because rule b motions are already subject to threshold requirements designed to screen out frivolous claims.we disagree.
rule b provides in pertinent part 
on motion and upon such terms as are just,the court may relieve a party or a party legal representative from a final judgment,order,or proceeding for the following reasons mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under rule b fraud whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic,misrepresentation,or other misconduct of an adverse party the judgment is void the judgment has been satisfied,released,or discharged,or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated,or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application or any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.
motions within each category are subject to various limitations.for example,motions under rule b,or must be made within a year after entry of the order being challenged.see.b.also,a motion under rule b may not be granted absent extraordinary circumstances.valero terrestrial paige,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
we decline to treat these limitations on rule b review as equivalent to the restrictions imposed by c.neither the rule itself nor the cases interpreting it require a b movant to satisfy the primary prerequisite for issuance of a,making a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.c.moreover,as noted above,the purpose of the coa requirement is to screen out frivolous appeals.in contrast,the limits on rule b review are designed to protect the finality of judgments.see,schultz butcher,cir noting that district court must consider interests of finality in resolving motion pursuant to rule b.that these interests are not interchangeable is demonstrated by the fact that congress requires a coa in habeas cases even though finality concerns figure prominently in habeas litigation,see calderon thompson,d.we therefore conclude that,notwithstanding the limits on rule b review,requiring a coa for an appeal from a rule b motion is necessary to achieve the congressional purposes underlying.
having concluded that reid needs a coa to obtain review of the order denying her rule b motion,we now consider whether a coa should issue.reid rule b motion apparently raised two claims that the district court erred in refusing to allow her to withdraw her habeas application the withdrawal claim,and that the state court abused its discretion in imposing a sentence the sentencing claim on appeal,however,reid seeks review only of the withdrawal claim.because this claim is procedural in nature,we may not grant a coa unless reid establishes a that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the rule b motion states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and b that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.slack,at.
in order to apply the first of the slack requirements,we must determine where to look to assess whether reid has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.the withdrawal claim itself is not constitutional in nature.moreover,this claim is entirely distinct from the sentencing claim,because,even if we ultimately grant relief as to the withdrawal claim and remand this case to the district court,our remand would not open the door to reconsideration of the sentencing claim.it therefore would not make sense to consider the sentencing claim in determining whether reid withdrawal claim makes the showing required by c.c requiring that coa specify issues for review.thus,if we were to look only at reid rule b motion,we would find no constitutional claim to support issuance of a coa.
we hold,however,that we should not look exclusively at the motion.instead,we may also examine the underlying habeas application.see morris horn,cir holding,that a court may grant a coa for review of a rule b order based on a credible showing that the district court denial of rule b relief was in error combined with a showing that the underlying habeas petition alleges a denial of a constitutional right.
in reviewing reid habeas application to determine whether she has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,we look only at those claims that are not distinct from her procedural claim,as we have used that term above.in other words,we look at the claims that the district court may reexamine if we conclude that its procedural ruling was erroneous if a particular substantive claim could not form the basis for relief on remand following vacatur of a challenged procedural ruling,then we must disregard that claim in determining whether to grant a coa with respect to the procedural ruling 
applying this principle here is straightforward,because the procedural ruling at denial of rule b relief on the withdrawal all of the claims in the underlying application.if that procedural decision was erroneous,then reid may be entitled to have the judgment as to all of her substantive claims changed from a dismissal with prejudice to a dismissal without prejudice.we may therefore consider any of the claims in reid application in answering the first question of the slack inquiry.
furthermore,it is sufficient for reid to make the requisite showing with respect to any one of the claims in her application.in other words,if any one of reid claims presents a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,then we must conclude that the first slack requirement is satisfied,and we need not examine the other claims in the application.see jefferson welborn,cir holding that the first slack prong was satisfied because a t least some of the applicant claims alleged the denial of a constitutional right.
following this approach,we hold that the first requirement of slack is satisfied because reid ineffective assistance of counsel claim makes a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.the district court denied relief on this claim based on reid statements at her plea colloquy.however,nothing in those statements is inconsistent with reid allegation that her attorney advised
