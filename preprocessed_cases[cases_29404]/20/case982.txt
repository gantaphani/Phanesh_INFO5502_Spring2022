in february,james roane,cory johnson,and richard tipton were convicted in the eastern district of virginia for an array of criminal activity,including several capital murders,arising out of operations in and near richmond.each received at least one death sentence for his crimes,plus various terms of imprisonment.after unavailing direct appeals to this court,united states tipton,cir,roane,johnson,and tipton the defendants sought habeas corpus relief in the district court.the government sought summary judgment on their claims,which the district court awarded,except for two claims raised by roane.see united states tipton.may,the opinion.after discovery proceedings and an evidentiary hearing on roane remaining two claims,the court granted relief on his sixth amendment claim of ineffective assistance of counsel iac claim,vacating roane convictions and sentences relating to the murder of douglas moody.see united states roane.may,the roane opinion.finally,the court rejected roane claim of actual innocence of the moody murder.id.
we are now presented with four separate appeals,which we have consolidated.in appeal,the government appeals the district court award of relief to roane on his sixth amendment iac claim.in,roane the court rulings in favor of the government on certain of his other claims.and in and,johnson and tipton appeal the award of summary judgment to the government on certain of their claims.as explained below,we affirm the rulings in favor of the government in,and,and we reverse the award of relief to roane in.
in our comprehensive opinion rejecting the defendants direct appeals,judge phillips aptly summarized the relevant facts underlying the prosecution of johnson,tipton,and roane.see tipton,at.because we are unable to improve on that summary,it is set forth in haec verba 
recounted in summary form and in the light most favorable to the government,the core evidence revealed the following.tipton,roane,and cory johnson were principal partners in a substantial conspiracy that lasted from through july of.the conspiracy operations began in trenton,new jersey where johnson and tipton,both from new york city,became members.in august of,the conspiracy expanded its operations to richmond,virginia where roane joined the conspiracy in november of.the operation came to an end on june,when police confiscated a large quantity of crack cocaine and firearms.in late,the conspiracy operations were expanded from the central gardens area of richmond to a second area in richmond called newtowne.
during the period of the conspiracy operation,its partners,including appellants,obtained wholesale quantities of powdered cocaine from suppliers in new york city,converted it by cooking it into crack cocaine,then packaged it,divided it among themselves,and distributed it through a network of street level dealers,workers.typically,the appellants and their other partners in the conspiracy operations took of the proceeds realized from sales of their product.
over a short span of time in early,tipton,cory johnson,and roane were variously implicated in the murders of ten persons within the richmond in relation to their operation and either because their victims were suspected of treachery or other misfeasance,or because they were competitors in the drug trade,or because they had personally offended one of the partners.
on january,tipton and roane drove douglas talley,an underling in disfavor for mishandling a drug transaction,to the south side of richmond.once there,roane grabbed talley from the rear while tipton stabbed him repeatedly.the attack lasted three to five minutes and involved the infliction of stab wounds to talley head,neck,and upper body that killed him.
on the evening of january,tipton and roane went to the apartment of douglas moody,a suspected rival in their area,where tipton shot moody twice in the back.after moody fled by jumping through a window,both tipton and roane pursued.roane,armed with a knife retrieved from an apartment where the knife was kept for curtis thorne,caught up with moody in the front yard of the apartment where he stabbed him eighteen times,killing him.
on the night of january,roane,cory johnson,and a third person retrieved a bag of guns that they had left at an apartment earlier that day.roane then located peyton johnson,another rival drug dealer,at a tavern.shortly after roane left the tavern,cory johnson entered with another person and fatally shot peyton johnson with a semiautomatic weapon.
on january,roane pulled his car around the corner of an alley,got out of the vehicle,approached louis johnson,whom appellant johnson thought had threatened him while acting as bodyguard for a rival dealer,and shot him.cory johnson and lance thomas then got out of roane car and began firing at louis johnson.as louis johnson lay on the ground,either cory johnson or thomas shot him twice at close range.louis johnson died from some or all of these gunshot wounds.
on the evening of february,cory johnson and lance thomas were told that roane had gone to the apartment of torrick brown,with whom roane had been having trouble.johnson and thomas armed themselves with semiautomatic weapons and went to the apartment where they joined appellant roane outside.the three then knocked on brown door and asked his,martha mccoy,if brown was there.she summoned brown to the door and cory johnson,roane,and thomas opened fire with semiautomatic weapons,killing brown and critically wounding mccoy.
in late january,after being threatened by cory johnson for not paying for a supply of crack cocaine,dorothy armstrong went to live with her brother,bobby long.on february,cory johnson learned from jerry gaiters the location of long house.thereafter,tipton and an unidentified young fellow picked up gaiters and cory johnson who were then driven by tipton to a house where the group obtained a bag of guns.after dropping off the unidentified third party,the group proceeded to long house.upon arriving at long house,cory johnson and gaiters got out of the car and approached the house.while tipton waited in the car,cory johnson and gaiters went to the front door.when long opened the door,cory johnson opened fire,killing both dorothy armstrong and one anthony carter.bobby long fled out the front door,but was fatally shot by cory johnson in the front yard.
in early february,cory johnson began to suspect that linwood chiles was cooperating with the police.on february,johnson borrowed valerie butler automobile and arranged to meet with chiles.that night,chiles,curtis thorne,and sisters priscilla and gwen greene met cory johnson and drove off together in chiles station wagon.chiles parked the car in an alley,and tipton soon drove in behind it in another car,got out,and came up alongside the stationwagon.with tipton standing by,cory johnson told chiles to place his head on the steering wheel and then shot chiles twice at close range.additional shots were fired,killing thorne and critically wounding both of the greene sisters.the autopsy report indicated that thorne had been hit by bullets fired from two different directions.
tipton was charged under e and with capital murder for eight of these killings talley,moody,louis johnson,long,carter,armstrong,thorne,and chiles cory johnson,with seven louis johnson,long,carter,armstrong,thorne,chiles,and peyton johnson and roane,with three,moody,louis johnson,and peyton johnson.
the jury convicted tipton of six of the eight capital murders with which he was charged under e talley,armstrong,long,carter,chiles,and thorne.one of the other two e charges was dismissed louis johnson and the other resulted in acquittal moody.tipton was also convicted of conspiracy to possess cocaine base with the intent to distribute,engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise cce a,eight counts of committing acts of violence the eight killings charged under e in the aid of racketeering activity,two counts of using a firearm in relation to a crime of violence or a crime c,and two counts of possessing cocaine base with intent to distribute a.
the jury convicted cory johnson of all seven of the capital murders with which he was charged under e louis johnson,long,carter,armstrong,thorne,chiles,and peyton johnson.he was also convicted of conspiracy to possess cocaine base with the intent to distribute,engaging in a cce a,eleven counts of committing acts of violence including the seven killings charged under e in aid of racketeering activity,five counts of using a firearm in relation to a crime of violence or offense c,and two counts of possession of cocaine base with the intent to distribute a.
the jury convicted roane of all three of the capital murders with which he was charged under e moody,peyton johnson,and louis johnson.he was also convicted of conspiracy to possess cocaine base with the intent to distribute,engaging in a cce a,five counts of committing acts of violence including the three killings charged under e in aid of racketeering activity,four counts of using a firearm in relation to a crime of violence or a drug trafficking offense c,and one count of possession of cocaine base with the intent to distribute a.
following a penalty hearing on the capital murder counts,the jury recommended that cory johnson be sentenced to death on all of the seven e murders of which he had been convicted that tipton be sentenced to death for three of the six e murders of which he was convicted talley,chiles,and thorne and that roane be sentenced to death for one of the three of which he was convicted moody.the district court sentenced johnson,tipton,and roane to death in accordance with the jury recommendations pursuant to l,and imposed various sentences of imprisonment upon each of the appellants for the several noncapital counts on which they were convicted and for those capital murder counts on which tipton and roane had been convicted but were not given death sentences.
on appellants motion,the district court refused to order execution of the several death sentences on the grounds that congress had neither directly authorized the means by which the death sentences imposed under should be carried out,nor properly delegated to the attorney general the authority to issue the implementing regulations that were invoked by the government.in consequence,the district court stayed execution of the death sentences it had imposed until such time as congress had authorized the means of execution.
when the defendants initially appealed their convictions and sentences to this court,the government the district court stay of their death sentences.in our tipton opinion,we analyzed and disposed of approximately sixty issues,including challenges by the defendants to aspects of the process,the trial guilt phase,and the trial penalty phase.see id.at.in rejecting nearly all these challenges,we affirmed the convictions and sentences of the defendants,except for their convictions for violating conspiracy to commit drug offenses,which we vacated on double jeopardy grounds.finally,on the government,we vacated the stay of their death sentences and remanded for the executions to proceed in accordance with regulations promulgated by the attorney general.id.at.
following our decision in tipton,the defendants persisted in seeking relief from their convictions and sentences.on may,they sought leave to interview jurors,pursuant to local rule of the district court,which was denied.johnson pruett.june.on june,the defendants sought relief under,filing motions to vacate,set aside,or correct their sentences the government sought summary judgment on these motions,and the defendants,in june,requested leave to conduct discovery.the court granted the discovery request in part,authorizing tipton to conduct certain forensic testing.johnson pruett.may.
in its opinion disposing of the motions,the district court awarded summary judgment to the government except on roane claims that he was denied effective assistance of counsel in connection with the moody murder,and he was actually innocent of that murder.see opinion at.the defendants thereafter filed a joint motion to alter the opinion,which the court denied.united states tipton.july.johnson and tipton then moved for the issuance of certificates of appealability,which the district court awarded on november,as to all claims raised in their motions.united states tipton.johnson and tipton have filed timely appeals,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to and a.
on june,the district court conducted an evidentiary hearing on roane iac claim and on his claim of actual innocence.in the roane opinion of may,the court made findings of fact regarding the representation rendered by roane trial attorney.see roane opinion at.in so doing,the court first addressed the evidence implicating roane in the moody murder,finding as follows 
denise berkley testified that on the night of the moody murder,she watched roane stab moody or times while moody pleaded for his life that she then saw sandra reavis,roane,curt thorne,linwood chiles,and priscilla pepsi greene leave the scene of the murder in chiles station wagon and that roane took the knife he used to stab moody and gave it to pepsi greene,asking her to get rid of it 
pepsi greene testified that she heard two or three shots and then saw roane and tipton exit the house from which the shots were fired that roane then directed her to get him a knife and that later that night,roane returned the knife,then covered with blood,and told her to get rid of it and 
robert davis testified that,immediately following the moody murder,he saw tipton and roane by the steps near his house and heard them stating,yeah,i got him,i got him we ca stay out here,man.this is hot anyway.
id.at.importantly,the court found the testimony of these witnesses to be credible and corroborated by the physical evidence of murder including the autopsy and the crime scene video.id.at.indeed,the court found greene testimony to be particularly compelling.id.
the court then focused on the evidence of gina taylor,who observed the moody murder.taylor had testified at trial that roane was not involved.id.the court found,however,that the value of taylor evidence was undermined by her acknowledgment that she could not identify the assailant gender and that she did not see his face,the fact that she was evasive on,and her acknowledgment that she had kind of dated tipton.id.
the court then made findings regarding roane alibi for the moody murder.according to the court,roane had advised his lawyer prior to trial of the following he did not participate in the murder of moody on january,night of the was in a howard johnson hotel room with codefendant sandra reavis he and reavis were driven to the hotel by linwood chiles carmella cooley accompanied them to the hotel and chiles had registered and paid cash for the hotel room.id.at.the court found that the lawyer,david baugh,was convinced that roane did not participate in the moody murder and that the hotel was a couple of miles from where douglas moody was murdered.id.
in addressing baugh pretrial investigation into roane alibi,the court found the following baugh interviewed cooley,who said that she had once accompanied roane and reavis to the howard johnson but could not verify the date baugh concluded that cooley ignorance of the date and apparent hostility would make her a bad witness baugh contacted the hotel seeking records of linwood chiles renting a room on january,when the hotel manager advised that there were no such records,baugh went to the hotel and personally sought to locate such records baugh limited his search to the name linwood chiles,and searched only for records of january,and baugh found no records of linwood chiles being registered at the hotel on january.id.
the court analyzed the sufficiency of baugh pretrial investigation and concluded that it was constitutionally deficient.in so ruling,it found that an investigator hired by roane habeas corpus lawyer went to the howard johnson and looked through boxes of occupancy records for three hours the investigator found a card with the name chiles,linwood from the night of january,and a card with the name chiles,larry from the night of january,in his trial preparation,baugh could have subpoenaed the howard johnson records,or he could have devoted more effort to searching for them if baugh had utilized the subpoena process or searched more diligently,he could have located the records found by the investigator and roane was amenable to testifying in his own defense but was advised by baugh not to testify unless his alibi defense could be objectively corroborated.id.at.
finally,the court made several findings on the evidence presented in the habeas corpus evidentiary hearing,to the following effect roane testimony was tenable but not compelling although reavis confirmed roane alibi,her testimony was flat and unpersuasive because she would not waive her fifth amendment rights,reavis would not have testified at trial demetrius rowe testified that,at about on the night of the moody murder,reavis told rowe that she was going to a hotel with roane rowe saw reavis and roane leave the in chiles station wagon as roane claimed but in a cab rowe witnessed the murder of moody and was sure roane was not present rowe did not provide anyone with this information before trial and to the extent it exculpated roane,rowe evidence was not credible and would carry no weight with a jury.id.at.
assessing all these findings in the context of the case,the court concluded that baugh was constitutionally ineffective in his investigation of roane alibi.it therefore vacated roane convictions and sentences on the three counts related to the moody murder,that is,counts five,six,and seven id.at.finally,the court denied relief on roane claim of actual innocence id.
the government appealed the court ruling in favor of roane on his iac claim,and roane sought a certificate of appealability on certain of the claims resolved against him,which the district court issued.united states tipton.roane then,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to and a.
in our consideration of the district court rulings,we review its legal conclusions de novo and its findings of fact for clear error.monroe angelone,cir see also quesinberry taylor,cir.we review de novo mixed questions of law and fact addressed by the district the issue of whether a lawyer performance was constitutionally adequate.smith angelone,cir.we review for abuse of discretion the district court decision to deny a request to interview jurors,united states gravely,cir,as well as its rulings on a discovery request.see thomas taylor,cir.
the defendants raise multiple issues on appeal,and the district judge has awarded a certificate of appealability on each of them under the applicable statute,an appeal may not be taken from a final order of a district court in a proceeding unless a certificate of appealability has been issued.c b.a certificate of appealability may only be issued if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,id.c,and the judge must specify the issues on which the certificate has been granted,id.c.in this instance,the district judge issued certificates of appealability to the defendants and explained,u pon consideration of the defendants claims and the arguments offered in support thereof,the court concludes that the issues for which the defendants seek a certificate of appealability are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.united states tipton.
although some of the issues raised on appeal are common to the defendants,certain issues pertain to only two of the defendants or solely to a particular defendant each of their contentions,however,falls into one of six categories 
claims that the prosecution unconstitutionally discriminated against women in the jury selection process 
challenges to their cce claims that the trial court erred in failing to instruct and counsel were ineffective in failing to request an instruction that a the jury had to unanimously agree on which predicate violations constituted a continuing series b the jury had to unanimously agree on the identities of the five or more persons that each defendant supervised and c certain categories of persons and certain types of relationships can not constitute supervision 
claims of prosecutorial misconduct during claims that a the prosecution knowingly introduced perjured testimony from witnesses gregg scott,maurice saunders,and hussone jones and b the prosecution improperly withheld exculpatory evidence regarding witnesses wildman stevens,john knight,and stoodie green 
challenges to the court conduct of the habeas corpus a challenges to the standard employed by the court in assessing the defendants discovery requests b the contention that the court abused its discretion in granting summary judgment without allowing further discovery and c johnson and tipton claim that the court erroneously denied their motion for leave to interview jurors 
iac claims not otherwise a that their lawyers should have further investigated their alleged gang activities in new york and new jersey b johnson and tipton claim that their lawyers should have requested a voir dire inquiry on whether prospective jurors had a tendency to favor the death penalty c johnson and tipton claim that their lawyers failed to present mitigating evidence regarding prison conditions d tipton claims that his lawyers failed to present adequate defenses to the talley and stoney run murders e tipton claim that his lawyers failed to present an adequate f roane claim that his lawyers conceded certain aggravating factors and g roane claim that his lawyers waived his right to attend the voir dire proceedings and 
johnson eighth amendment claim that he is mentally retarded and can not constitutionally be executed,and that his counsel were ineffective in failing to address this issue at sentencing and on direct appeal 
we assess these various issues in turn 
at trial,the government utilized two of its peremptory challenges to strike men from the jury panel,and it used eight peremptory challenges to strike prospective women jurors.the defendants,however,failed to object at trial to the government use of its peremptory challenges.after trial,but before defendants direct appeal,the supreme court held that intentional gender discrimination by use of peremptory challenges contravenes the equal protection clause.alabama,d extending its holding in batson kentucky,d from racial discrimination to gender discrimination.the defendants,in their direct appeal,raised the issue of sex discrimination in jury selection.in rejecting their claim,we explained that they had produced no evidence to support their claim,other than raw figures of men versus women stricken by the prosecution,and such raw figures were insufficient to make a prima facie showing of gender discrimination.tipton,at.because we addressed this issue on direct appeal in tipton,the defendants can not raise their claim again in these proceedings 
the defendants also maintain that the failure of their counsel to object to the prosecution use of its peremptory challenges constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.at the time of their trial,however,the supreme court had not granted certiorari in,and the ninth circuit was the only federal appellate court to extend the batson principle to gender discrimination.see united states de gross,cir en banc.indeed,we had explicitly rejected attempts to extend batson to gender.see united states hamilton,cir w e reject appellants suggestion that the equal protection clause compels us to extend batson to apply to peremptory challenges exercised on the basis of gender.in light of this precedent,the defendants are unable to demonstrate that their counsel failure to object to the prosecution use of peremptory strikes against prospective female jurors fell below the range of professionally competent performance.see united states mcnamara,cir explaining counsel not deficient for following controlling circuit precedent at time of trial.accordingly,we must affirm the court ruling on the iac claims premised on the lack of an objection at trial to the prosecution use of its peremptory strikes.
we turn next to the defendants multiple claims of error regarding their convictions on the cce counts.in order to convict a defendant of a cce offense,the government is required to prove five elements 
the defendant committed a felony violation of the federal drug laws such violation was part of a continuing series of violations of the drug laws the series of violations were undertaken by defendant in concert with five or more persons defendant served as an organizer or supervisor,or in another management capacity with respect to those other persons and defendant derived substantial income or resources from the continuing series of violations.
united states ricks,cir see also c.on appeal here,and in their proceedings in district court,the defendants focus on the second,third,and fourth of these elements.
in their direct appeals,the defendants asserted that the trial court had plainly erred in failing to instruct the jury that it was required to unanimously agree on three predicate violations supporting the continuing series element of c assuming that unanimity was required,we rejected this claim and explained that the record plainly indicates that appellants could have suffered no actual prejudice from the lack of a special unanimity instruction on the predicate violation element because b y its verdict,it is clear that the jury unanimously found each guilty of at least five predicate violations tipton,at.
after we rendered our tipton decision,the supreme court confirmed what we had assumed there.it held that,in a cce prosecution,the jury must unanimously agree on the specific violations that make up the continuing series.richardson united states,d.the defendants now contend that the trial court failure to give the richardson instruction constitutes a structural defect in their trial and that they are therefore not required to show prejudice.in the alternative,they assert that they have demonstrated prejudice.johnson and tipton also maintain that their lawyers were ineffective in failing to object to the lack of a unanimity instruction.as explained below,we agree with the district court that these claims lack merit.
we have recognized that a trial court failure to give a richardson instruction is a procedural defect rather than a structural one.united states stitt,cir rejecting assertion that richardson error is structural defect united states brown,cir same.as explained in stitt,a trial court failure to give a richardson instruction is subject to harmless error analysis,and a defendant raising such an issue must therefore demonstrate prejudice.stitt,at.we ruled on the defendants direct appeal that the trial court failure to give a instruction did not prejudice them,see tipton,at,and we must therefore affirm the district court on this point.
in addition to their substantive richardson claims,johnson and tipton maintain that their counsel failure to request a instruction at trial constitutes ineffective assistance,in violation of the sixth amendment.again,our decision on direct appeal forecloses this contention.in order to prevail on an iac claim,a defendant must demonstrate that counsel performance was deficient and such deficient performance prejudiced the defense.strickland washington,d.because we decided in tipton that the defendants were not prejudiced by the lack of a richardson instruction,johnson and tipton are unable to satisfy the second prong of strickland.accordingly,we affirm the court ruling on this claim as well.
relying on united states jerome,cir,johnson and tipton next contend that they were entitled to a special unanimity instruction on the cce charge regarding the identities of the five or more persons that each of them was alleged to have supervised.see c.not only has this claim been inexcusably defaulted by johnson and tipton failure to raise it either at trial or on direct appeal,it also fails because,in stitt,we held that richardson did not change the rule that the jury need not unanimously agree on which five persons were organized,supervised,or managed by the defendant.stitt,at.
johnson and tipton nevertheless claim that their attorneys were constitutionally ineffective in failing to raise this unanimity issue at trial.because stitt stands for the proposition that unanimous agreement on the identity of each supervisee is not required,we agree with the district court that the lawyers were not ineffective in failing to seek such an instruction.see opinion at.
johnson and tipton next contend that the trial court erred in failing to counsel were ineffective in failing to certain categories of persons,drug kingpins can not as a matter of law be supervisees,and that certain types of relationships,can not constitute supervision.see united states barona,cir finding error in failing to instruct that certain individuals who were on list of potential supervisees given to jury were incapable,as a legal matter,of counting as supervisees.this claim has been defaulted by the failure of johnson and tipton to raise it either at trial or on direct appeal.see bousley united states,d.like the district court,see opinion at,however,we will briefly examine this claim in order to assess the contention that counsel failure to raise it in a timely manner resulted from constitutionally ineffective representation.
the trial court gave the following instruction regarding the supervision element of c 
t he term organizer and the term supervisory position and position of management are to be given their usual and ordinary meanings.these words imply the exercise of power or authority by a person who occupies some position of management or supervision.
see opinion at.we upheld this very instruction in united states hall,cir,two months after our decision in tipton.in hall,the defendant maintained that the jury should have been instructed that he could have neither supervised nor organized individuals with whom he had only a relationship.id.as we explained in hall,j urors are competent to understand and apply ordinary concepts like organizer,supervisor and management.id.at.this jury,like the one in hall,was fully capable of understanding the term supervision.accordingly,johnson and tipton were not prejudiced by the lack of such an instruction,and their counsel were not ineffective in failing to request a more detailed instruction regarding these terms 
we turn next to the contentions of johnson and tipton that their trial was prejudiced by multiple instances of prosecutorial misconduct.they contend that the prosecution knowingly introduced false testimony at trial,in contravention of their due process rights,from witnesses gregg scott,maurice saunders,and hussone jones.and tipton asserts that the government contravened the principles of brady maryland,d,by withholding from them exculpatory evidence pertaining to the witnesses wildman stevens,john knight,and stoodie greene.we assess these claims in turn.
first,johnson and tipton contend that the prosecution knowingly introduced perjured testimony from gregg scott,maurice saunders,and hussone jones.in order to prevail on such a claim,johnson and tipton are required to demonstrate that the testimony was false,see boyd french,cir the government knew the testimony was false,see thompson garrison,cir and there is a reasonable probability that the false testimony could have affected the verdict,boyd,at.as explained below,we agree with the district court that this claim must be rejected.
in support of this habeas corpus claim,johnson and tipton submitted affidavits from various gang members in new york,asserting that gregg scott had lied at trial when he testified that the new york boyz a gang of which johnson and tipton were allegedly members met to discuss retaliating against individuals who threatened other members of the gang and testified that he received guns from a man known as light.although johnson and tipton raised a factual issue on the falsity of these statements,they offered no proof that the government knew or should have known this testimony to be false.opinion at.and the fact that the evidence may have benefitted the government is not enough.such a iry generalities,conclusory assertions and hearsay statements do not suffice to stave off summary judgment or entitle a habeas petitioner to an evidentiary hearing,because none of these would be admissible evidence at an evidentiary hearing.id.at quoting united states aiello,cir.we therefore affirm the district court ruling on this claim.
johnson and tipton next assert that the government knew,or that it should have known,that maurice saunders testified falsely at trial when he claimed that he saw light during two trips to new york,and that light could not have been in new york because he was in fact incarcerated elsewhere during saunders visits.again,johnson and tipton proffer no evidence that the government,at the time of trial,knew or should have known of light incarceration.see horton united states,rejecting assertion that,for brady purposes,federal prosecutor is charged with knowledge of state prison records.and conclusory accusations that the government should have known that a statement was false,without more,do not warrant an evidentiary hearing or offer escape from summary judgment.see aiello,at.
in any event,johnson and tipton have made no showing that such testimony about light incarceration,even if untrue,could have affected the outcome of their trial.as the district court explained in denying their iac claim regarding the prosecution failure to discover light incarceration,the government presented extensive trial evidence of johnson and tipton new york connections and activities.opinion at explaining that the proffered testimony of light incarceration does not negate the following anthony howlen testimony that johnson and tipton were part of the new york boyz and sliced him with razors when he interfered with their attempts to sell drugs in new jersey the repeated references to the new york boyz during the course of the richmond based activities tipton threats to invoke the assistance of his new york associates if retaliatory actions were required the appearance of new york boyz lance thomas and hess in richmond and the repeated trips by tipton and johnson from richmond to new york to obtain drugs.we therefore affirm the district court on this claim.
johnson and tipton also contend that the witness hussone jones lied when he testified about the murder of douglas talley.jones testified at trial that he watched from his own car as tipton stabbed talley in talley car.johnson and tipton assume that this testimony was false because there were no street lights in the area of the crime,and they contend it was too dark for jones to see anything.the district court found,however,that jones was within ten to twenty feet of talley car,and that the car was illuminated by its dome light.the dome light was lit because,after initially being stabbed,talley arms and head prevented the car door from closing.opinion at.jones testimony was consistent with the facts observed at the crime scene,and johnson and tipton have failed to make the requisite showing of falsity.
tipton also asserts that the prosecution improperly withheld exculpatory evidence from his counsel,in violation of due process and brady,regarding the witnesses wildman stevens,john knight,and stoodie green.in order to establish a brady violation,tipton was required to demonstrate that the information at issue was favorable to the accused that it was suppressed by the government,either willfully or inadvertently and that prejudice to the defense ensued.strickler greene,d.the district court held that tipton failed to establish a brady violation,see opinion at,and we agree.
tipton contends,first of all,that the prosecutors knew,and yet failed to disclose,that the witness stevens had denied receiving a knife from tipton,and that this information would have refuted jones testimony that tipton gave stevens a bloody knife on the night of the talley murder.as for this claim,the district court found that there was no evidence that stevens actually conveyed this information to the prosecution.id.at.accordingly,this contention fails under the second brady prong.
second,tipton asserts that the prosecutors knew of,and yet also failed to disclose,statements by the witnesses john knight and stoodie green providing tipton an alibi on the night of the stoney run murders.tipton brady claims must fail,however,because,where the exculpatory information is not only available to the defendant but also lies in a source where a reasonable defendant would have looked,a defendant is not entitled to the benefit of the brady doctrine.united states wilson,cir.we have explained that information actually known by the defendant falls outside the ambit of the brady rule.fullwood lee,cir.obviously,tipton knew who he was with on the evening of the talley had no need for the government to provide him with such information.thus,no brady violation has been shown,and we affirm the district court ruling on the issue.
we turn next to the defendants multiple challenges to the district court conduct of their habeas corpus proceedings.these contentions include their challenge to the standard utilized by the court in assessing their discovery requests their contention that the court abused its discretion in awarding summary judgment to the government without first according them an opportunity to conduct discovery and their assertion that the denial of their motion for leave to interview jurors was erroneous.
other than authorizing tipton to conduct forensic testing of a knife found at the talley murder scene,the court denied the defendants broad motions for authority to conduct discovery in their habeas corpus proceedings.johnson pruett.may.pursuant to rule a of the rules governing proceedings,a prisoner may engage in discovery only if,and to the extent that,the judge in the exercise of his discretion and for good cause shown grants him leave to do so,but not otherwise.the defendants contend that the district court utilized an incorrect legal standard in assessing their discovery requests.and the defendants assert that,regardless of the standard employed,such discovery should have been authorized.we are constrained to disagree.
in denying the request for discovery,the court explained the standard it was utilizing 
the supreme court determined in harris nelson,d,and its progeny,bracy gramley,d,that good cause for discovery exists when a petition for habeas corpus establishes a prima facie case for relief.see harris nelson,at.specifically,discovery is warranted,where specific allegations before the court show reason to believe that the petitioner may,if the facts are fully developed,be able to demonstrate that he is entitled to relief.bracy,at.citing harris,at.
johnson pruett.may.the defendants assert that the court,in ruling against them,improperly applied a stringent prima facie standard under harris,instead of a more forgiving good cause standard authorized by bracy.this contention is incorrect.in bracy,the court cited with approval the discovery standard articulated in harris,merely clarifying the definition of good cause.see quesinberry taylor,cir observing that bracy approved the harris standard see also murphy johnson,cir t he bracy decision does not lower the grade for discovery in habeas cases,but rather it merely reasserts the standards of harris nelson.here,the district court properly applied the good cause standard outlined in harris and bracy,and it did not abuse its discretion in deciding that the defendants had not shown good cause for the bulk of their discovery requests.the court carefully considered each claim asserted by the defendants,and it assessed whether the defendants had shown good cause for discovery.see johnson pruett,at.may.because the court applied the proper standard and did not abuse its discretion,we affirm its rulings on this issue 
johnson and tipton next contend that the district court abused its discretion in denying their claims of juror misconduct without first granting them leave to interview the jurors.according to johnson and tipton,the jurors were exposed to extraneous information during trial,including extensive media coverage,which clouded their judgment.
we have already assessed and disposed of at least one aspect of this claim.during trial,two jurors admitted reading an inflammatory article about the defendants.one of those jurors was excused by the trial court,but the other,cooke,advised the court that the article would not affect his consideration of the case,and he continued to serve.on direct appeal,the defendants contended that cooke should have been removed from the jury because he had been exposed to adverse publicity.we specifically considered this claim and found no error in the court decision with regard to cooke.tipton,at.in addition,we agree with the district court that johnson and tipton remaining claims with respect to the jury have been procedurally defaulted by their failure to raise them either at trial or on direct appeal.see opinion at.
as to their juror misconduct claims,the district court carefully explained that they are so speculative as to be insufficient to survive summary dismissal,much less summary judgment.united states tipton,at.july.throughout the trial,the court gave cautionary instructions to the jury concerning both media coverage and other possible outside influences,repeatedly reminding the jurors to avoid such external sources of information.johnson and tipton have provided us with nothing to suggest that the jurors violated these instructions.and as we observed in gravely,r equests to impeach jury verdicts by contact with jurors are disfavored.at.before proceeding down the path of impeaching a jury verdict,a movant must make a threshold showing of improper outside influence.id.in this instance,the court did not abuse its discretion in finding that no such showing had been made.id.explaining that denial of jury investigation is subject to abuse of discretion review.put simply,johnson and tipton have failed to proffer any evidence that the jurors engaged in misconduct or that they were improperly exposed to outside influences.we therefore affirm the court rulings on the defendants request to interview the jurors.see opinion at united states,at.july.
the defendants also assert multiple other iac claims,contending that their lawyers should have further investigated their alleged gang activities in new york and new jersey johnson and tipton lawyers should have requested a reversewitherspoon inquiry johnson and tipton lawyers failed to present mitigating evidence regarding prison conditions tipton lawyers failed to present adequate defenses to the talley and stoney run murders tipton lawyers failed to make an adequate roane lawyers conceded certain aggravating factors and roane lawyers waived his right to voir dire.
as we have explained,the court in strickland established that an iac claim has two prongs that counsel performance was deficient and that such deficient performance prejudiced the defense.at.a defendant asserting an iac claim must therefore satisfy both prongs,and a failure of proof on either prong ends the matter.see williams kelly,cir.
under the first prong of strickland,we apply a strong presumption that a trial counsel strategy and tactics fall within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.strickland,at.for a lawyer trial performance to be deficient,his errors must have been so serious that he was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the sixth amendment.id.at.and the reasonableness of a lawyer trial performance must be evaluated from counsel perspective at the time of the alleged error and in light of all the circumstances,and the standard of reasonableness is highly deferential.kimmelman morrison,d see also strickland,at.
in order to establish prejudice under strickland second prong,a defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland,at.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.id.as explained below,we agree with the district court that the defendants remaining iac claims lack merit,standing alone or viewed in the aggregate.
first of all,the defendants maintain that their lawyers should have further investigated their alleged gang activities in new york and new jersey,and that this failure constitutes constitutionally ineffective assistance.they assert that such an investigation would have led to the discovery of impeaching evidence on certain prosecution,that light was in jail when saunders supposedly saw him in new york,and that scott testimony about retaliation was false.
notwithstanding whether counsel investigation was reasonable,the defendants have failed to establish prejudice under strickland second prong.as the district court explained,substantial negative repercussions would have resulted to the defendants from the introduction at trial of such impeachment evidence.opinion at.many of the purported impeaching witnesses had acknowledged being involved in illegal drug transactions with johnson and tipton and in pooling their money with johnson and tipton to purchase drugs,and light did not deny that he was a regular source of tipton for crack cocaine.id.in addition,none of this evidence would have undermined the overwhelming evidence before the jury that the defendants were involved in a cce in the richmond area,and that their enterprise had distributed illegal drugs and killed on several occasions in order to ensure its success.accordingly,the defendants could not have been prejudiced by any purported omissions of their counsel in this regard,and these claims must be rejected.
johnson and tipton next contend that,under the principle established in morgan illinois,d,their counsel were constitutionally ineffective in failing to request a specific inquiry of all prospective jurors.under morgan,a capital defendant has the right to an inquiry sufficient to the limits of reason and jury none of whose members would unwaveringly impose death after a finding of guilt and hence would uniformly reject any and all evidence of mitigating factors,no matter how instructed on the law.tipton,at quoting morgan,at.johnson and tipton contend that their lawyers failed to ensure that each prospective trial juror was specifically asked whether he or she would always impose a sentence of death.on direct appeal,however,this court foreclosed the prejudice prong of this contention when,in considering a separate contention concerning voir dire,we concluded that the district court inquiry into death penalty attitudes was sufficient to cull out any prospective juror who would always vote for the death penalty.id.at.accordingly,johnson and tipton are unable to satisfy strickland second prong,and their counsel were not constitutionally ineffective for failing to request a inquiry.
johnson and tipton next contend that their lawyers were constitutionally ineffective for failing to present mitigating evidence regarding the prison conditions they would face if sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.this contention is made in response to a point argued by the prosecutor during closing ask yourself,should they be punished beyond incarceration i not telling you incarceration is nice and a lifetime of incarceration is not punishment.but think about each and every day of their existence in jail.they will wake up,bathe,be fed.they will be able to watch tv,read books.they will be able to use the telephone to talk to their loved ones.essentially,johnson and tipton contend that,had their lawyers explained to the jury that actual prison conditions were more difficult than this benign description would suggest,the jury may have seen a life sentence as sufficient punishment and rejected the death penalty.
as the district court correctly explained,if the lawyers had introduced evidence of prison conditions,the prosecution would simply have been afforded another opportunity to remind the jurors that johnson and tipton possessed a proven inclination to engineer murders from behind prison walls.opinion at.and the government could have drawn the stark contrast between prison life and the living conditions of the incapacitated greene sisters who were critically wounded during the stoney run murders.accordingly,the lawyers acted reasonably in deciding not to describe prison conditions as mitigating evidence.
tipton next asserts that his counsel were ineffective in their defense of him on the talley murder counts counts three and four,and on the stoney run murder counts counts and.we reject both of these contentions.
tipton maintains that,based on pathologist fierro testimony,tipton,who is,could not have been talley murderer.accordingly,tipton contends that hussone jones eyewitness testimony must have been false and that his counsel were ineffective in failing to exploit this fact.we disagree.the district court expressly found that fierro testimony did not suggest that tipton,who was initially sitting on the right of talley,could not stab talley on the right side of his body such a diffusion of wounds is consistent with jones description opinion at.in light of this factual finding,counsel were not deficient in failing to urge the jury to absolve tipton on the basis of fierro testimony.
tipton also contends that defense counsel were ineffective in failing to interview and call as a witness wildman stevens,who,according to an affidavit submitted during the proceedings,would have contradicted jones testimony that jones drove tipton and roane to stevens house immediately after talley murder.as the district court found,however,there was no evidence that tipton had advised his counsel that stevens could contradict jones description.id.at see lackey johnson,cir.explaining lawyer not ineffective for failing to discover evidence that client knew but withheld.and as the court explained,tipton counsel had no reason to believe that it would be fruitful to interview stevens,considering the fact that the evidence indicated that stevens was simply another member of the cce.opinion at.accordingly,we affirm the court determination that counsel were not ineffective in defending tipton on the talley murder counts.
tipton also contends that his counsel failed to mount an adequate defense to the stoney run murder counts.in particular,tipton contends that counsel should have called john knight and stoodie green as alibi witnesses.again,we agree with the district court denial of this iac claim.as the court explained,c onspicuously absent from the record is any evidence from tipton that he told counsel that stoodie green or knight could exonerate him from involvement in the stoney run murders.opinion at.we agree with the court that tipton counsel was not constitutionally ineffective in his defense of the stoney run murders.
tipton claims that his attorney failed to present an adequate at the penalty phase of his trial.in particular,tipton relies on the absence of evidence from his mother,his paternal,and an older woman in whose home he resided in early contending that these witnesses could have testified to tipton unfortunate childhood.again,we agree with the district court that t he record refutes such a claim,in that counsel presented extensive evidence through both lay and expert witnesses,and succeeded in convincing the jurors to find twelve mitigating factors,a number of which pertained to tipton difficult childhood and his mental deficiencies.opinion at.indeed,the mitigating evidence in the trial penalty phase was sufficiently compelling to convince the jury to return verdicts on three of the six capital counts against tipton,despite the existence of numerous and weighty aggravating factors.in light of the compelling mitigation case presented by tipton counsel in the trial penalty phase,the court correctly concluded that their performance was not constitutionally deficient and that tipton was not prejudiced by the absence of additional witnesses.
roane maintains that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance at the trial penalty phase in failing to indeed,in effectively sufficiency of the government proof of the aggravating factor that the murder of moody involved substantial planning and premeditation.according to roane,this concession was error because there was no evidence that he manifested a premeditated intent to kill moody or that there was substantial planning,or any planning at all.the district court disagreed,and we agree with the district court.the court found that the evidence of substantial planning and premeditation was ample and that,in light of that evidence,t he best hope for roane was to emphasize the evidence in mitigation rather than challenge the prosecution solid case on the substantial planning aggravating factor.opinion at see carter johnson,cir concluding that it was reasonable for counsel to concede client culpability in order to establish credibility with jury bell evatt,cir concluding counsel reasonably conceded defendant guilt of kidnapping to retain credibility for penalty phase.because the performance of roane counsel was not constitutionally deficient,we affirm the district court.
relying on near cunningham,cir,roane maintains that a capital defendant may not waive his presence at trial and that his trial attorney was necessarily deficient when,after consulting with roane,he waived roane right to be present during portions of the jury selection process.roane contends that he was prejudiced as a result because,had he been present throughout voir dire,he would have insisted on using peremptory strikes to remove three jurors who ultimately served on the jury.he maintains that,had those strikes been utilized,the outcome of the trial penalty phase would likely have been different.
again,our decision on direct review forecloses this contention.in applying plain error review to roane claim,we observed that roane did not offer anything to suggest that he was prejudiced by his intermittent absences from jury voir dire beyond the conclusory assertion that he was presumptively prejudiced.tipton,at.accordingly,roane is unable to satisfy the second prong of strickland,and we need not consider this issue further.
johnson maintains that he is mentally retarded and that,under federal law,he can not be executed.he further contends that his counsel were ineffective for failing to argue this point during sentencing.the district court rejected these contentions,see opinion at,and we agree.
under federal law,a sentence of death shall not be carried out upon a person who is mentally retarded.l see also atkins virginia,d holding that execution of mentally retarded defendant constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under eighth amendment.the district court found,based on data of the american association on retardation,that an iq of or below places a person in the retarded category.id.at.at the penalty phase of johnson trial,dewey cornell,a psychologist,testified that,on october,he had administered a wechsler adult intelligence scale test wais test.johnson exhibited an iq of,which indicated a generally impaired intelligence,placing him just above the level of mental retardation.importantly,cornell testified that he knew the significance of finding johnson iq to be above,this finding would render johnson,and that he his numbers and consulted colleagues before reaching this conclusion.
despite cornell evidence,johnson asserts that he is in fact mentally retarded.in support of this proposition,johnson points to evidence offered during the penalty phase that his iq was somewhere between and in,and he relies on a publication concluding that the wais test tends to inflate iq scores over the years 
individuals appear to gain iq points over a ten year period.since the was published in,this inflation factor could mean that the average iq could be as high as points rather than the accepted value of.
id.at quoting the psychological corporation,an introduction to the wechsler adult intelligence scale,ed.based on these authorities,johnson maintains that his actual iq is below and that his score of is a product of score inflation.as the district court explained,however,cornell evidence that he his findings and consulted with colleagues before concluding that johnson was not mentally retarded belies the suggestion that cornell analysis did not account for possible variations in his testing instrument.id.at.accordingly,johnson is not barred from execution due to mental retardation.
johnson next contends that his counsel was ineffective for failing to assert possible inflation at sentencing.we agree with the district court that johnson trial attorney was not ineffective for failing to raise this issue.under strickland,counsel has a duty to make reasonabl
