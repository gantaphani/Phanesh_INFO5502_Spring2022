the trial court denied robinson petition,finding rice affidavit inadmissible because of his death,and further finding that even if admissible,the contrary testimony by the key agent on the case that only one taped interview was conducted was more credible.the parties failed to develop the allegation of sims status as a paid informant and the state courts did not address this issue.the tennessee court of criminal appeals affirmed the trial court denial of relief and the tennessee supreme court denied robinson application for permission to appeal.

b.the underlying crime 
the tennessee court of criminal appeals made the following factual findings 
petitioner and deloris smith were indicted for the first degree murder of gerald irwin in putnam county.during the evening of january,and early morning hours of january,the victim contacted robinson several times about the payment of a debt that robinson owed him.robinson met with the victim,a known drug dealer,on two occasions that night,but denied having the money to pay the debt.finally,robinson called the victim and said that he had the money and expressed his desire to meet the victim.the victim suggested that they meet at the old oak tree in cookeville.
evidence showed that robinson resold drugs that he obtained from the victim and,specifically,that he sold drugs to smith and had done so for approximately one year.smith was at the robinson residence to purchase drugs on the night of january.although she did not know the details,smith was aware that someone was trying to collect money from robinson.in conjunction with that,smith had driven robinson to a pay phone to make phone calls that evening.she was also present at the robinson home when the victim called and suggested the meeting at the oak tree.smith agreed to take robinson there.
smith drove robinson to the old oak tree and they waited for the victim to arrive.robinson was in possession of a small handgun that smith had provided as the victim approached,robinson exited the vehicle and told smith to drive around and then come back and get him.robinson got into the backseat of the victim car.kim sims was a passenger in the front seat.the victim drove a short distance and pulled into a parking lot to turn around.as the victim turned his car,robinson shot him in the back of the head.robinson then told kim sims to move to the backseat.robinson got in the driver seat and pushed the victim body over so that he could drive the car.as robinson drove the victim vehicle past smith vehicle,he motioned for her to follow him.
they drove on interstate to the smithville exit where robinson pulled off and parked the victim car on tucker ridge road.he took the victim wallet,cellular phone,pager,money,and some drugs.he and sims got into the smith vehicle and they returned to cookeville.robinson,smith,and sims concocted a story regarding their activities that evening.the day following the shooting,robinson called the victim friends and family inquiring about his whereabouts,apparently in an attempt to divert any suspicion.
according to sims testimony,she spent part of the day pretending to be looking for the victim and asking others about his whereabouts,likewise in an effort to divert suspicion from her.both sims and smith gave statements to law enforcement officials that corroborated the concocted story.those statements were later recanted and both gave new statements to law enforcement officials.
robinson testified at the trial and denied having any intent to kill the victim.he claimed that he shot the victim in.robinson said that the victim had threatened him and his family over the course of the night and he shot the victim because the victim pointed a gun at him while in the car although she did supply the gun,robinson stated that smith had nothing to do with the murder and did not know anything about it.the state theorized,however,that robinson and smith planned the murder and both were involved.although certain details were corroborated by a number of other witnesses,the state theory was established principally by kim sims,the only eyewitness to the crime.sims testified that she did not see the victim reach for his gun,and although she had been with the victim several hours that night,she never heard him threaten robinson.
smith did not testify at trial,but her second statement to law enforcement officials corroborated robinson testimony that he was fearful of the victim.in her statement,smith denied any involvement in the murder,but admitted giving the weapon to robinson.
state robinson,wl,at,emphasis added.no physical evidence or testimony,except sims,contradicted robinson assertion that he shot irwin in.
sims work as a confidential informant 
prior to trial,kim sims worked for the sparta police department as a paid confidential informant ci.on february,about a month after irwin was shot,sims was an informant against irwin sister and was paid for her cooperation.irwin sister,debra irwin,later served as a witness at robinson trial.sims worked as a ci for the sparta police department on at least seven other occasions and was paid each time.sims also worked as a ci for the putnam county sheriff office pcso and the tennessee bureau of investigation tbi,both of which spearheaded the investigation in the case.on january,days before robinson trial aided a putnam county detective and a tbi agent in making a controlled buy from wade mcclure,who also later served as a witness at robinson trial.the district attorney appointed a special prosecutor from another district because of robinson and delores smith ties to local law enforcement nonetheless,robinson lawyers were not informed of sims activity as a ci or that sims had informed against two of the state irwin and wade mcclure.
