ralph miller,pro se,appeals the district court dismissal of his habeas corpus petition as not timely filed within the evolving meaning of section of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act.we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the facts at issue in miller appeal involve a complex procedural history with at least fifteen motions appeals before the ohio court of appeals and the ohio supreme court.the general time period starts with miller conviction on september,and ends with the filing of his habeas petition in the fall of.in order to determine whether miller petition was timely filed under section statute of limitations,we must assess miller actions during this time period.
on september,after a hamilton county jury found miller guilty of one count of robbery and one count of grand theft,a hamilton county court of common pleas judge sentenced miller to eleven to fifteen years.miller appealed his conviction to the ohio court of appeals on january,claiming insufficiency of the evidence on the robbery count.on may,the ohio court of appeals affirmed the trial court decision.miller did not appeal this decision to the ohio supreme court.
on july,miller sought leave to file a delayed appeal in the ohio supreme court.the court permitted his delayed appeal and miller again argued insufficiency of the evidence.on january,the ohio supreme court dismissed miller delayed appeal as not involving any substantial constitutional question.
shortly after seeking leave to file a delayed appeal,miller also sought to reopen his appeal in the ohio court of appeals on ineffective assistance of appellate counsel grounds pursuant to rule b of the ohio rules of appellate procedure miller filed his application on august,and in an order dated november,the ohio court of appeals ruled that miller claim was barred by res judicata because he could have argued ineffective assistance of appellate counsel in his delayed appeal to the ohio supreme court.the court also concluded that miller did not establish a colorable claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.miller alleges that he did not receive a copy of this order until may of the following year.
believing that the ohio court of appeals had not ruled on his rule b application,miller next filed a motion to proceed to judgment in the ohio court of appeals on may.a week later,miller received a letter from the ohio court of appeals notifying him of their decision regarding his rule b application.on june,miller then filed a motion for relief from judgment.the ohio court of appeals denied that motion on june.miller then timely appealed that decision to the ohio supreme court,which dismissed the appeal on october.
on november,miller filed an application for delayed reconsideration in instanter pursuant to app.and app.b in the ohio court of appeals.the court of appeals construed the motion as a second rule b application to reopen his appeal and rejected it because it contain ed the same arguments which he raised and which this court did address in his previous application for reopening.miller subsequent appeal to the ohio supreme court was denied on august.
miller swore under penalty of perjury that he presented his habeas corpus petition to prison officials on september.his petition,which was filed by prison officials on november,presented two grounds for relief ineffective assistance of counsel insufficiency of the evidence on his robbery conviction.
on november,the district court initially dismissed miller petition with prejudice,declined to issue a certificate of appealability and certified that any appeal would not be taken in good faith.thereafter,the district court amended its decision and issued a certificate of appealability as to whether miller petition was.on appeal,this court remanded miller petition to the district court for reconsideration in light of slack mcdaniel.on remand,the district court stood by its amended opinion,and on october,a rule panel declared this case unfit for rule disposition.
in reviewing a habeas petition,we review a district court legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.lucas,cir.
a conviction becomes final for purposes of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act statute of limitations upon conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.d a.the state of ohio argues that miller conviction became final on july,days following the ohio court of appeals may,decision on direct appeal affirming miller conviction.with respect to miller filings after this date,the state of ohio acknowledges that miller delayed appeal was a properly filed collateral attack within the meaning of section d and therefore tolled the statute of limitations while it was pending.see searcy carter,cir.the state correctly observes that miller delayed appeal did not toll the statute of limitations for the ninety day period he could have sought review in the supreme court.isham randle,cir section d does not toll the limitations period to take into account the time in which a defendant could have potentially filed a petition for certiorari with the united states supreme court following a state court denial of relief.
as to miller rule b application,the state of ohio also argues that it tolled the statute of limitations while it was pending,but because it overlapped with the tolling from miller delayed appeal in the ohio supreme court,it did not have any practical tolling effect.this argument potentially skips a step in the analysis.in bronaugh state of ohio,cir,we ruled that there was no need to assess whether an untimely rule b application was properly filed within the meaning of section d because a rule b application was a step in ohio direct review process.in reaching this conclusion,we nonetheless emphasized that the petitioner could not benefit from his delay in bringing a rule b application to reopen direct appeal by requesting that d a not begin until after his rule b application has run its course through the courts.id.at.rather,the statute of limitations is tolled only for that period of time in which the rule b application is actually pending in the ohio courts.id.
in our view,there are two ways to read bronaugh.the first,which is the state of ohio position in this case,is that a rule b application is technically part of the direct review process,but in effect,it functions as a collateral attack because it only tolls the statute of limitations during pendency,it does not affect the conclusion of direct review and thus does not postpone the initial running of the limitations period.the other possible interpretation is that because a rule b application is part of the direct review process,a conviction does not become final pursuant to section d a until the ohio courts dispose of a petitioner rule b application.thus,a timely application does not merely toll the statute of limitations,the limitations period does not begin to run until its conclusion.therefore,although the state of ohio argues that miller apparently timely rule b application only tolls the statute of limitations there is an argument that miller direct appeal did not conclude,and the statute of limitations did not begin to run,until the ohio courts disposed of his rule b application 
we need not resolve this question in the present case,however,because it does not affect our resolution of whether miller habeas petition was timely.we therefore assume for purposes of this appeal that the state of ohio is correct,and that even a timely rule b application only tolls the statute of limitations.we proceed,then,under the assumption that miller conviction became final on july,and that by january,the date the ohio supreme court denied his delayed appeal,miller had used eight days of the limitations period 
where the facts are not in dispute,we review a district court decision declining to apply equitable tolling de novo.dunlap united states,cir.in the present case,the state of ohio does not contest miller factual account.
miller contends he should receive the benefit of equitable tolling for the period from november,until may,the period during which
