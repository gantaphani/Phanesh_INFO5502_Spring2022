in,after pleading guilty to conspiracy to distribute cocaine,raymond surratt was sentenced to life imprisonment.we affirmed his conviction and sentence on appeal,and surratt motion to vacate his conviction and sentence under was likewise denied.neither surratt direct appeal nor his motion questioned the legality of his mandatory life sentence.
several years later,surratt returned to this court and asked for permission to file a second or successive motion.surratt request was premised on united states simmons,cir en banc,which in turn overruled our prior decision in united states harp,cir.had surratt been sentenced after simmons,he would have faced a lower mandatory minimum sentence than the mandatory life term that he actually received.surratt maintained that this difference entitled him to be resentenced.but congress set out certain conditions that must be met before a successive motion may be permitted,and surratt did not meet those required conditions.see h.we therefore denied him permission to file a successive motion.see in re surratt,cir,ecf.
in the district court,surratt had simultaneously filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under seeking the same relief.as a federal prisoner,however,surratt can not challenge his conviction and sentence under unless e also called the savings clause applies.the district court concluded that e did not in fact confer jurisdiction to consider surratt claim in a petition,so it denied surratt petition.
surratt now appeals from the judgment of the district court.we are not unsympathetic to his claim like the dissent,we recognize the gravity of a life sentence.however,congress has the power to define the scope of the writ of habeas corpus,and congress has exercised that power here to narrowly limit the circumstances in which a petition may be brought.surratt petition does not present one of the permitted circumstances.accordingly,we agree that the district court lacked jurisdiction under e to consider surratt petition and affirm the judgment below.
in,a grand jury indicted surratt on several counts,including conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base in violation of b a and.the government then filed a timely information indicating that it would seek enhanced penalties based on surratt criminal history.the government information identified four previous convictions,each in north carolina a conviction for felony possession of cocaine a conviction for felony possession of cocaine a conviction for felony possession of cocaine and maintaining a place for storage or sale and a conviction for sale and delivery of cocaine.if two or more of these convictions constituted felony drug offense s,then surratt faced a mandatory term of life imprisonment without release.see b a.
four months after his indictment,and despite the prospect of a life sentence,surratt pleaded guilty to the conspiracy count.he acknowledged in his written plea agreement that the district court could not impose a sentence below any statutory minimum unless the united states sought a reduction for substantial assistance.he also waived any rights to further appeals,save in a few narrow circumstances.surratt did not stipulate,however,to any prior felony drug convictions.
after surratt plea,but before his sentencing,we decided united states harp,cir,which held that a north carolina drug conviction qualified as a felony drug offense if the maximum aggravated sentence that the state court could have imposed for that crime upon a defendant with the worst possible criminal history exceeded one year.id.at.under harp,all surratt prior convictions constituted felony drug offenses.therefore,unless surratt offered substantial assistance to the government,surratt faced a mandatory life sentence.
the district court sentenced surratt to life imprisonment in october.initially,the court expressed some misgivings about a life sentence and questioned whether a different sentence would apply had it been free to consider the factors listed in a.but the government had declined to move for any reduction,as it regarded surratt cooperation as halfhearted at best.consequently,the district court determined that it was required to impose the life sentence because of surratt prior criminal history and his engagement in this drug trafficking and,for whatever reasons,his inability to render substantial assistance.we affirmed surratt sentence on appeal.united states surratt,app x,cir.surratt did not raise any claim in his direct appeal as to his mandatory life sentence.
surratt then moved for relief under in april.in that motion,surratt claimed that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel during his initial plea and sentence,and further sought a sentence reduction based on an amended sentencing guideline.he did not challenge his mandatory minimum sentence.the district court denied and dismissed the motion.surratt united states,wl.we denied surratt request for a certificate of appealability.united states surratt,app x,cir.
more than three years after surratt filed his first motion,we decided simmons.overruling harp,the simmons en banc majority held that a prior north carolina conviction will constitute a felony for purposes of an enhanced punishment only if the prior conviction was actually punishable for more than one year of imprisonment as to that defendant.at.surratt and the government agree that only one of surratt prior convictions would qualify as a felony drug offense under simmons.
seeking to take advantage of simmons,surratt sought relief in both this court and the district court in august.he first asked this court to permit him to file a second or successive motion.because surratt motion fell outside the statutorily enumerated exceptions permitting that type of motion,see.h,we denied him permission to file.see in re surratt,cir,ecf.on the same day that he filed that request,surratt also moved in the district court to vacate his sentence under and,or for writ of coram nobis.surratt maintained that,in light of simmons,he was innocent of the career offender enhancement and was a victim of fundamental error.in particular,surratt argued that he should not have been subject to a mandatory life sentence.the government did not oppose surratt request.
despite the parties agreement,the district court denied surratt motion.surratt united states,cr,cv,wl may.although it again expressed misgivings about surratt mandatory life sentence,the court determined that a federal prisoner may use to seek relief that h would otherwise bar only when a substantive change in the law coming after an initial petition rendered the prisoner original offense conduct.id.at.because surratt challenged only his sentence,the court concluded that he could not establish that simmons rendered any of his conduct noncriminal.therefore,he could not obtain relief under.
surratt appealed,arguing that the district court should have permitted him to proceed under.the government agreed and also elected not to enforce the appeal waiver in surratt plea agreement.therefore,in light of the government position,we appointed amicus curiae to defend the district court judgment.
in the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,congress circumscribed the ability of federal prisoners to request relief.see rhines weber.section provides the ordinary means for a federal prisoner to challenge his conviction or sentence.but in aedpa,congress limited the jurisdiction of federal courts to hear second or successive requests under.see,in re weathersby,cir congress placed strict limitations on second or successive motions under.
specifically,courts may hear second or successive petitions only if they pertain to newly discovered evidence clearly and convincingly establishing that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense or a new rule of constitutional law,made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the supreme court,that was previously unavailable.h.we have already held that surratt claim does not fall into either of these categories,so h does not permit him to file a second or successive motion under.
if a federal prisoner can not meet h requirements,then he may seek to file a traditional petition for writ of habeas corpus under.but that right carries significant limits as well.specifically,a prisoner may file a habeas petition under only if the collateral relief typically available under is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.prousalis moore,cir quoting e.if a federal prisoner brings a petition that does not fall within the scope of this savings clause,then the district court must dismiss the unauthorized habeas motion for lack of jurisdiction,rice rivera,cir,even if the government supports the prisoner position.
surratt is a federal prisoner who means to file a petition for relief.therefore,we must assess whether is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.e.we consider that question de novo.see yi fed.bureau of prisons,cir.we have jurisdiction over this appeal under.
we have determined that was inadequate or ineffective in only one prior instance.in that case,petitioner byron jones argued that bailey united states,rendered his convictions for use of a firearm during a drug offense invalid.in re jones,cir.bailey had overruled this circuit understanding of what it meant to use a firearm,id.at citing bailey,u.at,and jones contended that his conduct therefore did not amount to use under bailey reading of the term,id.at.jones,however,had already filed a motion before bailey,and h barred him from filing another one.id.at.we decided to award relief,deeming inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of a conviction when 
at the time of conviction,settled law of this circuit or the supreme court established the legality of the conviction subsequent to the prisoner direct appeal and first motion,the substantive law changed such that the conduct of which the prisoner was convicted is deemed not to be criminal and the prisoner can not satisfy the gatekeeping provisions of because the new rule is not one of constitutional law.
in short,jones opened a narrow gateway to relief for certain prisoners found actually innocent of their offenses of conviction,allowing relief only where the acts for which the defendant was convicted are not a crime.since then,we have focused on this aspect of jones actual innocence of a criminal act when characterizing the decision.see,farrow revell,app x,cir darden stephens,app x,cir rice,at united states poole,cir.other circuits also give substantial attention to the actual innocence aspect of jones when discussing it.see,bryant warden,fcc coleman medium,cir abernathy wandes,cir stephens herrera,cir abdullah hedrick,cir cephas nash,cir reyes requena united states,cir.
the dissent mistakenly tries to read the actual innocence requirement out of jones.that course ignores the clear limitation in jones that,before the case can be used to invoke e,the law must have changed such that the conduct of which the prisoner was convicted is deemed not to be criminal.at.the caveat was accidental,but drew from the fundamental recognition that actual innocence of a crime is different from other circumstances.indeed,jones agree d with the rationale of other courts that made this principle even more explicit.id.at see,triestman united states,cir permitting a bailey claim to be brought via in part because of the constitutional issues that would arise from refusing to hear an claim see also jones,at t hese courts have focused on the more fundamental defect presented by a situation in which an individual is incarcerated for conduct that is not criminal.were the dissent approach right,jones would permit any federal prisoner to bring any claim via in any instance where the law relevant to that claim changed in the petitioner favor at any time.that hardly describes a limited number of circumstances in which e would apply.jones,at.
jones simply does not apply here,as surratt is not innocent of anything.all parties agree that simmons did not decriminalize any part of surratt underlying conduct.surratt admits that he conspired to distribute drugs,the offense for which he was convicted.
he nevertheless argues that his predicate convictions constitute elements of a separate,aggravated offense for recidivists.if that proved true,we might say that surratt was not guilty of the prior conviction element,and therefore innocent of the recidivist offense.yet we do not treat a prior conviction as an element of the offense.almendarez torres united states,see also alleyne united states.indeed,the supreme court has consistently held that recidivism is not an element of the triggering crime.appleby warden,reg l jail corr.facility,cir.many good reasons justify this principle recidivism does not directly relate to the underlying charged conduct,courts may judicially notice convictions,prior convictions could prejudice the defendant if the government put them before the jury,and courts have treated recidivism as a sentencing factor for over years.see united states cheek,cir see also jones united states.
surratt insists that his sentence enhancements are different.they are not.we have treated the predicate convictions described in as sentencing enhancements,not elements of a separate crime.see,united states smith,cir accord jeanty warden,fci miami,cir united states ramirez,cir.the government did not charge the predicate convictions here in the indictment.and,had the case gone to trial,it would not have put them before a jury and proven them beyond a reasonable doubt.
we also do not believe that alleyne altered the longstanding rule treating predicate convictions as enhancements,not elements.alleyne held only that a jury must find certain facts that increase a mandatory minimum sentence.at.how alleyne would apply here remains something of a mystery,as the parties do not identify any authority indicating that the case could apply retroactively on collateral review.quite the contrary courts have held that alleyne does not apply retroactively.see united states olvera,cir we reiterate that alleyne does not apply retroactively.this decision accords with that of every circuit to have examined the issue,none of which has decided that alleyne is retroactive.
regardless,alleyne held that facts other than a prior conviction that increase a mandatory minimum amount to elements of the crime.at.the supreme court has specifically refused to apply this reasoning to prior convictions.id.at.so,almendarez torres remains good law,even after alleyne.united states mcdowell,cir.
to say that a petitioner can be actually innocent of a sentencing enhancement,rather than an element of the actual crime,would require a great deal of both verbal and logical gymnastics.turner warden coleman fci medium,cir see also,marrero ives,cir for purposes of the savings clause,a petitioner generally can not assert a cognizable claim of actual innocence of a noncapital sentencing enhancement.in re davenport,cir explaining that it would make an arbitrary hole in the antiterrorism act if the court were to accept an argument about a statute in re bradford,cir a claim of actual innocence of a career offender enhancement is not a claim of actual innocence of the crime of conviction and,thus,not the type of claim that warrants review under.
the traditional view of actual innocence focuses on the elements of the crime of conviction,see united states mikalajunas,cir,and nothing in jones deviates from that settled approach.sawyer whitley,remarking that,i n the context of a noncapital case,the concept of actual innocence is easy to grasp,as it means the defendant did not commit the charged crime.jones,after all,concerned conduct deemed not to be criminal,not conduct that remains criminal but subject to a lesser penalty.jones,at see also united states jones,cir innocence of conviction implicates the notion that a person has been incarcerated for a crime he did not commit,whereas a sentencing error does not at all implicate guilt.the supreme court,too,has not said that conduct is rendered lawful merely because the penalty for it is reduced.schriro summerlin,for example,found that ring arizona,did not render some formerly unlawful conduct lawful or vice versa,even though ring affected the length of sentences for some prisoners.so too here surratt remains as guilty today as he was in.
we recognize that we have applied broader concepts of actual innocence in other contexts.in united states pettiford,cir,drawing on earlier cases,we said that a defendant might establish actual innocence sufficient to excuse his procedural default if the defendant clearly showed that he had not committed the crime on which the calculation of his recidivist sentence was based.id.at see also mikalajunas,at united states maybeck,cir.in other words,pettiford and its predecessors suggested that,as to procedural default,a defendant might be actually innocent even if he is only innocent of a predicate conviction,not just the offense of conviction.but we have also explained that pettiford view of actual innocence should be confined to its original context.pettiford developed in the realm of procedural default,where we enjoy more latitude to shape our own rules and doctrines.we deal here,however,with a congressionally imposed statutory constraint that is not so amenable to ad hoc,exceptions.see jones,at holding that movant could not evade the f statute of limitations by claiming actual innocence of his sentence.we are especially reluctant to blaze broad pathways to e relief given that the provision constitutes only a narrow exception.cleaver maye,cir accord bryant,at hill werlinger,cir trenkler united states,cir.
even if we apply pettiford broader view,however,we still can not call surratt actually innocent.a ctual innocence,the supreme court has told us,means factual innocence,not mere legal insufficiency.bousley united states,see also united states tyler,cir while bousley addressed the standard that a petitioner must meet for claims brought under,this standard applies equally to actual innocence claims brought under.so,actual innocence applies in the context of habitual offender provisions only where the challenge to eligibility stems from factual innocence of the predicate crimes,and not from the legal classification of the predicate crimes.pettiford,at accord damon united states,cir mckay united states,cir.surratt does not suggest that he did not commit the crimes listed in the government original information.he only says simmons changed the relevance of those crimes in determining his later sentence.surratt argument constitutes the sort of argument about legal classification that we have deemed insufficient.
although jones does not present a portal through which surratt may pass to obtain relief,jones is not the exclusive route to e relief in all situations.as the government observes,we had no occasion in jones to consider whether sentencing errors like the one claimed here are redressable under the savings clause.gov t br.see also illinois lidster,explaining that general language in judicial opinions must be read as referring in context to circumstances similar to those then before the court.we must examine the text of the savings clause to decide whether the statute can afford surratt any relief.see united states neuhauser,cir starting with the text in a question of statutory interpretation.
the parties principally discuss whether surratt case presents a fundamental miscarriage of justice and then assume that this characterization could trigger the savings clause.certainly,in deciding whether to provide relief in an initial motion,we have considered whether a error involves a fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice.mikalajunas,at see also,united states martinez,cir.but we have never tied this miscarriage standard to the entirely separate question of relief via the savings clause.
such an approach would confuse the question of cognizability that is,what motions may be brought via generally with the separate question that we address here that is,what claims are barred by e.and the miscarriage standard addresses a different question in still another way.in particular,the court adopted the fundamental defect and miscarriage standard as a way of identifying those cases where a petitioner failure to bring his claim in his initial direct appeal could be excused.see reed farley.in contrast,e applies to prisoners who failed to bring their claims twice before on direct appeal and in their initial motion.thus,an interpretation of e focusing on a miscarriage of justice is less an argument for interpreting than it is one for amending.prost anderson,cir accord williams warden,fed.bureau of prisons,cir calling the miscarriage of justice standard plainly inapplicable to the question of whether e forecloses a particular petition perez stephens,app x,cir perez argument that the actual innocence and miscarriage of justice standards provide an exception to the savings clause requirement fails.
as an appellate court,we are not in the business of amending statutes.see dodd united states,indicating that the court was not free to rewrite the statute that congress has enacted even though the restrictions on petitions created the potential for harsh results in some cases.and holding that the miscarriage of justice standard opens the e portal would not just ignore the text of that section it would also erase the limitations on initial motions and second or successive motions found in f and h.
we hold that e text does not permit surratt to raise his claim under.and although the dissent insists that we act without any textual basis,dissenting op.at,we observe at least four separate textual factors in addition to the relevant provisions context and purpose that establish that surratt claim is foreclosed.
the savings clause first tells us that the remedy by a motion must be inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of surratt detention before he can proceed under.u.e emphasis added.we find congress deliberate use of the word test,rather than a more expansive term like guarantee or ensure,very meaningful.to test means to put to the proof.oxford english dictionary ed.in other words,the statutory text anticipates the opportunity to raise a challenge or argument.see,wag more dogs.liab.cozart,cir equating the government ability to test the plausibility of the claim with its ability to raise the relevant argument and offer particular evidence nlrb inter city advertising,cir saying that an employer had no way to test an administrative determination where it had no legal avenue to object.therefore,the clause is concerned with the petitioner an opportunity to bring his with nothing about what the opportunity promised will ultimately yield in terms of relief.prost,at see also taylor gilkey,cir agreeing that e use of the term test implies a focus on procedures rather than outcomes.we too have focused on the opportunity or unobstructed procedural shot afforded by,not on the ultimate result of a motion under that section,in defining the scope of the savings clause.rice,at.we have stressed that e will not permit an individual petition merely because the individual has been unable to obtain relief under or because an individual is procedurally barred from filing a motion.in re vial,cir.in,congress meant to provide a chance to be heard,not a right to prevail on any particular argument.see,cleaver,at offering an example of permissible savings clause relief in which the original sentencing court has been abolished or dissolved and the petitioner has nowhere to file a petition.
surratt clearly could have test ed the legality of his detention in his initial motion.surratt also chose to forego any challenge to his mandatory sentence on direct appeal.at both steps,then,he had the opportunity to claim that a lower mandatory sentence should have applied because he did not qualify as a drug felon.his choice to focus his motion on claims of ineffective assistance of counsel proves most important here,as he can not complain of his inability to test his detention in a proceeding when offered him that chance and he declined to take it.a prisoner can not be permitted to lever his way into section by making his section remedy inadequate.morales bezy,cir.
but surratt protests that the basis for his claim was foreclosed by circuit precedent at the time.opening br.that argument fails for at least two reasons.
as a factual matter,we can not know whether surratt claim might have led to relief because he never made it.we do know that many defendants filed suits prior to simmons asserting the exact same substantive claim that surratt now raises,including,of course,simmons himself.whiteside united states,cir en banc collecting cases.and indeed,t he nature of statutory interpretation requires that someone present the argument before the courts can define the law or,as in simmons,change it.bryan florendo,prost anderson and the enigmatic savings clause of when is a remedy by motion inadequate or ineffective,denv.
as a legal matter,courts do not permit petitioners special favors because the petitioners misjudged their claims as futile and chose not to present them in the first instance.in fact,the supreme court has held a dismissive attitude toward the contention that an argument legal futility is the same as a court inability to entertain the argument.brown caraway,cir easterbrook,statement concerning the circulation under circuit rule e.in the procedural default context,for instance,futility can not constitute cause if it means simply that a claim was unacceptable to that particular court at that particular time.bousley,at.futility also provides no basis to toll statute of limitations.see whiteside,at minter beck,cir same.the same principle applies here t he remedial vehicle was fully available and amply sufficient to test the argument,whether or not surratt thought to raise it.prost,at.admittedly,through simmons,a shift in the law has given increased relevance to a point made at the trial but not pursued on appeal.sunal large.but to permit this shift to open the gate to habeas relief would render litigation in these criminal cases interminable.whiteside,at noting that the myriad of substantive changes in law past the point of finality would cause a tectonic shift of resources if courts treated them as enough to evade procedural bars.
section e means to preserve a prisoner remedy,not his relief.see,tolliver dobre,cir we join our sister circuits that have held that a prior unsuccessful motion do es not make inadequate or ineffective.this distinction is reflected in other portions of the habeas statutes,where remedy similarly means an avenue or mechanism for relief,not the relief itself.see b a referring to exhaustion of state remedies see also vial,at referring to remedy as separate from its relief.that distinction likewise implies that what matters is the ability to make the request,not the ability to win it.
these reasons aside,we note that substantial practical difficulties could follow if we held that a prisoner could not test his detention because adverse circuit precedent once foreclosed his claim.neither surratt nor the government informs us,for instance,how clear circuit precedent must be before it forecloses the prisoner claim.perhaps,under the parties approach,analogous precedent might do perhaps not.nor do they tell us why our precedent alone forecloses an argument even though supreme court review remains available.and they do not explain when the foreclosure must arise.we find it better to avoid these questions by adhering to a more direct understanding of test.
as jones reflects,our interpretation of test yields in cases involving actual innocence of the crime of conviction.a thorny constitutional issue could result if no other avenue of judicial review were available for a party who claims that is factually or legally innocent as a result of a previously unavailable statutory interpretation.in re dorsainvil,cir accord triestman,at davis united states.for under our federal system it is only congress,and not the courts,which can make conduct criminal.bousley,at.generally,courts will construe a statute to avoid constitutional problems unless such construction is plainly contrary to the intent of congress.united states hamilton,cir.therefore,we read jones as an outgrowth of this constitutional avoidance doctrine.but because surratt presents no genuine claim of actual innocence of the crime of conviction,no thorny constitutional issues arise here.
in much the same way as test,the statute references to inadequacy and ineffectiveness tell us that e preserves only the chance to request relief,not the ultimate and absolute right to obtain it.
we see this notion in cases evaluating whether other substitute habeas remedies are adequate and effective.in swain pressley,the supreme court examined a provision of the district of columbia code that channeled collateral review of convictions in the superior court of the district of columbia back into that court rather than through federal courts via habeas review.in finding the provision adequate and effective,the court focused on the opportunity that the statute afforded,including the relief that the prisoner could request and the manner in which the court would consider his request.id.at.similarly,in boumediene bush,the court analyzed whether combatant status review tribunals afforded an adequate and effective substitute to habeas corpus for enemy combatants held at guantanamo bay,cuba.the court again concentrated on the opportunity that the substitute on the outcome,id.at,asking whether the sum total of procedural protections sufficed,id.at.these cases both make the same fundamental point the chance to argue a claim is the relevant criterion for adequacy and effectiveness,not any particular disposition of that claim.
when discussing effectiveness and adequacy in other areas of the law,we likewise focus on processes,not outcomes.we do not declare that counsel rendered ineffective assistance any time his particular argument fails and the client loses.similarly,a state appellate procedures satisfy the fourteenth amendment guarantee to an adequate and effective appeal so long as those procedures provide certain minimum safeguards.see smith robbins.when deciding whether we can enjoin a state criminal prosecution,we also must pass on whether the party seeking relief has an adequate remedy at law.trainor hernandez.in doing so,we consider whether the movant has an opportunity to raise and have timely decided the federal issues involved.id.at.these and other examples suggest that we should not assess effectiveness by weighing the historic outcome under that motion against the outcome we would reach today in an initial appeal from trial.we should instead ask only whether the procedures in provided a genuine opportunity for the petitioner to raise his present claim.
surratt never suggests that the mechanism denied him a chance to make his present argument.at best,he says only that our reading of b a did.see prost,f d at w henever legal error occurs it may very well mean circuit law is inadequate or deficient.but that does not mean the remedial vehicle is inadequate or ineffective to the task of testing the argument.we understand surratt reluctance to attack,as courts have upheld the statute as an adequate and effective means to challenge the detention of a federal prisoner for some years.united states hayman.but the point remains no deficiency in itself precluded surratt from lodging his sentencing challenge,so we can not call inadequate or ineffective here.
the savings clause also focuses on the legality of the relevant detention.especially in the context,courts have recognized unlawful or illegal sentences in a narrow subset of cases.actual innocence of the crime of conviction may present that sort of a case,as courts have long understood that a n imprisonment under a judgment becomes unlawful if that judgment be an absolute nullity.ex parte watkins,pet.and a sentence imposed above the proper statutory maximum might present another instance of an unlawful sentence,as the power to prescribe the punishments to be imposed upon those found guilty of federal crimes resides wholly with the congress.whalen united states,see also united states addonizio,accord sun bear united states,cir an unlawful or illegal sentence is one imposed without,or in excess of,statutory authority.united states gonzalez huerta,cir t he term illegal sentence is reserved for those instances where the term of incarceration exceeds the statutory maximum.
as we explained in another context,though,not every proceeding alleging a legal error in sentencing challenges that sentence as illegal.united states thornsbury,cir.we have said that illegal sentences involve much more fundamental issues such as challenges claiming a district court exceeded its authority,claiming that a sentence was based on a constitutionally impermissible factor such as race,or claiming a violation of the right to counsel.id.in like manner,the supreme court explained that a sentence was not illegal where,among other things,t he punishment meted out was not in excess of that prescribed by the relevant statutes and multiple terms were not imposed for the same offense.hill united states,accord united states pavlico,cir.
in accordance with this view,courts largely have not recognized an illegal detention one that would trigger the savings clause where the defendant challenges a sentence within the correct statutory maximum.see,united states powell,cir king,dissenting in part and concurring in part indicating that a sentence would be lawful if it falls within the unenhanced statutory maximum.the sixth circuit noted this general rule,for example,in holding that the defendants claims did not fall within any arguable construction of the savings clause.united states peterman,cir.the eleventh circuit likewise held that a federal prisoner could not bring a claim that would otherwise be barred by h in a petition where the asserted error resulted in a longer sentence not exceeding the statutory maximum.gilbert united states,cir en banc see also bryant,at a ny challenge to a sentence that is already below the authorized statutory maximum could not open the e portal.accord trenkler,at labeling petitioner claim incompatible with engagement of the savings clause where he did not charge that his life sentence wa s beyond the statutory maximum for the crimes of conviction.for a time,at least,even the government agreed that a federal petition.see wilson wilson,wl,at,quoting the position of the united states that savings clause relief is foreclosed for an erroneous sentence within the statutory maximum.that view also comports with scope,which provides sentencing relief only in cases involving violations of statutes establishing maximum sentences.united states pregent,cir.
this widely held view of legality should foreclose surratt claim.he never suggests that he received a sentence above the applicable statutory maximum.he can not.all parties agree that surratt has at least one prior felony drug conviction,regardless of simmons.a defendant like surratt who violates and after a single prior conviction for a felony drug offense has become final shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment which may not be less than years and no more than life imprisonment.b a.
surratt often emphasizes that his sentence is without parole,but that does not create any special issue.in the present federal system,life imprisonment is equivalent to life without parole in every case.see richmond polk,cir t he sentencing reform act of abolished parole for federal offenses committed after november.see also b stating that prisoners serving life sentences are not entitled to a deduction for good time credits.when congress abolished parole in,it essentially translate d every life sentence into life without possibility of parole.united states gonzalez,cir.thus,surratt life sentence does not exceed the maximum that the district court could have imposed had simmons been issued before surratt sentencing.in other words,surratt sentence does not offend the limits of punishment,such that we could question his detention legality.
tacitly recognizing the weakness of his position under the majority view,surratt urges us to adopt a distinct minority view that he considers persuasive.opening br.citing brown.
but even under this outlier decision,surratt can not prevail.in brown,the seventh circuit permitted a prisoner to challenge the length of his sentence through a petition even though that sentence fell below the statutory maximum.id.at.but brown concerned a sentence imposed under the formerly mandatory guidelines regime.see id.stressing that the defendant was sentenced in the era citing united states booker.for the seventh believed that at least when courts treated the guidelines as mandatory the only lawful sentence was a g uidelines sentence.id.regardless of whether the seventh circuit correctly characterized the former guidelines regime and we need not say here whether it did,see gilbert,at,its view on the issue exists in harmony with the approach taken by all other courts.quite simply,the seventh circuit believed that it could permit a petition because,at least,an unjustified sentence equated to a sentence above the statutory maximum.the top of the guidelines range provided the relevant maximum sentence,and brown sentence exceeded the maximum guidelines sentence.in contrast,in cases involving the advisory guidelines,even the seventh circuit recognizes that courts can not correct sentencing errors in proceedings,under or otherwise,if the sentence is below the statutory maximum.hawkins united states,cir.
here,the district court sentenced surratt under the,advisory guidelines scheme.as a result,his life sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum sentence,and even brown would afford him no relief.thus,we can not deem his detention illegal.
pointing to the savings clause reference to detention,surratt suggests congress meant to permit claims like his.but congress used the term sentence in some portions of,see a b,and conviction or offense in other parts,id.f,h.it chose not to use those terms in the savings clause,id.e,and we are obligated to give effect to congress decision to use different language in proximate subsections of the same statute.united states brandon,cir.we think the statutory term detention is yet another textual indication that e bars surratt petition it draws a line not between conviction and sentencing challenges,but between permissible challenges to executive acts and impermissible challenges to the acts of other branches of government.
detention concerns the act of physically confining or restraining an individual.see,oxford english dictionary ed.keeping in custody or confinement.black law dictionary ed.the act or an instance of holding a person in custody confinement or compulsory delay.physical confinement stands separate and apart from the sentence,and some detentions that may give rise to a habeas petition do not follow criminal sentences at all.detentions provide one common example,see e,but other instances come to mind,including detentions in instances of civil contempt,detentions in connection with immigration proceedings,detentions of material witnesses,or civil detention of sexually dangerous persons,see neuhauser,at.rather than being tied in all cases to a sentence as criminal punishment,then,e reference to detention speaks to physical restraint of a person liberty.
in contrast to the rendering of a criminal sentence by the judiciary,the physical holding of a federal prisoner represents an executive function,a keeping back or withholding by the executive branch.see samak warden,fcc coleman medium,cir pryor,concurring.the attorney general,acting through the bureau of prisons,acts as the detainer,and the sentencing court does not involve itself in keeping the prisoner restrained.see a explaining that the bureau of prisons has the responsibility to detain a person who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment until the expiration of the term imposed,or until earlier released for satisfactory behavior see also,janko gates,agreeing with a party concession that courts ordinarily do detain people.we see this concept in action in those instances where congress precluded the sentencing court from involving itself too much in the ongoing aspects of a detention.see united states wilson,holding that a sentencing court may not calculate credit for time already spent in custody,as that task belongs to the attorney general see also,united states ceballos,cir t he sentencing court has no jurisdiction to select the place where the sentence will be served.authority to determine place of confinement resides in the executive branch of government.
even the venue provisions of and reflect an executive versus dichotomy.a petitioner must bring his petition in the district of confinement,where the court can summon the warden to defend his actions.in contrast,a petitioner must move for relief before the district court that sentenced him,where the sentencing court and the original prosecuting united states attorney may bring their expertise to bear.
a challenge to detention through e should therefore focus on acts of the executive branch,rather than the judicial branch.see munaf geren,habeas is at its core a remedy for unlawful executive detention.ins cyr,same accord samak,at pryor,concurring trenkler,at.hence,a attack on detention lodged through e should entail a challenge to the right and authority of the executive to keep the individual in custody or the manner in which the executive executes the detention.that reading serves the historic purposes of the writ as well.boumediene,at the suspension clause protects the rights of the detained by affirming the duty and authority of the judiciary to call the jailer to account.
focusing on the executive power of restraint draws a clear line a line consistent with petitions under.for example,we have previously noted that petitioners can challenge the bureau of prison calculation of good time credits.see yi,at.that makes sense if a prisoner deserves credits but the bureau of prisons denies them,then an error by the executive may cause the warden to hold the prisoner without authority that is,beyond the time prescribed by congress and the sentencing court.see preiser rodriguez,finding that prisoners petition concerning credits fell squarely within th e traditional scope of habeas corpus because t hey alleged that the deprivation of their credits was causing or would cause them to be in illegal physical confinement emphasis added.similarly,when federal sentencing allowed for parole,provided a vehicle to challenge parole revocation.see vial,at.a detainee might also invoke if he is not timely arraigned or tried in that situation,the warden acts of continuing to detain the prisoner could render the detention improper under the fifth and sixth amendments.see united states tootle,cir.and the same principle may explain our decision in jones if a change in law renders the prisoner conduct,then the warden would have no authority to hold the defendant.
contrast these commonly accepted claims with surratt present one,which has little to do with any action.by all accounts,the warden is holding surratt under a validly entered sentencing order.surratt does not suggest that the warden is violating his statutory or constitutional rights.and the warden is detaining surratt pursuant to a sentence that congress empowered the district court to impose that is,a sentence within the statutory limits.surratt petition does not therefore attack any act of detention by the executive branch.thus,congress would not have expected federal prisoners to bring this type of a claim in a petition via the savings clause.
the broader context of further convinces us that surratt can not invoke.s tatutory construction is a holistic endeavor,and we therefore must evaluate the statutory language itself,the specific context in which such statutory language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.donnelley united states,cir.particularly in proceedings like this one,context often proves decisive.see,taylor,at relying in part on the history of e to reject a putative petition.
if surratt were permitted to raise his sentencing challenge in a petition,we would thwart almost every one of the careful limits that congress placed on challenges to a federal prisoner sentence.and we would do so in a broad class of cases.quite simply,congress would have accomplished nothing at all in its attempts through statutes like aedpa to place limits on federal collateral review.triestman,at.this comprehensive conflict between surratt view and so many different parts of the statute convinces us that we are not pick ing and choos ing some parts of the statute over others,as the dissent alleges.instead,we are simply constru ing all parts to have meaning.united states briley,cir.
if we embraced surratt position,then the limits found in h would first fall.that section provides that a prisoner may bring a second or successive motion only if the prisoner produces newly discovered evidence of actual innocence or relies upon a new rule of constitutional law,made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the supreme court,that was previously unavailable.h.the prisoner can not bring his second or successive motion until we grant him a certificate of authorization indicating that the motion satisfies one of these two conditions.id.when congress adopted h,it was undoubtedly aware that prisoners might wish to press other sorts of arguments,that is,arguments other than actual innocence or constitutional error,in second or successive motions.prost,at.nevertheless,congress decided to bar those other arguments outright.surratt,however,means to bring one of the very claims that congress foreclosed,albeit under a different caption.that course would produce an illogical,if not absurd,result h restrictions would continue to apply to prisoners bringing congressionally preferred claims,while no restrictions would apply to prisoners bringing claims that congress did not contemplate at all.surratt version of e would then return us,at least in part,to the world,where prisoners could file as many collateral attacks as they please d,provided that they did abuse the writ.taylor,at.
moreover,surratt premises his claim on a decision,even though h specifically states that only a retroactive supreme court decision should open the door to successive relief.no court has permitted a petitioner to bring a claim via the savings clause premised only on a change in authority.instead,the available authority all requires supreme court precedent.see tyler,at listing an intervening supreme court decision as one of several facts required to bring a claim via the savings clause kenemore roy,cir stating that a claim brought via the savings clause must be based on a retroactively applicable supreme court decision davenport,at noting an obvious qualification that a change of law could not qualify a prisoner to seek relief unless the change of law w as made retroactive by the supreme court wofford scott,cir t he only sentencing claims that may conceivably be covered by the savings clause are those based upon a retroactively applicable supreme court decision overturning circuit precedent.
holding otherwise would elevate circuit court precedent to the level of retroactive supreme court precedent without any congressional authority to do so.the government once recognized this point,too.see brief for the respondent in opposition at,williams hastings,wl arguing that the savings clause applies to petitions raising certain sentencing errors when the error is revealed by a retroactively applicable decision of the supreme court.in pressing a contrary position,the best case the dissent can summon is one in which another circuit court permitted a petition to be brought based on an assumedly retroactive supreme court decision.see light caraway,cir.given that surratt case involves no supreme court decision at all,that case strikes us as irrelevant.
surratt concept of retroactivity produces other anomalous results.under his approach,a petitioner invoking a new statutory interpretation from the fourth circuit could file immediately for relief,with no need to wait for a declaration of retroactivity.meanwhile,a petitioner invoking a new constitutional rule promulgated by the supreme court would have to wait for an explicit statement from that court rendering the rule retroactive.see tyler cain,the new rule becomes retroactive,not by the decisions of the lower court or by the combined action of the supreme court and the lower courts,but simply by the action of the supreme court.we resist attributing to congress an intention to render a statute so internally inconsistent.greenlaw united states.
movants under must also comply with a statute of limitations,f,and this provision would also fall victim to surratt view.a prisoner hamstrung by f could file a petition,as contains no statute of limitations.we only recently held,en banc,that the supposed futility of raising a simmons like claim before we decided simmons would not permit an untimely motion raising that sort of claim.see whiteside,at.but if surratt proved correct,then that decision would mean next to nothing.a different caption on his otherwise timebarred petition would permit the federal prisoner to go forward.
were we to adopt surratt view,the differing venue provisions in and would also invite mischief in circumstances like these.a prisoner sentenced in this circuit would file his initial motion here.if that motion failed,and the prisoner happened to be held in a different circuit as so often happens in the federal prison system,then the prisoner could seek relief via in that circuit.one of two unusual things would then happen the court would either apply the law of a different circuit to assess where the prisoner petition stands,see,samak,at,or it would apply its own law,see,united states wyatt,cir.either way,any number of inconsistent results could flow from this disjointed approach.by contrast,if challenges like surratt are confined to the motions,then only the sentencing court will consider them,and the motion will only implicate our circuit law.
surratt interpretation of the savings clause would also have strange implications for appeal rights.congress has the power to preclude any appeal from an order dismissing a writ of habeas corpus,since a party to a suit has no vested right to an appeal.united states brooks,cir.and congress exercised that power a movant can not appeal the district court decision on his motion unless the district or circuit court first grants a certificate of appealability.see c b.that certificate only issues when the movant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.see id.c see also jennings stephens,thomas,dissenting one of the key ways in which aedpa encourages finality is to narrow the scope of appellate review by requiring habeas petitioners to obtain certificates of appealability.so,a movant who raises a simmons claim might be unable to appeal because his claim does not present constitutional issues.see united states hadden,cir b ecause a certificate of appealability will not issue for allegations of error,he would not be able to obtain appellate review of any purely statutory errors at his sentencing.accord young united states,cir united states christensen,cir mateo united states,cir united states brooks,cir.but contains no such limits on appeal.therefore,applying surratt reading of the savings clause,a petitioner could evade congress conscious constraint on appellate review just by filing a petition,losing,and then exercising his automatic entitlement to appellate review.
we should not allow the savings clause to create a detour around restrictions,as those restrictions would then be rendered a nullity.reyes requena,at trenkler,at the strictures of section can not be sidestepped by the simple expedient of resorting to some more exotic writ.accordingly,we decline to dismantle the protections that congress created in by adopting surratt expansive reading of the savings clause.
lastly,we must take account of congress general purpose in enacting the various provisions at issue.see broughman carver,cir accord mccreary cnty.aclu,examination of purpose is a staple of statutory interpretation that makes up the daily fare of every appellate court in the country.congressional purpose confirms that e does not apply to cases like this one.
our narrower reading of the savings clause preserves one of the most important purposes that aedpa sought to serve finality.although aedpa serves multiple objectives,including comity,finality,and federalism,williams taylor,the foremost aedpa goal the act central concern is congress intent that the merits of concluded criminal proceedings not be revisited in the absence of a strong showing of actual innocence,calderon thompson.surratt and the dissent both seek to untether e from any actual innocence requirement.instead,they would have us create a new rule contradicting congress chief goal in enacting aedpa one that would apply to most any imaginable sentencing enhancement that we later believe could have erroneously increased a petitioner sentence.we see few limiting principles in that kind of rule,and take little comfort in surratt assurances that it would apply in only a few cases so long as he receives relief here.
further,even before aedpa,the concern with finality served by the limitation on collateral attack ha d special force with respect to convictions,like surratt,based on guilty pleas.united states timmreck,see also united states fugit,cir discussing the historical importance of finality,especially as to guilty pleas.plea agreements work only if dispositions by guilty plea are accorded a great measure of finality.blackledge allison.thus,a voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty made by an accused person,who has been advised by competent counsel,usually may not be collaterally attacked.mabry johnson.this rule holds even when the law later changes in the petitioner favor,as the possibility of a favorable change in the law occurring after a plea is one of the normal risks that accompan y a guilty plea.united states archie,cir.
undeniably,the federal government,no less than the states,has an interest in the finality of its criminal judgments.united states frady.for w thout finality,the criminal law is deprived of much of its deterrent effect.teague lane.a procedural system which permits an endless repetition of inquiry into facts and law implies a lack of confidence about the possibilities of justice that can not but war with the effectiveness of underlying substantive commands.mccleskey zant,accord custis united states,i nroads on the concept of finality tend to undermine confidence in the integrity of our procedures.see also henry friendly,is innocence irrelevant collateral attack on criminal judgments,chi,the proverbial man from mars would surely think we must consider our system of criminal justice terribly bad if we are willing to tolerate such efforts at undoing judgments of conviction.a waning of confidence would follow if we revisited convictions repeatedly,especially when the defendant conceded his guilt.it seems even odder to revisit convictions where,as here,the petitioner accepted an appeal waiver in his plea agreement.even though the government has chosen not to enforce that waiver,its presence means that surratt expected to have no later chance for any kind of review when he first agreed to plea guilty.
although one might find it tempting to put finality concerns aside for the sake of notions of fairness,we have recognized that there are dangers in subordinat ing finality to the equities of the individual case,especially if so vague a term as fairness is to be the touchstone.in re under seal,cir.courts also have never defined the scope of the writ of habeas corpus simply by reference to a perceived need to assure that an individual accused of crime is afforded a trial free of constitutional,let alone statutory,error.teague,at.no doubt,if we put finality aside when it suited us,we would invite a disquieting indeterminacy into our judicial system.and it hard to see where this fairness exception would end.so,w e do not pause to consider whether a statute differently conceived and framed would yield results more consonant with fairness and reason.we take the statute as we find it.anderson wilson,u.
finality offers tangible benefits for the judicial system.at the very least,it ensures that court resources focus on the initial trial and appeal stage.in contrast,i f every favorable precedential decision could become a ticket to being resentenced,the criminal justice system would need to continually marshal resources in order to keep in prison defendants whose trials and appeals and sentences conformed to constitutional and statutory standards.whiteside,at.finality also provides closure to victims and the defendant it assures the victim that his assailant will be punished,while it directs the defendant to move on with his life.and finality provides important incentives to litigants.if defendants know that they can not raise arguments more than once,then they will exercise greater diligence and invoke whatever rights they may have early on.see wainright sykes.
we decline to dispense with these many benefits deriving from aedpa central objective of finality by accepting surratt view of e.
invoking the canon of constitutional avoidance,surratt suggests that we must permit his petition because a failure to do so would present substantial constitutional concerns.specifically,he argues that denying him relief under e would raise questions related to due process,equal protection,principles,and the suspension clause.we disagree.
the canon of constitutional avoidance is an ill fit to this case.the canon is a tool for choosing between competing plausible interpretations of a provision.warger shauers.it has no application in the absence of ambiguity.id.as we have already explained,though,we see no ambiguity in e when it comes to surratt sentence.further,surratt attacks read like constitutional challenges to itself.but here again,t he canon of constitutional avoidance is not a method of adjudicating constitutional questions by other means.united states apel.nor does avoidance grant a permission slip to interpret statutes by gerrymandering them with a list of exceptions that happen to describe a party case,which strikes us as just the sort of thing that surratt means us to do.
ultimately,though,if the statute does not raise constitutional concerns,then there is no basis for employing the canon of constitutional avoidance.rodriguez robbins,cir accord united states dwinells,cir united states ex rel.long scs bus.tech.with no need for avoidance,we can rest assured that we have given e the correct reading.
we first conclude that our interpretation of e presents no colorable issue under the suspension clause.that provision of the constitution states that t he privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended,unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.const.art.i,cl.the suspension clause ensures that,except during periods of formal suspension,the judiciary will have a device,the writ,to maintain the delicate balance of governance that is itself the surest safeguard of liberty.boumediene,at.
as the government observes,the suspension clause may not apply here at all.neither the supreme court nor this court has decided whether the suspension clause protects the writ as it existed in or the writ as it exists today.see boumediene,at reserving the issue cyr,at same.sitting en banc,we hinted that the clause might very well protect only the former and not the latter.see vial,at.if that proves to be the case that is,if the suspension clause protects only the version,then surratt suspension clause argument fails.see morales,at lindh murphy,cir en banc,rev on other grounds,united states anselmi,cir.the original form of the writ did not afford relief of the type sought here.see ex parte yerger,wall,accord brown allen,jackson,concurring in result laguerre reno,cir.
in the end,we need not settle the particular question of whether the suspension clause protects the writ in its or century form.our reading of e sufficiently respects the writ in either event.t he substitution of a collateral remedy which is neither inadequate nor ineffective to test the legality of a person detention does not constitute a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.swain,at.here,itself serves as the relevant substitute.and by holding that presents an adequate and effective substitute means to test surratt detention,we have likewise ensured that no suspension clause issue exists.see hayman,at refusing to consider any constitutional attack on because the presence of the savings clause avoids those issues see also medberry crosby,cir section e avoided any serious question about whether the replacement of the writ of habeas corpus for a federal prisoner with the new caused an unconstitutional suspension of the writ.reyes requena,at noting that e ameliorates any suspension clause issues.as our preceding discussion should have made plain,surratt had a full opportunity under to make the claim that he makes here,but simply chose not to do so.
perhaps surratt means to attack our reading of e together with other limits found in,such as h limits on second or successive petitions.but that sort of attack would fare no better.stressing that judgments about the proper scope of the writ are normally for congress to make,the supreme court has held that analogous restrictions do not amount to a suspension of the writ.felker turpin.r estrictions on successive petitions constitute a modified res judicata rule,a restraint on what is called in habeas corpus practice abuse of the writ.id.in short,restrictions on multiple motions for relief amount to an entirely proper exercise of congress judgment regarding the proper scope of the writ.vial,at.and the reasoning of the supreme court with respect to limitations on second and successive habeas petitions pursuant to applies with equal force to the identical language in.id.at accord gilbert,at united states.barrett,cir see also justin marceau,challenging the habeas process rather than the result,lee,t he suspension clause is much less directly implicated by efforts to file multiple habeas petitions.
nor does a suspension clause problem develop whenever a prisoner is unable to take advantage of a later,favorable case.congress can,without offending the suspension clause,narrow the source of law cognizable on habeas review.green french,cir,abrogated on other grounds,williams taylor.and the narrowing here flows from an distinction in the law between actions previously taken and those yet to come.armour city of indianapolis,solem stumes,r etroactive application is not compelled,constitutionally or otherwise.wainwright stone,holding that state prisoner was not constitutionally entitled to the benefit of a new interpretation of a state criminal statute.therefore,the suspension clause is not offended in this case.
the approach we take to the savings clause also does not give rise to the sort of due process concerns identified in hicks oklahoma.in hicks,a state court jury was erroneously required to impose a sentence of forty years once they found the defendant guilty.id.at.on direct appeal,the state appellate court deemed the mandatory prison term unconstitutional but declined to vacate the sentence.id.at.the supreme court determined that decision to be a due process violation,as the state court unwillingness to correct the error deprived hicks of a liberty interest in a jury determination.id.at.given the somewhat unusual circumstances of the case,courts have read it to provide a rather narrow rule.simpson norris,cir.
several factors indicate that the due process concerns addressed in hicks do not arise here.
first,hicks involved sentencing by a jury this case does not.courts aggressively protect the jury historic role as an intermediary between the state and criminal defendants.alleyne.at see also blakely washington,just as suffrage ensures the people ultimate control in the legislative and executive branches,jury trial is meant to ensure their control in the judiciary.jones,at describing the historic development of the jury as a check on overly severe sentences.the framers,too,chose to emphasize the importance of the jury by separately enshrining its role in the sixth amendment.in other words,we show a special solicitousness towards claims that a mistake has tread upon the jury crucial role.hicks reflects that concept.it would not therefore apply in cases,like this one,that do not implicate the jury right.indeed,the supreme court has narrowly read hicks to hold only that where state law creates for the defendant a liberty interest in having the jury make particular findings,the due process clause implies that appellate findings do not suffice to protect that entitlement.cabana bullock,emphasis added,abrogated on other grounds by pope illinois,accord people gonzales,cal hicks is limited to the jury trial context.
hicks also involved two distinguishable types of constitutional error.the supreme court intervened where a lower court identified constitutional error at the time of sentencing but refused to do anything about it.thus,hicks presented problems at both sentencing and on appeal.the separate,unrectified error at sentencing might have been what compelled the court to act.see johnson rosemeyer,cir see also hicks,at rehnquist,dissenting concluding that the court should not have intervened because the defendant had not actually established constitutional error at trial.yet here,no one suggests that surratt sentence was unconstitutional,now or then.there is no separate error.in fact,no one suggests that his sentence was unlawful at the time that the district court imposed it in any way.
but perhaps as importantly,hicks concerned an error identified on direct review.it is one thing to say that an appellate court violates due process when it refuses to correct an error in a sentence.in that sort of case,the appellate court unwillingness to act renders appellate review a meaningless exercise.but it is quite another to say that due process requires us to reach back and correct a sentence that is in every sense final and was proper at the time imposed because we now believe that the district court misconceived the judicial dist.osborne,a criminal defendant proved guilty after a fair trial does not have the same liberty interests as a free man.that result implies a right to collateral review and relief that we do not believe exists.see united states maccollom,plurality opinion the due process clause of the fifth amendment certainly does not establish any right to collaterally attack a final judgment of conviction.herrera collins,pennsylvania.and,in prior cases,courts have not assumed that due process mandates relief whenever the sentencing judge might have failed to recognize the full scope of his discretion.see united states fox,cir t here is no due process right to individualized sentencing.the enormous body of cases refusing to award relief premised on booker which held that district courts have discretion to sentence outside the sentencing guidelines,see at provides perhaps the most compelling testimony to that fact.see united states morris,cir holding that booker is not available for relief for federal prisoners whose convictions became final before booker was decided.
hicks,then,gives us no reason for pause,and we find surratt due process argument to be without merit.
our reading of the savings clause also does not give rise to concerns.surratt contends that we tread upon congress right to define the relevant criminal punishment by denying him habeas relief the dissent agrees.yet neither surratt nor the dissent provides us with a case in which a court has identified a problem in connection with a sentence levied within the applicable statutory range,as was surratt sentence.a person who has been so convicted is eligible for,and the court may impose,whatever punishment is authorized by statute for his offense.chapman united states.surratt received that sentence.
if we were to embrace surratt contrary position,we would transform every alleged error related to statutory interpretation into a issue of constitutional dimension.the writ would become a catchall for perceived errors big and small.such an outcome would be plainly inconsistent with the remedy traditional scope.while the habeas remedy is in this comprehensive,it does not encompass all claimed errors in conviction and sentencing.addonizio,at.all the more so when the district court endeavored to comply with congress wishes by applying a understanding of congressionally imposed mandatory minimums.see united states jackson,explaining congress appropriately exercises its power to fix penalties when it imposes mandatory minimums.
we must also remain aware of competing concerns fundamental principles of separation of powers preclude us from ignoring the plain terms of the savings clause.in every case,t he function of the judiciary is to apply the law,not to rewrite it to conform with the policy positions of litigants.mort ranta gorman,cir.and we must act with a special sensitivity to that role while grappling with statutes,as they reflect a balancing of objectives sometimes controversial,which is normally for congress to make.lonchar thomas.we find no benefit to trampling on congress power to define the scope of the writ because of an unjustified fear of violating principles.
finally,no problems result from our decision.the fourteenth amendment equal protection clause protects an individual from being treated differently,not simply wrongly,by the government.sansotta town of nags head,cir.although that particular clause does not apply directly to the federal government,the approach to fifth amendment equal protection claims has always been precisely the same as to equal protection claims under the fourteenth.weinberger wiesenfeld.
surratt evidently thinks that an problem arises because some district courts in different cases have granted relief to some petitioners.but the difference alone does not give rise to an issue.the supreme court has said time and again that the fifth and fourteenth amendment s do not assure uniformity of judicial decisions or immunity from judicial error.beck washington.a disagreement between the courts on the interpretation of a statute is a matter which either the supreme court or congress should resolve it does not violate the equal protection rights of the person subjected to the more burdensome interpretation.hawkins agric.mktg,cir.besides that,b oth the fifth and the fourteenth amendments address legislative discrimination and not discrimination on the basis of particular opinions issued by the federal judiciary.united states brown,d.so,surratt has given us no reason to believe that equal protection concepts even apply here.
surratt also observes that defendants have obtained relief in cases in which they had not previously filed a motion.opening br.the difference in outcomes between these two groups of defendants does not stem from our present decision.in fact,this court precedents suggest that the other defendants should not obtain relief from their untimely motions.see whiteside,at.the government has waived the otherwise applicable in some of those cases,as it can do,and this intermittent waiver has produced disparate outcomes in somewhat similar cases.but the difference in treatment stems from the executive branch actions,not those of the judicial branch.we do not mean to imply that the government actions create any equal protections problems of their own in all likelihood,they do not.see united states venable,cir explaining that the government ordinarily has wide latitude in deciding whether to prosecute as long as it does not bas e the decision on an unjustifiable standard such as race,religion,or other arbitrary classification.but we can confidently conclude that our reading of e has nothing to do with equal protection.
for the reasons described above,we conclude that the district court lacked jurisdiction under e to consider surratt petition.
congress holds the power to define the scope of the writ of habeas corpus.it also holds an attendant power to define exceptions to the normal rule of finality of convictions and sentences that were lawfully imposed at the time that they were entered.we are firmly convinced that congress did not contemplate any exception for a case like this one.certainly,surratt mandatory minimum sentence was higher than the one he would have faced after simmons.but surratt had the opportunity to test the legality of that sentence in his direct appeal and initial motion,and he chose not to take it.he also is not actually innocent of his offense of conviction,or even the predicate offenses that dictated his enhanced sentence.and his sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum that congress set for his offense of conviction.
we can not alter congress decision to deny jurisdiction.nor can we rewrite habeas law for the sake of a sympathetic case.t he guidance of the supreme court and congress is clear and,in this situation,ties our hands.united states foote,cir.and by the same token,the government support of the petitioner also can not,a confession of error from the government does not relieve this court of the performance of the judicial function o ur judicial obligations compel us to examine independently the errors confessed.
still,the hands of congress and the executive branch are not constrained in the same way as those of the judiciary.congress may amend and permit us to hear cases like this one,if it so chooses.and the government,which initiated this criminal prosecution and filed the information that led to surratt enhanced sentence,can assist surratt in seeking a commutation from the president.see const.art.ii,cl.indeed,the president has shown a recent willingness to grant frequent commutations in other drugs cases.see,sari horwitz and juliet eilperin,obama cuts sentences of inmates,july,at juliet eilperin,obama commutes sentences of drug offenders.post,at katie zezima,obama commutes prison sentence of eight federal drug offenders.post,at david nakamura,obama commutes unduly harsh terms.post,at.
we also stress that our decision today is limited to the particular facts of this case.we do not decide whether,for instance,a federal prisoner might bring a petition claiming that the district court unlawfully sentenced him to a term of imprisonment exceeding the statutory maximum.nor do we mean to say anything about the types of claims that prisoners might bring in an initial motion.and we do not determine whether a change in law stemming from a retroactively applicable supreme court decision might offer relief beyond the circumstances already identified in jones.needless to say,we therefore disagree with the dissent suggestion that our limited determination renders the savings clause a complete nullity.see dissenting op.at.
given our disposition,we also need not decide whether an appeal waiver like the one found in surratt plea agreement could foreclose relief via the savings clause,as the amicus alternatively argued.we leave those issues for another day.
the district court judgment is therefore 
raymond surratt will die in prison because of a sentence that the government and the district court agree is undeserved and unjust.the district court sentenced surratt to life in prison only because it thought it was required to do so pursuant to a statutory mandatory minimum.as it turns out,the correct statutory range for surratt crime was a minimum of twenty years,and a maximum of life.
the majority thinks its hands are tied because surratt received only a life sentence,and not more than the statutory maximum.but the only option beyond a life sentence is death.by foreclosing any avenue for relief,the majority essentially punishes surratt for not having received the death penalty.it leaves him to spend the rest of his life in prison a death sentence of a different kind.in doing so,the majority renders the savings clause a complete nullity in violation of the suspension clause.
it is not just a sentence above the statutory maximum that presents a fundamental defect.life is not always so neat.when a punishment involves a complete deprivation of liberty,then even a sentence exactly at,but not exceeding,the statutory maximum can constitute an extraordinary miscarriage of justice of constitutional magnitude.in such cases,we must allow a prisoner to invoke the savings clause if the great writ,which has always been a bulwark against convictions that violate fundamental fairness,engle.isaac,is to mean anything at all.i dissent.
surratt was years old when he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute cocaine.the guidelines recommended a maximum penalty of years,yet the court imposed a life sentence.it did so while stating that it believed a life sentence to be undeserved and unjust.as the district court also remarked,it thought it had no other option pursuant to the statutory,lifetime term prescribed by the controlled substances act csa for anyone with two or more predicate felony drug offenses.see b a.
a few years after surratt first motion,in a case remanded to us from the supreme court,we corrected our mistaken understanding of just what constitutes a qualifying felony for federal sentencing purposes in united states simmons,cir en banc.both parties agree that under our simmons decision,see miller united states,cir,surratt possesses only one csa predicate felony.the statutory mandatory minimum for someone with one qualifying offense is not is actually the statutory maximum.id.b a.
given the difference between twenty years and life,surratt asks to be resentenced.remarkably,the government agrees with surratt.both parties agree that surratt is legally ineligible to spend the rest of his life in prison.given this mistake that the parties agree is of constitutional magnitude,the parties further agree that surratt is entitled to relief from the very sentence that the district court unambiguously stated it would not have imposed absent the erroneous statutory mandatory minimum.they agree the mechanism to do so is by motion via the savings clause of e.
the framers viewed freedom from unlawful restraint as a fundamental precept of liberty,and they understood the writ of habeas corpus as a vital instrument to secure that freedom.boumediene bush.accordingly,the prohibition on suspension of the writ is contained in the very blueprint of our nation,the constitution itself.const.art.i,cl.
the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus has remained central to our justice system even as the statutory scheme codifying the writ has undergone several transformations over the years.boumediene,at explaining that our framers recognized a necessity to secure the writ and ensure its place in our legal system.even when congress added to the relief statutes in,it did so in an effort to improve administration of habeas corpus hearings.united states hayman.the impetus for was that federal courts located near prisons had become overwhelmed by petitions from prisoners who,until that point,were required by to apply for writs in the district of their confinement.see hayman,at.in this way,replaced traditional habeas corpus for federal prisoners with a process that allowed the prisoner to file a motion with the sentencing court.boumediene,at.it was also these amendments that gave birth to the savings clause found in e.see wofford scott,cir.the savings clause preserves resort to when is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of a prisoner detention.e.
the supreme court has been explicit that was never meant to supplant,but was simply crafted to address the practical concerns of habeas administration.nowhere in the history of section,determined the court,do we find any purpose to impinge upon prisoners rights of collateral attack upon their convictions.see hayman,at.this remains true even following congress amendments to the statute,which created limitations on second or successive petitions in h.the savings clause,which congress chose to retain even while creating these gatekeeping provisions,continues to play a crucial role within this scheme.as the supreme court recognizes,the savings clause ensures that limitations in do not run afoul of the suspension clause.see boumediene,at.
