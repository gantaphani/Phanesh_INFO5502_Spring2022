federal prisoner michael john mullins claims that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel when his trial counsel prevented him from testifying in spite of his repeated requests to do so.the district court granted his petition,and the government appeals.we reverse.
mullins was involved in a drug deal in which undercover officers traded a television for drugs at a residence mullins shared with his girlfriend.at the conclusion of their investigation,police officers executed an evidentiary search warrant to recover the television from mullins residence.during a protective sweep of the apartment,the officers discovered a shotgun in a bedroom closet.they disarmed it and left it in the bedroom.mullins was not arrested during the execution of the warrant and remained on the front porch along with a friend.approximately a half hour later,mullins spoke to officer south on the porch.exactly what was said is in dispute.the officer testified that mullins told him that he had purchased the shotgun on the street,and did not want it if it was stolen.the officer had mullins retrieve the gun,and gave mullins a receipt which mullins signed stating that he had bought the gun on the street.mullins present explanation is that he told the officer that the gun was not his,that his girlfriend had bought it on the street,that it may be stolen,and that he did not want it around that he could not read the receipt because he did not have his glasses and would not have signed it had he known that it stated he admitted ownership of the gun.
mullins was indicted by a federal grand jury on the charge of felon in possession of a shotgun under g.during the execution of an arrest warrant at mullins new residence,mullins girlfriend consented to a search of the residence.officers found two handguns in a nightstand next to the bed mullins and his girlfriend shared,and drug paraphernalia in a closet in the bedroom.in a superseding indictment,mullins was indicted on a second count of felon in possession of a firearm for the two handguns.
mullins was represented by counsel at a jury trial.he was found guilty on count,involving the shotgun,but the jury could not reach a unanimous verdict on count,involving the handguns.mullins was sentenced to imprisonment for months,followed by five years supervised release,based on his prior convictions.count was dismissed on government motion.
on appeal,mullins argued that the trial court gave an erroneous jury instruction on reasonable doubt and used an invalid prior conviction to enhance his sentence.this court affirmed his conviction and sentence.
more than four years after his trial,mullins filed a petition under asserting that his counsel prevented him from testifying at his trial over his expressed desire to do so.the district court summarily dismissed mullins motion as untimely.in april,this court granted mullins request for a coa on the issue whether the district court erred in determining that mullins claim that counsel was ineffective in preventing him from testifying was procedurally barred and remanded to the district court for further proceedings.
the magistrate judge held an evidentiary hearing.after hearing testimony from mullins and his trial counsel,the magistrate judge concluded that mullins petition was not,and recommended that his petition based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel be granted.over the government timely objections,the district court accepted the magistrate judge findings and recommendations and entered judgment granting mullins petition.the government timely appeals.
a criminal defendant right to testify is well established only the defendant may waive this right,not his counsel and it must be knowing and voluntary we distinguish between interference with that right by defense counsel,and interference by the court or prosecutor.
in sayre anderson,we held that where the defendant contends that his counsel interfered with his right to testify,the appropriate vehicle for such claims is a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.if there is a claim that the court or prosecutor has interfered with the right to testify there is a different standard mullins asserts that his counsel interfered with his right to testify,and the district court applied the strickland standard.
strickland requires that a defendant show both that trial counsel performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense ineffective assistance of counsel is a mixed question of law and fact,and we review the district court grant of habeas relief de novo,while crediting the district court express or implied findings of discrete historic fact that are not clearly erroneous 
to satisfy the first element of strickland,the defendant must show that counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.in determining whether counsel performance was deficient,we must be highly deferential to counsel trial strategy in the past,we examined counsel decision on whether a defendant will testify as part of counsel trial strategy in examining that strategy,we keep in mind that the decision whether to put a defendant on the stand is a judgment call which should not easily be condemned with the benefit of hindsight.
at the same time it can not be permissible trial strategy,regardless of its merits otherwise,for counsel to override the ultimate decision of a defendant to testify contrary to his advice.we have decided several cases where the defendant alleged that his counsel in some way prevented him from testifying in those cases,we have often found that the record did not support the defendant claim,concluding that the defendant agreed with his counsel sound trial strategy that he not testify in other cases,we determined that the decision that the defendant not testify was sound trial strategy without directly addressing whether the lawyer made the decision over the objection of his client,or if the client made the decision these cases implicitly,and we think correctly,conclude that when the record is simply that the defendant knew of his right to testify and wanted to do so but counsel was opposed,defendant acquiesced in his lawyer advice,and therefore the only inquiry is whether that advice was sound trial strategy.that is not this record.
the decision of whether to testify belongs to the defendant and his lawyer can not waive it over his objection other circuits have reached the same conclusion as the seventh circuit stated in united states curtis 
when a defendant asserts that he desires to exercise his constitutional right to testify truthfully,counsel duty is to inform the defendant why he believes this course will be unwise or dangerous.if a defendant insists on testifying,however irrational that insistence might be from a tactical viewpoint,counsel must accede.we hold that a defendant personal constitutional right to testify truthfully in his own behalf may not be waived by counsel as a matter of trial strategy 
the eleventh circuit reached the same conclusion in united states teague 
i f defense counsel refused to accept the defendant decision to testify and would not call him to the stand,counsel would have acted unethically to prevent the defendant from exercising his fundamental constitutional right to testify under such circumstances,defense counsel has not acted within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases,and the defendant clearly has not received reasonably effective assistance of counsel.
to hold otherwise is to ignore the fact that the defendant right to testify is secured by the constitution and only he can waive it.it can not be reasonable trial strategy for an attorney to not honor his client decision to exercise his constitutional right to testify,not because the advice not to take the stand is unsound,but because counsel must in the end accede if the client will not abide by the advice.
relying on hollenbeck,garcia,jordan hargett robison and sayre,the government argues that when a defendant is aware of his right to testify and remains silent before the trial court,this court will not find his counsel refusal to allow him to testify to be ineffe
