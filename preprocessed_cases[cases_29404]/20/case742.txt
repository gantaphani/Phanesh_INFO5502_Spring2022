opinion of the court 
michael lacava appeals from an order of the district court which denied his petition for writ of habeas corpus as untimely filed,rejecting his contention that equitable tolling should apply.the appeal requires us to decide whether the month period that lacava allowed to pass prior to making inquiry into the status of his state petition for allowance of appeal precludes a finding of due diligence and thus application of the principle of equitable tolling,or whether the matter should,as lacava contends,be remanded to the district court for an evidentiary hearing.we hold that,under the circumstances of this case,the month period of passivity precludes a finding of due diligence for purposes of equitable tolling,and thus the necessity of an evidentiary hearing.we will therefore affirm the order of the district court denying the petition as untimely.
facts and procedural history 
lacava was found guilty by a jury in the philadelphia county court of common pleas of first degree murder,aggravated assault,simple assault,possession of an instrument of crime,and criminal conspiracy.the jury set the penalty at death.on direct appeal,the pennsylvania supreme court affirmed lacava convictions,but vacated the death sentence and remanded the matter for a new sentencing hearing.commonwealth lacava.lacava was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment on march,a sentence he did not appeal.
in january lacava filed a pro se petition for collateral relief under the pennsylvania post conviction relief act pcra.ann.west.counsel was appointed and an amended petition was filed.the pcra court denied lacava petition on january,and the pennsylvania superior court affirmed that decision in january of the following year.lacava,still represented by counsel,filed a request for permission to appeal,but the pennsylvania supreme court rejected the petition in an order dated august.
on december,lacava filed a pro se petition for habeas corpus,presenting four claims that appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance.as the merits of those claims are not at issue here,we will not set forth the specifics.the commonwealth answered by asserting that lacava habeas petition was and must be dismissed.the magistrate judge to whom lacava petition was referred issued a report recommending that his habeas petition be denied as untimely under d 
the magistrate judge concluded that lacava conviction became final on april,at the expiration of his time for seeking review with the pennsylvania supreme court.see.a petition for allowance of appeal shall be filed within thirty days from the entry of the order of the superior court sought to be reviewed see also d a swartz meyers,cir t he period of limitation tolls during the time a prisoner has to seek review of the pennsylvania superior court decision,whether or not review is actually sought.this was three days before the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa went into effect,and hence,pursuant to burns morton,cir,lacava had until april,to file his habeas petition.
section d provides,however,that t he time during which a properly filed application for state or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation d.accordingly,the statute was tolled when lacava properly filed his state petition on january,and remained tolled until august,when the pennsylvania supreme court denied his petition for allowance of appeal.see stokes dist.attorney of county of philadelphia,cir time during which state prisoner may file certiorari petition in the united states supreme court from denial of state petition does not toll statute of limitations.the magistrate judge calculated,correctly we believe,that lacava had approximately three and months,or until december,to file a timely habeas petition.lacava petition,which was submitted to prison officials on december,was filed well beyond the permissible period.the magistrate judge also concluded that lacava had failed to satisfy any of the exceptions to the limitation period as set forth in d b d.
there ensued a series of filings in which lacava asserted that the untimely filing could not be attributed to him because notice of the order denying his petition for allowance of appeal was delayed and he acted diligently in pursuing federal habeas corpus relief once he did receive notice.we detail these filings in the margin attached to lacava filings were three documents a copy of a letter from lacava to the pennsylvania supreme court deputy prothonotary dated april,inquiring as to whether notice of the denial of allocatur had been mailed to him prior to december,a copy of a letter from the prothonotary office dated december,advising lacava that his petition for allowance of appeal was denied on august,and a copy of a letter from lacava to his pcra attorney dated april,requesting that counsel review his records to determine if notice of the pennsylvania supreme court august order had been mailed to lacava at any time in august of 
on consideration of these papers,the magistrate judge issued an order permitting lacava thirty days to file a traverse.lacava did so,essentially reasserting the arguments he set forth in his previous filings.he again claimed an entitlement to equitable tolling due to the extraordinary circumstance of having received delayed notice of the state court disposition of his petition for allowance of appeal.lacava asserted that his allegation of delayed thus the reason for his untimely supported by the exhibits he attached to his objections,see supra,which,he claims,showed that he did not receive timely notice of the pennsylvania supreme court disposition from either the prothonotary of the pennsylvania supreme court or his attorney lacava conceded,however,that he was unable to offer direct documentary evidence in the form of prison logs or a letter from his attorney since no responses were forthcoming.
in an order entered on january,the district court,after noting that it had independently considered lacava petition for writ of habeas corpus,the magistrate judge report and recommendation,and lacava traverse,approved and adopted the report and recommendation,denied lacava habeas petition,and declined to issue him a certificate of appealability.lacava timely appealed.we appointed counsel and granted a certificate of appealability as to the issue of whether lacava timely filed his petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to.order of court dated.

lacava contends that he is entitled to have this matter remanded to the district court for an evidentiary hearing on the equitable tolling issue because he did not receive notice of the pennsylvania supreme court denial of his petition for permission to appeal within the limitations period and because he exercised reasonable diligence in filing his habeas petition once he finally received such notice.
