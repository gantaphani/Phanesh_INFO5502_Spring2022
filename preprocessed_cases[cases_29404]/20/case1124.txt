johnny ray johnson was convicted and sentenced to death for the capital murder of leah joette smith.in the proceedings the texas courts upheld his conviction and death sentence.in this federal habeas proceeding,the district court denied relief on the ground that johnson petition was not timely filed under the filing limitation period of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,and that he had not demonstrated the rare and exceptional circumstances necessary for application of the doctrine of equitable tolling.alternatively,the district court held that the state court did not unreasonably deny relief on johnson claim that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance.the district court denied johnson request for a certificate of appealability coa.
before us,johnson requests a coa from this court to appeal the district court denial of relief.with respect to the limitations issue,johnson argues both equitable and statutory tolling of the deadline.secondly,johnson requests a coa for his claim that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to conduct a complete and thorough mitigation investigation.he contends that evidence regarding his troubled childhood would have been discovered and that this evidence could have offered some degree of understanding of and explanation for his conduct as an adult.his third ground for a coa is that counsel were ineffective in failing to have a mental health expert conduct a psychological evaluation,and that this failure was unreasonable trial strategy because it was based on insufficient investigation.
we deny johnson request for a coa.we conclude that the district court holding that johnson federal habeas petition was untimely under aedpa is not debatable among jurists of reason.we thus find it unnecessary to address the ineffective assistance claim,and deny the coa.
johnson was convicted and sentenced to death for the march,capital murder of leah joette smith during the course of committing or attempting to commit aggravated sexual assault.the state presented evidence,including johnson confession,that johnson offered to give smith,who was addicted to crack cocaine,some crack cocaine in exchange for sex.after smith smoked the crack,she refused to have sex with johnson.he became angry and grabbed her,ripped her clothing off,and threw her to the ground.when she fought back with a wooden board,johnson repeatedly struck her head against the cement curb.after he hit her head against the cement three or four times,she stopped fighting.he then sexually assaulted her.during the assault,smith told johnson that he had better enjoy it because she was going to file rape charges against him.johnson confessed that he got very angry when smith hit him with the board and that it was like something in my head was just saying kill,kill,kill.after sexually assaulting smith,johnson stomped on her face five or six times.he walked away,but realized that he had left his wallet at the scene,so he returned.in his confession,he stated that when he saw joette body face up and naked,he sexually assaulted her again and then picked up his wallet and her boots and left smith there on the ground to die.
smith sustained numerous severe injuries to her mouth,face,head,and neck her teeth were knocked out,her tongue was displaced,both sides of her jaw bone were fractured,and she sustained scalp lacerations and a subdural hematoma.the medical examiner testified that she died as a result of swallowing her own blood that had accumulated in the back part of her throat when her jaw bones were fractured.he testified that the subdural hematoma also contributed to her death,but that she could have survived it had she received prompt medical attention.the medical examiner testified that smith did not die instantly,because it takes a while for the blood to accumulate in the back of the throat.
the jury convicted johnson for smith brutal murder.then at the punishment phase,the jury heard the state evidence of johnson extensive criminal history,beginning in,including numerous other brutal sexual assaults and murders.
johnson niece,elizabeth wright,testified that when she was eight or nine years old,johnson asked her to walk to a store in houston with him.as they were walking down a trail leading to the back of the store,johnson knocked elizabeth down,covered her mouth,pulled her pants to the side,and raped her.he threatened to kill her if she ever told anyone.

theresa lewis testified that johnson picked her up in his cab in.she got into the backseat,but johnson insisted that she sit in the front seat.when he asked her to have sex with him in exchange for,she refused and told him she was not a whore.this made him so angry that he pulled over,grabbed her by the neck and began choking her.when she fought back,he struck her in the face with his fist,and then raped her.he was convicted for that crime in,and sentenced to five years in prison.
johnson then met dora ann moseley,a prostitute,who became his wife.they moved to austin in and had some children together.johnson once beat her so badly that he claims he would have killed her if the police had not been called.she filed a police report a couple of weeks later,after he beat her again.johnson spent six months in jail for that beating.
johnson confessed that in the summer of,he met a girl on street in austin.they smoked crack and drank,and when she refused to have sex with him,he beat her.he said that she pulled out a razor and cut him on the left side of his neck and that he then bashed her head in and stomped on her.he then claimed that he took her head and gave himself oral sex before having regular sex with her.he left her dead body behind a drug store on street.
johnson confessed that he then raped a woman named amy on top of a hill across from the austin police station.he then raped a girl named eva.when eva tried to steal his crack cocaine,he grabbed her by the hair,smashed her head into a rock,and then raped her.he said that eva ran away,yelling and screaming.shortly before christmas in,johnson confessed that he lured a girl into a graveyard in exchange for crack cocaine,and that he raped her three or four times and slapped her around.he returned to houston at the end of december.
in february,johnson sexually assaulted debra jenkins,his brother wife.she testified that he grabbed her by the throat,threw her onto a bed,and began choking her.he cut the crotch of her pajamas with a pair of scissors,and raped her twice.
on march,a citizen found the badly decomposed body of a female in her thirties,in a gully near some railroad tracks.the victim had sustained numerous lacerations on her face,as well as severe injuries to her mouth,and there was evidence of manual strangulation.johnson confessed that he raped and killed this woman,whose identity had not been determined as of the time of johnson trial.he said he met her at a crack house and offered her some crack cocaine in exchange for sex.she tried to leave after he refused to give her more crack until she had sex with him,so he grabbed her by the throat and hair and threw her to the ground.she grabbed a rock and hit him on the head and he became angry and banged her head on the railroad track.after she passed out,he sexually assaulted her,then dragged her to the gully and left her there.
the jury also heard his confession that,three days later,he killed another woman.he said that he took her to a warehouse to smoke some crack cocaine.he became angry when she smoked his crack but refused to have sex with him,so he grabbed her by the neck and threw her down on the ground and sexually assaulted her while he choked her.he sexually assaulted her again later,and they smoked some more crack.when she jumped up,he caught her by the hair.when she kept fighting,he banged her head on the pavement until she became unconscious.
the evidence of his brutal rapes and murders seemed endless.on april,the partially clothed body of a female was found underneath a highway overpass in houston.she had sustained massive head injuries,including a fractured skull and cheekbone,and a large chunk of concrete with blood all over it was found near her head.the autopsy revealed that she died from a crushed head due to blunt trauma and asphyxia due to strangulation.the marking on her throat was consistent with someone placing his foot on her throat and stepping down.johnson confessed that he killed this woman,who had not been identified as of the time of his trial.they smoked crack cocaine together and he became angry when she refused to have sex with him.she hit him with a wine bottle and he grabbed her and swung her down to the ground.he grabbed her neck and banged her head on a rock.after she quit fighting,he sexually assaulted her,then hit her head with a rock and left.
finally,angela morris testified that on may,johnson grabbed her by the neck as she was walking down the street.he took her down a driveway,struck her,threatened to kill her,and raped her while holding a knife in his hand.he then tied her up with rags and left.
prior to trial,johnson counsel filed motions for fees to hire a mental health expert and to hire an investigator and mitigation expert.the trial court granted both motions.because johnson trial counsel who handled the punishment phase is deceased,the habeas record is incomplete concerning the results of employing these experts.we do know,however,that the final decision of his attorney at the punishment phase was to call only one witness,windel dickerson,a psychologist.we also know that dickerson was called only to testify that prisoners get less violent as they grow older and that prisoners whose crimes involved drug use were less likely to commit acts of violence in the controlled setting of a prison.in this connection,the jury was instructed that johnson,who was years old,would not be eligible for parole until he had served forty years in prison.this limited use of the expert at trial may well have been trial strategy given johnson horrendous record of rape and murder as other counsel involved in the trial have suggested see infra,page,but because of the death of trial counsel,we are left only to speculate.
the record further shows that his attorney introduced johnson disciplinary records from his three prior incarcerations in the texas department of criminal justice,and argued that these records showed his lack of violent behavior while incarcerated and thus indicated that he would not pose a danger to society if sentenced to life imprisonment.
in closing argument,defense counsel urged the jury to consider the fact that,if he were sentenced to life imprisonment,johnson would have to serve forty years in prison before he would even be eligible for parole,and argued that johnson prison disciplinary records,introduced as exhibits by the defense,demonstrated his behavior while incarcerated.counsel also pointed to dickerson testimony that people are less likely to commit crimes as they get older and that they are less likely to commit crimes of violence in the structured and controlled setting of a prison,especially given that there would be no alcohol,crack cocaine,or prostitutes available to johnson in prison.
the jury returned a punishment verdict after deliberating for only one hour and fifteen minutes.it answered the special issue on future dangerousness yes and answered the special issue on mitigation no.
johnson conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal.johnson state.
johnson filed a petition for state habeas relief on july.he alleged that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance at the phase,when they failed to have him psychologically evaluated for the purpose of advancing an insanity defense at the punishment phase when they failed to have him psychologically evaluated for use as mitigation evidence,when records from the texas department of criminal justice indicated that he had a history of major emotional disorder which included both auditory and visual hallucinations and at the punishment phase,when they failed to investigate adequately his history,when such historical information was essential in the preparation of a biopsychosocial assessment by an expert in the area of mitigation,thereby denying him the opportunity to present mitigating evidence.johnson discussion of these claims consists of three pages in his state habeas application,and he did not present any affidavits or other evidence in support of them.
johnson was represented by attorneys guerinot and millin at trial.guerinot handled the phase,and millin was responsible for the punishment phase.as we have earlier indicated,millin had died prior to the commencement of the state habeas proceedings and his files could not be located.the state habeas court ordered guerinot to submit an affidavit responding to johnson ineffective assistance claims.in his affidavit,guerinot stated that johnson never exhibited any signs of insanity and always appeared to be lucid,competent,and sane and that he believed that johnson was examined by a mental health expert,and that millin decided not to use the information resulting from the examination because it was severely detrimental to johnson case.regarding the claim of failure to investigate johnson personal history,guerinot stated that in the light of the evidence that johnson had terrorized and raped members of his own family,it was unlikely that evidence in that area would have been favorable to the defense.
one of the prosecutors at trial,bill hawkins,also submitted an affidavit in the state habeas proceeding.he stated that millin told him that he could not afford to put on any witnesses in the mental health area because such testimony would hurt a lot more than it helped.
the state habeas court found that a psychological interview of johnson was conducted on december,more than ten years before the murder of smith,when johnson was an inmate in the texas department of criminal justice.in the interview,he stated that he had visions of his mother and heard her telling him what to do.he stated that he twice tried to kill himself,once in the county jail,and once by jumping off a cliff.a month after that interview,psychologist wilson lilly stated in clinic notes inmate johnson was called in on recommendation of the mental health screening process.he has a history of major emotional disorder which included both auditory and visual hallucinations.currently,he denies such symptoms.his mental status is clear and appropriate except for a mild depression of mood.he does not desire mental health services at this time,but was advised to seek treatment should any of his past symptoms return.the state habeas court found that there was no mention of any mental health problems during the records of johnson later incarcerations,and that health questionnaires completed in july and october stated that there were no signs of a mental disorder.
the state habeas court concluded that trial counsel were not ineffective in failing to investigate or present an insanity defense,and that johnson was not prejudiced thereby.it made the following conclusions with respect to his claims of ineffective assistance for failure to investigate his history and failure to have him psychologically evaluated for purposes of mitigation 
because trial counsel believed that the evidence concerning johnson personal history would not have been favorable to johnson defense,trial counsel were not ineffective in failing to present evidence of johnson history for the purposes of mitigation 
because the evidence showed that johnson had terrorized and raped members of his own family,it was reasonable for trial counsel to limit their investigation of johnson history for the purposes of mitigation 
because trial counsel believed that testimony of psychological witnesses would have hurt johnson case more than it helped,it was reasonable for trial counsel to cho o se not to put such witnesses on the stand for the purposes of mitigation 
because johnson had raped and terrorized
