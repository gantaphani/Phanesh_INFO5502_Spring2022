pro se petitioner gene irving garland appeals the dismissal of his habeas corpus petition brought pursuant to.in that petition he argues that he is entitled to release in light of united states santos,d,which held that the statute,a,term proceeds was ambiguous and as a result,in certain circumstances,must be read to mean profits.santos clearly applies retroactively to garland convictions at issue in this case.united states mcphail,cir.garland contends that,under santos,he was wrongfully convicted of multiple nonexistent money laundering offenses because the indictment and the jury instructions did not require the government to prove that he used profits to pay returns to investors in his illegal pyramid scheme.he also argues that his petition satisfies savings clause and thus can be brought under.we agree that garland petition states a claim falling within savings clause and thus he may proceed under.therefore,we reverse the dismissal and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
is the primary means under which a federal prisoner may collaterally attack the legality of his conviction or sentence.reyes requena united states,cir.however,may be utilized by a federal prisoner to challenge the legality of his or her conviction or sentence if he or she can satisfy the mandates of the savings clause.id.at.
the savings clause states 
an application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section,shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief,by motion,to the court which sentenced him,or that such court has denied him relief,unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.
this court has interpreted e to mean that there are three factors that must be satisfied for a petitioner to file a petition in connection with savings clause.jeffers chandler,cir citing reyes requena.they are the petition raises a claim that is based on a retroactively applicable supreme court decision the claim was previously foreclosed by circuit law at the time when it should have been raised in petitioner trial,appeal or first motion and that retroactively applicable decision establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense.reyes requena,at.see also christopher miles,cir.
the petitioner bears the burden to demonstrate that the remedy is inadequate or ineffective.christopher,at.he must com e forward with evidence show ing each element of the reyes requena test.wesson penitentiary,beaumont,cir.therefore,before allowing the petitioner to proceed under,w e must examine the merits of the petitioner claim to determine whether the reyes requena factors are satisfied.christopher,at.accordingly,in reviewing the instant dismissal,we need to become familiar with not only the background of garland habeas petition,but also the underlying convictions that garland claims may have been for conduct.
the challenged convictions consist in relevant part of counts of money laundering pursuant to a a i.in addition,those charges were predicated upon garland commission of the unlawful acts described in counts of mail fraud pursuant to and one count of securities fraud pursuant to a and.
the statute under which garland was convicted established four essential elements of the crime that he knew that the property involved in a financial transaction represent ed the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity emphasis added that he conduct ed or attempt ed to conduct such a financial transaction that the financial transaction in fact involve d the proceeds of the specified unlawful activity emphasis added and that the transaction was undertaken with the intent to promote the carrying on of a specified unlawful activity.a a i.at the time garland was convicted,the statute did not define the meaning of the term proceeds.
the indictment and the jury instructions tracked the language of the statute by describing garland alleged money laundering as his knowing use of the proceeds of his pyramid scheme to pay sums falsely described as earnings to his in order to further the operations of his scheme thus,neither the indictment nor the jury instructions required the government to prove that garland transacted in profits of his unlawful activities,rather than gross receipts,in order to convict him of money laundering.in fact,it appears that the alleged transactions underlying the charge could not have involved profits,as the only allegation was that garland took proceeds from his criminal activities and used it to maintain the criminal enterprise.
as it explains on appeal and is reflected in the indictment,the government proved that garland engaged in securities fraud and at least one count of mail fraud by alleging that he conducted a pyramid scheme involving the sale of fraudulent securities.in other words,based on the indictment,the government alleged that using the mails garland sold fraudulent securities and then used the proceeds from those sales to distribute money to individuals who had previously bought his securities,under the guise that this was a return on the individuals initial investments,thereby encouraging their continued investment in his fraud.see a stating that securities fraud occurs when any person in the offer of sale or any securities uses the mails,directly or indirectly to employ any device,scheme or artifice to defraud or to obtain money or property by means of any untrue statement of a material fact or to engage in any transaction,practice,or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser stating that mail fraud occurs when one places in any post office or authorized depository for mail matter,any matter or thing whatever or knowingly causes to be delivered by mail any such matter or thing that was part of a devised or intend ed scheme or artifice to defraud or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses.in this manner,it is possible that the same payout of proceeds as returns to investors formed the basis of the mail and securities fraud convictions,as well proved the element of the charge that garland transacted in proceeds of the underlying unlawful activity.
following his convictions,garland filed two unsuccessful habeas petitions.his present petition pursuant to argues that the supreme court interpretation of the statute in united states santos,d,reveals retroactively that garland was convicted of nonexistent crimes of using receipts rather than profits from his pyramid scheme to further the scheme operations.the combination of the plurality and concurring opinions in santos holds that in certain circumstances,elaborated on below,proceeds must be defined as profits instead of gross receipts.at stevens,concurring in the judgment 
the district court,which adopted without alteration the recommendations of the magistrate judge,dismissed garland petition on two grounds.first,the magistrate judge concluded that santos narrow definition of proceeds as profits is limited to the specific facts of that case,under which the petitioners were convicted of money laundering stemming from the unlawful activity of running an illegal gambling operation.thus,the magistrate judge reasoned,santos does not apply to garland conviction and therefore he was not convicted of a nonexistent offense in light of that case.second,the magistrate judge stated that any claim that garland could have raised in light of santos was not previously foreclosed,as this circuit has never specifically held that proceeds should be defined as receipts rather than profits.garland objections on both points were overruled.

discussion 
we consider each of the reyes requena factors in turn.we conclude that garland petition satisfactorily establishes each factor and therefore his claim may proceed under.
claim based on a retroactively applicable supreme court decision 
there can be no question that garland petition satisfies the first reyes requena factor,that his claim is based on a retroactively applicable supreme court decision.the government argues that santos should not apply retroactively because the supreme court did not make its holding retroactive.government br.emphasis in original.however,as garland argues,our case law establishes that new decisions interpreting federal statutes that substantively define criminal offenses automatically apply retroactively and santos is an exemplar of such a decision.see united states mcphail,cir.
in davis united states,the supreme court held that a petitioner could collaterally attack his conviction based on a decision issued after the petitioner conviction was affirmed if that decision established that the conviction and punishment are for an act that the law does not make criminal,d.this court has interpreted davis to hold that substantive,decision s concerning the reach of a federal statute do not implicate the retroactivity analysis set forth in teague lane,d and instead appl y retroactively to cases on collateral review.united states mcphail,at citing davis,at.united states mckie,united states dashney,cir.mcphail further explained that a decision is substantive,concerning the reach of a federal statute,if it articulates the substantive elements that the government must prove to convict a person charged under the statute.id.by so doing,that decision explains what conduct is,and has always been,criminalized by the statute and thus it applies retroactively to cases on collateral review without triggering the teague analysis.id.accordingly,the mcphail panel concluded that a petitioner could collaterally attack his conviction for using a firearm in furtherance of his crime based on bailey united states,d,which was handed down subsequent to his conviction becoming final,and which established that the government must present evidence sufficient to show active employment of the firearm in order to sustain such a conviction.mcphail,at.
in light of mcphail,santos is a prime example of a supreme court decision retroactively applicable to cases pending on collateral review.santos examines the meaning of the word proceeds in the statute.it determines that,in certain circumstances,proceeds can not be understood as gross receipts,but rather must be defined as profits.see santos.at stevens,concurring in the judgment.thus,for money laundering falling within the case holding,santos fill s gaps in the statute by defin ing a potentially ambiguous statutory term.id.at.just as in mcphail,santos construed the reach of a federal statute more narrowly than its broadest possible meaning,thus requiring the government to prove additional facts in order to convict garland of money laundering.accordingly,santos applies retroactively.it is not barred from having retroactive effect upon cases on collateral review under the teague analysis because it is a substantive,decision concerning the reach of a federal statute.
claim was previously foreclosed by circuit law 
likewise,as garland argues and the government appears to concede,his present claim was foreclosed under our cases.see government br.thus,he satisfies the second reyes requena factor.
our cases have never explicitly defined the meaning of foreclosed by circuit law as used in this reyes requena factor.nonetheless,we have previously adopted the ordinary meaning of foreclosed exclude d by prior controlling case law.oxford english dictionary ed.see garrido morato gonzales,cir united states cathey,cir.we have consistently held that if an argument falls within the scope of,and is excluded by,a prior holding of a controlling case,it is foreclosed by that case.the court need not have specifically considered and rejected the exact claim for it to be foreclosed,as long as the breadth of a prior holding was meant to encompass and preclude the argument.
for instance,in garrido morato we held that circuit case law foreclosed the defendant claim that her conviction for harboring aliens should not bar her from discretionary relief from deportation.at citation and quotation marks omitted.individuals are barred from such discretionary relief if they have committed an aggravated felony.see id.a prior case in this circuit had held that the parenthetical related to alien smuggling in the statute defining aggravated felonies is descriptive and not limiting.id.clearly,harboring aliens,although not part of the process of importing or exporting aliens,could be described as relating to alien smuggling.see black law dictionary ed defining smuggling as t he crime of importing or exporting illegal articles.therefore,we concluded that our case law excluded the defendant narrower interpretation of aggravated felony as not including harboring aliens garrido morato was foreclosed from arguing that she was entitled to discretionary relief on the basis that she had not committed an aggravated felony.id.
similarly,in cathey,at,we held that cathey argument that the district court sentence,based on its finding that another individual death resulted from cathey distribution of heroin,violated cathey right to a jury was foreclosed by united states watts,d.in watts,the supreme court held that a jury verdict of acquittal does not prevent the sentencing court from considering conduct underlying the acquitted charge,so long as that conduct has been proved by a preponderance of the evidence.cathey,at quotation marks omitted quoting watts,at.the supreme court had established a general rule that encompassed,rejected and thereby foreclosed the defendant specific argument.
under this definition,garland claim was previously foreclosed by circuit case law.in united states allen,a panel of this court wrote,f raudulent scheme s produce proceeds,at the latest when the scheme succeeds in disgorging the funds from the victim and placing them into the control of the perpetrators,cir.the panel then used this definition to conclude that the defendants could be convicted of money laundering because the money left the control of the victim and came into the possession of the defendants.id.the court indicated it did not need to determine that the funds were the profits of the unlawful activity it was sufficient that the government demonstrated that the defendant had control over the funds.id.see also united states puig infante,cir stating that t he only permissible inference from the government proof is that the defendant was in possession of the proceeds of unlawful activity,when all the government had shown was that the defendant had control over money obtained through the sale of illegal drugs.in this manner,this court previously held that the term proceeds was defined by whether the defendant had control over the derivatives of an unlawful activity,not the nature of those derivatives,whether the money or property represented the gross receipts or profits of the fraud.we are bound by the decisions of prior panels.united states rose,cir.therefore,as allen garland conviction and remained controlling case law until santos,garland was previously foreclosed by circuit case law from raising his instant claim.
claim establishes petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense 
garland argues that he satisfies the third reyes requena factor because the plurality opinion in santos held that proceeds must always be defined as profits.therefore,because his trial court in its charge to the jury defined proceeds as any property derived from the specified unlawful activity,he may have been convicted based on a set of facts that did not fall within the statute.he acknowledges that in santos justice stevens wrote a narrower concurrence in the judgment,providing the necessary fifth vote for a majority of the court.however,garland argues that we should ignore justice stevens analysis.
while we agree with garland ultimate conclusion that he satisfies the final reyes requena element,we can not agree with his analysis of santos s holding.when a fragmented court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five justices,the holding of the court may be viewed as that position taken by those members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.marks united states,d quoting gregg georgia,d.as a result and as was conceded by the santos plurality,justice stevens concurrence controls and therefore determines the scope of the court holding.see.at plurality opinion since his vote is necessary to our judgment,and since his opinion rests upon the narrower ground,the court holding is limited accordingly.citing marks,at.
we begin our analysis of whether garland claim is sufficient to establish that he may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense by determining the holding of the court in light of the splintered santos decision.although,as dictated by marks,our conclusion will ultimately depend on the ways in which justice stevens holding narrowed that of the plurality,we begin by establishing the underlying principles on which he and the four member plurality evidently agreed.
first,as justice scalia writing for the plurality explained,at the time the court rendered its decision,the term proceeds in the statute was undefined and its meaning ambiguous.the federal money laundering statute does not define proceeds.santos.at plurality opinion.while,typically,w hen a term is undefined,we give it its ordinary meaning,here p roceeds can mean either receipts or profits.id.both meanings are accepted,and have long been accepted,in ordinary usage.id.proceeds,moreover,has not acquired a common meaning in the provisions of the federal criminal code.id.most leave the term undefined.id.therefore,this ordinary meaning method of statutory construction was unavailing.under either of the word ordinary definitions,all provisions of the federal statute are coherent no provisions are redundant and the statute is not rendered utterly absurd.id.at.accordingly,f rom the face of the statute,there is no more reason to think that proceeds means receipts than there is to think that proceeds means profits.id.at.see also id.at stevens,concurring in the judgment when congress fails to define potentially ambiguous statutory terms,it effectively delegates to federal judges the task of filling gaps in a statute.congress has included definitions of the term proceeds in some criminal statutes,but it has not done so in,the statute at issue in this case.citations and footnote omitted.
second,if proceeds were to be defined as receipts rather than profits,the statute would be left open to what a majority of the court characterized as the merger problem.santos.at plurality opinion if we accepted the government invitation to speculate about congressional purpose,we would also have to confront and explain the strange consequence of the receipts interpretation,which respondents have described as a merger problem.id.at stevens,concurring in the judgment stating that defining proceeds as receipt runs squarely into what can be characterized as the merger problem.the plurality explained the meaning of merger problem by relating the phrase to the specific facts of santos.the jury found santos guilty of one count of running an illegal gambling business and two counts of money laundering based upon his payments to runners,winners and collectors involved in the gambling business.id.at plurality opinion.see also id.at stevens,concurring in the judgment.the plurality concluded that these dual charges resulted in the merger problem because 
if proceeds meant receipts,nearly every violation of the statute would also be a violation of the statute,because paying a winning bettor is a transaction involving receipts that the defendant intends to promote the carrying on of the lottery.since few lotteries,if any,will not pay their winners,the statute criminalizing illegal lotteries would merge with the statute.
id.at plurality opinion citation omitted.moreover,the plurality continued,t he merger problem is not limited to lottery operators.id.for a host of predicate crimes,merger would depend on the manner and timing of payment for the expenses associated with the commission of the crime.id.few crimes are entirely free of cost,and costs are not always paid in advance.id.a ny crime with multiple participants would become when the initial recipient of the wealth gives his confederates their shares.id.at.thereby,corresponding to what may have occurred in garland case,the plurality explained that the merger problem resulted any time the definition of proceeds as receipts enabled the charge to rely upon the same transaction as the predicate crime.justice stevens later adopted this understanding of the merger problem in his concurrence.id.at stevens,concurring in the judgment 
as a result of these underlying premises shared by justice stevens and the plurality,both agreed that,at least in certain circumstances,proceeds must be defined as profits rather than receipts.the plurality would have held that b ecause the profits definition of proceeds is always more than the receipts definition,the rule of lenity dictates that it should be adopted.santos.at plurality opinion.however,limiting the scope and reasoning of this holding,justice stevens concurrence dictates that the definition of proceeds in the statute must be determined via a bifurcated analysis.santos.at.stevens,concurring the judgment.first,a court must determine whether,when proceeds are defined as gross receipts rather than profits,the defendant would face the merger problem.id.at.if so,then,consistent with the plurality decision,the rule of lenity governs and proceeds must be defined as profits and the court need not proceed to the second step of justice stevens analysis.id.at.however,if,instead,there is no merger problem,justice stevens analysis,unlike the plurality,directs that a court must look to the legislative history of the statute to determine how to define proceeds.id.a court does so with the default presumption that proceeds should be defined as gross receipts,unless the legislative history affirmatively supports interpreting proceeds to mean profits.id.at.
our understanding of justice stevens limits on and disagreements with the plurality rule begins and ends with justice stevens closing footnote,the only place in his short concurrence in which justice stevens attempted to lay out an independent holding rather than his partial disagreements with the plurality and the dissent.there,justice stevens responded to what the plurality characterized as its effort to determine the stare decisis effect of the splintered santos decision.santos.at stevens,concurring in the judgment quoting id.at plurality opinion.the plurality had argued that,based on justice stevens concurrence,the holding of santos is that proceeds means profits when there is no legislative history to the contrary.id.at plurality opinion.justice stevens rejected this interpretation.id.at stevens,concurring in the judgment.instead,he explained that his concurrence in the judgment,rests on my conviction that congress could not have intended the perverse result that the dissent rule that proceeds should always be defined as receipts would produce if its definition of proceeds were applied to the operation of an unlicensed gambling business.in other applications of the statute not involving such a perverse result,i would presume that the legislative history summarized by justice alito who dissented arguing that the legislative history of the statute demonstrates that proceeds should always be defined as gross receipts reflects the intent of the enacting congress.id.citing id.at alito,dissenting.
just above that footnote,justice stevens explained what he meant by the perverse result by relating that phrase to the facts of santos.he wrote 
as the plurality notes,there is no explanation for why congress would have wanted a transaction that is a normal part of a crime it had duly considered and appropriately punished elsewhere in the criminal code by criminalizing gambling,to radically increase the sentence for that crime by enabling the same conduct to constitute money laundering.this conclusion dovetails with what common sense and the rule of lenity would require.faced with both a lack of legislative history speaking to the definition of proceeds
