petitioner gregory bey appeals the district court dismissal of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.bey argues that the state trial court violated the united states constitution by admitting certain other acts evidence at trial,over his objection.we find bey claim meritless and affirm the judgment of the district court.
in august,police officers in toledo,ohio,responded to the scene of an apparent.at the scene,the body of dale pinkelman was lying on the floor of his store,pinkelman collectibles,dead from a single stab wound to the chest.pinkelman body was in a peculiar pants and shoes had been removed,such that he was lying in his underwear and socks.his shoes were placed neatly next to his body,but his pants were missing and,in fact,were never recovered.the police discovered valuable items on pinkelman person,including a gold necklace,rings,and two watches,but there were other items of value for which the police could not account,including merchandise from the store,cash from the register,and pinkelman car from the parking lot.the police also discovered a fingerprint and a palm print on a glass display case approximately three feet from pinkelman body,for which they could not identify an owner.despite the peculiar circumstances of the crime and the promising discovery of the finger and palm prints,the police had no suspect for the apparent and no solid leads.
a few months later,in november,the police found the body of peter mihas on the ground outside his restaurant,the boardroom restaurant,dead from several stab wounds to the chest.mihas pants had been removed and his shoes were placed neatly next to his body.his jewelry remained on his person.toledo detective william gray immediately recognized the similarities between the mihas and the unsolved pinkelman case 
an informant alerted police of bey possible involvement with the mihas murder and when the police confronted bey with evidence of his guilt,he confessed to murdering and robbing mihas.due to the unusual similarities of the crime scenes,the police compared bey palm prints to the unidentified prints found on the glass display case in pinkelman store.the prints matched.the police also found pinkelman car less than two blocks from bey residence.armed with this evidence,the police questioned bey concerning the pinkelman murder.bey initially denied that he knew pinkelman and denied having ever been in his store,but later,bey admitted that he had purchased a watch from pinkelman store on credit.bey also told the police that he had returned to the store and asked pinkelman for more time to pay for the watch,but pinkelman had refused and demanded payment.when the officers asked bey if he had ever harmed pinkelman or taken his car,bey replied that he did not remember and asked to terminate the questioning.
the grand jury returned a indictment,charging two counts of aggravated murder and two counts of aggravated robbery.the charges each contained the same specification,namely,aggravated murder in the course of an aggravated robbery,which,if found beyond a reasonable doubt,would render bey eligible for the death penalty under ohio law.see ohio a.bey moved to sever the trials,so that the mihas charges he had confessed to would be tried separately from the pinkelman charges.the court granted the motion.
the state prosecuted the mihas murder first.the jury convicted bey of both murder with the corresponding specification,and aggravated recommended life imprisonment with eligibility for parole after thirty years.the court adopted the recommendation and entered judgment.see state,no,wl ohio.march.the state then prosecuted the pinkelman murder.prior to trial,bey moved,pursuant to ohio evid.b,to exclude other acts evidence regarding the mihas murder.the state opposed the motion and the trial court issued a written,order in which it considered bey b argument but denied the motion.the court explained 
the probative value of the mihas homicide to prove identity has been clearly established by the state.both victims were male business owners who were confronted in or near their place of business.in both cases,the perpetrator directed violence to the two men through the use of a knife and inflicted the fatal stab wound to the chest.further,the uniqueness of the removal of the trousers and the shoes of the two men supports the admissibility of the evidence pursuant to evidence rule b the state has established the probative value of the evidence by the strong quality of its proof.the other act evidence relating to the homicide of mihas tends to show identity.said evidence shall be admitted at trial.however,before evidence of the mihas homicide is introduced at trial and at the close of all the evidence,the court shall instruct the jury as to the limited purpose of this evidence.
at trial,the state introduced evidence of the mihas murder.at the request of bey trial counsel,the trial court gave curative instructions,instructing the jurors that they were to consider that evidence only for the purpose of determining the identity of the person who had committed the offense for which bey was being tried.at the conclusion of the evidence,the jury convicted bey on all counts and specifications,and recommended a sentence of death.the trial court adopted the recommendation and entered judgment.bey unsuccessfully appealed his conviction and sentence to the court of appeals,see state bey,no,wl ohio,and to the ohio supreme court,see state bey,ohio.thereafter,bey filed petitions for relief in the state courts,and,at least with regard to the ohio evid.b issue before us in this appeal,exhausted his remedies.
in october,bey filed his petition for writ of habeas corpus with the federal district court,asserting grounds for relief.in september,the district court denied the petition and refused to grant a certificate of appealability.in november,we granted a certificate of appealability on one issue,namely,bey claim that 
petitioner conviction and sentence are in violation of the fifth,sixth,eighth,ninth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution in that the trial court erred to the prejudice of petitioner when it permitted the state to introduce other acts evidence without first conducting an analysis of whether the prejudicial impact of the evidence outweighed its probative value.
in his appellate brief,however,bey restates the issue thus 
issue on appeal petitioner conviction and sentence are in violation of the fifth,eighth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution in that the trial court erred to the prejudice of petitioner when it permitted the state to introduce other acts evidence which denied him due process of law.
we review de novo the district court denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.clinkscale carter,cir.because bey filed his habeas petition after the enactment of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,we review his claim under the standards set forth in that statute.see lindh murphy,d.under aedpa a federal court may grant a writ of habeas corpus only where the state court adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.a federal habeas court may issue the writ under the contrary to clause if the state court applies a rule different from the governing law set forth in supreme court cases,or if it decides a case differently than the supreme court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.bell cone,d.the federal court may grant relief under the unreasonable application clause if the state court correctly identifies the governing legal principle from supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular case.id.
bey statement of the sole issue on appeal differs from the issue on which we granted the certificate of appealability,and from the issues he raised in his habeas petition.notwithstanding,we will address the claim bey now puts before us,and,finding it baseless,lay it to rest.
in reconstructing his issue,bey has separated it into two distinct claims the trial
