a baltimore jury convicted john joseph merzbacher of child rape and related crimes.when his direct appeal failed,merzbacher sought state relief alleging that his trial lawyers denied him effective assistance of counsel in failing to notify him of,and counsel him about,a plea offer.after conducting evidentiary hearings,the state court refused to grant him relief.merzbacher then petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court,which the court granted.given the great deference to the state court judgment required by federal law,we must reverse.
in the early,merzbacher taught at a small catholic school in baltimore elizabeth murphy was one of his students.years later,murphy told authorities that merzbacher had subjected her to three years of sexual,physical,and emotional abuse.and in january,the state of maryland charged merzbacher with committing a number of sexual abuse crimes including rape,perverted practice,and carnal knowledge of a female child under the age of fourteen years against murphy.
merzbacher retained christina gutierrez to represent him.after the state brought charges involving an additional fourteen children against merzbacher,he qualified for appointed counsel.william kanwisher,a public defender,was then appointed to represent him.gutierrez and agreed to cooperate in merzbacher defense against all charges.
in december,following a pretrial motions hearing in the murphy case,prosecutors and defense counsel met with the judge,clifton gordy,in the judge chambers.merzbacher did not attend.during that meeting,the prosecutors discussed with gutierrez and kanwisher the possibility of their client pleading guilty in the murphy case in exchange for a recommendation of a sentence of ten years incarceration and dismissal of other charges.judge gordy bound himself to imposing a sentence of ten years incarceration should the plea be presented to him.
merzbacher never accepted the offer and the parties never resumed plea discussions.by the time the murphy trial began in may,judge gordy,as a result of the rotating schedule of assignments,was no longer assigned to the case.instead,judge robert hammerman presided over merzbacher trial.the jury convicted merzbacher on all counts.judge hammerman denied merzbacher motion for a new trial and sentenced him to four life sentences and one sentence,all running concurrently.on direct appeal,the court of special appeals affirmed in an unreported opinion.the court of appeals granted certiorari and then affirmed.see merzbacher state.
in july,merzbacher petitioned for relief in state court arguing in part that gutierrez and provided constitutionally ineffective counsel when they failed to convey the plea offer to him and advise him of his options with respect to that offer.the case was originally assigned to judge william quarles,then a state trial judge.however,the state moved to recuse judge quarles,because,in a prior case in which gutierrez appeared before him,judge quarles stated on the record that gutierrez had lied in court.judge quarles granted the motion and the case was reassigned to judge john hereinafter the state court.
over five days between october and february,the state court held hearings on merzbacher petition in which the court considered testimony and legal argument.merzbacher offered the testimony of gutierrez,kanwisher,and himself the state all three witnesses.
gutierrez testified to her expertise as a criminal defense lawyer who had handled approximately criminal cases since becoming engaged in the practice of law in.gutierrez explained that she had advised merzbacher on a number of trial issues including whether he should request a change of venue and testify at trial and that he had always taken her advice.gutierrez acknowledged that merzbacher had never at any time,not even,admitted guilt as to the crimes of which he was accused.
as for the plea offer,gutierrez testified that in judge gordy chambers,in late or early,the state essentially agreed that merzbacher could plead guilty to one or two counts rape and child abuse in the murphy case for ten years and that all of the other cases fifteen or sixteen of them would all be nol prossed.in her view,this was a firm offer with terms somewhere between ok and good i put it not quite good but as good as it going to get.following merzbacher conviction,gutierrez recognized her duty to communicate this offer to merzbacher,but testified that she had failed to do so because she was moving her office and very busy when the offer was made,and later,while preparing for trial in this case,she never thought about the offer.gutierrez acknowledged that,although plea offers were on the table in a lot of cases that she had handled,she could not recall another case in which she had failed to communicate a plea offer to her client.
gutierrez,kanwisher,confirmed that gutierrez was lead counsel,that merzbacher invariably had followed gutierrez advice on all trial matters,that merzbacher had always maintained his innocence,and that the state had offered the plea.kanwisher opined that this was a good deal and a fair deal for merzbacher and that defense counsel should have probably urged him to take it.but believing that gutierrez,who had a closer relationship with merzbacher,would inform merzbacher about the offer,did not do so.kanwisher further testified that he and gutierrez had disagreed as to the desirability of the plea he believed gutierrez was very confident that she could obtain an outright acquittal.
merzbacher himself testified that he had followed gutierrez advice as to venue,whether he would testify,and other trial matters.he stated that prior to proceedings,neither she nor anyone else had communicated to him the plea offer.merzbacher testified that had he known of the plea offer,he would have accepted it most graciously.he explained that he was scared and did have any money to continue to fight through eleven or fifteen different trials,that publicity was so bad that he was ruined for the rest of his life,and that the media can just blow all of these things out of proportion.
then the state presented its witnesses roberta siskind,one of the trial prosecutors,and judge gordy who were also.the state noticed gutierrez as a witness in its case but before the state could call her,gutierrez became unavailable to testify due to health problems requiring hospitalization.
siskind acknowledged that there had been a discussion before judge gordy in which we were talking about ten years.she explained it was more specific than that.merzbacher would plead guilty to a number of those cases and we did not define which ones those would be.siskind repeatedly testified that the state offered only a guilty plea and that she absolutely would not have accepted a plea under north carolina alford,d,with merzbacher not admitting guilt but admitting only that the prosecution would present enough evidence to convict.she recalled that gutierrez and kanwisher said they would take the offer to merzbacher.siskind had a vague recollection that later gutierrez came back and told us we were going anywhere,meaning there were going to be any further discussions.siskind related that this was really a surprise because we did really expect him to take anything.
judge gordy testified that there was some discussion of a possible plea at a pretrial meeting in his chambers discussing a lot of things.judge gordy believed that this was a good deal for merzbacher,indeed a surprisingly generous offer,and testified that if merzbacher had agreed to it,he judge gordy would have accepted it.according to judge gordy,although gutierrez did not say the deal was ridiculous,she also did not jump on it.judge gordy explained that throughout the motions process,gutierrez had reiterated that her client was not guilty,did not do these things and was insistent upon having his day in court.during the chambers meeting,judge gordy remembered that there was some discussion that merzbacher would not likely plead guilty to such a heinous offense in the presence or that would come to the attention of his wife,that he had denied these allegations throughout and that a plea was not likely.the judge testified that he got the impression that there were problems with the defendant pleading guilty to anything,whether it be five years or ten minutes.
finally,judge gordy remembered no discussion as to the structure of the plea rather t he ten years was,kind of,out there and i never heard back from anyone and the end of the term came and the case went to trial.similarly,he had no memory of an alford plea ever being discussed and no recollections as to if the ten years was accepted to which case or cases it would apply.
on march,the state court issued an opinion and order denying merzbacher petition for relief.merzbacher appealed to the court of special appeals.on march,the appellate court remanded so that the state court could expressly address in the first instance what advice if any trial counsel actually gave merzbacher as to whether the plea should be accepted,and whether counsel advice or lack thereof constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.on remand,the parties submitted supplemental memoranda,and the state court heard legal argument,but did not consider any additional evidence.
on june,the state court entered an opinion and order again denying relief.the new opinion,which incorporated an amended version of the original opinion,provided no new facts or analysis but,the state court explained,addressed,in expanded reiteration,the subject identified in the remand instructions.the state court acknowledged that some factors cut in merzbacher favor,the disparity between the plea offer and the life sentences he received,the fact that he did not testify in his own defense,and the testimony from him and his lawyers that no plea offer had been conveyed to him.however,the state court found 
merzbacher engaged in wishful thinking when he testified at the hearing that he was not apprised of the plea offer.
kanwisher was out of the loop on the issue and can not shed light on what occurred.
gutierrez committed perjury at the hearing when she testified that she never advised merzbacher of the offer,that she was so busy managing her office that she forgot to,and that the subject of a guilty plea never came up in her conversations with merzbacher.
the state court recognized the difficulty with drawing a negative inference that gutierrez told merzbacher about the offer where the only direct evidence was to the contrary,but not believed.nonetheless this is what the state court did,concluding 
because the court believes neither merzbacher nor gutierrez with respect to this assertion that gutierrez never told merzbacher about the plea,it draws the inference from the totality of the circumstances that the plea offer was discussed and rejected.
the state court then explained that it drew this negative inference because it could not square a contrary conclusion with either merzbacher vociferous protestations of innocence and his logical wish to avoid an embarrassing guilty plea when he had a good chance of successfully maintaining his innocence,or gutierrez long hours of work on the case,procurement of favorable evidentiary rulings,and certain facts outside the record assertedly demonstrating her lack of credibility.the state court relied heavily on these facts,involving gutierrez prior criminal convictions and eventual disbarment,in finding gutierrez not credible.
finally,the state court further explained that it could not grant relief because the offer was never firmed up in terms of details.rather,the court found,the plea discussions finalized only one leg of a putative plea agreement,the length of sentence and did not finalize the other legs.specifically,the plea discussions did not finalize the counts to which merzbacher would plead,whether the state or the court would accept an alford plea,and how a plea would affect the pending civil suits against merzbacher.
merzbacher filed an application for leave to appeal the state court denial of relief.in january,the court of special appeals denied him leave to appeal.
merzbacher then sought relief pursuant to in the united states district court for the district of maryland hereinafter the federal court.the federal court held several nonevidentiary hearings and considered extensive legal memoranda.on july,the court issued a comprehensive opinion and order granting habeas relief.
the federal court found the record before the state court itself provides clear and convincing evidence rebutting the presumptive correctness of the dispositive facts relevant to the state court adverse credibility determination the overall of the state court was not simply incorrect,but wholly unreasonable,because the state court ma d e factual findings under a misapprehension as to the correct legal standard and the process itself was defective quoting taylor maddox,cir the state court was more than unreasonable in finding,based on no evidence other than information outside the record going to credibility,that gutierrez had told merzbacher about the plea,and was unreasonable in finding kanwisher did not have an obligation to tell merzbacher about the plea and merzbacher testimony before the state court unambiguously asserts that he would have immediately accepted the state plea offer and the terms of the offer were sufficiently specific so that he could have accepted it.
the federal court thus granted a writ of habeas corpus and ordered the state to return this prosecution to the status quo ante that is to say,the state shall afford merzbacher an opportunity to accept its prior offer of a plea agreement,provided,however,that the performance by the state of any such plea agreement shall be expressly conditioned on its acceptance of same by a judge of the circuit court of baltimore city,or as further ordered by the appellate courts of maryland.
the state timely noted an appeal 
the sixth amendment right to the assistance of counsel during criminal proceedings extends to the process.see missouri frye,d.thus,criminal defendants are entitled to the effective assistance of competent counsel during that process.lafler cooper,d internal quotation marks omitted.as explained in hill lockhart,d,the test set forth in strickland washington,d,governs ineffective assistance claims involving the plea process.pursuant to that test,to prevail on an ineffective assistance claim,a petitioner must establish that counsel performance was deficient and there is a reasonable probability that the deficiency prejudiced the defense.strickland,at.
in all cases,to establish deficient performance,a petitioner must show that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.id.at.courts indulge a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance,in order to avoid the distorting effects of hindsight.yarbrough johnson,cir quoting strickland,at.
generally speaking,to establish prejudice under strickland,the petitioner must show that but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland,at.when an ineffective assistance claim arises in the plea context,the supreme court has said that the strickland prejudice inquiry focuses on whether counsel constitutionally ineffective performance affected the outcome of the plea process.hill,at.
the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,provides two independent requirements for federal court review of state court factual findings in habeas petitions.miller el cockrell,d.under d,a federal court may not grant a state prisoner application for a writ of habeas corpus based on a claim already adjudicated on the merits in state court unless that adjudication resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.and,under e,a determination of a factual issue made by a state court shall be presumed to be correct,unless the petitioner satisfies his burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.the two provisions,operating in tandem,require that t o secure habeas relief,petitioner must demonstrate that a state court finding was incorrect by clear and convincing evidence,and that the corresponding factual determination was objectively unreasonable in light of the record before the court.miller el,at.
thus,under federal habeas courts have no license to redetermine credibility of witnesses whose demeanor has been observed by the state trial court,but not by them.cagle branker,cir quoting marshall lonberger,d alteration in original.rather,for a federal habeas court to overturn a state court credibility judgments,the state court error must be stark and clear.id.at.we have repeatedly emphasized the deferential standard of review,especially of a state court credibility findings.see,wilson ozmint,cir credibility determinations,such as those the state court made regarding a witness,are factual determinations.as such,they are presumed to be correct absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary,and a decision adjudicated on the merits and based on a factual determination will not be overturned on factual grounds unless objectively unreasonable in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.quoting miller el,at.
as the supreme court has explained,although t he term unreasonable is no doubt difficult to define i t suffices to say that a factual determination is not unreasonable merely because the federal habeas court would have reached a different conclusion in the first instance.wood allen,d internal quotation marks omitted.rather,even if reasonable minds reviewing the record might disagree about the finding in question,on habeas review that does not suffice to supersede the trial court determination.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
merzbacher claims that his trial counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance when they failed to convey the plea offer to him and failed to advise him of his options with respect to that offer.his argument that the state court decision was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding,d,carried the day below and he obtained habeas relief from the federal court.we review de novo when,as here,the decision on a petition for a writ of habeas corpus is based on the state court record.gray branker,cir.
in granting merzbacher relief pursuant to,the federal court clearly understood the substantial constraints,outlined above,which aedpa imposed on it.moreover,like the state court,the federal court recognized that to establish constitutionally ineffective counsel,merzbacher had to demonstrate that counsel provided him with constitutionally deficient representation and a reasonable probability existed that the deficient representation prejudiced him.strickland,at.the first strickland prong deficiency in representation dominated both the state and the federal courts analyses.accordingly,we turn first to that prong.
merzbacher presented only testimonial evidence to support his claim of deficient representation,and the state court rejection of merzbacher claim rested on its determinations of the witnesses credibility.section commands a federal court to presume the correctness of state court factual findings and only overturn a state court credibility finding when the state court error is stark and clear.cagle,at.as detailed above,the record here does contain some evidence to support the state court determination as to gutierrez general lack of credibility.for example,gutierrez admitted that this was the only time in a career involving hundreds of criminal cases that she recalled having failed to convey a plea offer to a client.and she offered less than persuasive reasons for her failure to do so,she moved her office when the offer was made and it was out of her mind later when she was working to prepare for trial in this very case.
but,as the federal court carefully explained,the state court analysis contains serious flaws.for example,in finding gutierrez not credible,the state court heavily and improperly relied on highly prejudicial evidence from outside the record the circumstances of gutierrez delayed admission to the maryland bar,including disclosure of two shoplifting convictions,and newspaper accounts of her disbarment in.
further,and perhaps ultimately more significantly,the federal court pointed out that the record before the state court contained unrebutted testimony that merzbacher was never told about the offer.not only did merzbacher so testify but the only other persons in a position to know his two lawyers unequivocally confirmed that testimony.their testimony provides powerful support for his claim because,as the federal court noted,it cut significantly against their own interests since it suggests professional malfeasance.
moreover,even if gutierrez testimony is not believed on this point,there is not a shred of evidence that merzbacher lawyers counseled him about the plea,as they were required to do in providing effective assistance of counsel.see lafler.at.tellingly,even though the state court found that gutierrez had conveyed the plea offer to merzbacher,it made no findings as to or even any mention of gutierrez counseling of merzbacher 
for these reasons,whether merzbacher established a reasonable probability that he received deficient representation presents a very close question but it is a question we need not resolve here.this is so because even if merzbacher did demonstrate that the state court was unreasonable in finding he did not receive deficient performance under strickland,he did not demonstrate that the state court was unreasonable in finding it unlikely that strickland prejudice resulted from this deficient performance.
we note that although the strickland test speaks of performance first and prejudice second,in announcing its test the supreme court explained that there is no reason for a court deciding an ineffective assistance claim to resolve both components of the inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one.at.rather,i f it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice,which we expect will often be so,that course should be followed.id.we find this is just such a case,and accordingly turn to the strickland prejudice prong.
to show prejudice from ineffective assistance of counsel in a case involving a plea offer,petitioners must demonstrate a reasonable probability that they would have accepted the earlier plea offer had they been afforded effective assistance of counsel,and the plea would have been entered without the prosecution canceling it or the trial court refusing to accept it,if they had the authority to exercise that discretion under state law.frye.at accord lafler.at.
the state court most certainly did not follow this precise language in its findings.it could not have done so for the supreme court did not issue frye and lafler until well after the state court had ruled.but,the state court did make findings relevant to both elements of the frye prejudice test.we consider,in turn,its findings with respect to each of those two elements.
as to whether merzbacher demonstrated a reasonable probability that he would have accepted the plea,the state court found merzbacher did not because he avidly and vociferously maintained his innocence throughout the proceedings,was still subject to numerous civil suits,would not have admitted to any of the allegations in his wife presence or to her knowledge,and stood a good chance of successfully maintaining his defense.
merzbacher argues that he has demonstrated a reasonable probability that he would have accepted the plea by simply offering his own post hoc testimony that he would have done so and pointing out the disparity between the plea and the life sentences he received.merzbacher argues that these two pieces of evidence,without more,demonstrate the requisite prejudice under frye and lafler.plaintiff appellee br.at id.at quoting lafler.at prejudice can be shown if loss of the plea opportunity led to a trial resulting in a conviction on more serious charges or the imposition of a more severe sentence.
what exactly frye and lafler require of a petitioner to demonstrate prejudice is not clear at this time.the sixth circuit has adopted the
