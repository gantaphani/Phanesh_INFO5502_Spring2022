james tenny was convicted in a texas state court of the murder of joyce mulvey,the woman with whom he was living at the time.after unsuccessful state habeas proceedings,tenny turned to federal court.the federal district court granted habeas relief based on trial counsel failure to adequately investigate and elicit crucial evidence of.we affirm.
in,tenny and mulvey were living together in blanco,texas.mulvey worked as an attendant at elder haus,a residential facility for the elderly,located on the grounds of christ of the hills monastery.on may,tenny and mulvey had a violent altercation resulting in mulvey death.the district court below recounted the facts and state trial testimony surrounding the fight as follows 
on the night of her death,may,joyce mulvey and jim tenny had an argument over tenny moving out of their house so he could have his son come live with him.tenny testified he left the room to allow things to cool down and upon returning to the kitchen,mulvey attacked him with a gas can.mulvey sloshed gasoline into tenny eyes and all over his body.tenny further testified he could hear the clicking of a lighter and saw mulvey approaching with a lighter.the fight escalated from there with tenny punching mulvey to keep her away.
tenny called at requesting help because his old lady wa s trying,trying to burn down the house.according to tenny,mulvey then smashed a platter over his head,thereby ending the emergency call.mulvey continued her attack on tenny with a butcher knife and they engaged in a violent struggle for the knife in which tenny sustained several injuries,including a stab wound to his chest,which collapsed his lung.tenny then stabbed mulvey believing it necessary to defend his own life and caused the death of mulvey 
on may,a jury found tenny guilty of murder,rejecting his contention that the act had been in.the court sentenced him to years,rejecting tenny mitigation,sudden heat of would have capped his sentence at years.the state appellate court affirmed and tenny did not seek discretionary review by the texas court of criminal appeals.
tenny filed a state habeas petition arguing,inter alia,ineffective assistance of counsel iac in developing his claims of and mitigation.the state habeas court declined to grant tenny petition and on april,the texas court of criminal appeals denied tenny application without an opinion and without a hearing 
tenny then filed a habeas petition in federal court.the magistrate judge held an evidentiary hearing and issued a recommendation.the district court granted relief,holding that the state court unreasonably concluded that tenny had not received ineffective assistance from his trial counsel the state appealed.tenny did not file a.
we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo as claims of ineffective assistance of counsel involve mixed questions of law and fact,they are reviewed de novo.
under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,d,a writ of habeas corpus will not issue unless the state habeas court adjudication of tenny iac claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
we focus here on d that is,on whether the state habeas court decision was an unreasonable application of strickland washington in making this inquiry we ask whether the state court application of clearly established federal law was objectively unreasonable,and we are mindful that an unreasonable application of federal law is different from an incorrect application of federal law.further,we are authorized by d to review only a state court decision,and not the written opinion explaining that decision.
tenny asserts an iac claim based on his trial counsel failure to investigate adequately and elicit testimony germane to tenny theory of.the law is clear tenny claim is measured against the familiar strickland tandem of deficient performance and prejudice 
a deficient performance is conduct beyond the bounds of prevailing,objective professional standards we accord substantial deference to counsel performance,applying the strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance that is,the defendant must overcome the presumption that,under the circumstances,the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.e very effort must be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight,to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel challenged conduct,and to evaluate the conduct from counsel perspective at the time.
prejudice is established by a demonstration of a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.a defendant need not show that counsel deficient conduct more likely than not altered the outcome in the case.
in light of the aedpa,the test for federal habeas purposes is not merely whether a defendant made the requisite strickland showing,but,instead the test is whether the state court a defendant did not make the contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,the standards,provided by the clearly established federal law strickland,for succeeding on his iac claim.we are persuaded that tenny has satisfied the heightened standard prescribed by the aedpa.
we turn first to deficiency.the district court held that,insofar as the state court found no deficiency in counsel performance the state court decision was an unreasonable application of strickland.the state,in its opening brief,does not challenge this holding and we thus consider the issue waived in its reply brief,the state argues that it did not waive the issue because it is not unusual for iac analysis to assume deficient performance arguendo and to focus on the prejudice prong.this argument is meritless.while the cases cited by the state aptly illustrate that we often opt to decide an iac claim based solely on one of the two prongs that does not give the state license to argue one prong to the exclusion of the other and expect the latter issue not to be waived.had the state actually challenged the district court holding on the first prong and then proceeded arguendo,it would,of course,be a different matter.
the prejudice here is plain.the district court pointed to ample unpresented that would plainly be vital to tenny success on.as the district court expressed it,tenny did not elicit any critical testimony supporting tenny sole defense.his counsel failed to investigate and call witnesses,including two monks and a nun,and failed to elicit important testimony from witnesses,including a doctor,who were called 
much of the evidence that never reached the jury,including evidence of mulvey threats on tenny life,would clearly have been useful to tenny theory of by demonstrating that tenny had a reasonable apprehension and that mulvey was the aggressor specifically,the omitted evidence indicated that mulvey threatened to kill tenny in the days leading up even on the very day fight that resulted in mulvey death mulvey was agitated,argumentative,and threatening on the day of the fight tenny was warned on the day of the fight that mulvey intended to kill him mulvey had stabbed tenny on the friday before the fight mulvey threatened to burn the house down mulvey exhibited violent tendencies and was prone to fly into insane rages and mulvey possessed the strength necessary to throw almost any grown man to the ground.a doctor,who did testify at trial,would have provided additional testimony had tenny attorney questioned him further.specifically,he would have explained that,upon visiting tenny in the hospital after the fight,
tenny looked like he had been run over by a threshing machine.his right eye was black and blue,his right ear cut,and there was a tube coming out of his chest emptying blood from a punctured l
