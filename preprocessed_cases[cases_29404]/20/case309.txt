in,with the passage of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira,congress significantly expanded the categories of subject to mandatory detention pending their removal proceedings under section c of the revised ina,the department of homeland security dhs is required to detain aliens who have committed certain crimes when they are released.the section contains no explicit provision for bail when the constitutionality of section c was challenged in demore kim,statistics showed that removal proceedings were completed within days in percent of cases in which aliens were mandatorily detained.id.at.emphasizing the relative brevity of detention in most cases,the court concluded that detention during removal proceedings was constitutionally permissible.id.at.
however,the passage of the iirira,which,among other things,expanded the definition of criminal aliens and required states to provide notice of aliens who violate state criminal laws,combined with a simultaneous rise in immigration to the united states,has resulted in an enormous increase in the number of aliens taken into custody pending removal by,immigration and customs enforcement ice was imprisoning close to four hundred thousand aliens every year,of whom were subject to mandatory detention under section c not surprisingly,the time that each immigrant spends in detention has also risen substantially.in,the average time an alien was detained from the initiation of removal proceedings to release or entry of a final order of removal was approximately days in,the average detention time for most section c detainees was approximately days.see demore,at.since then,the situation has worsened considerably.ice has not provided statistics regarding the length of time that mandatory detainees spend in detention.it is clear,however,that today,a detained under section c who contests his or her removal regularly spends many months and sometimes years in detention due to the enormous backlog in immigration proceedings there are thousands of individuals in immigration detention within the jurisdiction of this court who languish in county jails and in and permanent ice facilities.
no doubt an appreciable number of these detainees have criminal records that subject them to mandatory deportation.many in this group are dangerous or have no ties to a community.congress was quite clear that it wanted such individuals detained pending deportation.on the other hand,this group includes who,for a variety of individualized reasons,are not dangerous,have strong family and community ties,are not flight risks and may have meritorious defenses to deportation at such time as they are able to present them.
one such detainee is alexander lora,a lawful permanent resident lpr and citizen of the dominican republic,who was convicted of drug related offenses,sentenced to probation,and taken into custody by ice agents pursuant to section c,over three years into his probation term.after four months in immigration custody,lora petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus.he contended,among other things,that he was eligible to apply for bail because the mandatory detention provision of section c did not apply to him because he had not been taken into custody when released and that indefinite incarceration without an opportunity to apply for bail violated his right to due process.
his petition was granted by the district court peck.magistrate judge peck agreed with lora statutory argument,did not reach his constitutional argument,and ordered that lora be afforded a bail hearing.at that hearing,the government did not contest his eligibility for bail.following the parties stipulation that lora,who was gainfully employed and had substantial family ties to his community,was not dangerous and posed no risk of flight,the immigration judge ij ordered lora release conditioned on his posting a bond.this appeal followed.
the main issue of statutory construction driving this appeal is whether,as lora argues and the district court ruled,the when released provision of section c applies only if the government takes an alien into immigration custody immediately following his release from a custodial sentence or whether,as the government argues,an alien is subject to mandatory detention even if dhs does not detain him immediately upon release.on this issue we agree with the government and conclude that lora was subject to mandatory detention under section c.
however,we agree with lora constitutional argument.while the supreme court has held that the government may constitutionally detain deportable aliens during the limited period necessary for their removal proceedings,demore,at,it has made clear that the indefinite detention of a raise s serious constitutional concerns in that f reedom from imprisonment from government custody,detention,or other forms of physical restraint lies at the heart of the liberty that the due process clause protects,zadvydas davis.following this guidance,we hold that,in order to avoid significant constitutional concerns surrounding the application of section c,it must be read to contain an implicit temporal limitation.in reaching this result,we join every other circuit to have considered this issue specifically,we join the ninth circuit in holding that mandatory detention for longer than six months without a bond hearing affronts due process.see rodriguez robbins,cir accordingly,we affirm the district court decision to grant the petition.
background 
lora entered the united states as a lawful permanent resident lpr from the dominican republic in when he was seven years old.for the next nineteen years,lora lived continuously in brooklyn,new york where he has a large family network,including his citizen fianc√©e,citizen mother,lpr father,and citizen brother and sister.lora has two sons whom he supports a son who is a citizen and lives in the united states and an son who lives in the dominican republic.during the nearly two decades that lora has spent in this country,he attended school and worked in grocery stores to support himself and his family.
in july,while working at a grocery store,lora was arrested with one of his and charged with several new york state offenses relating to cocaine possession.in july,lora pled guilty to criminal possession of cocaine with intent to sell,criminal possession of cocaine with an aggregate weight of one ounce or more,and criminal use of drug paraphernalia in violation of new york penal law.lora was sentenced to five years of probation.he was not sentenced to any period of incarceration and he did not violate any of the conditions of his probation.
on november,over three years into his probation term,ice agents arrested lora in an early morning raid in the brooklyn neighborhood where he was living at the time.after the agents took lora into custody,he was transferred to hudson county correctional center in kearny,new jersey,where he was detained without bond.lora was charged with removability under ina a b,a b,for having been convicted of a crime involving a controlled substance,and ina a a iii,a a iii,for having been convicted of an aggravated felony,namely,trafficking in a controlled substance as defined in ina a b,a b.dhs took the position that lora removal charges rendered him subject to mandatory detention under section c and that he was not eligible for a bail hearing.
while his removal proceedings were pending,lora moved in new york state court to set aside his conviction.his motion was granted on consent and in march,his original plea and sentence were vacated.lora was then permitted to plead to a minor offense a single count of third degree possession of a controlled substance and was to a conditional discharge imposed nunc pro tunc to july.with this new sentence,lora now has a strong argument for cancellation of removal under c because third degree possession is a class b felony under penal law and does not qualify as an aggravated felony for immigration purposes under a a iii however,he is still technically subject to mandatory detention under section c because he had been convicted of a crime involving a controlled substance under a b i.in march,lora requested that he be permitted to file an application for cancellation of removal and that he be afforded a bail hearing.the ij granted lora request to file for cancellation of removal but denied lora request for a bail hearing 
at the same time,lora filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus,challenging his continued detention.lora argued that he was not subject to mandatory detention under section c,which requires an alien to be taken into dhs custody when the alien is released because dhs did not take him into custody at the precise time when he was released on his underlying convictions,but years later,and that he could not have been detained when he was released because he was never incarcerated or kept in physical custody following his triggering conviction.lora also argued that his continued imprisonment without a bail hearing raised constitutional concerns under the due process clause of the fifth amendment in light of his substantial defenses to removal and the strong possibility of his indefinitely prolonged detention.finally,lora raised the alternative argument that his continued detention was not in the public interest,and that he should be released on parole.
the district court granted lora petition,holding that section c clear language requires that dhs detain aliens immediately upon their release from criminal custody,and because lora was not detained until years after the criminal conviction that formed the basis of his removal charge,he was not subject to mandatory detention.in the alternative,the district court also found that lora was not subject to mandatory detention because he did not serve a custodial sentence in connection with his criminal offense and so was never released from custody.the district court directed the government to provide lora with an individualized bail hearing by may,which was the date of his next hearing before the ij.the government did not seriously dispute that lora was neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community and the ij ordered that lora be released from custody after posting a bond.insofar as the record reveals,since being admitted to bail,lora remains gainfully employed,tied to his community and poised to contest his removability once dhs clears its backlog sufficiently to afford him a hearing.
the government appeals,contesting the district court interpretation of section c.the government maintains that,even though lora no longer stands convicted of an aggravated felony,he is still deportable and subject to mandatory detention as a result of his conviction under a law relating to a controlled substance.notably,the government does not take the position that it should be permitted to hold immigrants indefinitely.rather,it contends that due process requires a inquiry as to the allowable length of detention and there should be no rule for when detention becomes presumptively unreasonable.gov t reply br.at.
discussion 
when the government seeks removal of an alien,an ij can ordinarily conduct a bail hearing to decide whether the alien should be released or imprisoned while proceedings are pending.however,c requires the mandatory detention,for the duration of their removal proceedings,of aliens convicted of certain crimes.the portion of section c applicable to lora provides 
the attorney general shall take into custody any alien who 
b is deportable by reason of having committed any offense covered in section a a ii,a iii,b,c,or d of this title specified offenses including controlled substance offenses when the alien is released,without regard to whether the alien is released on parole,supervised release,or probation,and without regard to whether the alien may be arrested or imprisoned again for the same offense.
the attorney general may release an alien described in paragraph only if the attorney general decides that release of the alien from custody is necessary for certain witness protection purposes,and the alien satisfies the attorney general that the alien will not pose a danger to the safety of other persons or of property and is likely to appear for any scheduled proceeding 
c emphasis added.
thus,detention without a bail hearing under section c is mandatory unless dhs determines that an alien falls within a narrow exception not applicable here.see c.however,the clause in paragraph,when the alien is released,has been the source of persistent confusion and extensive litigation in this circuit and elsewhere.
this case calls for us to decide whether an alien is subject to mandatory detention only if he or she has been sentenced to and released from prison or some form of physical custody and whether an alien is subject to mandatory detention if there is a gap between the alien being on release and his or her confinement by dhs although these are issues of first impression for this court,other circuits as well as numerous district courts,both within and outside of this circuit,have addressed the issue but remain divided on how to apply section c 
meaning of released 
the government argues that the court should reject the district court holding that lora is not subject to mandatory detention because he was never released from a sentence of incarceration.the government relies on two bia cases in which the board determined that the word released in section c includes release from arrests see in re kotliar,w e have held that an alien who is released from criminal custody,including from an arrest preceding a conviction,is subject to mandatory detention.in re west.west and kotliar also suggest that the alien must be released from some form of physical custody for c to apply.see,west,i at w e construe the word released to refer to a release from physical custody.the government urges that,consistent with these cases,released can refer to a release from confinement,such as an arrest.
because we find that section c unambiguously mandates detention in this circumstance for other reasons,we need not confront the bia decisions or the government interpretation of them.see chevron,nat.res.def.council.d eference to an agency statutory interpretation is called for only when the devices of judicial construction have been tried and found to yield no clear sense of congressional intent.dynamics land,cline,citing ins cardoza fonseca.a natural reading of the statute suggests that the term released in section c means not incarcerated,not imprisoned,not detained,not in physical custody.see demore,at congress was justifiably concerned that deportable criminal aliens who are not detained continue to engage in crime and fail to appear for their removal hearings.thus,detention is mandated once an alien is convicted of a crime described in section c and is not incarcerated,imprisoned,or otherwise detained.this interpretation avoids nullifying the provision in section c that dhs shall take into custody any alien who is inadmissible or is deportable by reason of having committed a certain type of crime when the alien is released,without regard to whether the alien is released on parole,supervised release,or probation emphasis added which clearly contemplates sentences.see,trw.andrews,noting that statutes should be read to avoid making any provisions superfluous,void,or insignificant internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,where congress has intended to limit detention to aliens sentenced to a certain prison term,it has done so explicitly.see.a alien is not eligible for a visa or admission if the alien has committed a crime involving moral turpitude for which a sentence of at least six months has been imposed.accordingly,we conclude that an alien who has been convicted of a qualifying crime under section c is subject to mandatory immigration detention,whether he is sentenced to a prison term or to probation.
when the alien is released 
the government next argues that the district court wrongly interpreted the word when in the when the alien is released clause of section c as imposing a temporal limit on dhs obligation to mandatorily detain.because lora was not taken into immigration custody until more than three years after his july criminal conviction and sentencing,the district court found that he was outside the reach of the statute and so was eligible for bail.
this single issue consists of two inquiries whether when released contemplates detainment immediately upon release,or merely at some time after release,and whether,notwithstanding the meaning of when released,the statute imposes a temporal restriction on the agency authority and duty to detain an alien.because we defer to the bia interpretation that when released does not impose a temporal restriction on the agency authority and duty to detain an alien,we need not decide the meaning of when released.
over a decade ago,the bia,the agency charged with administering this statute,considered a challenge from a detainee to his mandatory detention.see in re rojas,bia.the detainee argued that because he had not been taken into custody when released,as directed by section c,he was not subject to mandatory detention under section c.id.at.the bia declined to consider whether when released meant immediately upon release or merely sometime after the detainee was released,and instead agreed with the government that regardless of the proper interpretation of when released,the text,structure,history,and purpose of the statute all suggested that congress did not intend the when released clause to limit the authority of agents to detain an alien.id.at.under the bia interpretation,when released refers to the time at which the duty to detain arises,and does not place a temporal limit on the agents authority to detain an alien thus,c mandates detainment even if dhs does not detain the alien immediately upon release.id.at.this has been referred to in this circuit as the construction,while lora argues for what has been referred to as the construction.see straker jones,d.
because we are faced with an administrative agency interpretation of a statute,we follow the chevron inquiry.see chevron,at.if we find,based on the plain language of the statute,that the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter.id.at.however,if we find that the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,we will proceed to the second step determining whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.we defer to the bia interpretation so long as it is reasonable,and not arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.adams holder,cir quoting chevron,at.the government argues that,because the statute is ambiguous,the district court should have followed the bia reasonable interpretation.we agree.
at the first step of the chevron inquiry,we have little trouble concluding that it is ambiguous whether when released should be given the construction or the construction.the bia agrees.rojas,at.and the supreme court has long recognized that the word when may alternatively mean the precise time when a particular act must be performed,or the occurrence which shall render that particular act necessary.united states willings.
as the bia recognized,it is unclear from the text of section c whether the when released clause is part of the definition of aliens subject to mandatory detention.rojas,at.section c requires that dhs take custody of aliens convicted of four categories of predicate criminal or terrorist acts and offenses a through d when they are released and that dhs may not release an alien described in paragraph unless that alien falls under an exception for protected witnesses.but it is not clear whether the phrase an alien described in paragraph refers to the aliens described in categories a through d,as the government argues,or to aliens who both qualify under these subcategories and were taken into immigration custody when released from custody,as lora argues.noting this difficulty,the tenth circuit has described how the when released phrase can be considered adverbial,modifying the opening verb phrase the dhs shall,or it can be considered adjectival,modifying the noun phrases in categories a through d.see olmos,at.
because we find that congress has not directly spoken on the meaning or application of when released in this statute,we must consider whether the bia interpretation of section c is permissible and thus entitled to chevron deference.see khouzam ashcroft,cir.in rojas,the alien argued that he was not subject to mandatory detention under section c because immigration authorities did not take him into custody until two days after his release.to resolve the statute ambiguity,the bia used four separate approaches to analyze section c the ordinary meaning of the statute language,although that language was ambiguous the overall statutory context and goals the statute predecessor provisions and practical considerations.rojas,at.the bia,while not deciding whether when released meant immediately upon release or something else,concluded that the duty to detain is not affected by the character of an alien release from criminal incarceration,id.at,and that the alien was subject to mandatory detention pursuant to section c of the act,despite the fact that he was not taken into immigration custody immediately upon his release from state custody,id.at consistent with chevron,we are not convinced that the interpretation is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.adams,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.as the bia explained in rojas,i t is difficult to conclude that congress meant to premise the success of its mandatory detention scheme on the capacity of dhs to appear at the jailhouse door to take custody of an alien at the precise moment of release.at.
moreover,the bia interpretation of section c follows supreme court precedent establishing that statutes providing that the government shall act within a specified time,without more,are not jurisdictional limit s precluding action later.barnhart peabody coal.i f a statute does not specify a consequence for noncompliance with statutory timing provisions,the federal courts will not in the ordinary course impose their own coercive sanction.united states james daniel good real,see also united states montalvo murillo,holding that the government may detain criminal defendants leading up to trial even if they do not comply with the relevant statute command that a judicial officer shall hold a bail hearing immediately upon the person first appearance before the officer sylvain,at applying barnhart and montalvo murillo to section c and concluding that the government retains authority under section c despite any delay.
finally,the bia interpretation has the added benefit of accounting for practical concerns arising in connection with enforcing the statute.particularly for criminal aliens in state custody,it is unrealistic to assume that dhs will be aware of the exact timing of an alien release from custody,nor does it have the resources to appear at every location where a qualifying alien is being released.state and local law enforcement may also have difficulty determining citizenship,since records of arrests and convictions may be incomplete in this regard.accordingly,we join the third,fourth,and tenth circuits in holding that dhs retains its authority and duty to detain an alien even if not exercised immediately upon the alien release regardless of whether when released contemplates detainment immediately upon release or merely sometime after release,we adopt the construction,and hold that an alien may be subject to mandatory detention even where dhs does not immediately detain the alien after release from criminal custody 
whether c authorizes mandatory detention beyond six months without a bail hearing 
because the district court decided in lora favor on statutory grounds,it did not reach his constitutional argument as noted,lora also argued below and argues to this court that his indefinite detention without being afforded a bond hearing would violate his right to due process.we agree.significantly,the distance between lora and the government on this issue is not large the government does not advocate for indefinite detention nor does it contest the view that,in order to avoid serious constitutional concerns,an implicit time limitation must be read into section c.
it is that the fifth amendment entitles aliens to due process in deportation proceedings.reno flores.t he due process clause applies to all persons within the united states,including aliens,whether their presence here is lawful,unlawful,temporary,or permanent.zadvydas,at considering a challenge to detention.as noted,more than a decade ago,in zadvydas,the supreme court signaled its concerns about the constitutionality of a statutory scheme that ostensibly authorized indefinite detention of.id.two years later,when the court upheld the constitutionality of section c in demore kim,it emphasized that,for detention under the statute to be reasonable,it must be for a brief period of time.see,at detention permissible because,as compared to zadvydas,the detention here is of a much shorter duration.justice kennedy explained in his concurrence that w ere there to be an unreasonable delay by the ins in pursuing and completing deportation proceedings,it could become necessary then to inquire whether the detention is not to facilitate deportation,or to protect against risk of flight or dangerousness,but to incarcerate for other reasons.id.at kennedy,concurring.
these cases clearly establish that mandatory detention under section c is permissible,but that there must be some procedural safeguard in place for immigrants detained for months without a hearing.accordingly,we join every other circuit that has considered this issue,as well as the government,in concluding that in order to avoid serious constitutional concerns,section c must be read as including an implicit temporal limitation.see,rodriguez,at i n several decisions over the past decade we have consistently held that demore s holding is limited to detentions of brief duration.diop,cir applying canon of constitutional avoidance to conclude that the statute implicitly authorizes detention for a reasonable amount of time ly hansen,cir noting that demore is undergirded by reasoning relying on the fact that the alien in the case,and persons like him,will normally have their proceedings completed within a short period of time and the case must be understood as only authorizing detention for brief periods of time.
however,while all circuits agree that section c includes some reasonable limit on the amount of time that an individual can be detained without a bail hearing,courts remain divided on how to determine reasonableness.this court has not yet had the opportunity to decide which approach to follow.the first approach,employed by the third and sixth circuits and favored by the government,calls for a inquiry requiring an assessment of all of the circumstances of any given case,to determine whether detention without an individualized hearing is unreasonable.diop,at see also chavez alvarez.warden york cty.prison,cir explaining the highly nature of the balancing framework.under this approach,every detainee must file a habeas petition challenging detention,and the district courts must then adjudicate the petition to determine whether the individual detention has crossed the reasonableness threshold,thus entitling him to a bail hearing.
in contrast,the second approach,adopted by the ninth circuit,is to apply a rule to cases of mandatory detention where the government statutory mandatory detention authority under section c is limited to a period,subject to a finding of flight risk or dangerousness.rodriguez,f d at.we believe that,considering the relevant supreme court precedent,the pervasive confusion over what constitutes a reasonable length of time that an immigrant can be detained without a bail hearing,the current immigration backlog and the disastrous impact of mandatory detention on the lives of immigrants who are neither a flight risk nor dangerous,the interests at stake in this circuit are best served by the approach.
first,zadvydas and demore,taken together,suggest that the preferred approach for avoiding due process concerns in this area is to establish a presumptively reasonable period of detention.in zadvydas,the court held that six months was a presumptively reasonable period of detention in a related context,namely detention.at finding that there was reason to believe that congress previously doubted the constitutionality of detention for more than six months.after that point,once the alien provides good reason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future,the government must respond with evidence sufficient to rebut that showing.id.in demore,the court held that section c authorized mandatory detention only for the limited period of the alien removal proceedings.at.at that time,the limited period referred to last ed roughly a month and a half in the vast majority of cases in which section c was invoked,and about five months in the minority of cases in which the alien cho se to appeal.id.at see rodriguez,at as a general matter,detention is prolonged when it has lasted six months and is expected to continue more than minimally beyond six months.
secondly,the pervasive inconsistency and confusion exhibited by district courts in this circuit when asked to apply a reasonableness test on a basis weighs,in our view,in favor of adopting an approach that affords more certainty and predictability.notably,the supreme court has recognized that rules provide clear guidance and ease of administration to government officials.see,zadvydas,at adopting rule for the sake of uniform administration,while also noting that it would limit the need for lower courts to make difficult judgments.compare,martin aviles,civ.at ajp,wl,at june,holding an alien for over a year without a bond hearing violated his due process rights,and minto decker,civ.lgs knf,wl,at june,because petitioner detention has exceeded twelve months in the absence of any evidence that petitioner might be a flight risk or a danger to the community he is entitled to an individualized bond hearing,and monestime reilly,d,ordering bond hearing after eight months detention,and scarlett dhs,d.five years detention unreasonable,with johnson orsino,d fifteen month detention not unreasonable,and luna aponte holder,d,nearly three years of detention not unreasonable.adopting a rule ensures that similarly situated detainees receive similar treatment.such a rule avoids the random outcomes resulting from individual habeas litigation in which some detainees are represented by counsel and some are not,and some habeas petitions are adjudicated in months and others are not adjudicated for years.
moreover,while a approach might be workable in circuits with comparatively small immigration dockets,the second and ninth circuits have been disproportionately burdened by a surge in immigration appeals and a corresponding surge in the sizes of their immigration dockets with such large dockets,predictability and certainty are considerations of enhanced importance and we believe that the interests of the detainees and the district courts,as well as the government,are best served by this approach.
finally,without a rule,endless months of detention,often caused by nothing more than bureaucratic backlog,has consequences for immigrants and their families.lora is one such example.as noted,he is a lpr who has resided in and been extensively tied to his community for years.during his years in this country,lora has remained gainfully employed and has attended school.he is in jeopardy of removal as a consequence of what now stands as a conviction in for third degree possession of a controlled substance for which he received a conditional discharge.no principled argument has been mounted for the notion that he is either a risk of flight or is dangerous.instead,the record suggests that lora is an excellent candidate for cancellation of removal pursuant to a.he is the primary caretaker of a citizen son who was placed in foster care while lora was in detention he has no arrest record aside from this drug offense conviction he has been gainfully employed for over two decades while he has resided in the united states 
for these reasons,we hold that,in order to avoid the constitutional concerns raised by indefinite detention,an immigrant detained pursuant to section c must be afforded a bail hearing before an immigration judge within six months of his or her detention.following the ninth circuit,we also hold that the detainee must be admitted to bail unless the government establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the immigrant poses a risk of flight or a risk of danger to the community.rodriguez,at 
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court.

congress adopted section c in an effort to strengthen and streamline the process of removing deportable criminal aliens against a backdrop of wholesale failure by the ins to deal with increasing rates of criminal activity by aliens and evidence that one of the major causes of the ins failure to remove deportable criminal aliens was the agency failure to detain those aliens during their removal proceedings.demore kim.

lora was detained for months,and it is certain that,were he to be returned to custody,his total period of detention would exceed six months.
see a the attorney general may cancel removal in the case of an alien who is inadmissible or deportable from the united states if the alien has been an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence for not less than years,has resided in the united states continuously for years after having been admitted in any status,and has not been convicted of any aggravated felony.lora was admitted to the united states in,has worked and resided in this country ever since,and has strong family ties and responsibilities including serving as the primary caretaker of his citizen son.see march,declaration of talia peleg,given lora residence in the united states as a green card holder,his strong family and community ties here,and other relevant factors,it is my opinion that he has a strong defense to his deportation.
lora cancellation of removal proceedings are still pending,but because he is no longer detained,his removal proceedings have been taken off of the expedited track.due to a backlog in removal proceedings,his merits hearing on his application for cancellation of removal is currently scheduled for january.
because this appeal raises questions of law as to the interpretation of c,we review the district court decision on how to interpret the statute de novo.see puello bureau of citizenship immigration,cir.
compare olmos holder,cir holding that even if there was a delay after alien was released before the alien was taken into immigration custody,mandatory detention still applies,and sylvain att y of u,cir holding that immigration officials do not lose authority to impose mandatory detention if they fail to do so when the alien is released,and hosh lucero,cir holding that a criminal alien who is not immediately taken into immigration custody after his release from criminal custody is not exempt from section c mandatory detention provision,with casta√±eda souza,cir interpreting when as signifying that dhs can subject an alien to mandatory detention only if it detains the alien at or around the time the alien is released from criminal custody,reh g en banc granted,opinion withdrawn.
the third circuit has deferred to the bia interpretation and has held that a release following arrest satisfies section c release requirement.see sylvain,at.
see rojas,at we find the statutory provision,when read in isolation,to be susceptible to different readings.
as the supreme court explained in demore,at,congress adopted section c in response to its frustration with criminal aliens ability to avoid deportation if they were not already in dhs custody when removal proceedings were completed and its concern that criminal aliens who are not detained continue to commit crimes.see,wl,at.the bia relied on this history and concluded,we discern that the statute as a whole is focused on the removal of criminal aliens in general,not just those coming into ins custody when released from criminal incarceration.rojas,at second alteration in original.
see,sylvain,at e ven if the statute calls for detention when the alien is released,nothing in the statute suggests that officials lose authority if they delay.hosh,at the negligence of officers,agents,or other administrators,or any other natural circumstance or human error that would prevent federal authorities from complying with c,can not be allowed to thwart congressional intent and prejudice the very interests that congress sought to vindicate.
lora also argues that the bia analysis is unreasonable in light of the constitutional concerns it raises by giving the government limitless authority to deny bond hearings.however,in making this argument,lora misconstrues justice kennedy concurrence in demore,which observed that due process concerns could arise if there was an unreasonable delay by ice in deportation proceedings.at kennedy,concurring.justice kennedy observations were relevant to how long an alien is kept in custody,not when the custody must start or whether there may be a gap between release from criminal custody and commencement of immigration custody.id.at.
the issue was briefed by the parties below,and we may affirm a district court decision on any basis for which there is a record sufficient to permit conclusions of law,including grounds upon which the district court did not rely.see mauro new england,cir per curiam internal quotation marks omitted.
see john palmer,the nature and causes of the immigration surge in the federal courts of appeals a preliminary analysis,sch.
amici in this case cite multiple other examples of immigrants whose lives and whose families lives have been upended by dhs enforcement of section c without judicially imposed procedural safeguards.there is the case of a lpr who was arrested by ice,without warning,nearly nine years after the most recent conviction for which ice charged him as deportable,and five days before his girlfriend gave birth to their second child.he was detained for eleven months without a bond hearing before his habeas petition was finally decided while his companion struggled to raise his three children in a homeless shelter.see baker johnson,civ.lap,wl may.amici also cite the example of an immigrant from trinidad and tobago who was detained by ice without bond following his arrest on a dismissed criminal charge for seven months before the district court ordered that he be provided with a bond hearing.see straker,d.during those seven months,his daughter was left without a primary caretaker.the fact that there are over immigrants in ice custody in the united states on an average day and many of those individuals are parents and primary caregivers of citizen children gives some indication of section c scope and potential impact.we are confident that the government also does not wish for the type of outcomes described above and does not favor a regime that perpetuates them.
in the present case,the length of lora detention fell just shy of the mark he was detained by ice on novem
