petitioner george fulton appeals the district court denial of his application for habeas corpus under.his habeas claim of double jeopardy stems from the clermont county,ohio trial court sua sponte declaration of a mistrial after a jury was impaneled but before opening arguments in his criminal trial.the mistrial was ordered when,after the prosecution amendment of dates in the indictment,fulton counsel requested a continuance of an uncertain length.
fulton second trial was to the bench and resulted in a conviction on charges of gross sexual imposition and rape,followed by the imposition of a life sentence.
because the requisite high degree of necessity existed for the mistrial,we hold that fulton fifth amendment guarantee against double jeopardy was not violated.the district court is affirmed.
this case presents a unique set of circumstances to consider in deciding whether a criminal defendant was subjected to double jeopardy in violation of the fifth amendment.the question we must answer is if a mistrial,granted for the benefit objected to defendant,can meet the requirements of manifest necessity as set forth in arizona washington,d.
a jury trial commenced in the clermont county,ohio court of common pleas on march,in the matter of state of ohio george fulton.the charges,as stated in the grand jury indictment of december,were one count of gross sexual imposition and one count of rape.the complainant was fulton daughter.
because assigned judge william walker was not available,judge ringland presided over jury selection.after the jury was sworn and sent on a lunch break,prosecutor chapman advised the court that it had just confirmed with the complainant mother that the dates in the indictment of may through september were off by a year and should be may through september.the prosecution requested that the court allow it to amend the indictment under ohio rule of criminal procedure counsel for the defense opposed the motion,asserting that the court should examine the grand jury record and that he thought we ought to have an evidentiary hearing with,what i believe is,the complainant mother testifying as to the reasons for this error in the date officer lacy of the goshen police department.
the trial court granted the motion,stating on the record that it found no bad faith on behalf of the prosecution in making the request.haynes,counsel for the defense,interjected 
haynes i sorry to interrupt you but i just want to understanding of the record,the way i understand this to have come down is,chapman and i talked last night and had,at that point,a discussion about when these parties separated.george fulton and melissa,then,fulton.
and chapman impression was that,it was in,they were separated for over a year before the divorce was final.i told him,flatly,that i did think that was the case.and my understanding is that he has then,today,i guess,has had a,since last night,anyway,had a conversation with melissa loggins,now,formerly melissa fulton,and that she had then said,no,that not when we separated.it was in.but that she had led chapman to believe that they were separated for over a year before the divorce was filed and i think that that goes directly to her credibility.
the court well,it may and that why you be able to impeach her on that,if you able to,under.however,it does not preclude chapman from making an amendment under,which i will grant.
judge ringland then anticipated that the amendment might catch defense counsel unaware,and gave haynes the 
opportunity to prepare and to take the necessary time you need to prepare for the impeachment of the witnesses,as well as obtaining witnesses in support of your defense for this new time frame.so,how long do you need 
haynes stated his intention to bring a motion to dismiss the amended indictment,as well as his need to interview potential new witnesses as a result of the new dates.the following colloquy ensued 
the court are we talking within a week or two weeks or 
haynes no,i think we need to get the investigator out.it would have to be more than that.
the court all right.so,in lieu of denial of your motion to dismiss,haynes,it my understanding you asking for additional time to prepare,is that correct 
haynes yes,i am,your honor.
the court all right.you shall have it.and we just have to get this set up for a new trial date.now,let me indicate that,because of the new date,i believe there was t there a review of some child cps children protective services records 
chapman judge,there had been in the past a review conducted by judge walker.an review of cps records that i had obtained from hamilton county.when,i think,we looked,there were no cps records in our county or in butler county.
the court we need to raise that issue,again,with the trial judge to have him review the records,again,concerning any discrepancy in the dates and review the grand jury transcript for discrepancy in dates,to determine if there any particularized need.
haynes so,you not overruling my request for evidentiary hearing.you deferring that 
the court i did say an evidentiary hearing.i said it needs to be an inspection by the court to determine if there any particularized need.i do think an evidentiary hearing is required,at this point.i think a review of the transcripts and records will be all that required.now,after that,if the judge feels it necessary,then he he wishes,ask for an evidentiary hearing.
haynes all right.
the court now,in as much as this was sent over to me,as administrative judge,only because judge walker was unexpectedly unavailable and so,under the rules of superintendency,it goes back to the original judge.
chapman then,judge,my understanding is that the court is going to grant a continuance under rule.discharge the jury,declare a,it will not be a count for double jeopardy,at this point,and then,the matter will be referred to judge walker.maybe we can set a next week to get oriented as to when we going to reschedule.
the court as far as i concerned,it is not a count that double jeopardy because i indicated that what you did no evidence of any bad you indicated the information as soon as you received it and,certainly,that for a reviewing court to review at a later point,but at this time,i mistry the case,again,it up to judge walker to determine if it double jeopardy but i would assume it would not be.
haynes you note our objection to that.
the court i note your objection,sir.
the defense filed two motions more than three weeks later,on april,for disclosure of grand jury proceedings,and to dismiss the indictment on grounds including the alleged violation of fulton guarantee against double jeopardy.judge ringland denied fulton motion to dismiss to the extent it relied on the statute of limitations in a order issued april,the same date a docket entry was made amending the dates in the indictment and bill of particulars to.he did not address fulton double jeopardy argument again.judge walker briefly addressed the issue in an order dated may,entitled entry granting defendant request for a continuance of trial and discharging the jury,reflecting the court action in granting an continuance of the trial and stating that t he court further found that jeopardy should not attach to the offenses charged in the amended indictment.judge walker entered an order denying defendant motion to compel disclosure of grand jury testimony on june.on july,he issued an order denying fulton motion to dismiss,concurring with judge ringland finding of no bad faith on the part of the prosecution in requesting amendment of the indictment,and stating only double jeopardy does not attach by the retrial of this matter.
fulton waived his right to trial by jury and was convicted on all charges by the court on october,more than six months after the mistrial declaration.he received a life sentence for the conviction of rape,a concurrent sentence for the other charge,and was determined to be a sexually oriented offender.his direct appeal included the assertion that his guarantee against double jeopardy had been violated,but that particular argument was not addressed by the state court of appeals in denying the requested relief.fulton again inclu
