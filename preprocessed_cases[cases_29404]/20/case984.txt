in october of,david hill was sentenced to death for the murder of major spencer guerry,the deputy police chief for the city of georgetown,south carolina.after the south carolina courts denied relief on both direct appeal and collateral review,hill sought habeas corpus relief in the district of south carolina.the district court denied relief,and it declined to issue a certificate of appealability coa in this proceeding,however,we have issued a coa on the following habeas corpus claims that the trial court violated the constitution in refusing to grant a trial continuance that the presence of numerous uniformed law officers in the courtroom and courthouse during the trial was unconstitutional that the district court erred in refusing to conduct an evidentiary hearing or authorize discovery on the presence of officers in the courtroom and courthouse and that hill lawyers were constitutionally ineffective in calling hill psychiatrist during the trial sentencing phase.as explained below,we reject each of these claims,and we affirm the district court denial of habeas corpus relief.
in the early evening of march,major spencer guerry,georgetown year old deputy police chief,ate supper with his wife and children at a shoney restaurant in georgetown.at approximately,guerry left the restaurant to return to police headquarters.while driving in his police cruiser on high market street,guerry observed a honda prelude travelling ahead of him with an expired colorado license plate.guerry promptly illuminated his blue flashing lights,and the honda pulled into a parking lot at the georgetown car.guerry exited his cruiser and approached the honda,requesting that the driver,david hill,provide his driver license and the honda registration card.although unable to produce a license,hill provided guerry with identification and the honda registration card.guerry then returned to his police cruiser and radioed hill information to headquarters.
while awaiting a response from headquarters,major guerry again approached the honda,instructing hill to exit the vehicle.at that time,guerry was shot in the face with hill gun.although he was mortally wounded,guerry managed to use the radio on his shoulder strap to call for assistance.as indicated on a tape recording made at headquarters,he muttered only a few words,including the code for the dispatcher at headquarters was and eh shot me.soon after this transmission,emergency personnel arrived on the scene and transported guerry to the medical university of south carolina,where he died several days later.
prior to the arrival of emergency personnel,hill fled the scene of the shooting.driving the honda,he first went to his home on mcdonald road in georgetown,where he picked up his girlfriend,wendy richardson.richardson and hill then went to the nearby home of hill parents,gracie and arthur hill.gracie and richardson then followed hill in gracie car as hill drove to johnson road in georgetown,where he abandoned the honda in a ditch.after returning briefly to his parents home,hill departed again,leaving richardson with his parents.
in the meantime,police investigators had begun to search for hill and the honda.armed with the information that major guerry had transmitted to headquarters before being shot,officers searched hill house on mcdonald road.afterward,they went to the home of hill parents.by the time they arrived,hill had abandoned the honda,returned with gracie and richardson,and left again.the officers spoke with both gracie and richardson and searched the residence.as they were leaving,they requested that gracie and richardson have hill contact the authorities.
approximately fifteen minutes after the investigators departed,hill returned to his parents home with his clothes covered in mud.after gracie informed him that the police had been there and were looking for him,hill showered and poured clorox on his hands.he then phoned the police and advised them that the honda had been stolen.investigators responded immediately,arresting hill and transporting him to headquarters.
at headquarters,investigators performed trace metal tests on hill hands,revealing that hill had recently fired a gun.after waiving his miranda rights,hill advised investigators that,earlier that afternoon,he had fought with his girlfriend.afterwards,he had walked from his home to his parents residence and had fallen asleep while reading a magazine in a nearby shed.upon awakening,hill entered his parents home,where gracie informed him that the authorities were looking for him.he then called the police.skeptical of hill statements,investigators questioned him regarding the precise timing of these events.hill then requested a lawyer,and investigators terminated the interview.that evening,investigators found the abandoned honda.they also visited a nearby exxon station and recovered a credit card receipt bearing hill signature.the receipt was at on march,hour before the shooting.
on april,hill was indicted in georgetown county for the murder of major guerry.pursuant to of the south carolina code,the state notified hill lawyers that it would seek the death penalty.trial proceedings began on monday,october,and by wednesday morning,october,jury selection had been completed.given the publicity surrounding guerry death and hill prosecution,the court sequestered the jury for the duration of the trial.during its,the state presented substantial evidence of hill guilt,including,inter alia eyewitness testimony forensic evidence and testimony from other witnesses,including richardson.by noon on saturday,october,fourth day of state rested its case,having presented more than forty witnesses.
in his defense,hill presented the testimony of officers involved with major guerry last radio transmission,as well as the testimony of a trace metal expert.hill also testified on his own behalf.by the time of trial,his version of the critical events had changed substantially from the statement he made to police on the night of his arrest.specifically,hill admitted in his trial testimony that he was in the honda at the time of guerry shooting.he claimed,however,that another person,johnny friend to whom he owed because of a drug deal gone guerry.on the day of the shooting,hill had travelled to pawleys island,south carolina,to purchase marijuana.while driving back to georgetown,he picked up steve blankenship,an individual with whom hill and cribb associated.after entering the honda,blankenship threatened hill with a pistol and forced him to drive to a ramada inn near georgetown.blankenship also removed hill handgun from the honda glove box.
at the ramada inn,cribb met hill and blankenship,and blankenship gave cribb both weapons.cribb entered the honda and informed hill that they had some unfinished business.at this point,cribb aimed a weapon at hill and instructed him to drive to hill home on mcdonald road.on the way,hill and cribb were pulled over by major guerry.during the traffic stop,cribb,who was hiding in the honda back seat,leaned into the front and shot guerry with hill handgun.after the shooting,hill and cribb drove to brick chimney road in georgetown and met blankenship.cribb forced hill to exit the honda and had him fire a handgun into the woods.afterward,cribb left with blankenship,and hill returned in the honda to his own home.he then met richardson and proceeded with her to his parents home before abandoning the honda on johnson road.
by approximately on saturday,october,hill had completed his testimony.his next witness was to be stephen cain,an expert from wisconsin.due to unforeseen circumstances,however,cain was unable to be in georgetown that afternoon or evening.given cain unavailability,the defense sought a continuance until monday morning so that cain could testify.after the court denied the continuance,the defense rested its case.closing arguments in the trial guilt phase were made on saturday evening,and the court instructed the jury on sunday morning.the jury then deliberated for about minutes on sunday before finding hill guilty of murder.
on monday,october,the trial sentencing phase began.at that time,the state presented several witnesses,including police officers,major guerry wife,and richardson.the defense began presenting its evidence monday afternoon,calling,inter alia,three experts emil coccaro,bernard albiniak,and joseph burt.each of these experts testified that hill suffered from a treatable disorder.on tuesday morning,october,hill mother testified.after closing arguments,the jury again deliberated and returned its verdict recommending that hill be sentenced to death.the trial court accepted the jury recommendation and imposed the death sentence.
pursuant to south carolina rules governing direct appeals,hill appealed his conviction and sentence directly to the supreme court of south carolina.on june,that court upheld hill conviction and death sentence.state hill.on december,the supreme court of the united states denied certiorari.hill south carolina,d.
on may,hill filed an application for relief the pcr in the court of common pleas for georgetown county the pcr court after conducting a evidentiary hearing on hill claims,the pcr court dismissed the pcr.hill catoe,order of dismissal of application for post conviction relief,the pcr order.on april,the supreme court of south carolina declined to review the pcr order,and the supreme court of the united states thereafter denied certiorari.hill maynard,d.
on april,hill filed his petition for habeas corpus the petition in the district of south carolina pursuant to b,the district court referred the petition to a magistrate judge,who conducted an extensive evaluation of hill claims and recommended that the petition be dismissed.hill maynard,bg,report and recommendations of the magistrate judge,the magistrate report.on november,the district court adopted the magistrate report and dismissed the petition.hill maynard,bg,order,the order.
although the district court denied hill request for a coa,we issued him a coa on the following habeas corpus claims 
that the state trial court violated the sixth amendment in failing to grant hill a continuance the continuance claim 
that the presence of numerous uniformed law officers in the courtroom and courthouse during the trial violated hill right to a fair trial the holbrook claim 
that the district court erred in refusing to conduct an evidentiary hearing or to authorize discovery on the holbrook claim the discovery claim and 
that hill lawyers were constitutionally ineffective in calling burt,hill psychiatrist,as an expert witness during the trial sentencing phase the iac claim.
hill ozmint,order cir.may.after discussing the applicable standards of review,we will assess the merits of each of these claims.
we review de novo a district court decision on a petition for writ of habeas corpus based on a state court record.basden lee,cir,cert.denied,d internal quotation marks omitted.additionally,we review for abuse of discretion a district court refusal to conduct an evidentiary hearing or to authorize discovery proceedings.thomas taylor,cir.
pursuant to the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,a federal court may award habeas corpus relief with respect to a claim adjudicated on the merits in state court only if the adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.as the supreme court has explained,a state court adjudication is contrary to clearly established federal law only if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than the court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.williams taylor,d.under the unreasonable application clause,a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.id.finally,a state court findings of fact are entitled to a presumption of correctness,which a petitioner may rebut only by clear and convincing evidence.e.
iii.the continuance claim 
hill asserts in his petition that the trial court violated his sixth amendment right to present his defense to the indictment in refusing to grant a continuance from saturday evening until monday morning so that he could introduce cain testimony and an enhanced version of guerry final radio transmission the supreme court of south carolina summarily denied the continuance claim,and the district court ruled that the claim had been procedurally defaulted.we have issued a coa on this claim.although we agree with hill contention that he has preserved his right to assert the continuance claim,the state court resolution of it was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,and we therefore decline to award habeas corpus relief on this claim.
as background,we review the factual predicate for this claim.at on friday,october,fifth trial state informed the court that it had exhausted its available witnesses.because its final four witnesses would not be available until saturday morning,the state sought an overnight recess.the court granted the continuance,and the trial was recessed until on saturday morning.in moving for a continuance,the prosecution stated that it was likely to rest its case on saturday morning.hill lawyers,however,had anticipated that the state would last at least through saturday.accordingly,they had planned to begin hill defense no earlier than monday of the following week.on friday,after receiving notice that the prosecution would probably rest its case the next day,hill lawyers altered their plans and prepared to present defense witnesses on saturday afternoon.
as discussed above,hill asserted that cribb had also been in the honda at the time of the incident and that cribb had shot major guerry.in support of this assertion,the defense contends that,in the garbled radio transmission to headquarters,guerry actually said they shot me rather than eh shot me.the defense had retained cain,a forensic tape analyst from wisconsin,to enhance the recording of guerry final transmission.cain expert testimony was to establish the foundation for admission of the enhanced recording,which hill hoped would convince the jury that guerry had said they shot me.on friday,october,the defense contacted cain,who was in nevada attending a conference with an assistant.cain advised hill lawyers that he would complete his business in nevada and fly to georgetown either that evening or saturday morning.after cain purchased his airline ticket for georgetown,however,his assistant became violently ill,collapsed,and was rushed to a hospital.as a result,cain was unable to leave nevada,and he thus informed the defense late on friday evening that he could not be in georgetown to testify on saturday 
when the trial court convened on saturday morning,hill lawyers informed the judge that they would be unable to present cain testimony until monday,and they thus moved for the trial to be continued until monday morning.the court reserved ruling on the continuance motion in order to see how the trial progressed.after presenting its final witness,the state rested its case at about noon on saturday.by that afternoon,hill lawyers had exhausted their available witnesses,and the defense team had been unable to secure cain presence.thus,the defense renewed its motion for a continuance,seeking to have the trial continued until monday morning when cain would be available to testify.the court denied the continuance,stating that it simply can not wait until monday morning.it is saturday.according to my watch it is approximately until five,and the court declines to recess the trial until monday morning.hill defense thus rested its case without presenting cain testimony or introducing the enhanced tape of guerry final radio transmission.
in his direct appeal to the supreme court of south carolina,hill maintained that,in denying his continuance motion,the trial court contravened his sixth amendment right to present a defense.the court summarily rejected that claim,relying on state babb,for the proposition that the denial of a motion for a trial continuance will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of discretion resulting in prejudice.hill,at.in his petition,hill again contends that the trial judge violated the sixth amendment in denying his continuance motion.the district court rejected the continuance claim on the basis that,because the supreme court of south carolina ruling rested on state law,the claim had been procedurally defaulted and could not be raised in a federal habeas corpus proceeding order at.we have issued a coa on this claim.
hill raises several subissues with respect to his continuance claim.first,he asserts that the district court erred in deciding that the claim had been procedurally defaulted.second,he maintains that there was no state court adjudication on the merits,and that we should therefore review the continuance claim de novo.finally,hill contends that he is entitled to habeas corpus relief because the trial court ruling contravened his sixth amendment right to present a defense.we examine each of these subissues in turn.
first,we agree with hill that the district court erred in ruling that the continuance claim was procedurally defaulted.it is true,of course,that when a state court has declined to consider a claim merits on the basis of an adequate and independent state procedural rule,burket angelone,cir,federal habeas corpus review of that claim is barred unless the petitioner can demonstrate cause and prejudice,or otherwise show that the failure to consider the claim will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.coleman thompson,d.in this instance,however,the state court did not dispose of the continuance claim on the basis of a state procedural rule.rather,it considered the merits of the claim,ruling that,under south carolina law,the denial of a motion for continuance will not be disturbed absent clear abuse of discretion resulting in prejudice.hill,at.applying this standard to the continuance claim,the court found no reversible error.in short,the state court did not determine that hill had procedurally defaulted his continuance claim it rejected the claim on its merits.
hill next asserts that,even though the state court rejected the continuance claim,we should nevertheless review the claim de novo because the state court failed to address and rely on the relevant supreme court precedents.in other words,hill contends that,because the state court referenced only state law in resolving this claim,it failed to adjudicate it on the merits.contrary to this assertion,a state court may adjudicate a claim on the merits without relying on or citing relevant supreme court precedents.see early packer,d applying aedpa deference to claim that state court disposed of without citing controlling supreme court precedent thus implicitly concluding that claim was adjudicated on merits see also cook mckune,cir holding that,under early,state court decision was entitled to deference under aedpa even though sixth amendment claim was reviewed under state law rather than relevant supreme court authority.in this situation,the state court,in rejecting hill claim,adjudicated it on the merits,regardless of whether it referenced relevant federal law.we must therefore apply aedpa deferential standard of review in our assessment of this claim.that is,we limit our review to deciding whether the state court adjudication was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.
in assessing the continuance claim,we must first identify the legal standards applicable to a defendant contention that a trial court violated the constitution in refusing to grant a continuance.a defendant must satisfy two elements in order to secure relief on such a claim.first,he must establish that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his continuance motion.ungar sarafite,d morris slappy,d.although a matter of continuance is traditionally within the discretion of the trial judge,a trial court is not entitled to deny a continuance because of a myopic insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay.ungar,at.second,to be entitled to relief,the defendant must establish that the trial court erroneous ruling prejudiced his defense.united states colon,cir.
in its resolution of hill direct appeal,the state court failed to provide the rationale for its decision to deny relief,and we are unable to ascertain whether its ruling was premised on the abuse of discretion issue or on the prejudice issue.accordingly,we are obliged to independently review the record and decide whether the state court rejection of the continuance claim was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law.bell jarvis,cir en banc quoting.in this situation,we are necessarily troubled by the trial court refusal to continue hill murder trial from saturday evening to monday morning.that said,hill is unable to demonstrate that he was prejudiced thereby.thus,the state court decision in rejecting the continuance claim was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.
at the time they sought a continuance,hill lawyers provided a credible and compelling justification for the need to delay the trial.they gave the court a reasonable explanation for cain unavailability they summarized cain anticipated testimony and its relevance and they informed the court that cain would be available to testify on monday morning.the trial court refusal to grant hill continuance request also evinces an apparent inequity in the court treatment of the parties.where the prosecution asked for a continuance,it was granted,but when hill requested one,it was denied.finally,the trial court refusal to grant hill a continuance appears to have been made arbitrarily.in rejecting the continuance motion,the court merely stated that it simply could not wait until monday morning.in these circumstances,the denial of hill continuance request seems to have resulted from what the supreme court has characterized as a myopic insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay.ungar,at.
nevertheless,hill can not show that he suffered any prejudice from the trial court ruling.to be sure,hill was precluded from introducing cain testimony and the enhanced tape,but as cain acknowledged during the pcr proceedings,the enhanced tape would not have aided the jury in deciphering guerry garbled transmission.in fact,both the original tape and the enhanced tape were,as the pcr court found,indecipherable.pcr order at we thus conclude that neither cain testimony nor the introduction of the enhanced tape would have aided hill defense.see gardner barnett,cir refusing to award relief because denial of continuance did not affect verdict when excluded witness testimony would not have aided defense.accordingly,the state court rejection of the continuance claim was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.
iv.the holbrook claim and the discovery claim 
in his holbrook claim,hill maintains that he was denied his right to a fair trial because of the large number of uniformed police officers present in the courtroom and courthouse during his trial more specifically,he alleges that,in an environment saturated by pretrial publicity and rampant with emotionalism in a small community,the trial court violated his right to a fair trial,as guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment by allowing a multitude of uniformed officers to be present during the trial.petition at.in the alternative,hill asserts in his discovery claim that the district court erred in denying the holbrook claim without affording him an opportunity to develop the record through an evidentiary hearing or discovery proceedings.specifically,hill contends that an evidentiary hearing or discovery would have permitted him to way of videotape recordings of the number of police officers present during his trial,and thus show that their presence interfered with his right to a fair trial.we issued a coa on both the holbrook claim and the related discovery claim.for the reasons explained below,however,we reject these claims.
during voir dire,hill asserted to the trial court that the presence of numerous uniformed law officers in the courtroom was inherently prejudicial,improperly suggesting to the jury that he was guilty.during a hearing on this tuesday,october cited two examples to support his contention.first,he maintained that,earlier that morning,six law officers were present in the hallway adjacent to the courtroom and that,as a result,the jury had to walk through a gauntlet of law officers.second,hill contended that the presence of security officers in the courtroom could unfairly prejudice the jury upon questioning from the court,however,hill conceded that not all of the six individuals in the adjacent hallway were uniformed law enforcement.in fact,hill count of six officers included bailiffs and individuals who worked in the prosecutor office.similarly,not all of the security officers in the courtroom were in uniform.for example,an officer near the judge was dressed in a coat and tie.in these circumstances,the court rejected hill contention that the presence of uniformed law officers in the courtroom was unfairly prejudicial 
on direct appeal,hill contended that the presence of uniformed law officers during his trial guilt phase violated his constitutional right to a fair trial.seeking support for this claim,hill requested that the supreme court of south carolina empower him to subpoena videos made by television stations that had covered his trial.the court refused to authorize the discovery of such videos because,pursuant to rule of the south carolina appellate rules of procedure,they would not have been admissible in any state court proceeding.the court also concluded that hill had failed to make the necessary showing that he suffered actual or inherent prejudice from the presence of uniformed law officers,and it therefore rejected the holbrook claim.id.at.
in denying the petition,the district court declined to conduct an evidentiary hearing on this claim,and it also refused to authorize hill to conduct discovery on this point,reasoning that the introduction of the videotapes would not have aided any relevant evidence not already contained within the record.order at.the court also concluded that,in adjudicating the holbrook claim,the state court decision was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.order at.
we agree that the state court decision on the holbrook claim was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.d.it is true,of course,that an accused is entitled to have his guilt or innocence determined solely on the basis of the evidence introduced at trial,and not on grounds of official suspicion,indictment,continued custody,or other circumstances not adduced as proof at trial.taylor kentucky,d.thus,for example,absent an essential state interest,it is inherently prejudicial and unconstitutional to compel a defendant to wear shackles in the presence of a jury.see illinois allen,d.
applying the principle enunciated in its taylor decision,the court has also concluded that a roomful of uniformed and armed policemen might pose a threat to a defendant chances of receiving a fair trial.holbrook flynn,d.in holbrook,the court acknowledged that,unlike the use of courtroom shackles,the presence of identifiable security officers does not inherently prejudice a defendant.id.at.the court recognized that j urors may just as easily believe that the officers are there to guard against disruptions emanating from outside the courtroom or to ensure that tense courtroom exchanges do not erupt into violence.id.accordingly,in ascertaining whether the presence of uniformed law officers during a criminal trial was so overwhelming as to be unconstitutional,a reviewing court must assess whether there was an unacceptable risk of impermissible factors coming into play.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.under this standard,a holbrook claim is difficult to establish,and a reviewing court must assess the scene presented to jurors and determine whether what they saw was so inherently prejudicial as to pose an unacceptable threat to the defendant right to a fair trial.id.at.
in support of his holbrook claim,hill relies primarily on the eleventh circuit decision in woods dugger,cir.there,the petitioner had been convicted of murdering a prison guard in florida.the crime had occurred in a community that was intimately tied to the prison,and,following the murder,over people signed a petition supporting the execution of those who kill prison guards.id.at.moreover,the murder and the resulting trial received vast publicity.finally,and most importantly,approximately uniformed prison guards were present in the courtroom during significant portions of woods trial,for no apparent reason other than to view the proceedings.the eleventh circuit concluded that,in those circumstances,the courtroom presence of the prison guards conveyed the unmistakable message that woods was guilty and deserved the death penalty.the court thus ruled that the pretrial publicity combined with the large number of uniformed spectators rose to the level of inherent prejudice,thereby depriving the petitioner of a fair trial.id.at.
in hill case,however,the presence of law officers in the courtroom did not brand hill with an unmistakable mark of guilt.holbrook,at.internal quotation marks omitted.we recognize,of course,that the community of georgetown was greatly impacted by the horrible death of major guerry likewise,that crime and hill subsequent trial were highly publicized.that said,however,there is nothing in the record to indicate that the courtroom was filled with an array of police officers.further,the officers present were dispersed throughout the courtroom.in other words,they were not positioned so as to create the impression that hill was dangerous.see united states elder,cir denying relief because marshals were spread around the courtroom.finally,the jurors may well have believed that the officers seated in the courtroom were waiting to testify.the judge did not sequester the trial witnesses,and at least seventeen officers testified.in such circumstances,the presence of officers in the courtroom did not create a scene that was so inherently prejudicial as to pose an unacceptable threat to the right to a fair trial.holbrook,at.it necessarily follows that the state court decision to deny the holbrook claim was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.
our ruling on this issue,however,does not end the matter.hill also contends that,if the current record does not entitle him to relief on the holbrook claim,he is entitled to develop the record further.we thus turn to the discovery claim,whether the district court abused its discretion in denying hill an evidentiary hearing and in failing to authorize discovery on the holbrook claim.
in seeking habeas corpus relief on his holbrook claim,hill requested the district court to conduct an evidentiary hearing or authorize discovery so that he could obtain videotapes of his trial.the district court denied the discovery claim,reasoning that the introduction of the videotapes would not have aided any relevant evidence not already contained within the record.order at.hill now maintains that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to conduct an evidentiary hearing and failing to authorize discovery on his holbrook claim.as explained below,the court was within its discretion in rejecting the discovery claim,and we affirm.
to obtain authorization to conduct discovery,hill is obliged to make a specific allegation that shows reason to believe that he may be able to demonstrate that he is entitled to relief.quesinberry taylor,cir.hill has failed to make the required showing,however,in that he has failed to provide any plausible indication that the videotapes he seeks might demonstrate that he is entitled to relief under holbrook.in particular,there is nothing in the record indicating that these t
