the district court denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus is reviewed de novo.bell ozmint,cir.we may grant relief on a claim adjudicated on the merits in a state court only if the proceeding resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.with this in mind,we turn to the merits of muhammad claims.
muhammad first argument is that the government withheld exculpatory information during his trial.a brady maryland,d,violation has three essential elements the evidence must be favorable to the accused it must have been suppressed by the government,either willfully or inadvertently and the suppression must have been material,it must have prejudiced the defense at trial.monroe angelone,cir citing strickler greene,d.
muhammad notes that in june,one month before the due date for filing his state habeas petition,his virginia attorneys received from his maryland attorneys a dvd with approximately pages of discovery responses that were not produced during his virginia case over two years earlier even though they were possessed by the same multijurisdictional joint investigation team.muhammad contends that several of these undisclosed documents contained exculpatory information that would have undermined portions of the prosecution case in virginia.
first,muhammad takes issue with the government failure to disclose an fbi criminal analysis that indicated that the sniper committing the shootings was likely acting alone.he believes that this analysis would have undermined the testimony of sniper expert mark spicer,who opined that a sniper team carried out the shootings because one person could not have done so alone.moreover,in the murder of pascal charlot,the government had no direct evidence of muhammad involvement,but used spicer testimony to draw the connection.the district and state courts concluded that the analysis was not exculpatory because the report did not definitively conclude that the killings were the work of a single shooter.muhammad warden,at.for example,the report opined that i f there is a second offender,he is not likely to be an equal partner in these crimes,and would be subservient to the primary offender.furthermore,the fbi profile explicitly notes,this analysis is not a substitute for a thorough,investigation,and should not be considered all inclusive.the information provided is based upon probabilities.id.at.given the inconclusive language in the report,it can not be considered exculpatory,and the state court conclusion that there was no brady violation was not in error.
second,muhammad takes issue with the ballistics evidence used to convict him.among the undisclosed information,he points to reports that the evidence recovered from the september and september shootings were too damaged to provide a conclusive ballistics match.he also highlights a report from the prince george county police department that there was insufficient evidence to determine whether the handgun recovered at the alabama shooting was that used to fire the bullets that killed the victims.finally,he points to a december,report that preliminary ballistics findings were inconclusive.the district court dismissed the claims after it determined that muhammad failed to present them to the state court.muhammad concedes that he did not present the claims to the state court initially pet r br,but he responds that the warden raised the issue by arguing that the suppressed evidence was not material and that he disputed the claim.
upon review of the portions of the record that muhammad cites in support of his argument that these claims were properly presented to the state court,we must rule against him.there is no indication in the record that the government directly presented the issue of the materiality of the undisclosed ballistics evidence to the court.and although muhammad claims to have disputed the prosecution ballistics testimony in his motion for rehearing,the motion does not mention the ballistics reports detailed above.thus,it appears that muhammad did not present these claims to the state court and they are therefore forfeited 
third,muhammad disputes evidence of his involvement in the parker shooting in alabama,which was used as one of the predicate killings for his capital charges.he claims that several witnesses reported conflicting information,and relevant to the undisclosed information,two witnesses who identified someone other than malvo at the scene were not disclosed to him,and witnesses who reported seeing a handgun were also not disclosed.muhammad interprets the previously undisclosed interviews to indicate that clyde,along with james gray,chased after malvo point and fire a handgun.yet,wilson does not actually say that he saw a handgun in fact,he could not specifically identify the type of gun that he saw,but demonstrated what he saw by extending his arms straight out.additionally,muhammad argues that wilson account could have been used to impeach other witnesses because wilson stated that the suspect was wearing a green or turquoise from other descriptions he could not identify malvo in the lineup,casting doubt on gray identification.the supreme court of virginia determined that his testimony could not have been used to impeach gray because wilson saw malvo from a different vantage point and chased malvo down a different route from gray,and gray saw malvo.moreover,because wilson did not testify,the report would have been of minimal use.we can not say that the supreme court of virginia conclusion was unreasonable.
further,in an undisclosed report,forensics experts in alabama had previously determined that the bullets used in the killing were caliber and likely came from a handgun.muhammad contends that it was only after his apprehension that the experts determined,without examining the weapon,that the bullets came from his caliber bushmaster rifle and not the caliber handgun found nearby.but muhammad challenges to the ballistics information were not made in state court.moreover,atf firearms examiner dandridge made an independent conclusive match of the bullets found in montgomery to the bushmaster rifle.thus,these claims must fail 
fourth,muhammad challenges additional evidence related to the chariot shooting in the district of columbia,another predicate killing for his capital murder conviction.he alleges that the government suppressed evidence that one witness,gail howard,had previously provided only a vague description of the car seen at the scene did not speak to the police until weeks after the shooting,contrary to her testimony and had letters written by the police to the immigration and naturalization service on her behalf in order to assuage her fears about her immigration status.moreover,those witnesses who talked to the police within hours after the shooting supposedly indicated that a handgun,not a rifle,was used in the shooting.
howard police statement said that the car she saw was an american made,big police looking car,square shape.the same type of car people buys sic,after the police had them.i think it was a four door and the windows were tinted.and the car was dark colored.this description is not vague it accurately describes a chevrolet caprice,which is what muhammad drove.as for the immigration letters,as the supreme court of virginia noted,muhammad makes no allegation that howard testified falsely,so it is unclear how this information would prove exculpatory.regarding the statements from the other seven witnesses,only one of them,ayman gomma,states that a handgun was fired,and this was not from personal observation,but was instead a deduction he drew from his training in the army and the sound that he heard.moreover,none of them testified at trial,and howard testimony,which the witnesses would have supposedly impeached,was corroborated by the ballistics evidence.thus,the supreme court of virginia conclusion that the information was not exculpatory was not incorrect.
the fifth category of evidence that muhammad raises as exculpatory concerns the ballenger killing in baton rouge,louisiana,which was used as one of the predicate offenses for the virginia capital charges.ingrid shaw testified that she saw malvo running from the murder scene and identified muhammad caprice as the one that malvo entered.however,when she was first interviewed,and in two subsequent interviews,she did not mention seeing a car parked nearby that later picked up malvo.when she did mention a car,she said it could be an olds cutlass,and the louisiana license plate number she gave was registered to a ford.presumably,this information could have been used to impeach her testimony,and the district court found as much.however,the district court ultimately concluded that the information was not prejudicial because of the ballistics evidence,her positive identification of malvo,and the fact that the ballenger murder was one of several predicate killings for the capital murder charge.we can find no error in this conclusion.
finally,muhammad contends that the commonwealth failed to disclose a series of twelve letters written by malvo to another inmate named.these letters allegedly contradict the commonwealth position that muhammad directed or controlled malvo acts,as required by virginia law in order to subject muhammad to the death penalty.see muhammad virginia.while the letters do not discuss muhammad directly,muhammad argues that the letters could be used to demonstrate that malvo was not malleable and could think independently of muhammad.the district court and the supreme court of virginia determined that the letters were largely cumulative because there was trial testimony that also indicated that malvo could think independently.given this,the conclusion of the state courts in this regard was not unreasonable.
let it be clear that we by no means condone the actions of the commonwealth in this case.as a matter of practice,the prosecution should err on the side of disclosure,especially when a defendant is facing the specter of execution.when questioned at oral argument regarding why this information was withheld or why the commonwealth did not take the step of instituting an policy,the commonwealth had no explanation.yet,at this stage of the criminal process,we deal only with actions that were clear violations of the constitution.while not admirable,the commonwealth actions did not violate the constitution.even if the withheld evidence were exculpatory,muhammad can not show that he was prejudiced by any nondisclosure.the jury determined that he murdered several people,the evidence against him in most instances was compelling,and any number of the killings could serve as the one predicate killing necessary for his conviction.see griffin united states,d a general jury verdict is valid so long as it was legally supportable on one of the submitted though that gave no assurance that a valid ground,rather than an invalid one,was actually the basis for the jury action.thus,we find no constitutional violation.
muhammad next set of claims involves his belief that his trial attorneys were ineffective because they did not object to his representing himself despite evidence that indicated brain abnormalities and difficulties processing and communicating information.in order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,muhammad must first show that counsel performance was deficient.this requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the sixth amendment.strickland washington,d.second,muhammad must demonstrate that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.this requires showing that counsel errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial,a trial whose result is reliable.id.
muhammad alleges that his trial attorneys were informed of three abnormalities in an mri taken prior to his october,request to represent himself a a shrunken cortex,b a cavum septum pellucidum,and c an abnormal shortening of the corpus callosum.the shrunken cortex shows the loss of vital brain tissue that control sic an individual ability to analyze information,organize,control and direct his behavior and emotions,solve problems and learn from his own experiences.pet r br.muhammad claims that this is the result of severe beatings he received as a child.the cavum septum pellucidum is a space in the brain that should close during childhood,but muhammad did not.he notes a relationship between a cavum septum pellucidum and psychoses and schizophrenia.there is a similar relationship between schizophrenia and a shortened corpus callosum.
additionally,muhammad presents a topographic display that shows the damage to his brain,as indicated by shades of color.pet r br.the display was created for his habeas petition,but muhammad alleges that his trial attorneys knew the information at the time of his pro se request.moreover,an iq test,the,indicated that his performance was below percent of other men his age.dorothy lewis,a psychiatrist,determined that although muhammad could display a superficial brightness,he was not competent to represent himself see also finally,muhammad alleges that his trial attorneys knew that he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.muhammad contends that all of this evidence should have led his trial attorneys to object to his representing himself and prevented them from calling him very bright when the judge questioned them about muhammad ability to represent himself.
even if we assume that his attorneys should have objected to muhammad,the state and district courts found that muhammad did not show that he was prejudiced,since he represented himself for only two days during the government presentation of its case,and his defense attorneys were heavily involved as standby counsel,preserving objections to the government evidence and attempting to play as full a role as the court would allow.muhammad points only to the fact that eighteen witnesses were presented,including the government sniper expert,and that he made ramblings in front of the jury that damaged its view of him.however,muhammad does not point to any evidence that was improperly received and considered by the jury,or any potentially prejudicial piece of evidence.thus,the decision of the state courts on muhammad iac claim was not an unreasonable application of clearly established law 
according to muhammad,the district court further erred when it excluded all defense expert testimony during the penalty phase of his trial as a sanction for failing to submit to an interview by the commonwealth psychiatrist.muhammad had planned to present the opinion of mark cunningham,a psychologist who had interviewed muhammad friends and family,in order to show how his upbringing influenced his subsequent adult actions,including the shootings at issue.muhammad did not plan to use cunningham in order to present a psychiatric defense to his crimes.instead,he argues,cunningham would have been used only in mitigation so that he would receive life imprisonment instead of death.the defense attorneys concluded that they could not introduce the lay testimony without cunningham because only cunningham could provide the jury a conceptual basis for assessing muhammad moral culpability and understanding the truly mitigating character of this evidence.pet r br.
the lay testimony that the defense attorneys would have presented included accounts from muhammad sister,aurolyn williams,who would have testified that their mother died of breast cancer while they were young.the children then moved into their grandparents house,where they lived with twenty other people and were beaten,forced to eat peas separately from everyone else every night,prevented from entering the house during the day,and never told their birthdays until they were older.another of muhammad sisters,bessie williams,would have testified similarly.his brother,edward williams,would have testified about how their uncle,felton reform school guard convicted of battery with a dangerous weapon in for beating a minor to attacked them.muhammad was allegedly forced to place his hand on a spark plug while his grandfather,guy holiday,pulled the cord.
according to th
