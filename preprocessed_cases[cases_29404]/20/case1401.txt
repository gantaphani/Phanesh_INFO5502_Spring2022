at the police station,defendant waived his miranda rights and admitted that he and randy had killed lewis and ruth.defendant said that while at the crystal bar,he and randy had talked about going to rob the rays,and decided that they would have to kill the rays because they did not want the rays to be able to identify them.defendant told police that after arriving at the rays house,he and lewis began to argue about money that defendant supposedly owed lewis.defendant further admitted that he picked up an object from the kitchen counter and struck lewis,eventually overpowering him.defendant claimed that lewis said,i going to kill you,kenny,so defendant grabbed a knife and cut lewis throat.he then rolled lewis on his side and took his wallet.defendant said he walked to the bedroom and saw ruth body on the floor.randy had choked her to death.the two men ransacked the bedroom and left in russell automobile.

state proceedings 
prior to trial,smith counsel filed a motion to suppress smith confession to the police.the motion challenged both the arrest itself and the subsequent interrogation and was described by the trial court at the hearing as a shotgun motion.suppression hr g tr.at.at the hearing,the government called three detectives who participated in smith arrest and interrogation,and smith counsel did not call any witnesses.smith counsel did not question any of the witnesses about smith mental state at the time of the interrogation.a supplemental brief filed by smith counsel focused not on the interrogation but on the supposed lack of probable cause for the arrest.the trial court subsequently denied the motion.
smith appealed his convictions and sentence to the ohio supreme court raising several assignments of error.among other things,smith argued that recent amendments to the ohio constitution providing for appellate review in capital cases violate the fourteenth and eighth amendments the capital specifications on his conviction for the murder of ruth ray required the jury inappropriately to examine the actions of the principal offender,his brother randy,rather than smith actions the death penalty was applied inappropriately,excessively,and disproportionately because smith brother randy received only a life sentence prosecutorial misconduct at smith trial denied his right to due process smith did not receive effective assistance of counsel at all stages of the proceedings smith statement to police was obtained involuntarily and unknowingly and ohio statutory provisions governing the imposition of the death penalty are unconstitutional on their face and as applied.the ohio supreme court denied smith appeal on all grounds and affirmed his convictions and sentence.
smith then sought postconviction relief in the ohio state courts pursuant to ohio revised code,raising eleven claims for relief and requesting an evidentiary hearing and the opportunity to conduct discovery.among his grounds for relief,smith claimed that he was denied effective assistance of counsel and that his statements to the police should have been suppressed because he was intoxicated at the time of the interrogation.the trial court denied smith relief,and the ohio court of appeals affirmed.the ohio court of appeals concluded that many of smith claims were barred by res judicata and that smith had not met his burden to show that an evidentiary hearing was warranted.state smith,no,wl ohio.
federal proceedings 
on october,smith filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio pursuant to,asserting nineteen grounds for relief.among these claims,smith asserted that his constitutional rights were violated by the prosecutor misconduct on of smith and during closing arguments,smith counsel was ineffective in challenging his confession,smith constitutional rights were violated when he was sentenced to death for a murder he did not commit,smith rights to equal protection and due process were violated by ohio elimination of the intermediate level of appellate review for capital defendants,and ohio statute is unconstitutional on its face and as applied to smith.smith initially sought discovery and an evidentiary hearing,but both motions were denied without prejudice.although smith filed a renewed motion for leave to conduct discovery,which was then denied,he never filed a renewed motion for an evidentiary hearing.
the case was referred to a magistrate judge,who recommended that the petition be denied on all grounds.smith filed objections to the magistrate judge report and recommendation,but the district court ultimately adopted the report and recommendation and denied relief.smith mitchell,no,wl,smith mitchell,no,wl.the district court did,however,grant a coa on one claim whether ohio system of appellate review for capital cases violates the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.smith,wl,at.we subsequently expanded the coa to include four additional claims whether the prosecutor committed misconduct at trial by arguing that smith lacked remorse and by improperly questioning smith on whether trial counsel ineffectively challenged smith confession whether smith was sentenced to death for a murder he did not commit whether the ohio death penalty statute is unconstitutional as applied to smith.joint appendix at order.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
in a habeas corpus proceeding,this court reviews a district court legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.smith berghuis,cir quoting miskel karnes,cir.because smith filed his habeas petition after april,we review all claims that were adjudicated on the merits by the ohio state courts under the standards set forth in the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat.codified at.under aedpa,
an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.the supreme court has explained that subsection d contains two prongs,the contrary to and the unreasonable application of clauses,each with an independent meaning.terry williams taylor,d.a decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if either the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in the supreme court cases,id.at,or the state court confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of the supreme court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from supreme court precedent,id.at.a decision is an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,on the other hand,if the state court identifies the correct governing legal rule from the supreme court cases but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular state prisoner case.id.at.
prosecutorial misconduct 
smith argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct during the guilt phase of the trial.specifically,smith claims that the prosecutor argued during his closing statement that smith lacked remorse and that the prosecutor badgered smith and made inflammatory comments about the victim on.in the evaluation of a claim for prosecutorial misconduct,it is not enough that the prosecutor comments were improper,but t he relevant question is whether the prosecutors comments so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.darden wainwright,d quoting donnelly dechristoforo,d accord broom mitchell,cir,cert.denied,d.in order to satisfy the standard for prosecutorial misconduct,the conduct must be both improper and flagrant.broom,at accord boyle million,cir.we consider four factors in determining whether a prosecutor improper conduct is flagrant 
the likelihood that the remarks of the prosecutor tended to mislead the jury or prejudice the defendant whether the remarks were isolated or extensive whether the remarks were deliberately or accidentally made and the total strength of the evidence against the defendant.
broom,at quoting bates bell,cir,cert.denied,d accord boyle,at.
the ohio supreme court rejected smith arguments,finding that neither instance of alleged misconduct was improper.as to the prosecutor remarks during closing arguments,the court found that t he prosecutor reference to defendant lack of remorse may have been intended to question his credibility.smith,at.we agree that this statement was not improper in the context of this case.on direct examination,smith testified that he cried when he told his friend james baker about the murders this contradicted baker testimony that smith was laughing when he told baker about slitting lewis ray throat.the prosecutor reference to baker testimony that smith lacked remorse was proper to discredit smith contradictory testimony.
regarding smith,the state court concluded that b ecause defendant claimed that parts of his written confession to police were untrue,it was not improper for the prosecutor to ask defendant to identify those parts of his confession and that because d efendant testimony also conflicted with the photographs it was not improper for the prosecutor to question defendant about the photographs in evidence.id.at.although we believe that some of the prosecutor conduct on may have been improper,particularly his questioning of smith about the kind of sounds ray lewis made when you ripped his throat from ear to ear,trial tr.at,we can not conclude that this conduct was flagrant such that it so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.darden,at.the comments were isolated,do not seem to have been purposeful,and any prejudice was slight,as the jury already had graphic photographs of the crime scene.further,the evidence against smith,particularly the photographs,the physical evidence,baker testimony,and the statement smith gave to police after he was arrested,was very strong.overall,we do not find unreasonable the conclusion of the ohio supreme court that no misconduct occurred that would have affected the fairness of the trial.smith,at.
ineffective assistance of counsel 
smith argues that his trial counsel performed ineffectively by failing to develop and introduce at the suppression hearing evidence of smith intoxication at the time of his arrest and interrogation and of his low mental capacity.the standard for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel was set out by the supreme court in strickland washington,d.claims of ineffective assistance of counsel have two components a petitioner must show that counsel performance was deficient,and that the deficiency prejudiced the defense.mason mitchell,cir quoting wiggins smith,d.to establish that counsel was deficient,the defendant must show that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.strickland,at.to establish prejudice,t he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.id.at.after setting forth the strickland standard,the ohio supreme court denied smith claim because i ntoxication affecting one state of mind,absent coercive police activity,would be an insufficient reason to exclude his voluntary confession.smith,at citing colorado connelly,d.
although we believe that smith has likely established the first strickland prong,that his counsel performance was deficient,we conclude that smith has not shown that this deficiency prejudiced the outcome of the suppression hearing.we first note,however,that the ohio supreme court reliance solely on colorado connelly was misplaced,because smith did not argue only that evidence of intoxication would have shown that his confession was involuntary,but also smith contended that this evidence would have shown that he did not knowingly and intelligently waive his miranda rights.a suspect in custody may waive his miranda rights provided the waiver is made voluntarily,knowingly and intelligently.miranda arizona,d.the supreme court has stated that this inquiry involves two distinct dimensions 
first the relinquishment of the right must have been voluntary in the sense that it was the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation,coercion,or deception.second,the waiver must have been made with a full awareness both of the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.only if the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation reveal both an uncoerced choice and the requisite level of comprehension may a court properly conclude that the miranda rights have been waived.
colorado spring,d quoting moran burbine,d.as this court has explained,while connelly establishes the standard for showing that a confession was involuntary,the question of whether a miranda waiver was knowing and intelligent is a separate question.clark mitchell,cir.in considering the merits of smith underlying miranda claim,the ohio supreme court improperly looked only at whether smith would have been able to satisfy the first element of the inquiry,voluntariness.
the ohio supreme court application of strickland,however,was not unreasonable.in evaluating whether a miranda waiver was knowing and intelligent,a court will apply a totality of the circumstances test to ascertain whether the defendant understood his right to remain silent and to await counsel.clark,at.applying this standard,we conclude that smith has not shown that he was prejudiced by his counsel performance.in support of his claim,smith presents his trial testimony,as well as that of james baker,who was with smith the day of the arrest,that smith had ingested various prescription medications,smoked marijuana,and consumed a large amount of alcohol during the hours leading up to his arrest.smith also presents the affidavits of three experts detailing smith limited mental capability and long history of polysubstance abuse.charles kandiko,who conducted a neuropharmacological evaluation of smith,concluded that smith was intoxicated at the time of his arrest and interrogation by police and therefore was not in a mental state to competently decide whether he wanted to talk to the police or not.at kandiko evaluation at.even in light of this evidence however,smith would not have been able to show that his waiver was not knowing and intelligent under the totality of the circumstances.the testimony of the officers at the suppression hearing showed that smith was given his miranda warnings at least three times and that he affirmatively stated that he did not need a lawyer and that he would talk about the killings.after completing a typed statement,the detective had smith read the statement back to him to show that smith could read,and smith then signed the statement and initialed various edits.it is highly unlikely that this testimony would have been controverted by smith had he testified at the suppression hearing.during his trial testimony,smith stated that he recalled being advised of his rights and agreed that he was willing to talk to the detective,willing and ready to confess at that time to actually killing lewis,and had no intention of denying at all.trial tr.at.smith age and previous experience with the criminal justice system would have weighed further toward finding the waiver knowing and intelligent.see murphy ohio,cir.moreover,smith has submitted no evidence that his conduct during the interrogation gave the police any indication of his alleged intoxication or failure to understand his repeated waivers.see garner mitchell,cir en banc.overall,we conclude that smith has not shown a likelihood that the presentation of this evidence at the suppression hearing would have changed the outcome of the proceeding 
smith death sentence for the murder of ruth ray 
smith argues that his constitutional rights were violated when he was sentenced to death for the murder of ruth ray,who was killed by smith brother randy,because the capital specifications did not require that smith had the specific intent to murder ruth ray and did not genuinely narrow the class of persons eligible for the death penalty.the ohio supreme court rejected these claims on direct appeal,concluding that t he eighth amendment does not prohibit the death penalty for an accomplice whose participation in the felony murder was significant,and whose mental state is one of reckless indifference,smith,at citing tison arizona,d,and finding that the jury specifically found that smith purposely intended to kill ruth ray,and that he did so with prior calculation and design as an aider and abettor in her aggravated murder,id.
smith was found guilty for the murder of ruth ray under ohio revised code b,the provision of the statute in effect at the time the offenses were committed.he also was found guilty on three capital specifications,making him eligible for the death penalty t he offense was committed for the purpose of escaping detection,apprehension,trial,or punishment for another offense committed by the offender,ohio a the offense at bar was part of a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing of or attempt to kill two or more persons by the offender,a and t he offense was committed while the offender was committing,attempting to commit,or fleeing immediately after committing or attempting to commit aggravated robbery,and either the offender was the principal offender in the commission of the aggravated murder or,if not the principal offender,committed the aggravated murder with prior calculation and design,a.
in arguing that these capital specifications were deficient,smith primarily relies on the supreme court decisions in tison arizona,d,and enmund florida,d.in tison,the court stated,enmund held that when intent to kill results in its logical though not inevitable taking of human eighth amendment permits the state to exact the death penalty after a careful weighing of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances.tison,at.the court therefore held that the reckless disregard for human life implicit in knowingly engaging in criminal activities known to carry a grave risk of death represents a highly culpable mental state,a mental state that may be taken into account in making a capital sentencing judgment when that conduct causes its natural,though also not inevitable,lethal result.id.at.the supreme court recently noted with approval that the ohio aggravated murder charge intent element does not require any showing that the defendant had himself shot the victim.rather,ohio law considers aiders and abettors equally in violation of the aggravated murder statute,so long as the aiding and abetting is done with the specific intent to cause death.bradshaw stumpf,d.
smith essentially argues that the state did not prove that he had the specific intent required to sentence him to death for the murder of ruth ray,because the capital specifications used do not require a showing of prior calculation and design.this argument fails,however,because,the ohio supreme court reasonably concluded that the jury found that smith and his brother had planned to kill both lewis and ruth ray to avoid leaving any witness,providing the requisite intent.smith,at.smith focus on the wording of the capital specifications ignores the fact that the specific intent to cause death is an element of the statute itself,which requires that n o person shall purposely cause the death of another while committing or fleeing an enumerated felony.ohio b emphasis added.the statute also states that n o person shall be convicted of aggravated murder unless he is specifically found to have intended to cause the death of another and instructs that the jury may not conclusively infer such intent from the fact that the person engaged in a common design with others to commit the offense by force and violence or because the offense and the manner of its commission would be likely to produce death.ohio d.therefore,regardless of the capital specifications,the jury made a finding of specific intent and purpose to cause the death of ruth ray when it found smith guilty of her aggravated murder under.no more was required under enmund and tison.
smith also argues that the jury instructions improperly added the phrase as an aider and abettor to the language of the third capital specification,a resulting in failure genuinely to narrow the class of persons eligible for the death penalty or reasonably to justify the imposition of a more severe sentence on the defendant compared to others found guilty of murder as required by zant stephens,d.smith br.at.smith argues that this addition removed the requirement that smith acted with prior calculation and design in the murder of ruth ray,which is a requirement of the capital spe
