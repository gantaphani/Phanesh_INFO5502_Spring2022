monica cosby was convicted in illinois state court of murder for helping her boyfriend kill his mother and conceal her body.after pursuing a direct appeal and seeking collateral relief in the illinois courts,cosby filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court.the district court denied the petition.cosby appeals.we affirm.
the gruesome facts of this case challenge the imagination.monica cosby began living with her boyfriend,kmuel or kevin king shortly after halloween in.they shared an apartment that cosby thought was kmuel,but it actually belonged to kmuel mother,bobbie jean king.cosby three children,ages seven,four,and one at the time,who had been staying with cosby parents,joined her there shortly before thanksgiving.kmuel mother soon returned to reside in the apartment with her own infant son.this combination left three adults and four young children in the,apartment.bobbie relinquished use of the bedroom and slept in another area on the floor next to her own infant crib.
not surprisingly,tensions peaked around christmas because bobbie,who was not a christian,did not want a christmas tree in her home.bobbie was already highly irritated by the overcrowded conditions imposed upon her apartment.although cosby testified that bobbie never objected to the additional residents,other evidence suggested that bobbie insisted that cosby and her children leave.regardless,cosby testified that she planned to leave anyway because of a breakdown in her relationship with kmuel shortly after christmas.
what happened next is gleaned primarily from cosby testimony at trial.in the early hours of december,cosby and kmuel ingested alcohol and marijuana at a gathering in another apartment.after they returned,bobbie was upset due to their late arrival.cosby testified that kmuel and his mother began to argue,while cosby ate cake with her children in the kitchen and listened to the radio.kmuel then entered the kitchen and informed cosby that he had just killed his mother,doing it for her.
cosby and kmuel then went to the bathroom,where they viewed the body.blood from bobbie beaten head covered the floor.at kmuel request,cosby fetched a plastic bag.although in a statement to the police cosby stated that she placed the bag over bobbie head,at trial she testified that kmuel did it.kmuel tied an electrical cord around the bag.together,they maneuvered the body into the bathtub,placing plastic bags of laundry over her.they also bound bobbie arms and legs.cosby and kmuel then engaged in sexual relations on the living room floor while the children were asleep in the bedroom.
the next morning the body remained in the bathtub,even as the children used the bathroom.several times during the day,while cosby was present in the apartment,bobbie daughter came looking for bobbie.the police also visited to investigate the disappearance.in the wake of these inquiries,cosby and kmuel decided to relocate and ultimately dispose of the body.they placed the victim in a shopping cart piled with laundry bags,laundry detergent,and fabric softener.they then moved the shopping cart to a neighbor closet,claiming that they needed a place to store some dirty laundry.cosby later led a friend to the body.the police were alerted and arrested both cosby and kmuel on the evening of december.
cosby mother arranged for an attorney,a family friend who did not practice criminal law,to visit her at the police station that night.the attorney conferred with cosby for approximately minutes.as the attorney departed at,he advised the officers that cosby was invoking her right to remain silent.cosby also asserted this right.the officers returned about two hours later,informed her of her miranda rights,and confronted cosby with statements made by kmuel.cosby made two statements,one at and another,after again being informed of her miranda rights,at.the two statements each recounted the preceding events in substantially identical detail,except that in the statement,cosby stated that she placed the bag over the victim head.cosby was subsequently charged with murder and concealment of a homicidal death.
cosby trial counsel prepared a motion to suppress the statements,but filed it with an incorrect case number.the motion was never or decided by the court.at the bench trial,the prosecution offered the statement,but not the statement,into evidence.cosby counsel did not object.instead,cosby counsel pursued a defense that was consistent with the statements a defense.he argued that cosby believed bobbie to be dead when she or kmuel placed the bag over bobbie head and bound her limbs.since cosby believed the victim was dead,counsel argued,she could not be guilty of murder.at the bench trial,the medical examiner testified that bobbie was still alive when the bag and bindings were secured.she died as a result of strangulation,with blunt force trauma to the head as a major contributing factor.cosby testified and,contrary to her earlier statement,claimed that kmuel placed the bag over bobbie head.the judge found cosby to be incredible and found her guilty on both counts.
after her direct appeal and state collateral proceedings,cosby filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court pursuant to.in her petition,she asserted her actual innocence and claimed ineffective assistance of counsel,as well as violations of her right to remain silent,her right to counsel,and her right to due process.the district court denied the petition,but granted a certificate of appealability.this appeal followed.
at the outset,we note that the district court only certified one issue for appeal whether cosby counsel was ineffective for failing to seek suppression of her statement because it was taken in violation of her right to counsel and her right to remain silent.before this court,cosby briefed claims regarding her right to counsel and her right to remain silent as independent issues.if a petitioner includ es issues in its briefs that were not specified in the certificate,we construe this as a request to amend a certificate to include additional issues.ouska,cir citations omitted.as discussed below,cosby fails to make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right regarding her right to counsel or her right to remain silent.c.we therefore decline to amend the certificate and address these claims only in the context of her counsel alleged ineffectiveness.

cosby argues that her trial counsel was ineffective and that the state court determination to the contrary was an unreasonable application of strickland washington,d.to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel under the familiar standard of strickland,cosby must show that her counsel performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced her defense.martin grosshans,cir citing strickland,at.as noted,cosby claims that the statement was inadmissible and her counsel failure to suppress it constituted ineffective assistance.to address this claim,the appellate court of illinois began by examining whether there was a reasonable probability that the motion to suppress would have been granted.see butler,cir if there was no underlying constitutional violation,a motion to suppress would have been futile and counsel could not be viewed as ineffective for failing to present such a motion.citation omitted.
in considering the potential for suppression based on an alleged violation of the right to remain silent,the illinois court relied on michigan mosley,d.under mosley,if a suspect invokes the right to remain silent,the authorities must scrupulously honor the suspect right to cut off questioning,but may
