opinion of the court 
robert jenkins,a pennsylvania prisoner at state correctional institution laurel highlands,seeks federal habeas relief pursuant to,as amended by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa.the district court ordered the dismissal of jenkins habeas petition as untimely under d.for the reasons stated below,we hold that jenkins is eligible for statutory tolling of aedpa limitation period.accordingly,we will reverse the district court order.
the resolution of this appeal turns on its detailed procedural history.jenkins was convicted by a jury of several offenses for which he was sentenced by the york county common pleas court to a term of incarceration.he timely filed a notice of appeal,but the pennsylvania superior court affirmed his conviction.commonwealth jenkins.he also timely filed a petition for allowance of appeal,which the pennsylvania supreme court denied on september.commonwealth jenkins.he did not petition for certiorari to the united states supreme court.
on october,jenkins timely filed a petition pursuant to pennsylvania post conviction relief act pcra.et,which the common pleas court denied he timely filed a notice of appeal,but his attorney moved to withdraw pursuant to commonwealth turner,and commonwealth finley,en banc.the superior court granted his attorney motion to withdraw and affirmed the common pleas court denial of his pcra petition on november.commonwealth jenkins.
on december,jenkins filed a pro se pleading with the pennsylvania supreme court entitled,motion to file petition for allowance of appeal nunc pro tunc,and for the appointment of counsel.in his pleading,he acknowledged that the deadline to file a petition for allowance of appeal was december.he also admitted that the superior court had allowed his attorney to withdraw.finally,he claimed i do not have the legal understanding to adequately file my own petition for allowance of appeal,and t he person helping me with this filing is expecting to be transferred,and there is nobody else i can trust.a pp.at.
the pennsylvania supreme court notified the superior court that jenkins had filed a petition for allowance of appeal.however,on december,the supreme court issued jenkins a defective filing notice,which stated that his pleading failed to comply with certain pennsylvania rules of appellate procedure unrelated to timing.jenkins promptly perfected his pleading on december.nonetheless,on april,the supreme court denied his pleading in an unpublished per curiam order without opinion.commonwealth jenkins,mm.lexis.a pr.
on may,jenkins filed a pro se habeas petition pursuant to the district court,sua sponte,raised the issue of timeliness,ordered briefing,and ultimately dismissed his habeas petition as untimely and denied a certificate of appealability jenkins superintendent of laurel highlands,cv,dist.lexis.this timely appeal followed.determining that reasonable jurists could disagree with the district court dismissal of jenkins habeas petition as untimely,we granted a certificate of appealability.
the district court had jurisdiction over jenkins habeas petition pursuant to and.we have jurisdiction over jenkins appeal pursuant to and.we exercise plenary review over the district court refusal to toll aedpa limitation period.merritt blaine,cir.
aedpa imposes a limitation period for a state prisoner to file a federal habeas petition.d.as applicable here,aedpa limitation period runs from the date on which the judgment became final by the expiration of the time for seeking direct review.d a.also as applicable here,the expiration of the time for seeking direct review is the deadline for petitioning for certiorari to the united states supreme court.gonzalez thaler,d.
on direct review,the pennsylvania supreme court denied jenkins petition for allowance of appeal on september.jenkins.because jenkins had ninety days to petition for certiorari to the united states supreme court,his conviction became final on december.jenkins did not file his habeas petition until well over a year later on may,thus,it is untimely unless aedpa limitation period was tolled.
aedpa limitation period does not set forth an inflexible rule requiring dismissal whenever its clock has run.holland florida,d quoting day mcdonough,d.instead,the limitation period is subject to both statutory and equitable tolling.merritt,at citing jones morton,cir.we conclude that jenkins is entitled to statutory tolling and,although unnecessary to the disposition of this appeal,we note that he makes a strong showing for equitable tolling.
we first analyze whether jenkins should benefit from statutory tolling.a prisoner properly filed application for state collateral review statutorily tolls aedpa limitation period during the time it is pending.d.here,the following facts are undisputed jenkins october,pcra petition was properly filed his prca petition was pending from october,the date he filed it,to december,the expiration date for him to file a petition for allowance of appeal and his pleading was pending from december,the date he filed it,to april,the date the pennsylvania supreme court denied it thus,the sole issue we must resolve is whether jenkins december,pleading was filed properly and thereby statutorily tolled aedpa limitation period during its pendency.
the answer to this question will determine whether jenkins habeas petition was timely.between the date his conviction became final,december,and the date he filed his pcra petition,october,days of aedpa day limitation period ran.additionally,between the date the pennsylvania supreme court denied his pleading,april,and the date he filed his habeas petition,may,more days ran.as a result,if his pleading was properly filed,then only those days would have run,and his habeas petition would be timely by days.however,if his pleading was not properly filed,then the additional days between the expiration date for him to file a petition for allowance of appeal,december,and the date the pennsylvania supreme court denied his pleading,april,would be added to the days already accrued.in this scenario,days would have run,and his habeas petition would be untimely by days.
a prisoner application for state collateral review is properly filed when its delivery and acceptance are in compliance with the applicable laws and rules governing filings,artuz bennett,d emphasis omitted,including time limits,no matter their form,pace diguglielmo,d.thus,if a state court determines that an application is untimely,that is the end of the matter for purposes of statutory tolling of aedpas limitation period,id.at quoting carey saffold,d,regardless of whether it also addressed the merits of the claim,or whether its timeliness ruling was entangled with the merits,carey,at.but if a state court fails to rule clearly on the timeliness of an application,a federal court must determine what the state courts would have held in respect to timeliness.evans chavis,d.
at oral argument,jenkins asserted that the pennsylvania supreme court had not held that his pleading was untimely or otherwise not properly filed.the commonwealth,in turn,conceded that the supreme court may have denied jenkins pleading on the merits.we agree that the supreme court order provides no indication about whether it denied jenkins pleading as untimely,as otherwise not properly filed,or on the merits.see jenkins.lexis,at t he motion to file petition for allowance of appeal nunc pro tunc and for the appointment of counsel is denied.formatting omitted.thus,we must look to state law governing when a petition for collateral relief is properly filed.douglas horn,quoting fahy horn,cir.
the commonwealth acknowledges that jenkins filed his pleading before the deadline to file a petition for allowance of appeal.pennsylvania rule of appellate procedure a provides that a petition for allowance of appeal shall be filed with the prothonotary of the supreme court within days after the entry of the order of the superior court sought to be reviewed.jenkins filed his pleading on december,only days after the superior court entered its order on november.thus,the nunc pro tunc title of his pleading is a misnomer in reality,jenkins filed a motion to extend the time to file a petition for allowance of appeal 
the commonwealth argues,however,that jenkins pleading was not properly filed because it was merely a procedural motion to enlarge the time for filing a petition rather than an actual substantive petition.the commonwealth bases its argument exclusively on pennsylvania rule of appellate procedure b,which provides that a court may not enlarge the time for filing a petition for allowance of appeal.the district court agreed with the commonwealth and,consequently,held that jenkins pleading was not properly filed and that aedpa limitation period was not statutorily tolled during its pendency.
although the t ime limitations on the taking of appeals are strictly construed and can not be extended as a matter of grace,commonwealth valentine,quoting commonwealth perez,rule b is not unyielding.first,it is not intended to affect the power of a court to grant relief in the case of fraud or breakdown in the processes of a court,commonwealth braykovich,quoting.note,which may occur when a court officer depart s from the obligations specified in the pennsylvania rules of criminal procedure,commonwealth patterson,citing,inter alia,braykovich,at.further,it does not prohibit an appeal nunc pro tunc when the appellant notice of appeal was filed late as a result of circumstances,either as they relate to the appellant or the appellant counsel the appellant filed the notice of appeal shortly after the expiration date and the appellee was not prejudiced by the delay.criss wise,citing bass commonwealth.
significantly,the pennsylvania supreme court frequently grants without mention of rule b motions to extend the time to file petitions for allowance of appeal which it sometimes characterizes as petitions for leave to file petitions for allowance of appeal nunc pro tunc we have repeatedly identified a state court practice of accepting a pleading as an important indication that the pleading is properly filed.see,kindler horn,cir,vacated on other grounds by beard kindler,d holding motion for reargument was properly filed in part because capital defendants in pennsylvania routinely seek reargument when their claims for relief are denied,and the pennsylvania supreme court has granted such motions on more than one occasion citations omitted nara frank,cir,overruled in part by carey,d holding motion to withdraw guilty plea nunc pro tunc was properly filed in part because it is not uncommon for pennsylvania courts to accept such motions citation omitted lovasz vaughn,cir holding second and subsequent pcra petitions were properly filed even though the pennsylvania supreme court has announced strict rules regarding the granting of such petitions in part because courts occasionally grant relief in such proceedings citations omitted.for the same reason,we find that the supreme court frequent granting of motions to extend the time to file petitions for allowance of appeal undermines the commonwealth argument that rule b renders jenkins pleading not properly filed 
in sum,we are presented with a situation in which the pennsylvania supreme court did not hold that jenkins pleading was untimely or otherwise not properly filed the supreme court may have denied jenkins pleading on the merits jenkins pleading was timely filed and the supreme court has a common practice of granting motions to extend the time to file petitions for allowance of appeal notwithstanding rule b.in these circumstances,we conclude that jenkins pleading was properly filed.therefore,we hold that jenkins pleading did statutorily toll aedpa limitation period and that his habeas petition was timely.
although we base our decision that jenkins habeas petition was timely on statutory tolling,we also note that this appeal presents a compelling case for the application of equitable tolling because aedpa limitation period is not jurisdictional,holland.at quoting day,at,it is subject to equitable tolling,id.citing,inter alia,miller state dep t of,cir.we extend the remedy of equitable tolling only sparingly,urcinoli cathel,cir quoting irwin dep t of veterans affairs,d,when principles of equity would make the rigid application of a limitation period unfair,munchinski wilson,cir quoting miller,at.
a prisoner is entitled to equitable tolling only if he shows that he has been pursuing his rights diligently,and that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.holland.at quoting pace,at.here,the commonwealth does not suggest that jenkins has not been pursuing his rights diligently.such a contention would be untenable.jenkins timely filed his notice of direct appeal petition for allowance of direct appeal pcra petition pcra notice of appeal and pleading.jenkins also perfected his pleading within thirteen days of the pennsylvania supreme court issuance of its defective filing notice and he filed his habeas petition within ten days of its denial of his pleading in short,jenkins has not been sleeping on his rights.munchinski,at quoting mathis thaler,cir 
the commonwealth argues,however,that jenkins has not shown that he has in some extraordinary way been prevented from asserting his rights.brinson vaughn,cir quoting brown shannon,cir.one potentially extraordinary circumstance is where a prisoner is effectively abandoned by his attorney.holland.at quoting nara,at another potentially extraordinary situation is where a court has misled a party regarding the steps that the party needs to take to preserve a claim.munchinski,at quoting brinson,at.jenkins proposes that both of these extraordinary circumstances thwarted the timely filing of his habeas petition.
jenkins first claims that his attorney abandoned him.however,jenkins attorney withdrew pursuant to the judicially sanctioned process,which,among other requirements,mandates that an attorney serve a client with the application to withdraw,the letter,and a statement advising the petitioner that,in the event that the court grants the application of counsel to withdraw,he has the right to proceed pro se or with the assistance of privately retained counsel.commonwealth widgins,quoting commonwealth friend,overruled in part by commonwealth pitts.because his attorney engaged in significant communication pursuant to the process,jenkins abandonment argument is meritless.contrast holland.at reversing and remanding for further proceedings in part to determine whether attorney repeated and prolonged failure to communicate with client was extraordinary circumstance warranting equitable tolling.
jenkins next contends that the pennsylvania supreme court defective filing notice misled him into believing that his pleading was holding a place for him on its allocatur docket.we resolved a similar claim in munchinski.there,the common pleas court erroneously dismissed the prisoner second pcra petition for lack of jurisdiction because his first habeas appeal was pending before us.id.at.the common pleas court thereby implicitly suggested that the prisoner could later reassert his claims in a third pcra petition.id.at.the prisoner relied on this advice,but on the appeal of his third pcra petition,the superior court concluded that the allegations that he had previously raised had become untimely,id.at.under these facts,we held that the common pleas court implicit suggestion was sufficiently misleading as to constitute an extraordinary circumstance because it later operate d to prevent the prisoner from pursuing his rights.id.at quoting urcinoli,at.
if jenkins were not already entitled to statutory tolling of aedpa limitation period,the same analysis would appear to apply here.the pennsylvania supreme court defective filing notice informed jenkins that his pleading failed to comply with certain pennsylvania rules of appellate procedure.importantly,the notice did not indicate that jenkins pleading was untimely.in other words,by explicitly directing jenkins to cure certain filing defects,the notice implied that his pleading otherwise satisfied the rules not referenced therein,including rule b.relying on the notice,jenkins promptly perfected his pleading and reasonably waited for the supreme court decisi
