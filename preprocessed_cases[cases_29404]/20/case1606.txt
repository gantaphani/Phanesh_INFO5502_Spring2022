the district court,pursuant to,conditionally granted the petition for a writ of habeas corpus of maurice whiting petitioner or defendant,an inmate of the state prison of southern michigan,the condition being that the state grant petitioner a new appeal in the michigan court of appeals and,if not done within the time specified by the district court,petitioner could apply for a writ ordering sherry burt,the warden of the prison respondent to release him.respondent appealed,and the district court denied respondent motion for a stay pending the appeal.another panel of this court granted respondent motion for a stay pending the appeal and the parties request for oral argument.for the reasons stated herein,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings.
the issues presented by this appeal require a detailed history of the proceedings in the michigan state courts and the subsequent proceeding in the federal district court.
i.the michigan state courts 
a.the michigan trial court 
during his trial in the detroit recorder court on charges of felony murder and armed robbery,defendant was represented by a retained attorney,lawrence schultz.upon being convicted of both charges in,defendant was sentenced to concurrent terms of life imprisonment.he appealed to the michigan court of appeals in january.
b.the direct appeal to the michigan court of appeals 
in his direct appeal,defendant was again represented by attorney lawrence schultz.schultz asserted just two claims on defendant behalf the trial court erred in its determination concerning the voluntariness and admissibility of defendant statement to the police and defendant convictions and sentences for both felony murder and armed robbery violated the prohibitions against double jeopardy.the court of appeals affirmed the trial court decision concerning the admissibility of defendant statement to the police and,accordingly,affirmed his conviction of felony murder.the court of appeals,however,agreed that the convictions of both felony murder and the underlying felony of armed robbery violated the federal and state prohibitions against double jeopardy.the court of appeals therefore vacated the conviction and sentence for the underlying felony of armed robbery.
c.the delayed appeal to the michigan supreme court 
in june,defendant filed a delayed application for leave to appeal to the michigan supreme court.the leave to appeal was denied.
d.the proceedings in the michigan courts 
the michigan rules of court 
subchapter of chapter,criminal procedure,michigan rules of court mcr,entitled post appeal relief,establishes the procedure for proceedings challenging criminal convictions the request for relief from judgment must set forth,in addition to other information,the grounds for the relief requested and,if the grounds for relief were not raised before,the reasons they were not raised.mcr c and.the motion must be presented to the judge to whom the case was assigned at the time of the defendant conviction.mcr a.appeals are by application to the court of appeals.mcr a.
the critical rule governing the granting of relief is mcr.it provides,in pertinent part 
d entitlement to relief.the defendant has the burden of establishing entitlement to the relief requested.the court may not grant relief to the defendant if the motion 
alleges grounds for relief,other than jurisdictional defects,which could have been raised on appeal from the conviction and sentence or in a prior motion under this subchapter unless the defendant demonstrates 
a good cause for failure to raise such grounds on appeal or in the prior motion,and 
b actual prejudice from the alleged irregularities that support the claim for relief.as used in this subrule,actual prejudice means that,
i in a conviction following a trial,but for the alleged error,the defendant would have had a reasonably likely chance of acquittal 
iii in any case,the irregularity was so offensive to the maintenance of a sound judicial process that the conviction should not be allowed to stand regardless of the outcome of the case 
the michigan trial court 
defendant commenced his collateral proceedings on march,when he filed his motion for relief from judgment with the trial court.this time,defendant was represented by a new attorney,gerald lorence.the following claims were made in support of the motion 
i.the trial court committed reversible error in failing to give a cautionary instruction sua sponte on the accomplice testimony of witness james wright.
ii.prosecutor engaged in prosecutorial misconduct by vouching for the credibility of his own witness when he disclosed that one of the alleged received a plea agreement with the understanding that he would offer truthful testimony at defendant trial.
iii.the prosecutor denied the defendant a fair trial in cross examining the defendant when he made reference to the fact that the defendant had been in jail along with others on a prior occasion.
iv.defendant was denied effective assistance of counsel by virtue of his attorney failure to request an accomplice instruction with respect to the testimony of witness james wright who testified against the defendant and had been given a plea agreement in exchange for his testimony,and by virtue of this attorney failure to investigate and perfect a possible intoxication defense.
v.the trial court gave incomplete supplemental instructions to the jury by reinstructing them on the principal offenses without mentioning the lesser included offenses or the concept of aiding and abetting.
in defendant motion for relief from judgment,he stated 
under mcr d a,there is good cause for not having raised these issues in a previous appeal.specifically,defendant was denied effective assistance of appellate counsel who failed to raise these issues.ineffective assistance of counsel constitutes good cause for a delayed appeal.see brief in support.it is also significant to note that failure to object to the reinstructions,and the failure to request the undisputed accomplice instructions were due to ineffective assistance of counsel.since the same attorney represented the defendant at the appellate levels,it is not surprising that the issues concerning ineffective assistance of counsel were not raised at that time.
in his brief in support of this motion,defendant set forth his arguments with respect to each of the alleged grounds for relief.with reference to the alleged denial of the effective assistance of trial counsel,defendant pointed out that michigan courts had adopted the requirement for proving ineffective assistance of counsel as set forth in strickland washington,d.see people pickens,people stammer,people dalessandro.in strickland,the court held that in order to establish ineffective assistance of counsel,a defendant must prove that counsel performance was deficient and such performance prejudiced the defense.see at.
on january,the trial court denied defendant motion for relief from judgment.the court said 
the defendant has the burden of proof of establishing entitlement to the relief requested.cause and prejudice must also be shown as to why the issues presented were not raised on one of the defendant prior appeals.most importantly,it must be shown in a conviction following a trial,but for the alleged error the defendant would have had a reasonably likely chance of acquittal.this burden has not been met.mcr.
likewise it has not been shown that it would be manifestly unjust to allow the conviction to stand,nor has it been shown that any irregularity was so offensive to the maintenance of a sound judicial process that the conviction should not be allowed to stand.mcr.
the court nevertheless proceeded to consider the merits of the five allegations of error.it found no error in failing to sua sponte give an accomplice testimony instruction,no prosecutorial misconduct in allegedly vouching for the credibility of a state witness,no error in the instructions given to the jury,and no error in failing to object to a comment about the defendant being in custody,a fact already known to the jury.with regard to the remaining allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel,the court stated 
the defendant has met neither prong of the test set forth in the landmark cases of strickland washington,d,people pickens.failure to request an accomplice instruction does amount to ineffective assistance of counsel nor does picking one strategy over another.it has long been established that reviewing courts will not find ineffective assistance in differences over tactics on what defenses and issues to raise,people stevenson.
the michigan court of appeals 
in january of,defendant filed in the michigan court of appeals a delayed application for leave to appeal the denial of his motion for relief from judgment.on february,the court of appeals entered the following order 
the court orders that the delayed application for leave to appeal is denied for failure to establish entitlement to relief under mcr.
ja at.defendant then sought leave to appeal to the michigan supreme court.
the michigan supreme court 
on september,the michigan supreme court entered the following order 
on order of the court,the delayed application for leave to appeal from the february,decision of the court of appeals is considered,and it is denied,because the defendant has failed to meet the burden of establishing entitlement to relief under mcr d.
ii.the united states district court 
a.the petition for a writ of habeas corpus 
on november,petitioner filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus,pursuant to.on april,petitioner,now represented by another attorney,james lawrence,filed an amended petition listing the following grounds for relief 
issue.petitioner statement to police was involuntary and inadmissible.
issue.petitioner was denied a fair trial by testimony and argument that a prosecution witness had an agreement with the prosecutor to testify truthfully.
issue.petitioner was denied the effective assistance of counsel by failure to investigate,prepare and advance a diminished responsibility defense,and by failure to request a cautionary instruction regarding testimony by an alleged accomplice.
issue.petitioner was denied a fair trial where the trial judge reinstructed the jury with incomplete instructions that prejudiced the defense.
issue.petitioner was prejudiced by ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.
the petition noted that issue admissibility of petitioner statement to the been determined adversely to petitioner on direct appeal,and that issue alleged ineffectiveness of appellate based on a failure to raise issues,and,as well as two issues of state law,on direct appeal petitioner argued that the outcome of the appeal would have been different had appellate counsel raised these issues.
the brief in support of the petition contained extensive arguments and legal citations with respect to each of the five listed issues.of particular significance in this appeal is issue,the alleged ineffectiveness of appellate counsel.while petitioner admits that appellate counsel did raise good issues,ja at,including the issue of the involuntary statement as set forth in issue in the habeas petition,he argues that counsel failure to raise the other issues on direct appeal provides the basis for the claim of alleged ineffectiveness of appellate counsel.with respect to these other issues,petitioner noted,b ecause raised for the first time in the motion for relief from judgment,they were doomed to failure under the cause and prejudice rules of mcr d,unless ineffective assistance of appellate counsel were to be found.ja at.
petitioner argued that the requirement of strickland had been met,counsel failure to raise the other issues in the state court of appeals constituted deficient performance,and there was a reasonable probability that,if appellate counsel had raised these issues,the outcome of the appeal would have been different.petitioner also pointed out that because the attorney who represented him on direct appeal,lawrence schultz,had also represented him at trial,schultz would not be expected to raise claims based on his own ineffectiveness.petitioner contended that when the same attorney represents a defendant at trial and on direct appeal,there is an inherent conflict of interest and,under the standard set forth in cuyler sullivan,d,prejudice is presumed.
b.the respondent answer in opposition to the petition 
respondent argued the merits of the first issue,the admissibility of petitioner statement to the police,which had been decided adversely to petitioner on direct appeal.respondent claimed that issues,and were procedurally defaulted because they were not raised on direct appeal,and the michigan state courts had denied petitioner relief under mcr d.recognizing that petitioner was attempting to apply the cause and prejudice exception to the claims on the basis of the alleged ineffectiveness of appellate counsel issue,respondent argued that petitioner had failed to satisfy the first prong of strickland,that the attorney performance was deficient.accordingly,respondent contended,the issues were not subject to review by the federal courts.respondent,alternatively,argued that none of the allegedly defaulted claims was meritorious.
c.the standard of review by the district court 
a federal court review of a state court decision under is governed by the antiterrorism effective death penalty act aedpa,effective april,the provisions of that act relevant to the issues in this case are as follows 
b an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted unless it appears that 
a the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the state or 
b i there is an absence of available state corrective process or 
ii circumstances exist that render such process ineffective to protect the rights of the applicant.
an application for a writ of habeas corpus may be denied on the merits,notwithstanding the failure of the applicant to exhaust the remedies available in the courts of the state.
a state shall not be deemed to have waived the exhaustion requirement or be estopped from reliance upon the requirement unless the state,through counsel,expressly waives the requirement.
c an applicant shall not be deemed to have exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the state,within the meaning of this section,if he has the right under the law of the state to raise,by any available procedure,the question presented.
d an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.the opinion and order of the district court 
on june,the district court rendered its opinion and order conditionally granting the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.the court,after recognizing the appropriate standard of review under the aedpa,proceeded directly to petitioner fifth claim,the alleged ineffectiveness of appellate counsel and the alleged conflict of interest arising from the fact that petitioner was represented on direct appeal by the same attorney who represented him at trial.
the court first,however,sua sponte questioned whether the claimed conflict of interest issue had been properly presented to the michigan courts and,if not,whether respondent had waived a possible procedural default,the failure to exhaust state remedies,by failing to assert the procedural default as an affirmative defense in respondent answer.the district court reasoning on these important preliminary questions was as follows 
although not specifically addressed by respondent in her answer,the court briefly discusses whether petitioner conflict of interest was properly exhausted with the michigan courts.although respondent failed to raise the exhaustion issue in her answer,this defense is not waived unless the state,through counsel,expressly waives the exhaustion requirement.benoit bock,d,b.moreover,considerations of comity and federalism require this court to raise the exhaustion issue sua sponte.id.
in the present case,petitioner counsel did not raise a separate ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim in his motion for relief from judgment.however,counsel argued ineffective assistance of appellate counsel to establish cause,as required by d,to excuse petitioner failure to raise his claims in his appeal of right.as part of this argument,counsel made one reference to the conflict of interest issue 
since the same attorney represented defendant at the appellate levels,it is not surprising that the issues concerning ineffective assistance of counsel were not raised at that time.
this reference is sufficient to fairly present this claim to the michigan courts.
as to any possible procedural default for failure to raise this issue in the first appeal this court will not enforce any possible procedural default of the conflict of interest claim,because respondent failed to raise the defense of procedural default in her answer with respect to this specific claim.benoit bock,d at.as the judge in benoit indicated,with the exception of the exhaustion issue,the sixth circuit strongly discourages the sua sponte invocation of procedural affirmative defenses that were not raised by the respondent.id.citing to scott collins,cir.thus,although the issue of exhaustion must be expressly waived by respondent,the same is not true for the affirmative defense of procedural default.id.therefore,respondent failure to raise the procedural default defense in this case can be considered an implicit waiver of that issue.benoit,d at.
the district court,having concluded that petitioner fifth claim,with its conflict of interest component,was properly before it,proceeded to address the merits of that claim.the court discussion focused basically on attorney schultz alleged conflict of interest.the district court held 
defense attorneys owe their clients a duty of loyalty,including the duty to avoid conflicts of interest.strickland washington,d citing to cuyler sullivan,d.however,a claim of a conflict of interest,by itself,is insufficient to justify reversal of a conviction.reedus stegall,d,citing to united states hall,cir additional citations omitted.instead,a habeas petitioner must demonstrate that counsel actively represented conflicting interests and that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer performance.reedus,d at citing strickland,at.see also mickens taylor,d actual conflict of interest,for sixth amendment purposes,is a conflict of interest that adversely affects counsel performance.however,a petitioner who can show that his counsel operated under a conflict of interest which affected his representation need not establish prejudice.cuyler sullivan,at.tyler united states,d.instead,prejudice is presumed,in connection with an ineffective assistance of counsel claim,where a defendant demonstrates actual conflicts of interest that compromise his or her attorney ability to advocate his or her client interests.olden united states,cir citing to strickland,at.the right to counsel extends to defendants who seek appellate review of their convictions.see pisa streeter.
the district court believed that appellate counsel conflict of interest prevented him from raising the ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims that are raised in petitioner third claim,ja,and that i n addition,petitioner has shown that this conflict of interest adversely affected appellate counsel performance in that appellate counsel failed to raise several colorable ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims.ja.it is clear that the district court based the finding of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel on a finding of a conflict of interest,and the application of the standard established in sullivan,d,in which prejudice need not be established when petitioner can show that his counsel operated under a conflict of interest which adversely affected his representation.
having found that petitioner was deprived of the effective assistance of appellate counsel as alleged in the fifth claim,the district court did not consider the merits of any of the other claims,including petitioner first claim concerning the admissibility of the allegedly involuntary statement to police,a claim which attorney schultz raised on direct appeal.instead,the court ordered that a writ would be granted if petitioner is not permitted to reinstate his appeal of right with the assistance of counsel in the michigan court of appeals within one hundred and twenty days from the date of this opinion and order.ja at.
iii.the issues on appeal 
there are five issues involved in this appeal 
whether the exhaustion requirement was satisfied by a fair presentment of petitioner conflict of interest issue to the state courts.
if the issue was not fairly presented to the state courts,whether petitioner can return to the state courts and,if not,has there been a procedural default.
if there has been a procedural default,whether this defense was waived by respondent in the district court.
if the defense of procedural default was waived by respondent in the district court,whether respondent can now raise that defense in the court of appeals.
if the court of appeals considers the merits of the claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel based on the alleged conflict of interest,did the district court properly apply the sullivan standard to that claim 
for the reasons discussed herein,we find that petitioner ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim based on the alleged conflict of interest was fairly presented to the state courts.the exhaustion requirement is therefore satisfied,and,accordingly,it is not necessary to consider the procedural default and waiver issues issues,and.we,therefore,consider on its merits the claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel based on an alleged conflict of interest.because we find that the district court improperly applied the sullivan standard to this claim,we vacate the decision of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings.
iv.discussion 
standard of review 
as noted earlier,this case is governed by the standard of review set forth in the aedpa,and this court reviews de novo the district court legal conclusions.we also review de novo the district court determination concerning petitioner ineffective assistance of counsel claim,a mixed question of law and fact.see hicks straub,cir citing lott coyle,cir,cert.denied,d.
ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim based on alleged conflict of interest 
the exhaustion requirement was satisfied by a fair presentment of the conflict of interest claim to the state courts 
we can not reach the merits of petitioner ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim based on an alleged conflict of interest without first resolving the question of whether this constitutional claim was exhausted by fairly presenting it to the michigan courts.
long before the doctrine was codified in b,it was firmly established that before a federal court may grant habeas relief to a state prisoner,the prisoner had to first exhaust his remedies in state court.ex parte royall.because state courts,like federal courts,are required to enforce federal law,including rights asserted under the constitution,comity requires that the state courts should have the first opportunity to review the prisoner federal claim and provide any necessary relief.see boerckel,d citing rose lundy,d darr burford.
as a necessary component of the exhaustion of state remedies doctrine,a petitioner claim must be fairly presented to the state courts before seeking relief in the federal courts.baldwin reese,d picard connor,d.it is sufficient if the substance of a federal habeas corpus claim be presented to the state courts,and there are instances in which the ultimate question for disposition will be the same despite variations in the legal theory or factual allegations urged in its support.picard,at.in our circuit,in making a determination of whether the petitioner has properly asserted both the factual and legal basis for his claim,there are four actions a petitioner can take which are significant to the determination of whether a claim has been fairly presented 
reliance upon federal cases employing constitutional analysis reliance upon state cases employing federal constitutional analysis phrasing the claim in terms of constitutional law or in terms sufficiently particular to allege a denial of a specific constitutional right or alleging facts well within the mainstream of constitutional law.
mcmeans brigano,cir citing franklin rose,cir,cert.denied,d.
in the present case,petitioner basic claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel was clearly presented to the michigan courts in his motion for relief from judgment.although ineffective assistance of appellate counsel was not included as a separate ground for relief as it was later in the federal habeas petition,it was specifically argued at length in an effort to meet the cause requirement of mcr d a.as noted earlier,defendant had argued 
under mcr d a,there is good cause for not having raised these issues in a previous appeal.specifically,defendant was denied effective assistance of appellate counsel who failed to raise these issues.ineffective assistance of counsel constitutes good cause for a delayed appeal.see brief in support.it is also significant to note that failure to object to the reinstructions,and the failure to request the undisputed accomplice instructions were due to ineffective assistance of counsel.since the same attorney represented the defendant at the appellate levels,it is not surprising that the issues concerning ineffective assistance of counsel were not raised at that time.
ja at.defendant brief in support of his motion for relief from judgment relied heavily on his argument that,under both state and federal law,he was entitled to the effective assistance of appellate counsel.
under both.const,and.vi,xiv,a criminal defendant is entitled to the effective assistance of counsel on appeal.evitts v lucey,d people wolfe.under the standards set forth in both strickland washington,supra,and people garcia,appellate counsel failure to raise issues which would likely result in a reversal constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.
ja at.the brief cited both state and federal cases for the principle that ineffective assistance of appellate counsel constitutes cause for a failure to include substantive claims of error in an appeal as of right.
with respect to satisfying the prejudice requirement of mcr d a,defendant brief stated 
in addition,the defendant has also shown actual prejudice in this case.the failure of the trial court to give a cautionary instruction sua sponte with respect to the accomplice testimony clearly requires reversal of defendant conviction alone.however,this error,combined with the other errors listed in this brief clearly create a combination of trial court error requiring reversal.in combination,these errors are so offensive to the maintenance of a sound judicial process,that the conviction should not be allowed to stand.insofar as defendant was sentenced to a term of mandatory life without the possibility of parole,the prejudice to his case was clearly substantial.
the michigan trial court,the first court to consider the arguments raised in the motion for relief from judgment,held that defendant had failed to meet the burden of proof placed on him by mcr.the trial court nevertheless proceeded to discuss the merits of defendant listed claims.with respect to the fourth claim,the alleged ineffective assistance of trial counsel,the court said 
the defendant has met neither prong of the test set forth in the landmark cases of strickland washington,d,people pickens.failure to request an accomplice instruction does amount to ineffective assistance of counsel nor does picking one strategy over another.it has long been established that reviewing courts will not find ineffective assistance in differences over tactics on what defenses and issues to raise.people stevenson.
ja at.both the michigan court of appeals and the michigan supreme court in orders denied defendant appeals,also for failure to meet the burden of establishing entitlement to relief under mcr d.
it is apparent from this record that,in his motion for relief from judgment,defendant argued at length that ineffective assistance of appellate counsel met the cause requirement of mcr d a and argued briefly that a combination of the alleged listed errors met the prejudice requirement of mcr d a.defendant,however,did not specifically argue at any length the fact that appellate counsel had also been trial counsel,thus creating a conflict of interest which,in addition to being a cause for failing to include claims in the direct appeal,resulted in prejudice to defendant.as the district court correctly noted,the only reference to a conflict of interest was the following sentence in defendant motion for relief from judgment 
since the same attorney represented the defendant at the appellate levels,it is not surprising that the issues concerning ineffective assistance of counsel were not raised at that time.
ja at.according to the district court,this reference is sufficient to fairly present this claim to the michigan courts.ja at.
respondent disagrees.respondent urges us to treat the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel based on the alleged conflict of interest as a separate claim,and find that it was not fairly presented to the michigan courts.however,the constitutional claim denial of defendant sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of appellate undeniably presented to the michigan courts and decided against defendant by the denial of his motion for relief from judgment the federal law governing ineffective assistance of appellate counsel is not only firmly established,but it has been applied by the michigan courts as cause to excuse a procedural default under mcr d a.in pickens,the michigan supreme court adopted the ineffective assistance of counsel standard articulated by strickland.see also people reed.the michigan supreme court has also dealt with a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on an alleged conflict of interest by an attorney.in people smith,the michigan supreme court held that in order to demonstrate that a conflict of interest has violated a defendant sixth amendment rights,the defendant must establish that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer performance.smith,at,at citing sullivan,d.
although the question of the alleged conflict of interest could certainly have been made in a more specific and more emphatic manner,the michigan courts,demonstrably very knowledgeable of federal law regarding ineffective assistance of counsel and claimed conflicts of interest,were made aware of the fact that defendant was represented by the same attorney at trial and on appeal and,to the extent that this presented a conflict of interest,it was brought to the attention of the michigan courts.we therefore find that the claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel,with an alleged conflict of interest component,was fairly presented to the michigan courts in the collateral relief proceedings.because petitioner exhausted his state remedies with respect to this claim,we may consider it on the merits.any discussion of the procedural default and waiver issues is therefore unnecessary and would be,at best,pure dictum.
the district court erred in applying the sullivan standard 
as noted earlier in this opinion,the district court proceeded directly to the petitioner fifth claim,the alleged ineffectiveness of appellate counsel and the claimed conflict of interest arising from the fact that petitioner was represented on direct appeal by the same attorney who represented him at trial.after finding that this claim had been fairly presented to the michigan courts and that,if not,a procedural default defense had been waived by the state,the district court found that,because of the alleged conflict of interest,petitioner had been deprived of his sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of appellate counsel.recognizing that a claim of a conflict of interest,by itself,is insufficient to justify reversal of a conviction,and that a petitioner must demonstrate that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer performance,the district court granted the petition on the basis that,under sullivan,a petitioner who can show that his counsel operated under a conflict of interest which affected his representation need not establish prejudice.ja at.this finding is at the heart of this appeal.
a.the strickland standard 
there is no dispute,of course,that ineffective assistance of counsel claims are normally governed by the seminal case of strickland washington,d and its progeny.the two familiar components of the strickland standard were described by this court in wickline mitchell,cir as follows 
under strickland washington,d,a violation of the right to effective assistance of counsel has two components 
first,the defendant must show that counsel performance was deficient.this requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the sixth amendment.second,the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.this requires showing that counsel errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial,a trial whose result is reliable.
id.at,d.review of counsel performance is highly deferential and requires that courts indulge a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.id.at,d.to demonstrate that counsel performance was deficient,a defendant must show that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.id.at,d.to establish prejudice,he must show that there is reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.id.at,d.
wickline,at.
the right to the effective assistance of counsel includes appellate counsel as well as trial counsel,and in mapes coyle,cir,cert.denied,d,this court,with reference to the first prong of strickland,listed eleven questions as matters to be considered in determining whether an attorney on direct appeal acted in accordance with the objective standard of reasonableness 
in the present case,the district court did not apply the strickland standard and the mapes case with its suggested list of questions.instead,the court was of the opinion that because the same attorney acted as both trial counsel and appellate counsel,that attorney would not have raised the specific issue of his own ineffective assistance,and that this constituted a conflict of interest which adversely affected his performance as appellate counsel.the district court,specifically relying on sullivan,held 
defense attorneys owe their clients a duty of loyalty,including the duty to avoid conflicts of interest.strickland washington,d citing to cuyler sullivan,d.however,a claim of a conflict of interest,by itself,is insufficient to justify reversal of a conviction.reedus stegall,d,citing to united states hall,cir additional citations omitted.instead,a habeas petitioner must demonstrate that counsel actively represented conflicting interests and that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer performance.reedus,d at citing to strickland,at.see also mickens taylor,d actual conflict of interest,for sixth amendment purposes,is a conflict of interest that adversely affects counsel performance.however,a petitioner who can show that his counsel operated under a conflict of interest which affected his representation need not establish prejudice.cuyler sullivan,at.tyler united states,d.instead,prejudice is presumed,in connection with an ineffective assistance of counsel claim,where a defendant demonstrates actual conflicts of interest that compromise his or her attorney ability to advocate his or her client interests.olden united states,cir citing to strickland,at.the right to counsel extends to defendants who seek appellate review of their convictions.see pisa streeter.
b.the sullivan standard 
petitioners claiming ineffective assistance of counsel under strickland have a heavy burden of proof.see lewis alexander,cir.this burden applies regardless of whether a petitioner is claiming ineffective assistance of trial counsel or ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.see munson kapture,cir.if,however,a petitioner attorney had an actual conflict of interest,at least in cases involving multiple representation,a lesser standard has been applied.
in sullivan predecessor,holloway arkansas,d,three defendants were represented by the same attorney.the trial court refused to consider the appointment of separate counsel despite the defense lawyer argument that his clients interests were in conflict.under those circumstances,the defendant was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel,and no showing of prejudice was required to reverse the conviction.the court pointed out that a rule requiring a showing of prejudice in a joint representation case would require unlike most cases,unguided speculation.id.at.this is because in joint representation cases of conflicting interests,the evil is in what the attorney finds himself compelled to refrain from doing,not only at trial,but also as to possible pretrial plea negotiations and in the sentencing process.accordingly,it would be difficult,if not impossible,to determine the prejudicial impact on the defendant in such cases.
sullivan was also a joint representation case but,unlike holloway,there was no objection made to the trial judge concerning any conflict of interest.under these circumstances,the court held that,i n order to establish a violation of the sixth amendment,a defendant who raised no objection at trial must demonstrate that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer performance.sullivan,at.the court,citing holloway,reiterated the rule that a defendant in such a case who is able to show that a conflict of interest actually affected the adequacy of his representation need not demonstrate prejudice in order to obtain relief.
subsequently,in strickland,the court recognized that,in certain sixth amendment contexts,prejudice is presumed.examples given included actual or constructive denial of the assistance of counsel altogether and various kinds of state interference with counsel assistance.prejudice in these circumstances is so likely that inquiry into prejudice is not worth the cost.strickland,at.the court referred to its earlier discussion in sullivan and a conflict of interest claim as involving a similar,though more limited,presumption of prejudice.id.it noted that the rule in sullivan 
is not quite the per se rule of prejudice that exists for the sixth amendment claims mentioned above.prejudice is presumed only if the defendant demonstrates that counsel actively represented conflicting interests and that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer performance.
id.quoting sullivan,at.
in mickens taylor,d,the supreme court revisited sullivan in another alleged conflict of interest case,one in which the defendant attorney had previously represented the victim of defendant murder in an earlier,different proceeding.the case was presented and argued on the assumption that the sullivan a showing of defective performance but not requiring a showing of applicable not only to cases of multiple representation,but also to cases of successive representation.because the court held that the judge failure to inquire into a potential conflict of interest did not itself relieve the defendant of the burden of showing that a conflict of interest adversely affected defendant representation,the court did not decide whether,when an actual conflict of interest is shown,the sullivan prophylaxis of not requiring a showing of probable effect on the outcome of the trial applies to successive representatio
