background 
on april,alvin ramsey ramsey was shot to death as he sat in the driver seat of a car parked in a detroit neighborhood.alton higgins higgins was one of three people sitting with ramsey in that automobile at or near the time ramsey was shot.another of those three people,michael adams adams,exited the vehicle and fled on foot before shots were fired,leaving higgins,ramsey and wayne young young in the car.
not long after the shooting,young,wearing a green jacket,surrendered to the police while the police were canvassing the neighborhood.the police were looking for young because word on the street was that young was the shooter and because a witness had reported that a black male wearing a green jacket was seen running from the car after two shots were fired.although he denied shooting ramsey,young admitted that he had been in the car with ramsey,sitting next to him in the front passenger seat,when a guy sitting in the rear seat behind ramsey put a gun to ramsey neck.identifying the man in the rear seat only as,young explained that he did not know the man real name.in his own words,young continued i got out and started running.i heard one shot as i turned the corner i heard a second shot.supp.at when asked specifically where he was when he heard the shots,young said first time i had just got out the car.the second shot when i was on the side of the house.id.at.when asked if he saw the shooting,young replied i only heard the shots.id.the police took forensic samples from young hands and thereafter released him from custody.those forensic samples,the results of which were not known until after higgins was charged with murder,showed that young had gunpowder residue on both hands.
the next day,april,higgins was questioned about the shooting.in a nutshell,higgins denied shooting ramsey.according to sergeant ralph openshaw who related higgins statement at trial,higgins said that he,young,adams,and some other friends were sitting on a front porch discussing who might have some guns for sale when young suggested that ramsey then sitting in a car on the street in front of them possibly had guns for sale.higgins said that,when he and young approached ramsey,ramsey indeed stated that he would sell a caliber gun that he had at his house.according to higgins,young returned to the porch and told his friends that he was going to purchase the gun for money and possibly some fake cocaine.higgins told openshaw that young,having seen that ramsey was armed,armed himself with a caliber or.mm handgun.higgins admitted that he and young walked down the street to ramsey house,where ramsey retrieved a caliber gun,then fired a shot into the air to show young and higgins that the gun was,in fact,operable and in good condition.higgins said that the men then got into ramsey car to negotiate the price of the gun.according to higgins,young was sitting in the rear seat behind ramsey higgins was sitting in the right front passenger seat next to ramsey.higgins said that,after they completed their negotiations,young asked ramsey to drive back down the street.as ramsey started to drive,young pulled a gun from his coat and said we want everything you got.higgins told sergeant openshaw that he higgins jumped out of the car before he heard two shots and before he saw ramsey car hit a van parked on the side of the street.
later that same day,april,young was shown sergeant openshaw report of higgins statement.after seeing that report,and after hearing that he would get life in jail if he refused to say who shot ramsey,young admitted that he knew the name of the man who shot ramsey.that man,according to young,was alton higgins.young went on to explain 
when i saw alton pull a gun out of his coat and put it to ramsey neck,mike adams jumped out of the car.alton said give me the.ramsey opened his door and put the car in drive,and alton hit him on the back of his head with the gun.i jumped out of the car and heard a gunshot coming from within the car.i started running to the vacant house on coplin with mike.as i started to run i heard a second shot coming from out of the car.
two weeks later,on april,young testified at a preliminary hearing on the murder and robbery charges then lodged against higgins.higgins counsel,walter pookrum pookrum,was present at the preliminary hearing and questioned young.young again said that he was not in the vehicle at the time of the shooting,that only higgins and ramsey were in the car when he young heard two shots fired.when asked where he was when he heard the shots,young replied my sister driveway.at.at the time of the preliminary hearing,pookrum did not have copies of young prior statements,and the result of the forensics test of samples taken from young hands was still not known.indeed,the result of the forensics test was not known until august of.
higgins was charged with felony,armed robbery,and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.at trial,the medical examiner testified that ramsey died almost immediately as a result of a single gunshot through the back of his neck that exited just below the collarbone in the area of his right shoulder.when asked whether he could determine if the firing was,the medical examiner replied there was no evidence of any close range on the skin.at.a police officer later testified that gun residue was found on the hands of both ramsey and young.
over pookrum objection,young preliminary hearing testimony was read into the record at trial after young failed to appear on the day he was subpoenaed to testify.the trial court found that young was deliberately evading and was,therefore,unavailable.
on the fourth day of trial,young was located.he testified on direct that he had been threatened by telephone and in writing not to testify in the case.he did not say who had threatened him.he also testified that,while higgins was sitting in the rear of the automobile behind ramsey,ramsey handed higgins the caliber handgun,without a clip.when the prosecutor asked him what happened after higgins was given the caliber gun,young responded so after higgins got the in his hand,i pulled out the,saying give it up.at.according to young,ramsey tried to get out of the car,but higgins shot him before he could escape.young denied that he had fired any of the guns that day.
pookrum did not anticipate young appearance on the last day of trial.he therefore asked that he be given until after the lunch hour to review young two sworn statements and preliminary hearing testimony in order to prepare for his.inexplicably,pookrum had not reviewed young prior statements before young appeared in court.when the trial court agreed to give him only a brief period of time to prepare,pookrum declined to do any at all.as he explained in open court well,i not ready to this man it will be malpractice for me to proceed.at.thus,the only person who directly implicated higgins as ramsey killer was never in front of the jury.
after the jury returned guilty verdicts on all three counts,higgins was sentenced to two concurrent terms of life imprisonment for felony murder and armed robbery plus two years imprisonment for a felony firearm conviction.
while the case was on appeal,new appellate counsel filed a motion to remand so that he could file a motion in the trial court for a new trial based upon an affidavit by young in which young recanted his trial testimony.the motion to remand was granted,but young failed to appear at the hearing on higgins motion for new trial.the trial court accordingly dismissed the motion for new trial,and the case was returned to the court of appeals.
among other things,higgins argued on direct appeal that t rial counsel lack of preparation and refusal to the prosecution key witness deprived higgins of the effective assistance of counsel and a fair trial.at.in an opinion dated march,the state court of appeals affirmed higgins felony murder and felony firearm convictions but vacated his conviction and sentence for armed robbery.people higgins,wl,at.march,unpublished decision supp.at.in rejecting higgins ineffective assistance of counsel claim,the state court of appeals wrote 
finally,defendant contends that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.specifically,defendant contends he was denied a fair trial when his counsel refused to young.we disagree.to prove a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel a defendant must show that counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense so as to deny defendant a fair trial.people smith.we conclude that defendant has failed to establish that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because he is unable to show that he was prejudiced by counsel inaction.
id.on november,the michigan supreme court denied higgins application for leave to appeal the appellate decision of march.people higgins,supp.at.on february,the michigan supreme court denied higgins motion for reconsideration.people higgins,supp.at.
higgins thereafter filed a motion for relief from judgment,including among his seventeen claims for relief the following defense counsel denied defendant of sic his right to effective assistance of counsel where he failed to effectively the sole prosecution eyewitness and denied defendant of sic his right to confrontation and a fair trial.at.the trial court denied higgins motion for relief,and higgins was thereafter denied leave to appeal by the michigan court of appeals and the michigan supreme court.
on may,higgins filed a petition for habeas corpus relief in federal court.included among his many claims for relief was the following petitioner alton higgins was denied the effective assistance of trial counsel in violation of the united states constitution sixth amendment counsel failure to and abandonment of his duty to wayne young denied petitioner his constitutional rights to due process and to confront his accuser.at.in his response to higgins petition,renico did not argue that higgins claim was procedurally defaulted.indeed,given the state court record,such an argument would not succeed.
the district court found merit to only one of higgins claim that,by abandoning the duty to the key,and only,eyewitness against higgins at trial,pookrum violated his client sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel.noting that the state courts made no finding under the performance prong of the test for ineffective assistance of counsel,the district court evaluated pookrum performance de novo,finding that t he failure of counsel to participate in a critical phase of the trial,and to subject the state case to meaningful adversarial testing,on the sole ground of lack of preparation,was not a reasonable strategic decision entitled to deference.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the district court thus found that higgins trial counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.id.
the district court did not defer to the state courts finding that higgins failed to demonstrate prejudice,explaining that t he state court of appeals discussion of the prejudice prong of the strickland test was truncated and represented an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent that has been clearly established for several years.at.unlike the state courts,the district court found that prejudice clearly inured to higgins from his trial attorney substandard performance.id.having determined that higgins satisfied both prongs of the strickland test for ineffective assistance of counsel,the district court ordered renico to release higgins from custody unless the state brings him to trial again within seventy days.id.at.renico thereafter filed this timely appeal.
ii.standard of review 
the lone issue before this court is whether higgins sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel was violated when his trial attorney failed to the only eyewitness against him.we review de novo a district court determinations concerning a habeas petitioner ineffective assistance of counsel claim.moss hofbauer,cir.
because higgins habeas petition was filed after april,this court review is governed by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat.as amended,the aedpa provides,in relevant part,that a federal court may not grant a petition for writ of habeas corpus unless the state court adjudication of the claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.furthermore,state court determinations of factual issues are presumed to be correct unless the habeas petitioner rebuts this presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.
in williams taylor,d,justice described the circumstances under which a federal habeas court may grant a writ of habeas corpus 
under the contrary to clause of d,a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than the supreme court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.under the unreasonable application clause,a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.
id.at.justice part ii majority opinion.notably,an unreasonable application is an objectively unreasonable application.id.at.
where a state court does not evaluate the merits of a petitioner federal claim,the deferential standard of review mandated by the aedpa does not apply.as this court has previously explained 
the aedpa by its own terms is applicable only to habeas claims that were adjudicated on the merits in state court where the state court did not assess the merits of a claim properly raised in a habeas petition,the deference due under aedpa does not apply.instead,this court reviews questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact de novo.

iii.discussion 
in his brief before the state appellate court,higgins argued his ineffective assistance claim as follows 
the record reveals,clearly,that the trial counsel was deficient in his representation of higgins.the key witness,young,was the person who made the identification of higgins as the shooter.young had kept himself in hiding through the first days of the trial.young had admitted to the initial plan to trick ramsey and get his guns through the scam.trial counsel refused to young,due to his counsel apprehension that to do so would constitute malpractice,as he was admittedly unprepared tt.the reason for the failure to was,thus,placed into the record.even without counsel express admission,it would be obvious that there could be no reasonable excuse or rationale or sound trial strategy for a failure to the prosecution key witness.
the failure to effectively young was a failure of the right to effective counsel counsel failed to utilize the power of when it counted with the key witness.instead,the jury was left with essentially unrebutted,and untested,testimony that higgins had the gun and shot the victim.the evidence of higgins guilt was not overwhelming,and consisted of the testimony of young the prejudice to this defendant is obvious.
addressing this claim,without specifically citing any federal law,the state court of appeals set out the supreme court strickland test for ineffective assistance of counsel.under strickland,a defendant must establish both that his counsel performance at sentencing was seriously deficient and also that he suffered prejudice as a result of such deficiency.strickland,at.without discussion,the state appellate court made a determination,albeit conclusory,that higgins suffered no prejudice as a resu
