we affirm the district court denial of jarmaine carroll habeas petition because the michigan state courts did not unreasonably apply united states supreme court precedent in holding that the state trial court adequately dealt with an incident of improper jury contact,and that counsel for could stand in for defendant counsel during reinstruction of the jury without violating defendant sixth amendment rights.
on november,elisia brockington and two masked,armed intruders shot samir dawood in the leg during a robbery of the eagle market.brockington,who admitted to being an accomplice in the crime,described to the police carroll involvement in the robbery.the state of michigan subsequently charged carroll with several crimes,including armed robbery,assault with intent to commit murder,and conspiracy to commit armed robbery.he stood trial with codefendants william and michael thompkins.
on thursday,may,the jury began deliberating the fate of carroll and william thompkins.michael thompkins elected to have the trial judge decide his fate.two events pertaining to the jury deliberations are significant to this appeal.first,on the second day of deliberations,the jury requested that the trial judge reinstruct the jury on certain definitions and elements of the crimes.carroll attorney,richard powers,who was absent during the start of the reinstructions,entered the courtroom towards the end of the trial court response to the jury request.at the end of the reinstruction,which was lengthier than the original instructions and included several examples,counsel for,regina jemison,objected on behalf of codefendant and carroll.the trial judge overruled the objection and acknowledged that counsel for stood in for carroll attorney,noting,she did more than stood in,she stood up.
the second relevant event occurred on tuesday,may,when the trial court received a note from the jury that family members of one of the defendants harassed two jurors.juror number stated that,as she was waiting outside for someone to pick her up,a man walked past her and said he was going to jack her.the man then walked to a car,and looked back at the juror.this prompted her to reenter the building to wait for her ride.juror number,meanwhile,stated that a female asked her for her name.having heard these two jurors stories,the trial judge assured the jury that deputies would protect them.
an hour later,the jury convicted carroll of conspiracy to commit armed robbery,and the trial judge asked the two jurors whether earlier events affected the verdict.both jurors said that the earlier events did not affect their decisions as to defendants guilt.carroll counsel did not ask for a more detailed investigation or propose a different procedure to investigate the incidents.the judge later sentenced carroll to fifteen to thirty years.defense counsel moved for a mistrial because of the contact with the jurors,which the state trial court rejected.
in an unpublished opinion,the michigan court of appeals affirmed carroll conviction,people carroll,wl and the michigan supreme court subsequently denied carroll leave to appeal.as to carroll argument that the trial judge should have granted a mistrial because of jury tampering,the court of appeals noted that the two jurors were not biased against carroll.as to carroll argument,the michigan court of appeals noted that counsel,who objected to the conspiracy instructions on behalf of both defendants,stood in for carroll counsel during the reinstruction.
carroll filed a petition for habeas relief,which the federal district court denied on october.the federal district court noted that,on the issue of investigating jury tampering,the preferred course of action would have been to question the jurors individually regarding whether their impartiality was impacted by contact with the unknown persons rather than questioning the jurors together.nevertheless,the court held that it can not be said that the state court conclusion was contrary to or an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent.as to carroll denial of the right to counsel,the court noted that,while it would have been prudent for the trial court to state on the record prior to reinstructing the jury that counsel for was temporarily representing carroll,the state court determination that carroll was represented by counsel during reinstruction was not an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence,nor was it an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent.
the district court properly denied carroll petition for habeas relief because the michigan courts decisions did not involve an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court precedent or result from an unreasonable determination of facts.a federal court may grant a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in state custody only if the judgment of the state resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.
i.the michigan court did not unreasonably apply federal law in holding that the trial court adequately investigated allegations of improper contact with jurors.
carroll argument that the trial court failed to investigate allegations of improper contact with jurors suffers from two serious flaws.first,the record simply does not support carroll description of events,namely that the trial court prohibited counsel for carroll to participate in the investigation and ignored the request of carroll trial counsel to inquire of the jury after they rendered the verdict.instead,the record demonstrates that the trial court took the lead in investigating the claims and did not prevent carroll counsel from asking for a more investigation.
the relevant section of the record begins after the jury returned a guilty verdict.at that point,the trial court asked counsel,do you want a polling to which counsel answered,can we inquire presumably as to any alleged bias resulting from the statements to jurors.in response to counsel request,the trial court initiated an inquiry,asking both jurors whether the statements had any impact on their deliberations.the two jurors answered in the negative the judge then asked,do you want a polling to which counsel answered,yes.the trial court then polled the jury.
it is significant that counsel never asked the trial court to conduct any further investigation or to question the jurors individually in closed chambers.see white smith,cir observing that counsel did not request a hearing for the purpose of assessing the impact of statements that the jury heard united states walker,cir same for impact of juror riding in elevator with.carroll is simply incorrect in stating that the trial court prohibited anyone from participating in the investigation or ignored anyone requests because counsel did not make any requests.
second,carroll argument falters because precedent from the united states supreme court does not require more than what the trial court did in this circumstance.the two principal cases upon which carroll relies,remmer united states,and smith phillips,d,do not support his argument that the trial court failed in its obligations.
in remmer,an unknown person tried to induce the jury to find the defendant not guilty by attempting to bribe a juror.at.after the juror informed the court of the bribe offer,the fbi interviewed jurors.neither the judge nor the prosecutor,however,informed the defendant of the incident.id.on appeal following a conviction,the united states supreme court ordered the district court to conduct a hearing to determine whether the incident harmed the defendant,and,if so,to hold a new trial.id.at.see also united states herndon,cir holding that to fulfill its remmer obligations,a trial court must investigate claims of juror misconduct and not just permit defense counsel to make a record for the purposes of appeal.this case stands in stark contrast with remmer since the state trial court did,in fact,engage in an investigation of allegations of bias during which the jurors said that they could serve in a fair and impartial manner.see zuern tate,cir.
smith,similarly,does not support carroll position.in smith,a juror in a state murder trial applied for a major felony investigator position at the district attorney office.at.after the jury convicted the defendant,the state trial court held a hearing during which the juror explained that he had seen nothing improper in submitting the application during the trial.id.at.after hearing this evidence,the state trial court held that there was no prejudice against the defendant on the part of the juror,at,and the united states supreme court refused to disturb the state court finding.id.at.as in smith,the trial judge in this case investigated allegations of bias,and,as in smith,carroll offers no justifications beyond calling the state proceedings superficial and wholly inadequate for overturning the findings of the state courts.id 
thus,while the trial court might have done more to investigate the claims of jury tampering,there is nothing in remmer or smith that required the trial court to do so.for this reason,carroll claim is without merit because the state courts did not engage in an unreasonable application of federal law.
ii.michigan courts reasonably determined that the trial court did not deny carroll the right to counsel by allowing counsel for to stand in for carroll counsel.
the state courts,similarly,did not engage in an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,as determined by the united states supreme court,when they rejected carroll argument that he was denied counsel during jury reinstruction.clearly,carroll had a right to counsel when the trial court reinstructed the jury.see strickland washington,d right to counsel united states cronic,d right to counsel at critical stage of trial french jones,cir critical stage includes giving of supplemental jury instructions.the only question that remains is whether the michigan state courts unreasonably applied united states supreme court precedent when they determined that carroll was,in fact,represented by counsel when counsel for stood in for a portion of the jury reinstructions because the michigan courts did not unreasonably apply supreme court precedent,we affirm the district court denial of habeas relief.
the michigan court of appeals distinguished the facts before it from a case in which counsel for did not stand in during the jury reinstructions.the court noted that 
the record reveals that defendant was not denied his right to counsel during the reinstruction.defense counsel thanked codefendant william thompkin attorney for standing in for him during the reinstruction,and thompkin attorney objected to the conspiracy instruction on behalf of both defendant and thompkins.in addition,the trial court acknowledged that thompkin attorney stood in for defense counsel during the reinstruction.therefore,because defendant was represented by counsel during the reinstruction,he was not deprived of his sixth amendment right to counsel.
the michigan court solution to the problem of having counsel for stand in for counsel is not the ideal solution,nor consistent with this court precedent regarding what federal courts must do.see olden united states,cir.the preferred solution to such problems is to generate ex ante approval by having the trial court ask the defendant whose counsel is not present whether he or she consents to having counsel for stand in,and insuring that the consent is informed.see united states patterson,cir.
the supreme court,however,has not required this court solution in olden.the cases upon which carroll relies,johnson zerbst,brewer williams,d,and united states cronic,d,did not reach the issue of counsel standing in during a critical phase of the trial,a common practice in extended trials.see united states jackson,cir patterson,at.in johnson,for example,the supreme court dealt with a situation in which defendants were tried,convicted,and sentenced without assistance of counsel.at.the court held,i f the accused,however,is not represented by counsel and has not competently and intelligently waived his constitutional right,the sixth amendment stands as a jurisdictional bar to a valid conviction and sentence depriving him of his life or liberty.id.at.the court,however,did not discuss whether a stand in counsel constituted counsel for the purposes of this test.in brewer,the court determined whether a defendant waived the right to counsel when the police intentionally interrogated the defendant after adversary proceedings had commenced,and the court did not reach the issue of whether a briefly standing in deprived a defendant of his rights.at.the issue instead was whether defendant waived his right under massiah united states,d,not to be interrogated without a lawyer present,when defendant responded to a christian burial ploy by investigating police.finally,in cronic,the supreme court held that there was no constitutional violation when an inexperienced attorney represented a defendant,but noted that the court has uniformly found constitutional error without any showing of prejudice when counsel was either totally absent,or prevented from assisting the accused during a critical stage of the proceedings.at.the supreme court did not address whether stand in counsel solves the problem of an absent counsel.because no united states supreme court precedent deals with the issue of stand in counsel,the michigan courts did not engage in an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent when they determined that carroll was not denied assistance of counsel at the jury reinstruction phase.
for these reasons,we affirm the district court denial of carroll habeas petition.
while i concur in part i of the majority opinion,which concludes that petitioner suffered no constitutional violation of his right to an impartial jury,i dissent from the majority evident error in part ii of the majority opinion in approving the continuation of the trial proceedings in the absence of petitioner counsel.
contrary to clear supreme court precedent and with absolutely nothing in the record justifying such a holding,the majority by its ruling in this case makes a mockery of perhaps the most fundamental of all rights of the accused.petitioner sixth amendment right to counsel was clearly violated by his counsel unexplained absence during the jury reinstruction.there is absolutely no indication anywhere on the record that petitioner was aware that his counsel would be absent from the trial or that petitioner consented to the counsel standing in for his own counsel therefore,it defies logic to conclude that petitioner knowingly or intelligently waived his right to be represented by his counsel.where a record is completely silent as to the circumstances of one defense counsel standing in as counsel for another defendant,there is also no indication on the record regarding whether the two defendants have competing or conflicting interests,claims,or defenses this is a problem which is simply not addressed by the majority opinion.
in the present case,the jury requested to be reinstructed on the elements of conspiracy,one of the crimes with which petitioner had been charged.with no acknowledgment that petitioner counsel was not present,the court began the reinstruction.in explaining the crime of conspiracy,the court gave an example of how conspiracy worked and,in the process,incorporated the prosecution theory of the case into its example.petitioner counsel was not present to witness or object to the content or method of the instruction.the counsel for the stood up and objected on behalf of her own client,and then,purportedly,on behalf of petitioner.the objection was overruled.petitioner actual counsel then entered the courtroom and for the very first time anywhere on the record,there is an acknowledgment that he had been absent.
petitioner counsel apologized to the court for his absence and thanked the counsel for standing in.petitioner,however,was not addressed at all by his counsel or by the court concerning petitioner knowledge of his counsel ab
