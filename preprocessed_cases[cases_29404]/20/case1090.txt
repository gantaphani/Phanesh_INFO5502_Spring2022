preston hughes,iii was convicted and sentenced to death in texas for the murders of shandra charles and her cousin,marcell taylor.hughes sought federal habeas relief as to both his conviction and sentence.we granted a coa authorizing hughes to appeal the district court denial of federal habeas relief as to three claims arising from the sentencing trial.hughes dretke.cir unpublished.we now affirm the judgment of the district court.
at hughes trial,the state presented evidence that hughes stabbed both of the victims in the neck and chest,severing their aortas and jugular veins.when the police arrived at the scene,shandra charles was still alive.she told a police officer that a man named preston had stabbed her after trying to rape her.the police officers went to an apartment complex near the vacant field in which the victims were found.the manager of the complex gave them a list of tenants.the only tenant named preston was the petitioner.the police officers went to hughes apartment around.he agreed to accompany the officers to the police station,where he later gave two written statements in which he admitted that he had stabbed both of the victims.
in the first statement,hughes said that he had been carrying a knife with him because some people had been talking about trying to kill him.he said that,as he was walking home through the vacant field,someone came up behind him and touched him on the shoulder.he said he turned and just started sticking with the knife.it was dark,and he could not tell who was there,but after he stuck the first two times,he saw that it was shandra charles hughes called her shawn.he said,i was f ed up and i just got scared and kept sticking.
in the second statement,hughes said shawn did not come up behind him and tap him on the shoulder,as he had said in his first statement.instead,he said that he saw her walking with a little boy.he said that when they met in the middle of the trail through the field,she told him that she was on her way to his apartment to borrow his contact lenses.when he told her that she was not going to wear his contacts,he said that she kissed him,and then started rubbing his crotch.he described in detail the events that occurred next.suffice it to report that he said heavy sexual activity followed,which became unsatisfactory to hughes.when shawn demanded money,he refused.she threatened to accuse him of rape and when she hit him,he pulled his knife and began stabbing her.the little boy with shawn looked up at him and started crying.when the boy ran between hughes and shawn,hughes stabbed him several times.
at the phase of the trial,hughes took the stand in his own defense.he denied that he killed the victims,claimed that he was framed by the police,and testified that he confessed to the crimes only because the police officers struck him and threatened him,causing him to fear for his life.the jury found him guilty of capital murder.
at the punishment phase,the state called tracy heggar.she testified that hughes had raped her in,when she was thirteen years old.she testified further that hughes had threatened her with a gun in an attempt to prevent her from testifying against him about the rape.the state also presented evidence that,at the time of the murders,hughes was serving two probated terms for the aggravated sexual assault and aggravated assault of heggar.
the defense called several witnesses.six of hughes friends and his mother testified that he was a,person.hughes also testified in his own behalf at the punishment phase.he denied that he raped or threatened tracy heggar.he professed sorrow for the deaths of the victims,but denied that he committed the murders.he promised the jury that he would not be violent in the future and asked the jury to spare his life.the jury gave affirmative answers to the special issues on deliberateness and future danger,and,accordingly,the trial court sentenced hughes to death.
the texas court of criminal appeals affirmed hughes conviction and sentence on direct appeal.hughes state,opinion on rehearing,cert.denied,d.on october,hughes filed an application for state habeas relief.the texas court of criminal appeals denied the application based on the trial court findings of fact and conclusions of law.ex parte hughes.on april,hughes filed a second state habeas application.the texas court of criminal appeals dismissed the application as an abuse of the writ under article,section of the texas code of criminal procedure.ex parte hughes.
the district court denied hughes petition for federal habeas relief and denied a coa.
based on our limited,threshold inquiry and general assessment of the merits of hughes claims,we granted a coa authorizing hughes to appeal the denial of habeas relief for the following claims 
whether the claim is procedurally barred that the jury instructions at the punishment phase of the trial gave the jury no means for considering and giving effect to hughes mitigating evidence and,if not,whether the claim has merit 
whether,at the punishment phase,the jury was improperly allowed to consider a prior conviction that was later overturned on appeal and 
whether,at the punishment phase,the prosecutor violated hughes fourteenth amendment rights by suggesting to the jury that hughes counsel was callous and morally wrong to put tracy heggar,the rape victim who testified as a witness for the state,through the rigors of.
the parties filed supplemental briefs on the merits,as well as letter briefs addressing cases decided by our court and the supreme court of the united states.
with respect to the claims adjudicated on the merits in state court,hughes is not entitled to federal habeas relief unless the state court adjudication of his claims 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.the state court factual determinations shall be presumed to be correct,and the petitioner shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.e.
the aedpa standards of review cited above do not apply when we review the denial of a claim on procedural grounds,because there has not been an adjudication on the merits by the state court with respect to such a claim.see valdez cockrell,cir.we review the district court conclusions of law de novo.nelson quarterman,cir en banc,cert.denied,d.
we now turn to consider the claims for which we granted a coa.
hughes argues that the jury instructions at the punishment phase of his trial did not give the jury a means for considering and giving full effect to the mitigating evidence that he presented.the district court held that this claim is procedurally defaulted because hughes raised it for the first time in his second state habeas application,which was dismissed by the state court as an abuse of the writ,and that hughes had not shown cause for the default or actual prejudice,nor could he demonstrate that the failure to consider the claim would result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.alternatively,it denied relief on the merits.because we agree with the district court that the claim is procedurally defaulted,and that hughes has failed to establish cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justice,we do not address the merits of the claim.
a federal habeas claim is procedurally defaulted when the state court has based its rejection of the claim on a state procedural rule that provides an adequate basis for relief,independent of the merits of the claim.coleman thompson,d.to be adequate to support the judgment,the state law ground must be both firmly established and regularly followed by the state courts.ford georgia,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted.there is a presumption that there is no independent and adequate state ground for a state court decision when the decision fairly appears to rest primarily on federal law,or to be interwoven with the federal law,and when the adequacy and independence of any possible state law ground is not clear from the face of the state court opinion.coleman,at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
federal habeas review of procedurally defaulted claims is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law,or demonstrate that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.id.at.t he existence of cause for a procedural default must ordinarily turn on whether the prisoner can show that some objective factor external to the defense impeded counsel efforts to comply with the state procedural rule.id.at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.examples of external impediments include active governmental interference or the reasonable unavailability of the factual or legal basis for the claim.rodriguez johnson,cir.to demonstrate actual prejudice,the petitioner must show not merely that the errors created a possibility of prejudice,but that they worked to his actual and substantial disadvantage,infecting his entire trial with error of constitutional dimensions.smith quarterman,cir quoting murray carrier,d.the fundamental miscarriage of justice exception to the cause requirement of the procedural default doctrine is limited to cases in which the petitioner can show that a constitutional violation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent of the substantive offense,dretke haley,d quoting murray,at,or,in the capital sentencing context,the petitioner can show by clear and convincing evidence that,but for a constitutional error,no reasonable juror would have found the petitioner eligible for the death penalty under the applicable state law.id.quoting sawyer whitley,d.
the texas court of criminal appeals dismissed hughes second state habeas application,in which he raised this claim for the first time,as an abuse of the writ,citing texas code of criminal procedure article,section.this court has held that,since,the texas abuse of the writ doctrine has been consistently applied as a procedural bar,and that it is an independent and adequate state ground for the purpose of imposing a procedural bar.see kunkle dretke,cir see also fearance scott,cir holding that texas common law abuse of the writ doctrine has been strictly and regularly applied since and is an independent and adequate procedural bar emery johnson,cir holding that the texas statutory abuse of the writ rule,article,section,is an adequate and independent procedural bar.
notwithstanding our precedent,hughes argues that the texas abuse of the writ doctrine is not an adequate and independent state law ground because federal law was used as guidance for the codification of the texas common law abuse of the writ doctrine and because the state statute is dependent upon federal law for its application.the texas statute provides that a court may not consider the merits of or grant relief based on the subsequent application unless the application contains sufficient specific facts establishing that the claim could not have been presented in a previous application because the factual or legal basis of the claim was unavailable that by a preponderance of the evidence,but for a violation of the united states constitution no rational juror could have found the applicant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,or that by clear and convincing evidence,but for a violation of the united states constitution no rational juror would have answered in the state favor one or more of the special issues that were submitted to the jury crim.a.
the use of federal law as guidance for the enactment and application of the texas statute cited by the court of criminal appeals as the basis for its rejection of hughes claims does not,as hughes suggests,mean that the court decision rested primarily on federal law or was interwoven with federal law.no application or interpretation of federal law is required to determine whether a claim has,or could have,been presented in a previous habeas application.the texas court of criminal appeals did not need to consider or decide the merits of hughes constitutional claims in reaching its decision to dismiss those claims as an abuse of the writ pursuant to article,section.furthermore,there is nothing in its perfunctory dismissal of the claims that suggests that it actually considered or ruled on the merits.accordingly,its decision was independent of federal law for purposes of application of the procedural default doctrine.see stewart smith,d.
hughes next argues that he has shown cause and prejudice and a miscarriage of justice sufficient to overcome the procedural bar.as cause for the default,hughes submits that state habeas counsel was not appointed until a short time before his initial state habeas petition was due,and that the initial state habeas petition was filed in a rushed effort to toll the federal statute of limitations,at approximately the time article was enacted.the district court held that,although the changes in the law were external factors,hughes had failed to allege how the government had interfered with his ability to discover and investigate his claims,or that his claims were unavailable at the time he filed his direct appeal or his first state habeas application,or why his pleadings could not have been amended to raise the claims.
notwithstanding the fact that the texas court of criminal appeals dismissed his claim,asserted in his second state habeas application,as an abuse of the writ,hughes argues that this court should reach the merits of his claim because ex parte robertson,no,wl,unpublished,held that the legal basis for raising a meritorious penry claim was previously unavailable prior to the supreme court decisions in tennard dretke,d,and smith texas,d per curiam.in tennard and smith,the supreme court rejected this court relevance test for penry claims.that test required that petitioner evidence show a uniquely severe permanent handicap with which the defendant was burdened through no fault of his own and that the criminal act was attributable to this severe permanent condition.nelson,at brackets,internal quotation marks,and citation omitted.hughes therefore contends that he satisfies the conditions for filing a subsequent state habeas application.we disagree.
in ex parte hood,the texas court of criminal appeals held that tennard and smith did not provide a new legal basis for relief.hood,at.instead,it concluded that such claims could have been reasonably formulated from penry i and other previously available case law.id.at.the court stated that,if the legal basis for the claim was recognized by or could have been reasonably formulated from a supreme court decision,any federal court of appeals decision,or any state appellate court decision,then the applicant has failed to meet the unavailability exception under article,section.id.at.
with respect to prejudice,hughes asserts that he should not be held liable for the prejudice that was directly the result of changes in state law,state appointment of counsel procedures,and attempts to comply with new federal law.absent a showing of cause,it is not necessary for the court to consider whether there is actual prejudice.martin maxey,cir.
hughes next argues that the fundamental miscarriage of justice exception should apply because he is actually innocent of killing the victims and because he is actually innocent of the death penalty,inasmuch as there is insufficient evidence to support the jury findings on the special punishment issues of deliberateness and future dangerousness.we agree with the district court conclusion that hughes has not established that he fits within the fundamental miscarriage of justice exception.he has not presented any evidence establishing that he did not commit the murders,and the evidence was more than sufficient to sustain the jury answers to the special issues.
in sum,we agree with the district court conclusion that hughes penry claim is procedurally defaulted,and that he has failed to establish cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justice,to excuse the defaul
