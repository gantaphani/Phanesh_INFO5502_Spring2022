kevin keith filed a petition for habeas corpus in federal district court.the district court concluded that the petition was second or successive and transferred keith case to this court for determination of whether keith should be permitted to file the petition under b.this court denied keith permission to file his petition.see keith bobby,cir.keith thereafter filed a motion in the district court under federal rule of civil procedure e asking the district court to reconsider its order transferring the matter to this court.the district court denied keith motion both because the motion was untimely and because the court again concluded that keith petition was second or successive.keith now appeals the decision of the district court.because we conclude that keith rule e motion was untimely,and because this court order barred the district court from reconsidering whether keith petition was second or successive,we affirm the order of the district court.
our prior decisions have provided a full review of the facts and procedural history of keith case,see keith,at,keith mitchell,cir,so we will set forth only a brief summary here.in february,a gunman killed marichell chatman,linda chatman,and marchae chatman,and wounded richard warren,quinita reeves,and quinton reeves.physical evidence and witness accounts led ohio police to keith,and a grand jury indicted keith for three counts of aggravated murder and three counts of attempted aggravated murder.after a trial,a jury found keith guilty of all counts.on the jury recommendation,the trial court imposed a death sentence for each of the aggravated murder counts.
keith filed a direct appeal in the ohio court of appeals and,subsequently,in the ohio supreme court,but both courts affirmed keith conviction and sentence.see state keith,ohio state keith,wl wl ohio.keith then unsuccessfully pursued relief in ohio state court.see state keith,ohio,table state keith,wl ohio,see also state keith,ohio,table denying reconsideration.finally,in,keith filed a petition for habeas corpus in the united states district court for the northern district of ohio.after reviewing the merits of keith petition,the district court denied relief.this court affirmed.see keith,at.
in,keith filed a second petition for habeas corpus in the district court.the petition asserted that newly discovered evidence revealed violations of brady maryland,and napue illinois.the petition acknowledged that b required keith to obtain permission from the court of appeals before filing a second or successive petition,but argued that keith did not need to satisfy this requirement because his new petition did not fall within the meaning of second or successive.
on july,the district court entered an order of transfer in which the court rejected keith contention that his petition was not second or successive.following the procedure established in in re sims,cir,the district court transferred the matter to this court for initial consideration.
once this court received keith petition,the clerk of the court instructed keith to file a proper application for permission to file a second or successive petition.in response,keith filed a corrected second or successive motion.attached to that motion,keith provided a supporting memorandum and a revised version of his petition.neither keith motion nor the attached memorandum argued that keith petition was not second or successive,and the revised petition did not discuss the issue,which had been adverted to in the district court filing.
on january,this panel issued an order denying keith motion to file a second or successive habeas petition.keith,at.the panel did not explicitly address the district court finding that keith petition was a second or successive petition for habeas corpus.we focused on whether keith petition overcame the bar on second or successive petitions established by b.we concluded that keith petition did not overcome that bar because keith had not made a prima facie showing that no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.id.at quoting b b ii.
thirteen days after this court issued its order,keith filed a motion in the district court under federal rule of civil procedure e asking the district court to reconsider its order of transfer,entered more than six months earlier.keith argued that the district court committed a clear error of law when it determined that keith petition was second or successive,and that the district court should therefore alter its order transferring the petition to this court.keith asserted that this court january order did not bar the district court from reconsidering its earlier determination because this court had not addressed whether keith petition was second or successive.keith made no effort to apprise this court of the alleged defect in its january order.
on june,the district court issued an order denying keith rule e motion.the district court held that it was not precluded from reconsidering whether keith petition was second or successive,because the sixth circuit never adjudicated on whether keith petition is a successive petition.instead,the sixth circuit merely applied b without expressly holding whether keith petition was subject to its restrictions.at.however,the court concluded that keith motion was untimely because keith filed it more than six months after the district court issued its transfer order.at.further,the court reexamined keith petition and again concluded that it was a second or successive petition for the purposes of b.at.as a result,the district court refused to alter or amend its order of transfer.
at keith request,the district court issued a certificate of appealability with respect to the arguments raised in keith rule e motion.keith filed a timely appeal.
on appeal,keith claims that the district court erred by denying his rule e motion.we review a district court denial of a rule e motion for an abuse of discretion.betts costco wholesale,cir.abuse of discretion is defined as a definite and firm conviction that the trial court committed a clear error of judgment.a district court abuses its discretion when it relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact,or when it improperly applies the law or uses an erroneous legal standard.ibid.quoting tompkin philip morris usa,cir.
keith argues that the district court improperly applied the law both when it determined that his rule e motion was untimely and when it reaffirmed its conclusion that his petition was second or successive.with respect to the timeliness of his rule e motion,keith argues that the district court order of transfer did not become a final order until this court issued its denial of keith motion to file a second or successive habeas petition.appellant brief at.as a result,keith asserts that the time for filing his rule e motion did not begin to run until this court entered its january order.ibid.turning to the district court conclusion that his petition was second or successive,keith contends that his petition was not an abuse of the writ and thus did not fall within the meaning of second or successive.appellant brief at.
we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied keith rule e motion.first,the district court was correct when it concluded that keith motion was untimely.federal rule of civil procedure e provides that a motion to alter or amend a judgment must be filed no later than days after the entry of the judgment.e.this court has interpreted the term judgment to refer to a judgment or a final order.see cgh,quebecor world,app x,cir see also inge rock fin,cir when a party files a motion to reconsider a final order or judgment within ten days of entry,we will generally consider the motion to be brought pursuant to rule e.as mandated by the language of rule e,a court must look to the date upon which the final order or judgment was entered to determine whether a rule e motion is timely.see intera henderson,cir in order for a rule motion to be deemed timely,the motion must be served no later than days after entry of the judgment.quoting.e.
in this case,the district court entered its order of transfer on july,and kei
