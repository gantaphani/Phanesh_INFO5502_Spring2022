dwight john appeals from the district court denial of his habeas corpus petition.john was convicted in massachusetts superior court state trial court of murder of lezmore buffong and is serving a sentence of life imprisonment.the conviction was affirmed by the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc.commonwealth john.john argues that the federal court erroneously denied his petition because his conviction was based on a confession for which he had been granted informal immunity.we reject this claim and affirm the district court denial of the petition.
the following discussion of the facts is based on the state court record.see teti bender,cir.
john involvement with the poison clan gang 
john was a founding member of the poison clan,a gang formed in the brooklyn,new york area.under the leadership of george chang,john and other members of the gang,including dean beckford,sean henry and winston gordon,sold large amounts of crack cocaine in the late.
eventually,one of the gang members murdered chang,and the poison clan subsequently led a faction located in virginia and john,henry,and gordon led a faction located in boston.henry was killed not long after chang,which resulted in the poison clan temporarily shutting down.although john and gordon left boston soon after henry death,unbeknownst to john,gordon later returned to boston and started a marijuana distribution operation.to assist him with this operation,gordon hired lezmore buffong.
in,john visited boston and encountered gordon and buffong.the encounter,friendly at first,turned deadly.on december,john and buffong,who were traveling together in buffong car followed by gordon and another individual,became separated from the others at a traffic light.at some point after this,john murdered buffong.
nine days later,john was found driving buffong car in new york,and the police recovered two guns and buffong wallet in the car.john,however,was not arrested for the murder of buffong until nearly four years later in,and that charge was later dropped.
john cooperation with city and federal authorities 
in,while in custody in new york awaiting trial on a state robbery charge,john contacted new york authorities for the purpose of sharing information about the poison clan criminal activities,including information regarding chang murder.john made a statement about chang murder that eventually came to the attention of assistant united states attorney david novak,who was building a federal case in virginia against beckford and other poison clan members.novak and john new york attorney arranged to have john transferred to a federal institution in virginia so that he could be available to give information to novak about the poison clan.they also agreed that novak would seek to have counsel appointed for john.
the first meeting between john and novak took place in virginia in april.at that meeting,novak advised john that he should be represented by counsel and spent half an hour attempting to persuade john to accept representation.john refused representation.novak also offered john a proffer letter which stated that nothing contained in the oral proffer will be used against you john declined to sign the proffer letter,telling novak that he just wanted to tell his story.novak developed the impression that john wanted to even the score with beckford,whom john believed was responsible for henry murder.john subsequently gave information about criminal activity by poison clan members.
following that initial interview,john was debriefed on a number of occasions by novak and by federal agents.john implicated himself in some of the poison clan criminal activity,admitting at one point that he provided the gun that was used to murder chang.during those interviews,john was asked at various points whether he had ever killed anyone.he consistently answered that he had not.
in may,john testified before a federal grand jury about the poison clan drug operations and about several murders.prior to this testimony,novak and john had agreed that,in return for john cooperation with the federal prosecution,novak would recommend to the brooklyn district attorney da a favorable treatment in his robbery case.the grand jury transcript itself includes john acknowledgment of the government agreement to notify the brooklyn da of his cooperation,and further shows that john was warned that he could be prosecuted for perjury if he lied.the transcript contains no references to an immunity agreement.after novak informed the brooklyn da of john cooperation,john pending plea deal in the brooklyn robbery case was reduced from years to years incarceration.
in october,beckford and others were indicted for multiple homicides,as well as for racketeering,conspiracy,and engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise.at around this time,john,still in prison in virginia,began acting strangely.he reportedly walked around naked,threw fecal matter about,poured milk on his head,cut himself,banged his head against a wall,and tied a string around his neck in an apparent attempt to commit suicide.
we pause here to note that several indicted poison clan defendants were incarcerated in the same facility as john.the state trial court that heard john motion to suppress during the later murder prosecution against him observed that there was evidence that john was malingering in order to avoid testifying against the beckford defendants.
after receiving reports of john bizarre behavior,novak visited him in the correctional facility.john told novak that he would not testify at the beckford trial.novak responded that he could compel john to testify by granting him immunity,thus stripping him of his fifth amendment privilege not to testify 
as part of his trial preparation,novak filed notices about prospective government witnesses concerning their criminal histories,and any rewards or inducements made in exchange for their testimony.see giglio united states,d.the notice filed with respect to john,sent to counsel for the beckford defendants in may the notice,explained the arrangement with the brooklyn da.the notice also stated that john has been informed that he has use immunity for his statements,meaning that anything he says can not be held against him in any fashion.
john,however,did not testify at trial.on june,the week before he was scheduled to testify,john was visited by an fbi agent.the agent noticed that john seemed agitated and asked him whether the defendants knew something about him that the government did not that might come up at trial.at that point,john told the agent that he had killed buffong in boston.the agent notified novak of the confession,and novak elected not to call john as a witness.the agent also notified the boston police 
trial court suppression hearing and prosecution of john 
after john was indicted in in massachusetts for buffong murder,he sought to suppress his confession.at the suppression hearing,novak testified that his promise of immunity to john was conditional upon john testifying at the beckford trial,and then only for his trial testimony.the confession was admitted,and after a trial john was found guilty of murder.on direct review of the conviction the sjc upheld the trial court conclusion that john did not have immunity from the use of his confession against him.
after exhausting his state remedies,john filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus with the district court.the district court denied john petition but issued a certificate of appealability under c.
ii.discussion 
we review the district court denial of a habeas petition de novo.see lynch ficco,cir citing ellsworth warden,cir.
federal habeas review of a state court decision is conducted under the and effective death penalty act of aedpa.see lindh murphy,d niland hall,cir.under aedpa,a federal court can grant habeas relief only where a state court adjudication 
d resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.subsection e provides that 
a determination of a factual issue made by a state court shall be presumed to be correct.the applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.john first argues for relief under subsection d 
and e,and then under d.as to d and e,he argues that the trial court factual john confession was not obtained under a grant of erroneous john other arguments are based on the fifth and fourteenth amendments.we address these arguments under d,the contrary to,or an unreasonable application of standard.
challenge to state court factual findings 
john challenges the state trial court determination,which was affirmed by the sjc,that john statements and grand jury testimony were not protected by a grant of immunity.john,at.in challenging this ultimate factual finding,john relies solely on evidence presented in the state court proceedings.
john has framed his habeas challenge under both d and e.he asserts that the trial court finding was objectively unreasonable in light of the evidence presented in the trial court proceeding,see d,and that he has presented clear and convincing evidence sufficient to overcome the presumption of correctness we afford state court factual findings in the habeas context.see e.as we observed in teti,the relationship between the standards enunciated in d and e remains unclear.at quoting lambert blackwell,cir.both standards,however,express the same fundamental principle of deference to state court findings.id.as dictated by teti,we apply a presumption of correctness to the trial court factual findings and also examine whether there has been an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.see id.
the trial court ultimately found that john confession was not obtained under a promise of immunity.supporting this determination,the trial court found that john expressed a willingness to assist in the prosecution of poison clan leaders and that novak concluded that john was willing to assist in the prosecution because he harbored animosity toward dean beckford,one of the poison clan leaders whom novak was prosecuting that john refused court appointed counsel in connection with this assistance and that john also refused to sign a proffer letter that provided that nothing contained in the oral proffer will be used against you.
the trial court also found that the only agreement that existed between novak and john was the one novak identified during john grand jury testimony that federal prosecutors had agreed to notify the brooklyn office of john cooperation in the federal prosecution of the poison clan.the trial court determined that although novak stated in the notice that john has use immunity for his statements,this statement meant simply that john had immunity for his anticipated testimony at the beckford trial.in making this finding,the trial court relied on other evidence in the record.the court noted that john had previously told novak that he did not want to cooperate further in the prosecution and,specifically,that he would refuse to testify at beckford trial.when novak heard this,the trial court found,he informed john that he had to testify because novak could immunize him formally or informally,effectively stripping him of his fifth amendment right to not testify.
seeking to adduce clear and convincing evidence sufficient to rebut the presumption of correctness we give these factual findings,john identifies two documents which he argues establish that,prior to his confession,novak offered him unrestricted use immunity not limited to future trial testimony.he additionally criticizes the record evidence the trial court relied on when making its factual findings.we first address john reliance on the two notice referred to above and a letter sent by novak to the suffolk county da in september letter.
we start with piece of evidence that is the most helpful to john letter.novak wrote 
in the spring of,john began having problems while housed at the northern neck regional jail and indicated that sic may not cooperate with our office.i orally told him that he had use immunity for his statements to us,meaning that anything that he said can not be held against him.i told him that this was conditioned upon him providing truthful evidence to us.again,during this time period,he was telling us that he had not killed anyone.in early june of,prior to the trial of the defendants in united states beckford,i provided the defendants with a notice regarding john that informed them that i had conferred use immunity on john we did not call john to testify at the beckford trial.
emphasis added.
viewed in isolation,the letter could be interpreted as indicating that novak had indeed conferred conditional use immunity on john that was not limited to his anticipated testimony at the beckford trial.but,when placed in the context of the record as a whole,the letter capacity to call into question the correctness of the trial court ultimate factual finding is significantly undermined.
to begin,john discordant use of the letter in the prior state court proceedings detracts from his attempted use of it in this appeal.although he attached the letter to his suppression motion in the trial court proceeding,john failed to advance any argument based on the letter in that proceeding.and,before the sjc,john mentioned the letter only to effectively argue that it should be ignored.specifically,john identified one statement made by novak in the statement that john immunity was conditioned on him providing truthful characterized it as a late attempt to amend the unrestricted use immunity granted john in.driving this point home further,john contended to the sjc that the notice,not the letter,was the best evidence of the immunity agreement.
putting aside the question of whether john has waived his newly minted argument regarding the significance of the letter,it is apparent that,at least before the state courts,he did not rely on the letter itself to establish the existence of a broader use immunity agreement.that john chose not to rely on the letter for this purpose before the state courts is certainly something those courts could have taken into account when resolving the factual question.but more importantly,when viewed against the backdrop of all of the other record evidence,the letter can be harmonized with the trial court finding that john confession was not obtained under a grant of immunity.
we examine the key statement in the letter,novak statement that,i orally told him that he had use immunity for his statements to us,meaning that anything he said can not be held against him.emphasis ours.as we have noted,this statement may be interpreted to suggest that novak offered john use immunity prior to his confession.for example,novak use of the word had may reasonably be read as indicating that the government had already bestowed a form of immunity on john distinct from any immunity contingent on future trial testimony.and,moreover,the phrase statements to us,could be read as referring to statements made to federal authorities.
but another interpretation of this statement is undoubtedly plausible.in the letter,immediately preceding novak statement about immunity,novak stated that john had indicated that sic may not cooperate with our office.it was then that novak stated that he,orally told john that he had use immunity for his statements to us,meaning that anything he said can not be held against him.emphasis ours.this indicates that novak statement about immunity was directed at ensuring john future cooperation.in other words,novak communicated to john that he had immunity for statements to be made at trial,immunity that would preclude him from successfully asserting a fifth amendment right not to testify at beckford trial.
this interpretation of novak statement in the letter is bolstered by novak testimony at the suppression hearing held by the trial court.novak testified that,when he visited john in,john informed him that he would not testify at beckford trial.novak further testified that,after hearing t
