fugen gulertekin appeals the district court denial of her petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to.for the following reasons,we affirm the decision of the district court.
background 
gulertekin conviction arises from events which occurred on june.gulertekin,a citizen of turkey who holds a master degree from ohio state university in special education and early childhood education,was caring for patrick lape,a infant,in her home.according to gulertekin testimony,in the early afternoon on that date,gulertekin was changing patrick diaper before his nap when he began to choke and vomit.patrick stopped breathing and gulertekin administered first the heimlich maneuver and then cpr.at some point she called for her daughter,who was also in the house,to call.the baby,however,started breathing again,so the call was discontinued.a few minutes later,when patrick again stopped breathing,gulertekin called her daughter to renew the call to,and resumed her attempts at resuscitation emergency personnel arrived and patrick was taken to children hospital in columbus,ohio.upon his arrival,carla hauersperger a pediatrician who examined and treated patrick diagnosed him with a closed head injury,seizure,possible aspiration pneumonia,bilateral retinal hemorrhage and occipital skull fracture.
gulertekin was indicted on one count of felonious assault and one count of child endangering.at trial,three physicians testified for the state.hauersperger stated that she had suspected child abuse,based on patrick injuries,so she ordered the medical photographer for the hospital to come to the emergency department and take photographs of patrick.hauersperger also ordered several consultations of other physicians,including charles johnson,the director of the child abuse division of the hospital.johnson,who is also a professor of pediatrics at the ohio state university college of medicine and has published articles on shaken baby syndrome,testified as well.johnson stated his opinion that the injuries to patrick brain occurred within minutes of the manifestation of his symptoms,that these injuries were caused by his being severely shaken,and that there was nothing in the history he had been given to indicate an accident.elizabeth gilles,a child neurologist at the hospital and an assistant professor of neurology and pediatrics at ohio state university,also testified.gilles has previously testified as an expert in pediatric child abuse and neglect,has written articles on shaken baby syndrome,and was called in as a consultant to examine patrick several weeks after his injury.she testified that patrick injuries were probably sustained within one hour before the paramedics were called,and that they could not have happened by accident.
the jury found gulertekin guilty of both offenses charged in the indictment.the court sentenced her to eight years imprisonment.she appealed her convictions to the ohio tenth district court of appeals,which affirmed on december.she then sought to appeal to the supreme court of ohio,but it declined to accept jurisdiction over the direct appeal.she filed a petition for relief with the trial court on september,one day after the deadline.the court dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction,due to the late filing.she appealed this dismissal to the ohio tenth district court of appeals,which affirmed.gulertekin then filed a petition with the ohio supreme court,requesting it to accept jurisdiction over her appeal,but it was denied.she filed the current habeas petition with the federal district court on july,asserting six grounds for relief the district court dismissed the petition,finding that her claims were procedurally defaulted and that her claim of actual innocence was insufficient to excuse such default.
standard of review 
in a habeas proceeding,this court reviews a district court legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.lucas,cir.further 
in all cases in which a state prisoner has defaulted his federal claims in state court pursuant to an independent and adequate state procedural rule,federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law,or demonstrate that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.

discussion 
procedural.juror coercion 
in her second claim on habeas,gulertekin asserts that her rights to due process,a fair trial,and an impartial jury were violated when the trial judge effectively directed the jury to return a guilty verdict.this claim stems from a series of events which occurred during the jury deliberations.the jury initially began deliberating at on november.at the jury was admonished and given a fifteen minute recess.the jury continued deliberating until,at which time they were admonished and recessed until the next morning.at approximately on november,the jurors submitted a note to the trial judge,asking,what do you suggest when some jurors feel strongly one way,and one or two jurors feel strongly the other way 
the judge noted that the same question had been posed by the jurors the day before,after they had been deliberating for less than two hours.the judge then gave the standard howard charge,and the jury returned to the jury room at shortly after,another note was sent to the trial judge asking whether one of the jurors could be replaced by an alternate juror.the note stated in part that juror would like to be replaced because i am not able to reach the decision of everyone else.
at,the trial judge held a discussion with the attorneys for both sides,out of the presence of the jury.the judge expressed concern that juror was not deliberating,and further related that i t also come to my understanding from the bailiff have seen her do whenever they are on break she on a cell phone.it is my understanding from the bailiff that she called her boyfriend to come pick her up.she not been excused from this jury.the judge then asked counsel what they wanted to do,and whether they wanted to excuse the juror,noting that yesterday the comment was that she does want to be the one responsible for making the decision in this case.in the discussion which ensued,the judge further expressed her intention to have the bailiff remove the juror cell phone,because 
for her to call her boyfriend to come pick her up to me is communicating about the case.that a violation of the oath it now been brought to my attention that she also called her mother yesterday,now she calling her boyfriend to come pick her up.maybe she not talking about the substance of the case,but i do think it appropriate to have that cell phone back there so i going to ask the bailiff to take the cell phone.
the trial judge asked the attorneys whether they wanted to voir dire the juror,in chambers,in order to determine whether she was refusing to deliberate.defense counsel stated his opinion that it is inappropriate for us to intrude into the deliberating process and that the court should not creat e an intrusive atmosphere with regard to that juror.he suggested that the next step would be to ask the jury foreperson whether further deliberations would be productive and,if he answered in the negative,to declare a mistrial to which the court stated that an insufficient period of time had elapsed since the giving of the howard charge to declare a mistrial.defense counsel then reiterated his objection to pull ing one juror out of deliberations and interrogat ing them in the middle of deliberations.a further exchange occurred regarding the judge concern that juror was not deliberating and her use of the cell phone,to which defense counsel responded,your honor,the question and the answer,seem to me,do not infer juror misconduct my suggestion is,frankly,the answer to the question is no,she ca be removed.the remaining dialogue was as follows 
the court okay.then what i tell her she ca be removed,hand over the cell phone.she not allowed to have any contact with anyone out of the jury deliberation room regarding this case.
defense counsel during the deliberations,or i do know,you can get 
the court outside the process here.i do want her on the breaks calling anybody saying come pick me up,i ca do this any more.
defense counsel well,i think you need to make it not just to her,but to all of the jurors.
the court bring them out here.we do that.
upon the jury entry into the courtroom,the judge read the note aloud,noted that it posed the same question as was submitted by the jury the day before,and stated 
our response is still the same,you are all members of this jury.you have not been excused from this jury.i have given you the instructions.i have just given you additional instructions on how you are to conduct yourselves in the deliberation room.i telling you to go back there and deliberate on this case.
i would like anybody who has got a cell phone to turn it in to the bailiff.you are not allowed to have any communications concerning this case either in the deliberation room or outside of the deliberation room.the admonition that i have given you applies throughout the entire trial.the only time you are allowed to discuss this case is among yourselves while you are deliberating in the deliberation room.this also applies to calling anyone on the outside,such as a mother or boyfriend to come pick them up because that not going to happen.
now,i going to ask you to turn over the cell phones to the bailiff,go back into the deliberation room and continue your deliberations.
the jury was given the admonition and recessed during the noon hour they resumed deliberations after lunch,and returned a verdict of guilty on both counts at.the jurors were polled,and each,including juror,indicated that this was his or her verdict.
gulertekin contends that the trial court tactics amounted to juror coercion,and has presented an affidavit by juror,julie weston ring,which recounts her feelings that the judge statements regarding the use of cell phones 
were directed solely at me,as i had previously used my cell phone to call my boyfriend during a break.in front of the entire courtroom,which was filled with spectators,news reporters and television cameras,i was then forced to turn over my cell phone to a man i believed to be the court bailiff.i felt humiliated and degraded by the judge.
ring further avers that the judge statements made me feel as though she was forcing me to change my position and compelling me to vote to convict gulertekin.the manner in which judge instructed us made me feel as though she was not going to let anyone leave until we had a conviction.
the district court found this habeas claim to be procedurally defaulted,due to the failure of gulertekin trial counsel to object to the judge supplemental instructions,and thus declined to address the merits gulertekin asserts,however,that the finding of a procedural bar is erroneous,because ohio criminal rule requiring contemporaneous objections to jury instructions does not apply to jury instructions given after the jury begins its deliberations defense counsel did object to the trial court resolution of the situation the court of appeals failed to provide a clear and express statement that it was enforcing the state procedural sanction at issue and this procedural bar does not constitute an independent and adequate state ground,separate from federal law.the district court rejected these arguments upon examination of the opinion of the ohio court of appeals,dated december,the last state court to review the claim.
in reviewing this claim on direct appeal,the ohio court of appeals first observed that defense counsel did not object to the howard charge the court had initially given to the jury,and further note d that no objection was raised to the court final supplemental instructions which included the court admonition to the jurors to go back there and deliberate on this case.the court then reviewed state law,holding that in the absence of plain error,the failure to object to improprieties in jury instructions,as required by crim,is a waiver of the issue on appeal.gulertekin first argument,that rule is inapplicable to jury instructions given after the jury has begun to deliberate,relies on a single antiquated case,burnett state,ohio law abs,which held that a court admonition to the jury to try and reach a verdict after deliberations had started was not an additional charge in violation of.neither gulertekin nor burnett explains the substance of,so the import of this holding,thus removed from its context,is dubious.moreover,while gulertekin asserts that the state court never used the term contemporaneous objection in reference to the jury coercion claim,the court did state that counsel failed to object to the supplemental instruction given at the time.therefore,this argument is without merit 
gulertekin further maintains that defense counsel discussion with the trial judge,prior to the giving of the supplemental instruction,in which he voiced disagreement with the suggestion of singling out juror,did constitute a contemporaneous objection to the judge to the court admonition against jurors calling anyone on the outside,such as a mother or boyfriend to come pick them up.gulertekin seeks to distinguish the present situation due to the fact that defense counsel had no opportunity,before the jury was called in,to review the exact language the court intended to use in addressing them and lodge any objections.although this factual scenario is somewhat unique,it is by no means unprecedented.in state gumm,ohio,during deliberations,the jury sent a question to the trial judge,asking are the aggravating circumstances to count i just the kidnapping and attempted rape,or do they also include the murder itself the jury was called into the courtroom,the court read its question aloud,and the judge responded as follows the answer to that is yes.let me read you the instructions on that point.id.the judge then reread the instructions on aggravating circumstances,without any contemporaneous objection from defense counsel.the jury was sent back to continue its deliberations,and after it left the courtroom,the defense objected that the judge had indicated that aggravated murder was itself an aggravating circumstance for the purpose of determining penalty.in reviewing this case,the supreme court of ohio stated 
we note that the jury question itself was compound in nature and therefore contained a potential for ambiguity.as a result,the trial court response the answer to that is yes contained an element of uncertainty as to whether that answer meant,yes,the aggravating circumstances are just the kidnapping and rape or yes,the aggravating circumstances include the murder itself.we note that defense counsel objection to the court response was not made at a point in time at which the trial court could easily have corrected the ambiguity inherent in its response,and error,if any,might properly be deemed to have been waived.
id.emphasis added.this case indicates that the rationale behind the contemporaneous objection timely correction of be taken into account in determining the import of a failure to object.if defense counsel felt that the judge remarks improperly coerced juror,counsel should have so indicated before the jury returned its verdict.his reliance on his previous discourse with the judge regarding the proper course of action,which resulted in ostensibly an agreement,is insufficient to preserve any objection to the supplemental instructions on appeal.what is clear from the record is that counsel objected to pull ing one juror out of deliberations and interrogat ing them.the trial judge accommodated this objection,and instead addressed the entire jury.while the particular reference to calling a mother or a boyfriend may have hit home with juror,there was nothing explicit in the judge admonition regarding cell phones which mentioned her by name or juror number,and defense counsel did not object to this admonition.
gulertekin also contends that the court of appeals failed to provide a clear and express statement that its ruling regarding her juror coercion claim was based on the state procedural bar,conducted a constitutional review,not plain error review,and spoke in terms of reversible error.the requirement that a state court invoking a state procedural bar must provide a clear and express statement to that effect the plain statement rule originated in michigan long,d,and was applied to the federal habeas context by harris reed,d.coleman,at.in coleman thompson,however,the supreme court made clear that a predicate to the application of the harris presumption that state court opinions lacking such a clear and express statement of reliance on a state procedural bar do not preclude federal habeas review of the claim at issue is that the decision of the last state court to which the petitioner presented his federal claims must fairly appear to rest primarily on federal law or to be interwoven with federal law.id.at.
the court of appeals took up the issue of the trial court jury instructions by first recounting the precepts that 
to preserve on appeal the issue of error in the instructions to a jury,an appellant must cite an objection to the instruction on the trial record.state powers,ohio app d.see also state underwood,ohio,in the absence of plain error,the failure to object to improprieties in jury instructions,as required by crim,is a waiver of the issue on appeal.further,n otice of plain error under.b is to be taken with the utmost caution,under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.state long,ohio,paragraph three of the syllabus.
the court then embarked on a discussion of whether each facet of the trial court supplemental instructions constituted plain error.although the court of appeals mentioned reversible error,and cited occasionally to federal law,the fact that it found the procedural problem defense counsel failure to object paramount,and examined only whether this holding would constitute plain error or manifest injustice,is sufficient to foreclose federal court review on habeas.the court began discussion of the issue by citing the contemporaneous objection rule,and returned to counsel failure in this regard several times throughout the analysis.the mentions of reversible error can fairly be read to broach the question of whether there was,indeed,any error,let alone one which would constitute manifest injustice if uncorrected.this case properly falls under the rubric of paprocki foltz,cir,wherein we observed 
the state court of appeals did not conduct the sort of review of the jury instructions that presumably would have been undertaken had there been a timely objection to them instead,the court inquired only whether affirmance of the conviction would result in manifest injustice because of the alleged instructional error we would be loath to adopt an exception to the cause and prejudice rule that would discourage state appellate courts from undertaking the sort of inquiry conducted by the state court,and we do not believe that the state court explanation of why the jury instructions resulted in no manifest injustice can fairly be said to have constituted a waiver of the procedural default.
see also hinkle randle,cir w e view a state appellate court review for plain error as the enforcement of a procedural default.
gulertekin related assertion that the procedural bar at issue was not an adequate and independent ground,separate from federal law,relies on an unpublished sixth circuit opinion,knuckles rogers,wl cir.in knuckles,this court acknowledged ohio contemporaneous objection rule and the procedural default which resulted from a failure to object,but found that since the ohio appellate court which reviewed the case conducted a plain error analysis,which gauges whether a person has been denied a fair trial which,in turn,requires the application of federal constitutional law,the decision was not independent of federal law.id.at.we have previously held ohio contemporaneous objection rule to constitute an adequate and independent state ground.see hinkle,at ohio contemporaneous objection rule constitutes an adequate and independent state ground that bars federal habeas review absent a showing of cause and prejudice seymour walker,cir objections to trial court jury instructions are defaulted because the court of appeals reviewed them only for plain error due to seymour failure to comply with ohio contemporaneous objection rule controlling precedent in our circuit indicates that plain error review does not constitute a waiver of state procedural default rules.and scott mitchell,cir t he supreme court has specifically found that default imposed for failure to object contemporaneously as required by ohio rule is an adequate and independent state ground.
in scott,we criticized knuckles,observing that 
in coleman,the court very strongly implied its continued disapproval of the rule ascribe d to knuckles.as a preamble to its discussion of independent state grounds,the court acknowledged that it had previously held oklahoma review for fundamental trial error before applying state procedural defaults was not independent of federal law so as to bar direct review because the state had made application of the procedural bar depend on an antecedent ruling on federal law.coleman,at.the coleman court then distinguished that holding by observing simply that ake was a direct review case.we have never applied its rule regarding independent state grounds in federal habeas.but even if ake applies here,it does coleman no good because the virginia supreme court relied on an independent state procedural rule.id.the supreme court,then,does not find the mere reservation of discretion to review for plain error in exceptional circumstances sufficient to constitute an application of federal law.
all in all,we think it is clear that knuckles,an unpublished decision of this court,can not provide persuasive authority to support a finding that the ohio supreme court did not rely on an independent state procedural ground in disposing of scott challenge to the trial court instruction on jury unanimity.
id.at.scott also noted that harris reed,d specifically instructed state courts that by its very definition,the adequate and independent state ground doctrine requires the federal court to honor a state holding that is a sufficient basis for the state court judgment,even when the state court also relies on federal law.scott,at quoting harris,at.citations omitted.the ohio appellate court in this case invoked the procedural bar imposed by defense counsel failure to lodge a contemporaneous objection sufficiently to preclude federal court review of this claim on habeas.
remaining claims 
gulertekin remaining claims on habeas are also procedurally defaulted,in that she failed to raise them before the state courts.her first claim alleges ineffective assistance of counsel,for defense counsel alleged failure to retain or consult with medical experts.while gulertekin petition for relief made a general claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,it did not include facts or argument concerning this theory.at any rate,the state courts denied this petition,which did specifically allege her third and fourth claims on habeas the government alleged violation of the vienna convention on consular relations and prosecutorial misconduct,without reaching the merits,because it was filed late.in her briefs to this court,gulertekin does not revisit the imposition of this procedural bar,but proceeds to argue that she can show cause and prejudice therefor.
cause and prejudice 
gulertekin contends that she can show cause and prejudice because any procedural default associated with her habeas claims is the result of ineffective assistance of counsel.
ineffective assistance of to consult medical experts 
in this claim on habeas,gulertekin asserts that her trial counsel was ineffective in that he did not employ a medical expert to investigate patrick lape medical records and to refute the state expert testimony.because this claim was not presented to the state courts on direct appeal or in her proceedings,it is ba
