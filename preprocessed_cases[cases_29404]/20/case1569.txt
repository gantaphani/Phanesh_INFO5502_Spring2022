this is a case about missed deadlines.at times,they go unnoticed,but sometimes the lapse is fatal.this case presents one of the fatal variety.petitioner keith bowles failed to receive timely notice of the district court ruling that triggered his appeal period.when he did receive notice,he correctly sought relief under fed.a.when the district court granted his requested relief but mistakenly offered an erroneous deadline,bowles chose it and failed to comply with the deadline of february.this court on motion declined to dismiss his appeal.today,we correct that error and hold that the period of rule a of the federal rules of appellate procedure is not susceptible to extension through mistake,courtesy,or grace.
on august,keith bowles,richard hayden,damon anderson,and jamal russell drove from cleveland to fairport harbor,ohio to see a performance at a bar called hellbusters.the group left the bar early in the morning and drove to nearby painesville to attend an party at the argonne arms apartment complex.on their way to the party,they passed a bar called nino,outside of which they saw hayden cousin,marcus moore,in some physical distress.later,after rendezvousing with moore,they learned from him that he had been jumped and beaten by a group of men from painesville including antonio rymmer.
bowles,hayden,anderson,and russell agreed to search for rymmer at the argonne arms and extract their revenge.when they found rymmer,and he was armed,the group decided to delay their plan.soon after,the group happened upon the victim,ollie gipson.gipson appeared as if he might be armed and,when it became clear that he was not,bowles,hayden,and anderson beat him.the final,deadly,blows were administered by hayden after bowles had returned to the car.gipson died the next day as a result of his injuries.bowles was indicted on september,for his part in the beating on a charge of felonious assault in violation of ohio revised code,and murder in violation of b.
in the trial court,bowles moved for dismissal,arguing that ohio revised code had created two categories of murder in contravention of the fourteenth amendment.see const.amend.xiv.the court denied the motion and held that the supreme court has never held unconstitutional the individual states ability to enact statutes.see lockett ohio,d holding t hat states have authority to make aiders and abettors equally responsible,as a matter of law,with principals,or to enact statutes is beyond constitutional challenge.on march,an ohio jury entered a verdict of guilty on a single count of murder and sentenced bowles to serve an indefinite term of imprisonment of fifteen years to life in an ohio correctional facility.
bowles appealed his case to both the court of appeals and supreme court of ohio.both denied him relief.see ohio bowles,wl ohio.may.the statute of limitations for federal habeas began running when the certiorari period ended.see abela martin,cir d allowing a statute of limitations on filing from the day a state conviction becomes final.
on september,bowles filed his federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus.the case was referred to a magistrate judge,who,on may,issued a report and recommendation that the petition be denied.bowles filed a lengthy objection to the magistrate judge report,but united states district judge nugent,on july,adopted the findings in a short memorandum opinion,additionally denying the petitioner a certificate of appealability pursuant to c.the order was docketed on july.
on august,bowles moved for a new trial under rule or to amend the judgment under rule,objecting to the adoption of the magistrate judge report without,he argued,de novo review of the findings.see.the motion was denied on september,the date of the final,appealable order in this case.accordingly,a timely notice of appeal would have been entered,at the latest,by october.see fed.a a giving thirty days to appeal a final judgment.however,instead of filing his notice,bowles,remained silent for days.all possible avenues of appeal closed during this period,save one.only fed.a allows a party to timely file a notice of appeal days after judgment.see fed.a requiring a notice of appeal to be filed within thirty days of judgment fed.a granting thirty days for appeal after the disposal of some motions including those under.fed.a extending time an additional thirty days for excusable neglect or good cause.
on december,bowles moved to reopen the appeal period pursuant to rule a of the federal rules of appellate procedure.bowles claimed that the order of september,in contravention of the rules,was never served by the court and that he was unaware of the order until december,when he obtained a docket sheet.see.d directing that i mmediately upon the entry of an order or judgment the clerk shall serve a notice.the parties do not dispute the lack of notice,but bowles blames the error on the court while the warden claims that bowles was at fault for failing to comply with the requirements imposed by electronic filing.regardless,bowles contention apparently had district court granted his motion on february.at this point,the district court inexplicably erred in miscalculating and then stating the date for the notice of appeal.in its marginal order,citing rule a,the court denied the motion to vacate but granted the motion to reopen,giving bowles until february to file his notice of appeal.by its explicit terms,the rule allows for only a extension.a timely appeal thus was required to have been filed by february.however,bowles filed his notice of appeal on february,timely under the judge order,but clearly not in compliance with the rule.
on march,this court issued a order,questioning the late filing of the appeal.bowles filed a response and on april,a motions panel of this court discharged the order and dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction as it applies to the july,judgment and the september,order.but,the order continued,t he appeal was timely filed as it applies to the february,ruling.on september,construing the appeal as an application for a certificate of appealability under fed.b,this court denied a certificate of appealability and bowles promptly petitioned for a rehearing.his motion for reconsideration was entirely concerned with the merits of his habeas petition denied by the district court.on december,perhaps unaware of the procedural disposition of the appeal,a different motions panel of this court granted bowles motion for reconsideration and granted in part and denied in part a certificate of appealability on some of the constitutional issues of the case.the order,which makes no mention of timeliness,states 
w e grant a certificate of appealability on the following issues whether bowles was denied a fair trial and his constitutional rights under the fifth,sixth,and fourteenth amendments by the prosecution questions to him on about the fact that he did not make a statement to the police and by the prosecutor comments regarding his failure to volunteer a statement to the police.
respondent warden argues that lack of subject matter jurisdiction prevents us from hearing the merits of this appeal and that the jurisdictional scope of this appeal should be limited to the marginal order of february,reopening the time for filing an appeal.petitioner does not offer any argument relating to the jurisdictional problem presented.however,even if the respondent had overlooked this issue,the federal rules of civil procedure make it incumbent upon this court to dismiss any action when it appears that the court lacks jurisdiction.h janis ashcroft,cir see also friends of crystal river epa,cir applying de novo review to questions of subject matter jurisdiction.
the federal rules of appellate procedure define the applicable deadlines in the courts of appeals.fed.a see rules are consistent with acts of congress.see also b rules shall not abridge,enlarge or modify any substantive right.all laws in conflict with such rules shall be of no further force or effect after such rules have taken effect.when properly informed of the judgment,a party has thirty days to file a notice of appeal.fed.a a.a limited extension of the time to file may also be granted upon a party motion under rule a.see zack united states,cir.where,as in this case,a party claims that he failed to receive notice of a judgment,rule a allows the district court to extend the time afforded to file a notice of appeal 
reopening the time to file an appeal.the district court may reopen the time to file an appeal for a period of days after the date when its order to reopen is entered,but only if all the following conditions are satisfied 
a the motion is filed within days after the judgment or order is entered or within days after the moving party receives notice of the entry,whichever is earlier 
b the court finds that the moving party was entitled to notice of the entry of the judgment or order sought to be appealed but did not receive the notice from the district court or any party within days after entry and 
c the court finds that no party would be prejudiced.
fed.a emphasis added.the appellate rules underscore the exclusivity of the a remedy by explicitly excluding it from the blanket rule regarding extension of other appellate time prescriptions,for good cause,the court may extend the time prescribed by these rules b ut the court may not extend the time to file a notice of appeal except as authorized in rule.fed.b see rhoden campbell,cir.
petitioner moved to reopen pursuant to rule a on december.in accordance with the rules,the motion was filed within seven days of december,the date on which petitioner received notice of the final judgment.this is also earlier than days after the judgment,march.finally,december is not within days of the entry of judgment,september.on february,the motion was granted and a marginal order reopened the period for appeal,extending it until february.however,according to the rule,the new appeal period can only extend fourteen days after the date when the order is entered.since the order was entered on the,the rule outermost deadline would have been february.see fed.a computing time.petitioner filed his notice of appeal on february,inside of the deadline stated in the order,but outside of the rule deadline.
rule a has been interpreted as both mandatory and jurisdictional by the supreme court and this circuit.see browder,of corrs.of illinois,d in re sulzer orthopedics knee prosthesis prods.liab,cir peake first nat.bank and trust of marquette,cir oja dep t of army,noting that it is beyond cavil that a is mandatory and jurisdictional.
other circuits have described rule a limited opportunity to reopen the time for appeal as one that balances the inequity of foreclosing appeals by parties who do not receive actual notice of a dispositive order against the need to protect the finality of judgments.see vencor,standard life and acc.ins,cir describing the rule as limited and exclusive.
according to the notes of the advisory committee on appellate rules,the purpose of the amendment was to provide a limited opportunity for relief in circumstances where the notice of entry of a judgment or order,required to be mailed by the clerk pursuant to.d,is either not received by a party or is received so late as to impair the opportunity to file a timely notice of appeal 
zimmer louis,zimmer,cir.see also in re stein,cir quoting identical language.the tenth circuit has found that the essence of the rule is finality of judgment.clark lavallie,cir.the clark court,like the other circuits to have considered the issue,found the limitation in the rule to be specific and unequivocal id.at.see vencor,at servants of paraclete does,cir see also wright,miller cooper,federal practice and procedure jurisdiction at rule a provides the exclusive means for extending appeal time for failure to learn that judgment has been entered.once the period has expired,a district court can not rely on the practice of vacating the judgment and reentering the same judgment in order to create a new appeal period.while application of that concept infrequently may work misfortune,it is an overriding principle which demands enforcement.clark,at.moreover,nothing within rule a indicates it is permissive or that its limitations may be waived for equitable reasons.id.at referring specifically to the limit.
counseling a contrary and more liberal interpretation of the rule is a line of supreme court cases employing an equitable interpretation of appeals time limits,starting with harris truck lines,cherry meat packers,d per curiam.in harris,the judgment of the trial court became final while the lead member of the litigation team was on vacation in mexico.id.at.the trial counsel in the united states was without direction about whether or not an appeal should be filed,so he moved for an extension to the regular limit for filing a notice of appeal pursuant to then.a,now fed.a a ii,allowing an extension where that party shows either excusable neglect or good cause.id.at.the motion was granted,an extra two weeks prescribed,and the notice of appeal was timely filed.ibid.on appeal,however,the seventh circuit held that the movant had not met the statutory standard under rule for excusable neglect based on a failure of a party to learn of the entry of the judgment,and that jurisdiction was thus lacking.harris truck lines,cherry meat packers,cir quoting.a.the supreme court reversed,noting the obvious great hardship to a party who relies upon the trial judge finding,and held that these decisions should be given great deference.at.harris closing language contains a phrase that has come to identify this line of cases whatever the proper result as an initial matter on the facts here,the record contains a showing of unique circumstances sufficient that the court of appeals ought not to have disturbed the motion judge ruling.ibid.emphasis added.thus,in harris,all action was within the relevant time limits.the only quarrel was over the effect of a possibly mistaken substantive ruling on which counsel relied.
harris was soon followed by thompson ins,d per curiam.in thompson,the trial court explicitly accepted,and the government did not object to,the timeliness of a motion for a new trial that was actually two days late.id.at.the motion was denied and a notice of appeal was filed that was timely with respect to the most recent motion,but not as to the original judgment.ibid.the court of appeals dismissed the notice as untimely.thompson ins,cir at.the supreme court,however,relying on harris,supra,reversed 
the instant cause fits squarely within the letter and spirit of harris.here,as there,petitioner did an act which,if properly done,postponed the deadline for the filing of his appeal.here,as there,the district court concluded that the act had been properly done.here,as there,the petitioner relied on the statement of the district court and filed the appeal within the assumedly new deadline but beyond the old deadline.and here,as there,the court of appeals concluded that the district court had erred and dismissed the appeal.accordingly,in view of these unique circumstances,we remand the case to be heard on the merits.
thompson,at.quoting harris,at.emphasis added,citation omitted.four justices dissented in thompson,finding that it was not analogous to harris.speaking through justice clark,they noted that the court in thompson,unlike the court in harris had no jurisdiction to pass upon the untimely motions,ten days having already elapsed.id.at.further,they accused the majority of extending harris into a context where excusable neglect is neither mentioned nor alleged,making the standard of unique circumstances meaningless.ibid.accord,wolfsohn hankin,d per curiam extending time to move for a rehearing where extension was granted within the statutory deadline.
the most recent,and only subsequent,decision to discuss thompson is osterneck ernst whinney,d.there,the court held that a postjudgment motion for prejudgment interest is a motion under.to alter or amend the judgment,and that it operates with fed.a to vitiate any notice of appeal filed while the motion is pending.id.at.even though the litigants claimed that the district court had led them to believe that their notice of appeal,made during the pendency of their rule motion,was timely,the court refused to apply thompson to
