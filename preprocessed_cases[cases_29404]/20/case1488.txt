on september,perry leonard was shot to death while sitting in his chevrolet suburban on bessemore street in detroit.three days after the shooting,a witness identified oyd mccray in a as the gunman.detroit police arrested mccray and charged him with murder,see.comp.laws,and with possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony,see id.
at mccray trial,eric perrin,the witness who identified mccray,testified that he was driving on bessemore street sometime after when he saw a brown chevrolet suburban truck stopped in the middle of the street blocking traffic.ja.he observed a man standing by the driver side window of the vehicle talking to the driver.about ten minutes later,perrin testified,a blue car pulled up to the suburban.the driver exited the car,put his arm across the roof and looked toward the guy in the suburban and then when he did that,the man standing by the driver side window of the suburban started shooting the guy in the suburban through the open window,just jerking the gun into the driver of the truck.ja.perrin described the gun as a silver,handgun.
in the midst of the shooting,perrin continued,the suburban began moving,veered left,jumped the curb and crashed into a house,and all the while the shooter kept firing the gun,running alongside the vehicle.ja.perrin estimated that the shooter fired off anywhere from five to ten shots.ja.he next saw the shooter enter the blue car,and,fearing that he had seen more than what he should have,perrin got out of there.ja.
at a three days later,perrin fingered mccray as the shooter.at trial,perrin admitted that he had not noticed mccray beard as profoundly at the time of the incident as he did in the,ja,but concluded that mccray was in fact the person he saw shoot and kill leonard.
the state second witness,dartrell effinger,testified that he was the driver of the blue car that pulled up to the suburban.he observed mccray,whom he had known for a l ong time,ja,talking to leonard,the driver of the suburban.he got out of his car,greeted leonard,then heard gunfire.he could not see mccray hand because it was inside the driver side window of the suburban.after hearing gun shots,effinger returned to his car and drove away.he denied that mccray and he left the scene together in his car and testified that he did not see perrin car stopped near the suburban during the shooting.on,effinger acknowledged that he had told defense counsel that the shooter might have been mccray brother,stacy,who looked very much like mccray.ja.
a county medical examiner testified that leonard died from massive internal bleeding caused by multiple gunshot wounds and noted that he found bullet tracks in leonard body.ja.the prosecution called several detroit police officers,who testified that leonard was lying in the suburban with blood spattered about the vehicle,ja,and that the vehicle had bullet holes in the passenger door.police tested the suburban for fingerprints but did not recover any.
mccray put on two witnesses,one of whom undermined his defense.herbert sanders,the attorney whom the court had appointed to ensure fairness at the suspect,acknowledged that perrin was eventually able to identify mccray as the shooter.ja.evelyn ross,who lived in the home struck by leonard suburban,testified that she did not see effinger or perrin car at the time of the shooting.
the jury found mccray guilty on both charges.the court sentenced mccray to life in prison without the possibility of parole for the murder conviction and to two years in prison for the firearm conviction to be served concurrently with the life term.
on direct appeal,mccray argued that his trial counsel had been ineffective because he had not contacted several potential witnesses.the michigan court of appeals affirmed mccray convictions,see people mccray,wl.june,per curiam the michigan supreme court denied leave to appeal,see people mccray,and the united states supreme court denied mccray certiorari petition,see mccray michigan,d.
mccray collaterally attacked his convictions,filing a motion in the trial court for relief from judgment.among the issues mccray raised was his trial attorney failure to track down potential witnesses.the trial court denied the motion,see people mccray,and the michigan appellate courts denied leave to appeal,see people mccray,people mccray.
mccray filed a second motion for relief from judgment,arguing that newly discovered evidence entitled him to a new trial.the new evidence consisted of two from effinger expressing doubt that mccray was the shooter,the other from jermaine hunter claiming he had spoken to effinger about the crime when the two were incarcerated together.effinger,says hunter,told him that mccray was not the shooter and that he had named mccray as the shooter to spare himself and his own brother jail time.the trial court denied mccray motion.see people mccray.the michigan court of appeals dismissed mccray appeal as untimely,observing that,even if mccray had filed a timely appeal,it would have denied the motion because mccray could have discovered the proffered evidence before he filed his initial motion for relief from judgment.people mccray.mccray did not seek leave to appeal to the michigan supreme court.
mccray turned to federal court for relief in september,filing a pro se habeas petition that raised three issues insufficient evidence to support the conviction,a violation when the trial court refused to allow sanders to testify about what perrin said during the and new evidence of mccray innocence.
the state filed a motion for summary judgment,contending that mccray claim was.mccray opposed the state motion and,in support,attached affidavits from five individuals including himself supporting the argument that he did not murder leonard.following an evidentiary hearing,the district court denied the state motion,concluding that mccray had made a colorable showing of actual innocence.ja.the district court granted mccray an evidentiary hearing on his claim,after which it granted the writ.
the parties do not dispute the basics for resolving this appeal.the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa not only imposes stringent limits on our authority to second guess a state court legal and factual determinations in a criminal case,see d,d williams taylor,d,but it also imposes a statute of limitations on bringing such claims,see d.mccray did not satisfy this requirement when he filed his federal petition in september,nearly five years after the supreme court declined to grant direct review of his case.see mccray br.at.under the doctrine of equitable tolling,we have authority to excuse habeas claims in appropriate circumstances.souter jones,cir.one form of equitable tolling that we have recognized is a claim of actual innocence.see id.at.
in determining whether an applicant has met the requirements for establishing a cognizable claim of actual innocence,we apply the same standard developed in schlup delo,d,for reviewing a federal habeas applicant procedurally defaulted claim.souter,at.under the schlup standard,as adopted in souter,the petitioner must show that it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.schlup,at.see id.at.t he standard requires the district court to make a probabilistic determination about what reasonable,properly instructed jurors would do.thus,a petitioner does not meet the threshold requirement unless he persuades the district court that,in light of the new evidence,no juror,acting reasonably,would have voted to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.see also souter,at.t o be credible a gateway claim requires new reliable it be exculpatory scientific evidence,trustworthy eyewitness accounts,or critical physical was not presented at trial.house bell,d internal quotation marks omitted.we must consider all the evidence,old and new,incriminating and exculpatory,without regard to whether it would necessarily be admitted under rules of admissibility that would govern at trial.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
the parties do not dispute these legal principles they just disagree about their application.the key question is whether mccray new evidence,together with the evidence presented at trial,establishes that it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.schlup,at.in our view,it does not,and accordingly his habeas claim must be rejected as.
mccray relied on the following evidence in the district court in attempting to meet the standard.one,in an affidavit,mccray said that he was not on bessemore street when the shooting occurred and that he was not clean shaven on the day of the crime,ja,or when he was arrested.during the evidentiary hearing,he also testified that he was over at his sister house when the murder occurred.ja.he also claimed that effinger visited him in jail and told him that it was anthony jones who shot tommy leonard,but effinger said it was mccray at trial because he did want to be charged with accessory to murder for helping tony get away.ja.
two,in an affidavit,stacy mccray the petitioner brother said that he was shooting dice on bessemore street on the day of the murder.he saw tommy pull up in a truck,then saw a man named tony go over to the driver side of the truck.ja.stacy mccray also observed a guy named trell dartrell effinger pull his car on the side of the truck and then heard gun shots.id.he ran for cover but came back out to watch tony run and get into the car with trell.id.he stated that he did not see his brother oyd at the scene of the shooting.during the evidentiary hearing,stacy mccray explained that tony was anthony jones and that jones also went by the name ja.he also testified that he ran into perrin at oyd mccray trial and that perrin told him that he might have mistaken him for his brother,oyd.
three,in an affidavit,derrick ross,who lived in the house hit by leonard suburban,said that he was sitting in his house on bessemore street when he heard a loud crash,something had hit his house and when he ran outside to see what it was,the suspect he saw running from the truck was not oyd mccray.ja.when mccray subpoenaed ross to testify at the evidentiary hearing,he did not show up.
four,in an affidavit,ferrie rice mccray aunt said that she heard gunshots while she was watching television in her house on bessemore street.after the shooting stopped,she looked out her front window and saw anthony jones running to dartrell effing er car.ja.rice stated that she never saw her nephew oyd mccray out there during any of this.ja.at the evidentiary hearing,rice testified that she saw a dark blue car cruising up and down bessemore street on the day of the shooting,ja,but could not recall the statements in her affidavit about seeing someone running to effinger car,and instead testified that when she looked out her window after the shooting she saw someone dressed in black run across the field near the crime scene.ja.
five,in an affidavit,demarlo gilbert a fellow prisoner recounted a conversation he had with mccray while the two men were in prison.according to gilbert,mccray told him that he lived near bessemore street and gilbert responded that the last time he was over there he almost got shot by some guy they call ja.he explained that in february or march,whose real name was anthony jones,had shot this guy in the truck and one of the bullets almost hit him.ja.gilbert claimed that he saw go over to the truck and a guy named trell pulled on the side of the truck and that when the shooting started.ja.he ran to the side of the house but came out when the shooting stopped and saw get into a car with trell and drive away.ja.gilbert testified to the same effect at the evidentiary hearing.
six,cynthia bacon mccray sister testified that she and her brother were sharing a car on the day of the shooting and that she drove that car to work.when she got home,her brother was at her house and he agreed to watch her children while she and her husband went to the store.while they were shopping,her husband pager went off,alerting them that there had been an emergency.they returned to the house to find mccray standing in the doorway.bacon said another sibling informed her that there had been a shooting on bessemore.ja.
seven,at the evidentiary hearing,dartrell effinger recanted his trial testimony identifying mccray as the shooter,claiming instead that mccray was not the person standing beside leonard truck at the time of the shooting,and that he could identify the perpetrator.ja.he claimed that police threatened to charge him with leonard murder and revoke his probation if he did not admit to police that mccray killed leonard and sign a statement to that effect,ja,and that the prosecutor told him to s tick with the statement at trial,ja.
eight,jermaine hunter a fellow inmate of effinger testified that while he and effinger were incarcerated together,effinger told him that he and anthony jones had pinned the murder on mccray to get effinger brother out of prison.on hunter acknowledged that effinger might have shared this information with him because hunter knew that effinger had testified against mccray at trial and effinger did not want to be pegged as a rat because he had the image that he hated rats.ja.
while mccray presents the testimony of many individuals to support his claim of innocence,he has not presented sufficient evidence to satisfy the schlup standard.the sheer quantity of this evidence,in short,is not matched by its quality.
oyd mccray affidavit and testimony that he was not on bessemore street at the time of the murder adds little in the way of quality to his claim.a reasonable juror surely could discount his own testimony in support of his own cause.see riggins norris,cir noting that court is certainly entitled to disbelieve defendant testimony cuppett duckworth,cir w e have repeatedly held that statements by a defendant that his conviction was constitutionally infirm are insufficient to overcome the presumption of regularity accorded state convictions.
a reasonable juror also could conclude that the testimony of three of the other his brother,bacon his sister,rice his aunt would not alter the verdict.not only did they,as family members,have a personal stake in exonerating mccray,see bosley cain,cir,but they did not see the murder and have not provided a good explanation for why they took so long to come forward with evidence that their relation stands wrongly accused of murder.see,ja rice admitting she made no effort to contact mccray lawyer and just waited for someone to contact her ja stacy mccray testifying that he tried unsuccessfully to contact his brother attorney t hree or four times,but that he never called the prosecutor and that when police came to question him he did not tell them he thought he had seen the killer ja bacon testifying that she tried to talk to mccray attorney but did not attempt to speak to police or prosecutors.
most critically,of the eight witnesses presented in support of mccray application,seven of and his three relatives as well as ross,gilbert and that they did not see the shooting.all of them save mccray say only that they witnessed the aftermath of the shooting or heard about it from others.this deficiency makes it impossible for these witnesses to refute the only disinterested eyewitness testimony that the jury testimony of perrin,who watched the crime unfold and who identified mccray as the murderer.the only challenge to perrin eyewitness account remains his impression that the perpetrator was,see ja,an initial impression that did not preclude him from being confi
