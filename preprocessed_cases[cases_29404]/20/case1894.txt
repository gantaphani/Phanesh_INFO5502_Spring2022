this appeal presents issues concerning postconviction relief.the petitioner was convicted in the federal district court for the northern district of indiana in on his plea of guilty to having participated in a conspiracy to launder money in an illegal gambling business.a a i,h.we affirmed his conviction and his sentence of months in prison in united states febus,cir.in,while serving his sentence in a federal prison in the southern district of indiana,he filed a motion in the northern district of indiana under and to set aside his conviction.the motion was filed some months after the conviction had become final and therefore months after the expiration of the statute of limitations for filing a section motion.the district court in the northern district therefore dismissed the section motion as untimely,although it did not enter the dismissal on a piece of paper separate from its opinion,as.requires.the court transferred the petitioner section petition to the federal district court for the southern district of indiana,because such a petition must be filed in the district in which the petitioner is confined rather than in the one in which he was sentenced.rumsfeld padilla,d.that court denied the petition on the ground that the petitioner had had a remedy in the sense of a route to obtaining relief under section in the northern district of indiana that was not inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention,which is a condition of a federal prisoner being allowed to file a petition for habeas corpus under section.
the remedy created by section is a substitute for habeas corpus for federal prisoners section backs it up.congress may have been anxious that without such a backstop section might be thought an illicit attempt to suspend habeas corpus,in re davenport,cir,though if this was its motive its anxiety was misplaced.habeas corpus as a postconviction remedy is not the type of habeas corpus to which article i,of the constitution was referring when it provided that congress can suspend the writ only in times of invasion or rebellion.lindh murphy,cir en banc,reversed on other grounds,d benefiel davis,cir taylor gilkey,cir henry friendly,is innocence irrelevant collateral attack on criminal convictions,chi.over the years,congress has authorized a much broader use of habeas corpus but curtailing an optional statutory enlargement does not violate the suspension clause.that would create an irrational ratchet.habeas corpus could always be enlarged,but once enlarged could not be returned to its previous,less generous scope without a constitutional amendment.once this was understood,there would be few if any further enlargements.laguerre reno,cir.
habeas corpus as a procedure for postconviction relief is a different animal from habeas corpus as a remedy against executive or military detention,merely sharing a name with it.in felker turpin,d,it is true,the supreme court assumed that the suspension clause is applicable to habeas corpus as a postconviction remedy see also swain pressley,d in re dorsainvil,cir triestman united states,cir,but it did not decide the question and we are confident that should it ever do so it will reject the application of the suspension clause.otherwise congress would have the power to entrench a habeas corpus statute against repeal an expansion of habeas corpus could be rescinded only by amending the suspension clause,just as if the expansion had been by constitutional amendment.since congress can not amend the constitution,the ratchet would be not merely irrational but unconstitutional it would bypass the procedure specified in article v for amending the constitution.that is not to say that a decision by congress to eliminate all postconviction remedies could not be challenged.but the proper route would be the due process clauses rather than the suspension clause,which limits a much more ominous form of congressional action than curtailing collateral attack on criminal executive or military detention,bypassing all courts altogether.
the petitioner appeal is from the judgment in the southern district of indiana turning down his section petition.but it asks us also to decide whether he is entitled to relief under section as well,even though the district court in the southern district did not rule on that issue.the court in the northern district had dismissed his section motion and the court in the southern district had no authority to consider it.only the court in the district in which the movant was sentenced,here the northern district,has such authority.
the petitioner argues that to require a petitioner in a dual case to appeal separately from the denial of each of the two petitions technically,one petition and one motion raises the hideous spectre of piecemeal appeals.that is a frivolous argument in a case such as this in which the two petitions should have been filed in separate districts and thus ruled on separately and if denied given rise to separate appeals.the only reason they were conjoined was that the petitioner did realize that he could file a habeas corpus petition in the district in which he had been sentenced because he was not confined there.his mistake does not entitle him to appeal from the dismissal more than days later,fed.a b and without his ever having filed a notice of appeal in the district court that had rendered the decision he wants to appeal.bowles russell,d varhol national railroad passenger,cir en banc per curiam.
lest we raise false hopes,we point out that although the district court in the northern district did not enter a rule judgment order dismissing the section motion,the petitioner can not now appeal the dismissal by filing a notice of appeal in that district court and then invoking the rule that if no rule judgment order has been entered the party can postpone appealing from a final judgment until it is entered.b a.that route is barred to our petitioner by the next subsection of rule,which provides an outer limit to appeal of days from when the final judgment is entered on the district court docket.b b see committee notes to amendments to rule charles wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure,at.that deadline expired more than a year ago.so long a delay two and a half years would doubtless bar the appeal under the doctrine of laches,pruitt city of chicago,cir see teamsters employers welfare trust of illinois gorman.ready mix,cir white daniel,cir,even if there were no limit.
all this is on the assumption that the dismissal of the petitioner section motion was final despite the absence of a rule judgment order.it was.nothing in the section proceeding remained for decision by the district court the court was through with it,which is the meaning of finality for purposes of determining appealability.chase manhattan mortgage moore,cir moreau harris county,cir.the fact that a separate petition for habeas corpus under section transferred rather than terminated is irrelevant.it is irrelevant not only because the two actions should never have been joined,but also because relinquishing jurisdiction over a part of a case to another court or to an agency does not affect the finality of the dismissal of the rest of the case.an example is a case in which a district court dismisses the federal claim that conferred jurisdiction on the court but relinquishes the plaintiff supplemental claim to the state courts.ross ex rel.ross board of education,cir disher information resources,cir erie county retirees ass county of erie,cir.
so the petitioner can not challenge the denial of his section motion in this court.we therefore can not reach the merits of his claim that the district court should have excused,under the doctrine of equitable tolling,his failure to have filed his section motion until months after the deadline for filing it.gildon bowen,cir green united states,cir.
all this would be of no moment if the petitioner section action habeas corpus had merit,but it does not.he can not show that his section remedy was inadequate or ineffective.a prisoner can not be permitted to lever his way into section by making his section remedy inadequate,here by failing to ap
