the state of ohio,through warden arthur tate,appeals from the district court order granting david mapes a conditional writ of habeas corpus unless the ohio courts review his sentence within days.for the following reasons,we affirm.
the facts of this case are fully reported in our previous decision in mapes coyle,cir mapes i,and are only briefly recounted here.mapes was convicted of aggravated murder in the shooting death of john allen during a robbery at allen bar in cleveland,ohio.because mapes had previously been convicted of a murder in new jersey,the ohio murder conviction made him eligible for the death penalty.at the sentencing phase of mapes trial,the jury heard evidence regarding seven statutory aggravating and mitigating factors.the only mitigating evidence mapes submitted was an unsworn statement that he was only years old at the time of the new jersey murder,that the conviction was really for manslaughter in light of the sentence he received,and that he was not responsible for the actual shooting.
to prepare the jury for its sentencing deliberations,the trial court gave several instructions,only two of which are in issue.first,the court instructed the jurors that they could not consider giving mapes a life sentence unless they first unanimously rejected the death penalty.id.at.second,the jurors were told that they were not permitted to consider mitigating evidence related to mapes prior murder conviction.id.at.mapes counsel objected to both of these instructions.
the jury recommended that mapes be sentenced to death.after the jury announced its verdict,the trial judge polled each of the jurors,asking them,i s this your verdict id.at.juror june chatman responded by saying,it to me,it the state verdict.id.inquiring further,the trial judge asked whether chatman had signed the verdict form.she answered,yes,i did.id.the trial court stated that chatman answer was sufficient.mapes counsel objected to this holding and requested that the jury be allowed to continue its deliberations.the trial judge refused this request.
mapes filed a direct appeal in the ohio court of appeals.his counsel brought assignments of error,of which pertained to the guilt phase of the trial.id.at.in his only sentencing argument,mapes alleged that,by commenting on the fact that his mitigation statement was unsworn,the prosecutor had infringed on mapes fifth amendment right to remain silent.appellate counsel did not raise,in the state appellate court,any of the three sentencing issues that are currently the subject of mapes habeas corpus petition.mapes conviction and death sentence were affirmed on direct appeal,state mapes,ohio,and his petition for state relief was denied,state mapes,ohio.
mapes filed a habeas corpus petition in federal district court alleging assignments of constitutional error.the only claim credited by the district court was that mapes had received ineffective assistance of appellate counsel by virtue of counsel failure to argue on direct appeal that the trial court had impermissibly precluded the jury from considering mitigating factors related to mapes new jersey murder conviction.the district court agreed and granted mapes petition,vacating his death sentence unless ohio courts provided another review within days.ohio timely appealed the district court order.
a divided panel of this court reversed in part and remanded to the district court for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether mapes appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the following four issues that the jury was not allowed to consider mitigating evidence relating to mapes prior murder conviction,hereinafter referred to as the eddings claim that the jury was erroneously required to unanimously reject the death penalty before considering a life sentence,hereinafter referred to as the claim that juror chatman gave an equivocal response during polling,hereinafter referred to as the unanimity claim and that trial counsel had been constitutionally ineffective.mapes i,at.
on remand,the case was referred to a magistrate judge who conducted an evidentiary hearing and concluded that mapes appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the eddings claim,the claim,and the unanimity claim.by agreement of the parties,the magistrate judge reserved judgment on the fourth issue,the claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.the district court adopted the magistrate judge recommendation and granted mapes petition for a writ of habeas corpus,vacating his sentence of death unless the ohio courts granted another review of mapes sentence within days.ohio appeals the district court order and mapes,claiming that,rather than a new appeal,the proper remedy is to vacate his death sentence.
because a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel raises mixed questions of law and fact,we review the district court ruling on such a claim de novo.united states jackson,cir.any findings of fact pertinent to the ineffective assistance of counsel inquiry are subject to a clearly erroneous standard of review.id.
mapes argues that he did not receive the effective assistance of appellate counsel because his appellate counsel failed to raise the following three issues on appeal the eddings claim the claim and the unanimity claim.a fourth assistance of trial reserved by agreement of the parties.mapes maintains that the district court correctly found that these issues were significant and obvious and that appellate counsel did not have a strategy in omitting these issues from his direct appeal.
ohio claims that the issues omitted by mapes appellate counsel were not significant and obvious because jurists,attorneys,and even mapes own expert disagreed about whether the claims were viable.ohio also points out that mapes bears the burden of establishing ineffective assistance of counsel and that the district court impermissibly shifted this burden to the state by holding that appellate counsel failure to recall an appellate strategy was evidence of deficient performance.ohio argues that the failure to recall an appellate strategy does not overcome the presumption that appellate counsel performed satisfactorily.
a defendant is entitled to the effective assistance of counsel in his first appeal of right.joshua dewitt,cir.appellate counsel performance is judged under the same standard for evaluating trial counsel performance found in strickland washington,d.smith jago,cir see also bowen foltz,cir.to establish ineffective assistance of counsel,it must be shown that counsel performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense so as to render the trial unfair and the result unreliable.strickland,at.the scrutiny of counsel performance is highly deferential and counsel is strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.id.at.nevertheless,a reviewing court must ensure that counsel acted reasonably under all the circumstances.id.at.
we consider the following factors in determining whether an attorney on direct appeal performed reasonably competently 
were the omitted issues significant and obvious 
was there arguably contrary authority on the omitted issues 
were the omitted issues clearly stronger than those presented 
were the omitted issues objected to at trial 
were the trial court rulings subject to deference on appeal 
did appellate counsel testify in a collateral proceeding as to his appeal strategy and,if so,were the justifications reasonable 
what was appellate counsel level of experience and expertise 
did the petitioner and appellate counsel meet and go over possible issues 
is there evidence that counsel reviewed all the facts 
were the omitted issues dealt with in other assignments of error 
was the decision to omit an issue an unreasonable one which only an incompetent attorney would adopt 
mapes i,at citing cases.the foregoing list is not exhaustive and is not intended to produce a correct score.id.at.
at his trial,mapes was charged with a specification alleging that he had previously been convicted of an offense,an essential element of which was the purposeful kill
