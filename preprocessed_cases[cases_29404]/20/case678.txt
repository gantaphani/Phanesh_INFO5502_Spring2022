philmingo jamison was sentenced to five to ten years imprisonment after pleading guilty to two separate criminal cases involving drug offenses.after unsuccessfully challenging his conviction in state courts,jamison filed a pro se petition for habeas corpus under in which he challenged the voluntariness of his guilty plea.the magistrate judge to whom the petition was referred issued a thorough report and recommendation recommending that habeas relief be granted.that judge concluded that jamison plea was not knowing,voluntary and intelligent because jamison was not advised of the mandatory term of imprisonment that his guilty plea subjected him to under pennsylvania indeterminate sentencing scheme.the district court rejected the recommendation,and denied the petition because no supreme court precedent specifically requires that defendants be informed of the terms of an applicable mandatory minimum sentence before pleading guilty.the district court thus concluded that the state courts rejection of jamison claim was neither contrary to,nor an unreasonable application of,supreme court precedent.
for the reasons that follow,we will reverse.
factual and procedural background.
in september,jamison was charged in two separate cases one charged him with possession of cocaine and marijuana with intent to deliver,and the other charged him with possession of marijuana,driving without a license,and reckless endangerment.prior to trial,the prosecutor offered jamison the opportunity to plead guilty in exchange for a sentence of years.pursuant to the advice of counsel,jamison rejected that plea offer.
however,jamison eventually decided to enter an open guilty plea without executing any formal plea agreement.thereafter,the commonwealth completed a form wherein the prosecutor wrote that the government would nevertheless still recommend years w mand.
on july,the trial court conducted a change of plea hearing which began with the prosecutor stating 
jamison has filled out a guilty plea colloquy.it is going to be a straight plea with a,other than the fact that we will run the recklessly endangering case concurrent with the drug case.he is facing a sentence by judge kennedy on a homicide,and we have no agreement as to whether these cases are concurrent or consecutive.of course,we are going to ask for them to be consecutive,and we will be filing mandatory on the drug case 
no other statements were made at the hearing regarding the mandatory minimum sentence,or the length of the sentence jamison would be required to serve under state law as a result of the applicable mandatory minimum sentence.moreover,other than the aforementioned reference to filing mandatory,jamison was never informed that his plea required the judge to impose a sentence of imprisonment.on the contrary,during the hearing,the court told jamison that because there was no agreement with the commonwealth,sentencing is basically up to the court.the judge asked jamison if he understood that sentencing was basically up to the court,and jamison affirmed that he did.the court then accepted jamison guilty plea.in doing so,the court implicitly found that jamison was entering the plea knowingly,voluntarily,and intelligently.
jamison also filled out and signed a written guilty plea colloquy.in that colloquy,jamison acknowledged only that he was facing a maximum term of years imprisonment pursuant to his plea.
six days after jamison entered the plea,the commonwealth sent a letter to both jamison and defense counsel.the letter stated in part 
based on your guilty plea to an offense at a wherein the controlled substance,cocaine,totaled grams,a mandatory minimum sentence of years,and fine must be imposed,years and if second or subsequent offense 
on august,jamison returned to the state trial court for a sentencing hearing.the prosecutor noted at the hearing that jamison had a juvenile record for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute,and that he was therefore subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of years imprisonment and a fine.the court then informed jamison that he had a right to make any statement that he care d to make,but that he was not required to make any statement if he did not choose to speak jamison responded that he had nothing to say.the court then sentenced him to not less than five nor more than ten years for the cocaine conviction and imposed a fine of.the court also imposed a concurrent sentence of not less than two,nor more than four years for the marijuana charge.the sentences were consecutive to any sentence that was imposed on the conviction for homicide.
state court decisions.
on june,jamison filed a pro se petition under the pennsylvania relief act pcra in which he challenged inter alia,the validity of his guilty plea.counsel was thereafter appointed,and a hearing was conducted.at that pcra hearing,jamison testified that prior to his guilty plea,he was not informed by anyone that his guilty plea subjected him to a mandatory minimum sentence,much less a mandatory minimum sentence of five years and fine.jamison further testified that when the prosecutor stated at the change of plea colloquy that she would be filing a mandatory on the drug case,he did not know what she was referencing.jamison maintained that he did not know he was facing a mandatory minimum sentence of five years.as far as she said,a mandatory,and that was it.i did know what mandatory would be filed.i did know i was subject to a mandatory minimum of five years and fine due to my second offense.jamison testified that he would not have entered an open guilty plea if he had known that he would have to serve at least five years in prison as a result.
jamison pcra testimony was confirmed by his trial counsel,harold fitzkee,who had been the york county district attorney before returning to private practice.he testified that he never told jamison that jamison would have to serve at least five years in prison if he pled guilty.fitzkee explained that he advised jamison to enter an open guilty plea because,based on his knowledge of jamison prior record,he thought jamison would be better off with the court determining the sentence than accepting the four to eight years that the prosecutor was offering.fitzkee also testified that he first learned that jamison was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of five years at the sentencing hearing,after jamison plea had already been accepted by the court.fitzkee swore he never received the letter from the prosecutor stating that a mandatory minimum of five years in prison applied and he never discussed the mandatory with jamison.
the pcra court ruled that jamison could not establish that his guilty plea was constitutionally infirm.the court first concluded that,as a matter of state law,the prosecutor statement that the commonwealth would be filing a mandatory on the drug case and the writing that the commonwealth would recommend a sentence of yrs w mand were sufficient notice to inform jamison of the commonwealth intent to seek a mandatory minimum sentence.the court also concluded that even if notice was insufficient,the guilty plea was nevertheless valid because jamison knew that he had no agreements regarding sentencing,and that the maximum sentence for his crimes was years imprisonment and a fine of.the pcra court concluded that this knowledge,and the fact that jamison was sentenced to a term less than that year maximum sentence,was sufficient for a knowing,voluntary and intelligent guilty plea.the superior court affirmed the pcra court denial of relief on different grounds without discussing the pcra court opinion.the superior court held that jamison could not obtain relief because he did not plead actual innocence as required under state law.see.a iii.
proceedings in the district court.
jamison then filed a pro se habeas petition under,challenging the voluntariness of his guilty plea.jamison petition was referred to a magistrate judge who held a hearing.during that hearing,jamison testified that,prior to pleading guilty,he was not aware that he was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of five years 
the magistrate judge appropriately analyzed jamison claim under the deferential standard required by the and effective death penalty act aedpa.under aedpa,a federal habeas court can not grant relief after a state court has rejected the petitioner claim on the merits unless the state court decision was contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established supreme court precedent.d the magistrate judge concluded that although no supreme court case precisely held that a defendant must be informed of an applicable mandatory minimum sentence in order for a guilty plea to survive constitutional scrutiny,jamison claim for relief was nevertheless clearly governed by the supreme court decision in boykin alabama,d.
the magistrate judge ruled that the state courts had unreasonably applied boykin in concluding that jamison plea was based on a knowing,voluntary and intelligent waiver of his constitutional rights.the magistrate judge concluded that jamison plea was not knowing,voluntary and intelligent because jamison was not given adequate notice of the five year mandatory minimum sentence he was subject to before he decided to plead guilty.the court reasoned that a mandatory minimum sentence is an important circumstance that a defendant should be aware of and take into consideration in determining whether to plead guilty.the magistrate judge also found that neither the statement by the prosecutor at the change of plea hearing that the commonwealth would file a mandatory on the drug case,nor the statement that the commonwealth would recommend yrs were sufficient to inform jamison that he would have to be imprisoned for at least five years if he pled guilty.
as noted at the outset,the district court rejected the magistrate judge recommendation.that decision was based on the fact that no supreme court case has precisely held that a defendant must be informed of the applicable mandatory minimum sentence and the state court decisions were not contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law.
this appeal followed 
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the and effective death penalty act,d,provides that 
an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
thus,jamison can not obtain relief in federal court unless the state court decisions denying relief were contrary to clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.jamison contends that his guilty plea was not knowing and intelligent because he was not told that he was subject to a mandatory minimum prison sentence of five years prior to pleading guilty.
we conclude that jamison claim is governed by boykin alabama,d and its progeny just as the magistrate judge ruled.there,the supreme court held that courts may not accept a guilty plea without first determining,on the record,that the guilty plea was the result of a knowing,and intelligent act done with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences.the court explained 
w hat is at stake for an accused facing death or imprisonment demands the utmost solicitude of which courts are capable in canvassing the matter with the accused to make sure he has a full understanding of what the plea connotes and of its consequence.when the judge discharges that function,he leaves a record adequate for any review that may be later sought.
id.at.see also brady united states,d.
in boykin,the trial court accepted the defendant guilty plea to robbery without asking the defendant any questions regarding the plea or the defendant understanding of the consequences of pleading guilty.on appeal,the supreme court reasoned that since a guilty plea constitutes a waiver of several fundamental rights,the validity of the waiver can not be presumed from a silent record.boykin,at.the court noted 
a majority of criminal convictions are obtained after a guilty plea.if these convictions are to be insulated from attack,the trial court is best advised to conduct an on the record examination of the defendant which should include,inter alia,an attempt to satisfy itself that the defendant understands the nature of the charges,his right to a jury trial,the acts sufficient to constitute the offenses for which he is charged and the permissible range of sentences.
the supreme court reaffirmed boykin in brady united states.there,the court stated that w aivers of constitutional rights must be knowing,intelligent acts done with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences.at.similarly,in henderson morgan,d,the court invalidated a defendant guilty plea because he was not informed that the intent to cause death was an element of the offense to which he pleaded guilty.in doing so,the court reiterated that a defendant must be informed of the consequences of his plea.at.white,concurring citing to boykin.
here,without discussing the impact of boykin or any of its progeny,the district court concluded that jamison claim was not governed by any clearly established federal law because no supreme court case has specifically held that a defendant must be informed of a mandatory minimum sentence prior to pleading guilty.however,that view of the aedpa standard of review is myopic and constrained.
aedpa standard of deferential review is clearly forged from a respectful balance of the limitations imposed by considerations of comity on the one hand,and a recognition of the crucial role of federal courts under our ordered system of liberty on the other.in her concurring opinion in williams taylor,justice explained 
when federal judges exercise their jurisdiction under the judicial power of article iii of the constitution,it is emphatically the province and duty of those judges to say what the law is.marbury madison,cranch.at the core of this power is the federal courts independent from its coequal branches in the federal government,and independent from the separate authority of the several interpret federal law.a construction of aedpa that would require the federal courts to cede this authority to the courts of the states would be inconsistent with the practice that federal judges have traditionally followed in discharging their duties under article iii of the constitution.if congress had intended to require such an important change in the exercise of our jurisdiction,we believe it would have spoken with much greater clarity than is found in the text of aedpa.
if we were to uphold the district court view of how precisely a supreme court decision must resolve a given issue under aedpa,only supreme court holdings arising from the identical presentation of a given legal issue would constitute clearly established law.this would collapse the dual unreasonable application of and contrary to prongs of d into a single inquiry.if clearly established means the supreme court must have previously addressed the identical presentation of a given issue,any state court decision that does not follow that holding would necessarily be one that is contrary to that supreme court decision.
moreover,we have never interpreted the standard of review in to suggest that congress intended habeas review to turn on whether the supreme court had previously decided an issue in a case involving a fact pattern that is identical to the facts underlying a habeas petitioner claim for federal relief.for instance,in resolving claims of ineffective assistance of counsel,we have not applied aedpa in a manner that suggests that its deferential standard of review turns on whether the supreme court has considered the precise act or omission alleged to constitute deficient performance of counsel under the sixth amendment.see moore morton,cir.supreme court precedent counsels that the reviewing court must examine the prosecutor offensive actions in context and in light of the entire trial,assessing the severity of the conduct,the effect of the curative instructions,and the quantum of evidence against the defendant.internal citations omitted.
thus,despite the seemingly limitless combinations of acts and omissions that could give rise to a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,the quality of counsel representation is measured by the standard set forth in strickland washington,d,and its progeny.see,florida nixon,d applying strickland to a claim that defense counsel failure to obtain defendant express consent to a strategy of conceding guilt at the guilt phase of capital trial constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel williams taylor,d finding that strickland constitutes clearly established law to decide petitioner claim that his lawyer failed to investigate and to present substantial mitigating evidence to jury in death penalty claims hill lockhart,d strickland constitutes established law in deciding petitioner claim that his lawyer provided ineffective assistance of counsel for guilty plea.
thus,we have never required the kind of precision and exactitude endemic in the district court application of aedpa.boykin,no less than strickland,is established supreme court precedent,and both cases set forth controlling principles.strickland proclaims that the sixth amendment affords an accused a right to effective assistance of counsel and holds that the right is violated when a defendant is prejudiced by counsel deficient performance.boykin affirms that the constitutional rights that are relinquished by a guilty plea can not be waived unless the waiver is knowing,voluntary,and intelligent.as we have already noted,the court has explained that the boykin inquiry demands the utmost solicitude of courts to ensure that the defendant has a full understanding of what the plea connotes and of its consequences.boykin,at.
thus,absent a record adequate to determine that a guilty plea is a knowing,voluntary and intelligent waiver,a reviewing court can not conclude that the guilty plea complied with constitutional safeguards.id.at.accordingly,just as we do not look beyond strickland and its progeny for established federal law in sixth amendment challenges to assistance of counsel,we need look no farther than boykin,and its progeny to find clearly established federal law here.jamison challenge to his guilty plea goes to the heart of the principle that was clearly established in boykin,brady,and henderson.
iii.application.
thus,we must determine if the state courts rejection of jamison claim was either contrary to boykin,or an unreasonable application of its requirement that a guilty plea be a knowing,voluntary and intelligent act,undertaken with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences.see boykin,at.
a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law when it is diametrically different,opposite in character or nature,or mutually opposed to a holding of the supreme court of the united states.williams taylor,at.citation omitted.this happens when the state court ignores or misapprehends clear precedent and when it confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of the supreme court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from supreme court precedent.id.the supreme court has held that the state court need not even be aware of our precedents,so long as neither the reasoning nor the result of the decision contradicts them.mitchell esparza,d per curiam quoting williams taylor,at.
in matteo,we explained that an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court precedent encompasses the following three distinct scenarios 
the state court extends supreme court precedent to cover a new factual context in which application of the precedent is unreasonable the state court unreasonably fails to apply a precedent in a factual context that warrants its application or the state court applies the correct precedent,but unreasonably in light of the facts of the case before it.of course,all three scenarios require a definition of unreasonable in the fourth circuit view,the habeas court must inquire whether the state courts have decided the question by interpreting or applying the relevant precedent in a manner that reasonable jurists would all agree is reasonable.
matteo,at citing green french,cir.
here,the state courts did not ignore or misapprehend boykin,because they clearly understood that guilty pleas must be knowing,intelligent and voluntary.moreover,as the district court noted,no supreme court case expressly mandates that defendants be informed of mandatory minimum sentences before tendering a guilty plea.however,the state courts did unreasonably fail to apply boykin in a factual context that warrants its application,and therefore those courts unreasonably applied that clearly established supreme court precedent.
the pennsylvania courts ruled that jamison was aware of the statutory maximum and knew that the prosecutor would file a mandatory.they therefore concluded that jamison plea was therefore knowing,voluntary and intelligent.as noted earlier,at the guilty plea hearing,the prosecutor stated that the commonwealth would be filing a mandatory in the drug case,and the commonwealth stated in writing that it planned to seek a sentence of years.the state courts concluded that this was sufficient notice of the mandatory minimum to allow for a valid guilty plea.before discussing why this was an unreasonable application of boykin,and its progeny,we must first explain the sentencing scheme in pennsylvania,as it differs dramatically from the more familiar federal scheme.pennsylvania employs an indeterminate sentencing scheme.commonwealth kleinicke.pursuant to that scheme,when a sentencing court imposes a sentence of imprisonment,it must impose both a minimum term of imprisonment and a maximum term.id.see also.a.the minimum period of incarceration must not exceed one half the maximum.b,once the defendant completes the minimum term of incarceration,it is up to the parole board to determine when and if will be released before serving the maximum sentence imposed by the court thus,the length of the defendant incarceration is not known at the moment of sentencing because the defendant may ultimately serve only the minimum,the maximum or any sentence between the two.kleinicke,at.statutes imposing mandatory minimum sentences such as the one jamison was subject to only limit the sentencing court discretion as to the minimum term,not as to the maximum term,which must always be set by the legislature.see,setting maximum terms for felony,misdemeanor and summary offenses.
although jamison was informed of the maximum sentence that his plea subjected him to,nothing on this record establishes that anything he was told by the prosecutor or the court either separately or cumulatively provided jamison with sufficient information about the mandatory minimum sentence his plea exposed him to.we realize,of course,that the exact length of any mandatory minimum sentence may depend on facts that are not known when a defendant changes plea.here,for example,it was not clear at the change of plea hearing whether jamison faced a three year mandatory minimum sentence,or a five year mandatory minimum.as is frequently the case,that could not be determined until a subsequent sentencing hearing.however,it was known that a finding of guilt would expose him to a mandatory minimum sentence of either three or five years depending on his prior record,and he was never informed of that.thus,when the trial court accepted jamison plea,jamison had not been told that he would have to receive a sentence of at least three years imprisonment,and that he would have to serve at least five years if he had a prior conviction for a controlled substance.
the prosecutor statement,filing mandatory,was far too opaque a reference to inform jamison that he may
