the district court granted william cabrera petition,pursuant to,for a writ of habeas corpus as to convictions in the circuit court of cook county,illinois,for burglary,robbery,and murder.the state appeals.
the present petition concerns convictions in,as a result of which cabrera received sentences of years imprisonment for murder and years each for robbery and burglary,the latter two reduced to years by the illinois appellate court.people cabrera,d.all sentences run concurrently.in addition,cabrera is serving a natural life sentence for an unrelated murder conviction.because of the separate murder conviction,the relief in this case was conditioned on the invalidation of the other,presumptively lawful,sentences authorizing his continued confinement.
the evidence at trial showed that on the night of february,the office of the assyrian national foundation in chicago was broken into,money was stolen,and yoel keena,a year old man staying as a guest at the foundation,was killed by strangulation and battery with a blunt instrument.at the crime scene,detectives found a receipt for traveler checks issued in keena name.later,the detectives learned that the checks were used to purchase clothing at a store in chicago the next day.they questioned derrick moore,the assistant sales manager of the store,and learned that three men had come into the store at about on february.a man later identified as ruben lopez,using keena traveler checks,purchased a red jacket,a white shirt with a popeye logo,and a necktie.moore saw the men go into another store and emerge with more merchandise.on february,moore looked through police mug shots and identified a photograph of cabrera as one of the men with lopez when he cashed the check.the police arrested cabrera at his home without a warrant,and a search of his home at the time of his arrest came up dry.cabrera waived his miranda rights,however,and gave a series of contradictory statements.
with the consent of his mother and sister,the police searched lopez apartment,where a shirt with a popeye logo was found.they also found an identification card that moore the fellow from the store said lopez used in cashing the traveler checks.later the red jacket was found as well.
on february cabrera made another statement,telling the detectives that he and lopez had entered the foundation through a broken window.lopez told cabrera to search the front of the building.cabrera found a metal cash box,which he pried open.he took the which was in the box.while cabrera was in the front office,lopez went to the back,where he found keena.cabrera saw lopez strike keena twice.cabrera then searched keena pockets,where he found the traveler checks.lopez took the checks and cabrera kept the.after making this statement,cabrera consented to a search of his apartment,where the police found two pairs of pants lopez had bought for him.cabrera was convicted of murder,robbery,and burglary.
after exhausting his state court remedies,cabrera filed the present petition,which included the two claims before us whether probable cause existed for cabrera warrantless arrest which led to several incriminating statements and whether the prosecution proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he was guilty of burglary.the illinois courts found that probable cause existed for the arrest and that the evidence supported the burglary conviction.as we said,the district court conditionally granted the writ.
section d,as amended by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa under which this petition was brought,provides that habeas relief may not be granted unless the state court proceeding 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
however,cabrera claim regarding his arrest faces a preliminary hurdle.fourth amendment claims are subject to the strictures set out in stone powell,d.and those claims,we have recently said,are outside the scope of the statute 
the aedpa changes to d apply only to cases within the scope of a and stone is based on an interpretation of a that treats inaccurate administration of the exclusionary rule as outside the scope of that statute.
hampton wyant,cir.
stone limited the role of the federal courts in evaluating fourth amendment claims of state prisoners who,relying on the exclusionary rule,contend that allegedly unconstitutionally seized evidence should not have been used against them.the court noted that the exclusionary rule,whose purpose is deterrence of illegal police conduct,actually hampers the central purpose of a criminal trial,which is determining the guilt or innocence of a defendant.the court reasoned that in the context of habeas petitions,the benefit of the exclusionary rule is minimal compared to the substantial societal costs of applying it.therefore,where the state has provided an opportunity for full and fair litigation of a fourth amendment claim,a state prisoner may not be granted federal habeas corpus relief on the ground that evidence obtained in an unconstitutional search or seizure was introduced at his trial.at.it sounds simple but has,in fact,caused considerable consternation over what exactly full and fair means the only help in stone is a footnote to a prior case townsend sain,d.and of course the value,generally,of citations is often only revealed in the eye of the beholder.
recently,we have waded again into the debate in an attempt to clarify some of our earlier cases.our traditional formulation was that a petitioner had a full and fair opportunity to litigate if 
he has clearly informed the state court of the factual basis for that claim and has argued that those facts constitute a violation of his fourth amendment rights and the state court has carefully and thoroughly analyzed the facts and applied the proper constitutional case law to the facts.
pierson,cir.this test spawned many arguments,including one that the litigation was full and fair only if the state court decided the issue correctly.this erroneous interpretation of stone was pretty clearly sent packing by our decision last year in hampton.in hampton we observed that the pierson approach nullifies the holding of stone and leads to collateral relief whenever the search violates the fourth amendment.even an egregious error would not by itself justify habeas relief 
a blunder,no matter how obvious,matters only in conjunction with other circumstances that imply refusal by the state judiciary to take seriously its obligation to adjudicate claims under the fourth amendment.
unsatisfied by this formulation,the state wants us to take this opportunity to further clarify the standard.the concern is that hampton focus continues to be on the quality of the hearing.the state says that a focus on the quality of the hearing can not be what stone envisioned rather,the exception must turn on whether the state provides a mechanism under which to litigate a fourth amendment claim.if it does,stone precludes habeas review.
unlike the state,we do not read hampton as implying federal courts must examine in any significant detail the quality of the hearing.quality,after all,is a word which can lead us right back to confusion as to whether the state judge had to arrive at the right decision in order for the hearing to pass muster.but it is true that hampton stops just short of what the state urges.hampton means that even if the state provides a mechanism under which to litigate a claim,stone would not block habeas review if the mechanism was in some way a sham.for instance,stone would not block habeas review if the judge had his mind closed to the necessity of a hearing,or was bribed,or decided,as hampton says,that probable cause is not required in illinois,or was sleepwalking another example from hampton,or in some other obvious way subverted the hearing.hampton does not mean,however,that federal courts will examine whether the judge seemed to have done some quality preparation for the
