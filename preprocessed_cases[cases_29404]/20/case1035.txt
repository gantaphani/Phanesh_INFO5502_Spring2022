federal habeas petitioner felix rocha confessed to the murder of rafael security guard found shot to death outside the houston nightclub where he later pled not guilty and proceeded to trial.texas indictments charged both rocha and a,virgilio maldonado,with capital murder,though each defendant was tried separately.a jury convicted rocha and on its answer to the sentencing questions he was sentenced to death.state courts affirmed the conviction and sentence on direct review.over the course of the next eight years,rocha filed four state habeas applications and one federal habeas petition.all failed.the federal district court denied relief but held an evidentiary hearing and granted rocha a certificate of appealability coa on his claim under brady maryland,a claim we now examine.before this court rocha also renews his request for a coa on two additional questions whether he is entitled to review on the merits of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim under wiggins smith and whether the state violated an right under the vienna convention by failing to inform rocha that he was entitled,as a mexican citizen,to contact his country consulate.we affirm the district court,deny relief on rocha brady claim,and deny rocha request for a coa on his claim under the vienna convention.we also hold that rocha was not entitled to have a federal court review the merits of his wiggins claim,but we grant his request for a coa on that question.
rocha federal petition is subject to the heightened standard of review set out in the and effective death penalty act aedpa.in the review of state proceedings,aedpa proscribes federal habeas relief unless the state court adjudication on the merits resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based upon an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.a state court decision is contrary to clearly established precedent if the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in the supreme court cases.a decision will also be contrary to clearly established precedent if the state court confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of the supreme court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from supreme court precedent.a decision involves an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent if the state court identifies the correct governing legal rule from the court cases but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular state prisoner case.aedpa requires us to presume findings of fact to be correct unless the petitioner rebuts that presumption by clear and convincing evidence.we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo,applying the same standards to the state court decision as did the district court.
after the state courts affirmed his conviction on direct and habeas review,rocha learned that one of the officers who had testified at his trial,jaime escalante,had a disciplinary record and was romantically involved with the sister of the lone eyewitness,reynaldo muñoz.now on federal habeas,he says the state suppressed this information in violation of brady maryland rocha claims he would have used the information to impeach the trial testimony of both officer escalante and eyewitness muñoz.the district court,as we have noted,denied relief but granted a coa.we affirm the district court denial of habeas relief because the information was immaterial to the jury decision to convict.
a successful brady claim has three elements the evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused,either because it is exculpatory,or because it is impeaching that evidence must have been suppressed by the state,either willfully or inadvertently and prejudice must have ensued.rocha procedurally defaulted on this claim by failing to present it in any of his four state habeas petitions so in federal court he must demonstrate cause and prejudice to qualify for habeas relief,unless failure to do so would result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice when a habeas petitioner brings a brady claim,the cause and prejudice requirements of the procedural default doctrine parallel the last two elements of the alleged constitutional violation itself that is,a petitioner shows cause when the reason for his failure to develop facts in proceedings was the state suppression of the relevant evidence,while prejudice exists when the suppressed evidence is material for brady purposes on appeal,we assume without deciding both that the asserted evidence is at least nominally favorable to rocha and that the state suppressed the evidence.our focus here is on materiality.
the parties do not dispute the relevant facts.at rocha,conducted separately from maldonado eyewitness muñoz testified that he was checking on some pool tables he owned at the nightclub when he saw two taller,and one fuentes,the eventual victim.the taller of the two men lifted his arms as if to permit a frisk.according to muñoz,the shorter man then pointed a gun at fuentes before demanding and reaching for fuentes own holstered firearm.muñoz fled the scene without seeing what happened next.he did,however,hear two or three gunshots as he ran.at rocha trial,muñoz identified maldonado as the taller man who had approached fuentes the night of the murder.muñoz never pinned the murder on rocha,saying only that his physical features fit the description of the shorter man.
but the state case against rocha did not rise and fall on eyewitness had confessed.the prosecution sought to lay a foundation for this confession through the testimony of officer escalante and a second police officer,xavier avila.escalante began by testifying that after the shooting he made the scene at the nightclub.there he interviewed five or six witnesses.from then on he took charge of investigating leads and following up on things he learned during that initial visit.
escalante testimony continued with no arrests made nearly a year and a half after the murder,police arrested rocha and maldonado on unrelated bank robbery and capital murder charges.two days later,officers escalante and avila went to see rocha and maldonado in detention,suspecting that the attempted bank robbers also had something to do with the fuentes murder.their hunch seemed to bear fruit rocha made an uncounseled waiver of his miranda rights with both officers present but requested that they come back the next day,at which time he would allow them to record his statement.
when the officers returned,they split up avila interviewed rocha escalante took maldonado.after about fifteen to thirty minutes,maldonado confessed to the murder and implicated rocha.this success in hand,escalante interrupted avila interview with up to this point had been share the news.he presented an audio recording of maldonado confession and prompted avila to use a particular segment as a tool to speed rocha interview along.avila,working alone,resumed his questioning of rocha,eventually making an audio recording of rocha full confession escalante took no direct part in rocha interview.
escalante trial testimony then turned to his interactions with eyewitness muñoz.he explained that he first met muñoz during the investigation and that in november he showed muñoz two photo spreads,neither depicting maldonado or rocha.muñoz did not identify anyone on the two spreads,noting only that two photos looked like the taller man.much later,in,escalante again showed muñoz a series of time with maldonado photograph included.muñoz identified maldonado as the taller of the two men who had approached fuentes.
officer avila trial testimony confirmed escalante account of their initial visit to rocha.avila testified in greater detail,answering questions regarding rocha mental state,physical,and apparent ability to understand his waiver of miranda rights.he then stepped the jury through his interrogation of rocha.
on federal habeas review,the district court held an evidentiary hearing before rejecting rocha brady claim muñoz,escalante,and others were deposed.in his deposition,escalante disclosed,for the first time,that he had freelanced for the owner of the the fuentes investigation and that their relationship had turned romantic by the time of rocha trial.he testified that their professional relationship began sometime after the murder when medeles hired him as an apparent for her area businesses.only later did the relationship blossom into something more.in seeming contrast to his trial testimony,escalante also downplayed the level of his involvement in the fuentes murder investigation,claiming,for example,that he did not recall taking part in the initial crime scene investigation at all.rather,he said his involvement began when the detectives handling the case asked him,months after the murder,to contact eyewitness muñoz through employer and,as it turns out,muñoz sister 
what happened,avila could get ahold of him,and he told me,hey,tell maria that we need to talk to her brother,show him a photo spread,and i said,well,give me the photo spread so i can show it to him.maria tracked him down.
in his deposition,escalante reiterated that he had first met muñoz during the investigation and that he had seen muñoz only three or four times.escalante said he could not stand muñoz and that medeles and muñoz were not close,emphasizing that the siblings were related by adoption only.consistent with testimony adduced at trial,escalante confirmed that he had not been present for rocha confession but had provided avila with the audio recording of maldonado statement.in his federal petition,rocha concedes escalante is vague on when his relationship with medeles began but asserts that at a minimum escalante knew medeles well enough in to use her to find her brother during the investigation.
escalante also admitted that he had been disciplined for running two background checks on medeles and three on her son at their request,and that he had retrieved the case number for a case involving the theft of items from medeles car.in response to these actions,the department suspended him for six days in for unauthorized usage of police computer systems.it is not entirely clear when the department investigation began,but escalante first gave a statement on the subject in september rocha november trial.
adding to this milieu,rocha rests his brady claim in part on the deposition testimony of andres reza,a former police officer who is currently serving a prison sentence on an unrelated conviction for kidnapping medeles and holding her for ransom.based on reza testimony,rocha claims that the police department internal affairs division had long investigated escalante activities and that the prosecution failed to disclose evidence of the following escalante suspected involvement in the murder of a colombian victim his suspected involvement in the drug trade a dea investigation into his alleged drug activities his suspected use of local cantinas in distributing drugs his suspected involvement with a colombian network and his suspected involvement in underage prostitution at the cantinas.notably,rocha provides no corroboration for these allegations.nor does he assign dates to any of the alleged incidents or investigations,explaining only that escalante disciplinary history spanned years and included seven sustained complaints.for its part,the state identifies three internal department misconduct complaints filed prior to rocha trial,but the record admits no further detail.
unless suppressed evidence is material for brady purposes,its suppression does not give rise to sufficient prejudice to overcome a procedural default.t he materiality standard for brady claims is met when the favorable evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.where,as here,there are a number of potential brady violations,a court must analyze whether the cumulative effect of all such evidence suppressed by the government raises a reasonable probability that its disclosure would have produced a different result.
the materiality of brady material depends almost entirely on the value of the evidence relative to the other evidence mustered by the state.undisclosed evidence that is merely cumulative of other evidence is not material,while the impeached testimony of a witness whose account is strongly corroborated by additional evidence supporting a guilty verdict generally is not found to be material either conversely,a brady violation is more likely to occur when the impeaching evidence would seriously undermine the testimony of a key witness on an essential issue or there is no strong corroboration.
the record,read liberally in rocha favor,indicates that escalante had a professional and romantic relationship with medeles by the time of rocha trial that because of this relationship escalante at least knew of medeles brother,eyewitness muñoz that escalante saw muñoz three or four times over the course of the subsequent investigation and that his relationship with muñoz was neither close nor particularly amicable.it is also undisputed that escalante was the subject of three sustained misconduct complaints prior to rocha trial.
rocha contends that the state failure to disclose this alleged impeachment evidence tainted the testimony of both escalante and muñoz.we can not say that he is entirely credibility,for one,is strained to say the least.yet,even if the undisclosed evidence tends to impeach all of escalante testimony,that testimony was merely duplicative of officer avila.while escalante went beyond avila in stating he had made the scene at the nightclub where the murder took place,interviewed five or six witnesses at the scene,and witnessed muñoz initial identification of maldonado as the taller man,the prosecution primarily relied on escalante to lay a foundation for rocha confession.on that score,it was provided the meaningful detail about rocha confession he was the one,after all,who actually questioned rocha.the remainder of escalante testimony was largely irrelevant to the state case.and at any rate rocha does not now contend that his full confession was anything but knowing and voluntary,so neither officer testimony is particularly relevant in demonstrating rocha guilt.
muñoz testimony also withstands rocha scrutiny,especially given the minimal impeachment value of the triangle.escalante romanced medeles escalante found muñoz through medeles a few years after the murder escalante presented a series of photographs and muñoz identified maldonado,rocha and muñoz later attested to that identification,adding only that rocha fit the description of the short man present moments before fuentes murder.without more,this no doubt not compelling impeachment.as the district court reasoned,muñoz s relationship to medeles does not establish that muñoz had any motive to lie about rocha or anything else in this case or had any reason to frame rocha or otherwise lie about who committed the murder.
a motive to lie or to frame is particularly difficult to fathom in light of the actual substance of muñoz testimony,which reached rocha guilt tangentially at most.muñoz merely related that rocha resembled the shorter man seen at the nightclub the night of fuentes murder,and the balance of his escalante only useful to the prosecution in corroborating the underlying facts of rocha full confession.that confession remains in evidence uncontested,strongly corroborating muñoz supporting testimony and rendering it largely superfluous.
viewed as a whole,the transcript falls far short of undermining confidence in the guilt phase outcome,and the undisclosed evidence is thus immaterial for brady purposes.
rocha also requests a coa to address two additional issues,first,a ineffective assistance of counsel claim,and second,a charge that the state violated his rights under the vienna convention.the district court rejected his request in full.
under aedpa,a is a necessary predicate to our full issue only if the habeas petitioner has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.we will grant a coa only when reasonable jurists could debate whether or,for that matter,agree that the court below should have resolved the claims in a different manner or that this court should encourage the petitioner to further litigate his claims in federal court this requires an overview of the claims in the habeas petition and a general assessment of their merits but not full consideration of the factual or legal bases adduced in support of the claims.
rocha first raised the claim that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective at sentencing by failing to investigate,develop,and present mitigation claim under wiggins the district court as part of his federal habeas petition the court noted that rocha did not raise this claim in state court,making the claim unexhausted.ordinarily,the district court observed,a federal habeas petition that contains unexhausted claims is dismissed without prejudice,allowing the petitioner to return to the state forum to present his unexhausted claims.however,if the court to which a petitioner must present his claims to satisfy the exhaustion requirement would now find the claims procedurally barred,the court need not dismiss his claims to allow exhaustion.the district court concluded that rocha wiggins claim would be procedurally barred in texas court,and that rocha was unable to show cause for or prejudice from a procedural default or that he was actually innocent of capital murder or the death penalty.accordingly,the district court held that rocha wiggins claim was procedurally barred from review in federal court and denied him habeas relief 
with his appeal pending before our court,rocha filed a subsequent state habeas application to exhaust his wiggins claim.rocha also moved stay of the federal appellate proceedings until the texas court of criminal appeals cca ruled on rocha wiggins claim.the cca eventually dismissed rocha claim,after briefly reciting the procedural history,in an unsigned per curiam order 
we have reviewed the application and find that the allegations do not satisfy the requirements of article,section a.therefore,we dismiss this application as an abuse of the writ 
rocha then returned to federal district court and filed a motion to reopen the district court final judgment under federal rule of civil procedure b for further evaluation of his wiggins claim.rocha asserted that the cca had reached the merits of his wiggins claim,thus permitting federal habeas review.rocha also moved for another stay and limited remand in the fifth circuit to allow the district court to consider rocha rule b motion.while rocha motion to stay the proceedings and for limited remand was pending,the district court denied rocha motion for rule b relief and denied rocha application for a coa.the district court denied rocha rule b motion for relief from judgment because it concluded that the cca reliance on a was an independent and adequate state ground,leaving intact its original conclusion that rocha wiggins claim was procedurally barred.
rocha appealed the district court denial of his rule b motion to this court we denied as moot rocha motion to stay the proceedings and for limited remand,and consolidated rocha appeal of the denial of his rule b motion with rocha appeal of the denial of his habeas petition 
rule b authorizes relief from a final judgment,order,or proceeding for any other reason that justifies relief.we have interpreted rule b any other reason language to mean any other reason than those contained in the preceding five enumerated grounds of rule b while rule b is commonly referred to as a grand reservoir of equitable power to do justice,the rule is only invoked in extraordinary circumstances.indeed,this court has repeatedly stated that the decision to grant or deny relief under rule b lies within the sound discretion of the district court and will be reversed only for an abuse of that discretion.
a federal court is precluded from considering a state prisoner habeas petition if the underlying state decision rests on an adequate and independent state ground,such as a state procedural bar we must presume that there is no independent and adequate state ground for a state court decision when the decision fairly appears to rest primarily on federal law,or to be interwoven with federal law.a state court may overcome this presumption by stating clearly and expressly that its decision is based on bona fide separate,adequate,and independent grounds.otherwise,a federal court will accept as the most reasonable explanation that the state court decided the case the way it did because it believed that federal law required it to do so.rocha asserted before the district on the cca dismissal of his application did not unambiguously rest on an independent state ground,and that the federal court accordingly erred by not reviewing the merits of his wiggins claim 
in,a of article of the texas code of criminal procedure,on which the cca dismissal relied,canonized texas abuse of writ doctrine.the provision governs whether texas state courts have the authority to consider new claims raised in a subsequent application for writ of habeas corpus in a case.once a habeas applicant has filed an initial habeas application in state court,a court may not consider the merits of or grant relief based on any new claims brought in a subsequent application unless the application contains sufficient specific facts establishing that 
the current claims and issues have not been and could not have been presented previously in a timely initial application or in a previously considered application filed under this article or article because the factual or legal basis for the claim was unavailable on the date the applicant filed the previous application 
by a preponderance of the evidence,but for a violation of the united states constitution,no rational juror could have found the applicant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt or 
by clear and convincing evidence,but for a violation of the united states constitution no rational juror would have answered in the state favor one or more of the special issues that were submitted to the jury in the applicant trial under article,or 
rocha the cca dismissal specifically relied on a,which,as paraphrased by the cca,permits a subsequent state habeas applicant like rocha to proceed with his claim if he can show to the requisite level of confidence that no rational juror would have answered at least one of the statutory special punishment issues which determine whether capital punishment will be imposed in the state favor.the texas legislature has determined,however,that the state interest in the finality of its judgments justifies the imposition of higher burdens upon the subsequent applicant who did not avail himself of the opportunity and resources available to him in an initial writ to raise his claim.for an applicant who bypassed the opportunity to raise a claim in an initial writ,the requisite level of confidence is clear and convincing evidence 
the state of texas undisputedly has the right to establish the conditions under which it will entertain a subsequent writ.and we have long held that those conditions as enumerated in a normally constitute an adequate and independent procedural bar to federal review,with at least two notable exceptions 
a federal petitioner at the same time may avoid a procedural bar if he can demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law,or demonstrate that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.the miscarriage of justice exception applies where a petitioner is actually innocent of either the offense giving rise to his conviction or actually innocent of the death penalty 
under the supreme court decision in sawyer whitley,a petitioner who claims to be actually innocent of the death penalty to which he has been sentenced must show by clear and convincing evidence that,but for a constitutional error,no reasonable juror would have found the petitioner eligible for the death penalty under the applicable state law.actual innocence is not itself a constitutional claim,but instead a gateway through which a habeas petitioner must pass to have his otherwise barred constitutional claim considered on the merits.
texas largely adopted this federal gateway in crafting its own conditions for subsequent habeas applications.as the cca has explained,t he texas legislature quite obviously intended a,at least in some measure,to mimic the federal doctrine of fundamental miscarriage of justice.apparently intending to codify,more or less,the doctrine found in sawyer whitley.the practical result in nearly all cases will be that the federal and state standards are identical 
texas is not alone in providing exceptions to habeas procedural bars under heightened pleading standards as the third circuit recently recognized,m any states have procedural default rules with similar safety valves for situations in which enforcing the procedural default would work a serious injustice.these rules typically invoke plain error review of alleged constitutional violations or pleading requirements to weed out facially implausible or frivolous claims,in order to mitigate the effects of procedural default the circuits are split on whether these exceptions negate an otherwise independent ground.the first third fourth sixth seventh tenth and eleventh circuits hold that such exceptions do not ordinarily deprive state court rulings of their independent character.the ninth circuit disagrees the eighth has reached inconsistent results and the supreme court teachings are inconclusive but we need not enter this fray because the identity of state and federal law in this case has rendered meaningless any search for an independent and adequate ground.
either a operates as an independent state ground,in which case federal law permits merits review only if the petitioner demonstrates cause and prejudice or actual innocence of the death penalty,or the provision is not independent of federal law,and we apply the standard because state law a that of us.in both cases,rocha must clear the identical hurdle before we can reach the merits of his wiggins claim.texas may exercise its prerogative to establish heightened barriers to subsequent state habeas applications,and the federal courts are obliged to faithfully apply those barriers in federal habeas proceedings as well n othing in the cca perfunctory dismissal of the claims suggests that it went behind sawyer and actually considered or ruled on the merits.it signifies that whether a is characterized as a exception to a state procedural bar or as an exception derived from federal caselaw yet circumscribed by state statute,the threshold review is for actual innocence of the death penalty 
here,rocha can not make the requisite showing under this shared standard.when a claim of actual innocence contests a sentence of death,the habeas petitioner claim must tend to negate not just the jury discretion to impose a death sentence but the petitioner very eligibility for that punishment.that is,a habeas petitioner who is unquestionably eligible for the sentence received can never be actually innocent of the death penalty.this is so because constitutional error that impacted only a jury sentencing discretion is not sufficiently fundamental as to excuse the failure to raise it timely in prior state and federal proceedings.t he actual innocence requirement must,then,focus on those elements that render a defendant eligible for the death penalty,and not on additional mitigating evidence that was prevented from being introduced as a result of a claimed constitutional error.
but that is just the sort of evidence rocha presents here.his wiggins claim reduces to an assertion that mitigating evidence could have influenced the jury discretion in considering a sentence of death he does not argue that this evidence would have rendered him ineligible for the death penalty.a wiggins claim by its operation in this case goes only to a jury discretion in meting out the penalty of death,not a particular defendant eligibility for that punishment 
that said,a caveat is necessary.although the state actual innocence standard as a general rule coincides with the federal standard,uncertainty exists because the cca speculated in ex parte blue that it might permit a subsequent state habeas applicant to proceed under circumstances that would not excuse a federal petitioner under sawyer whitley,specifically circumstances where the applicant faults his counsel failure to develop and present mitigation evidence at sentencing thus,rocha wiggins constitutional vehicle for complaints of inadequate mitigation at very well meet the criteria of a as a matter of state law 
but in the face of this uncertainty,the cca in rocha case was silent,dismissing his subsequent application with a bare citation to a.from this silence we can not discern whether the cca resolved the question left open in ex parte blue,concluded that the state version of actual innocence does in fact permit mitigation evidence to form the basis of such a claim,and then determined on the facts of this case that rocha had nevertheless failed the standard,or whether the court simply reverted to the federal standard.putting aside the low probability that any court would resolve sub rosa an issue it had very recently and explicitly left unanswered,we must at any rate conclude that the cca relied on federal law in making its decision.hitched to the supreme court teachings in sawyer,bare citation to a without more fairly appears to rest primarily on federal law,or to be interwoven with federal law,namely the federal actual innocence standard,and there is no clear and express basis to say otherwise accordingly,we must accept as the most reasonable explanation that the state court decided the case the way it did because it believed that federal law required it to do so.and federal law under sawyer precludes rocha wiggins claim.
seen generally,the district court rocha wiggins claim is of no help to him given the procedural posture of his case and the contours of state correct.however,given balentine and its newly minted reading,reasonable jurists could debate whether rocha wiggins claim fails because a operates as an independent and adequate state ground and rocha can not make the showing of actual innocence of the death penalty that is required to overcome a procedural bar,or his wiggins claim fails because his claim of actual innocence under a fails on the merits.therefore,a coa will issue on this question.as for our broader conclusion,whether state court invocation of a of article of the texas code of criminal procedure or its parts clearly rests a decision upon independent state grounds does not yield to a universal answer.rather,the answer will often turn on contextual and case specific inquiries laid on the federal blanket of michigan long and coleman thompson ever mindful that the state has the right to define the gateways of state habeas of federal review if clearly stated.
lastly,rocha requests a coa to determine whether the state of texas violated his rights under article of the vienna convention and whether such a violation warrants the exclusion of his confession.the state admits that it violated the convention terms rocha is a citizen of fact known to the arresting rocha was never informed of his right to talk to the mexican consulate.for this violation,rocha seeks to suppress his confession.the trial court denied relief,and direct and state habeas review upheld that decision.the federal district court also denied relief,explaining that article did not create rights 
rocha acknowledges we have held that article does not create rights but wants a coa so that he may pursue en banc consideration he points to the supreme court decision in where four,breyer,stevens,and their belief that the vienna convention does create rights without a clear holding from the court,however,our precedent stands and we must decline rocha request for a coa on this issue.
even if we were to take up the subject as a full court,rocha requested of inculpatory unavailable.held that suppression of evidence is not an available remedy where,as here,the vienna convention does not provide that particular remedy,either expressly or implicitly.absent a prescribed remedy,it is not for the federal courts to impose one on the states through lawmaking of their own.and in any event,suppression here would upend the state courts determination that rocha knowingly and voluntarily confessed and did not desire an attorney at that time,whether provided to him by the mexican consulate or not.
we affirm the district court,deny relief on the brady claim,deny a coa on the claim under the vienna convention,and hold that rocha was not entitled to have his wiggins claim considered on the merits but grant a coa on that question.because we are convinced that the issue on which we grant the coa has been fully briefed and squarely addressed at oral argument by able counsel,we will not seek additional briefing.in addition,we instruct the clerk of the court not to issue the mandate in this case until the mandate issues in balentine.
haynes,circuit judge,concurring and dissenting 
i concur in the majority opinion with the exception of section.and the portion of the conclusion reflecting that ruling.i agree that a coa should be granted on this issue,but i respectfully dissent from the majority opinion determination,at this stage,that rocha is not entitled to have a federal court review the merits of his wiggins claim.the majority opinion represents a deft and scholarly approach,but it also represents a novel analysis not fully consonant with this court recent decision in balentine thaler,cir,as well as other decisions of this court.
in balentine,we addressed a case with an almost identical procedural posture and reversed the district court denial of the habeas petitioner rule b motion as an abuse of discretion.we concluded that a texas court of criminal appeals decision denying habeas relief on a successive petition did not rest upon an independent ground because that denial could have been a decision that the facts were previously available and no excuse from presenting the claim earlier adequate and independent state that denial could have been based on a finding that the facts as alleged did not indicate a federal constitutional violation.at.because the basis for the texas court of criminal appeals decision could have rested on a finding that the petitioner failed to allege facts establishing a federal constitutional question of federal constitutional court concluded that balentine was entitled to have a federal court review the merits of his wiggins claim.id.at citing ruiz quarterman,cir.
balentine and ruiz support a reversal of the district court denial of rocha rule b motion in the instant case.here,the texas court of criminal appeals decision rested upon a finding that rocha allegations do not satisfy the requirements of article,section a.under our decisions in balentine and ruiz,the texas court of criminal appeals on a,which incorporates federal constitutional based on the merits of rocha federal constitutional claim rather than an independent ground.balentine,at a ruling that the facts,if established,did not constitute a violation would also be interwoven with federal constitutional law.ruiz,at the boilerplate dismissal by the cca of an application for abuse of the writ is itself uncertain on this point,being unclear whether the cca decision was based on the first element whether the factual or legal basis for the subsequent claim was previously unavailable,a question,or on the second element whether the facts alleged would establish a federal constitutional violation,a question of federal constitutional law.in short,our prior decisions in balentine and ruiz suggest that the texas court of criminal appeals decision in this case was rather than procedural,entitling rocha to federal merits review of his wiggins claim.
the majority opinion does not attempt to reconcile today result with our prior holding in balentine,and it does not fully reconcile this case with ruiz,hughes and rivera instead,the majority opinion instructs the clerk of the court to hold the mandate in this case because a petition for rehearing en banc has been filed in balentine.the majority opinion approach is collegial but contrary to the circuit rule that one panel can not overrule a prior panel decision in the absence of an intervening or superseding decision by the united states supreme court or a decision by this court sitting en banc.burge parish of tammany,cir it is a firm rule of this circuit that in the absence of an intervening contrary or superseding decision by this court sitting en banc or by the united state supreme court,a panel can not overrule a prior panel decision.because this court prior decisions in balentine and ruiz have not been overruled or altered as of this date,we are bound to follow those decisions.
our court jurisprudence in this balentine,ruiz,hughes,and confusion as to the precise language that will be considered to be an independent and adequate state ground in cases where the state court does not elaborate on its reasoning.en banc consideration of balentine perhaps together with this case may very well be appropriate but,as of this time,the court has yet to take that action,and ruiz and balentine remain controlling precedent.in the meantime,at a minimum,it makes little sense to hold the mandate in this case while denying the parties full briefing and possibly further oral argument on this issue.i would,at the very least,allow full briefing by the parties before deciding the merits of the procedural default question and,if appropriate,the merits of the wiggins claim
