an ohio jury convicted rasheem matthews of the murder of wayne price.an eyewitness and a jailhouse informant testified for the prosecution.approximately two weeks after matthews conviction and sentence,both witnesses received favorable plea bargains.according to matthews,the witnesses had agreed to testify in exchange for these favorable pleas,and,therefore,the prosecution should have notified the defense of the preexisting deals.because it failed to do so,matthews argues that the prosecution violated his right to due process under brady maryland,d.the district court agreed and granted matthews a conditional writ of habeas corpus.
as explained infra,matthews procedurally defaulted his claim involving the jailhouse informant,and has failed to show cause for the default.on his claim involving the eyewitness,the state court concluded that there was no preexisting deal,and matthews has not rebutted this factual finding with clear and convincing evidence.accordingly,we reverse.
the magistrate judge report and recommendation and the district court judge opinion set out the facts of this case in sufficient detail.we note only those facts relevant to this appeal.
a cuyahoga county grand jury indicted matthews in for unlawfully and purposely causing the death of price and for a firearm specification.the murder occurred in the early morning hours of october,when price was shot and killed at the housing projects in connection with a drug purchase.theodore roulette testified that he spoke to price at the projects.a few moments later,according to roulette,he saw price facing matthews,heard gunshots fired and observed price holding the lower part of his body as he spun around.roulette also testified that he observed matthews with a gun in his hand.price bled to death from two gunshot wounds.
in march,roulette was incarcerated in the cleveland city jail for theft,where he encountered price brother.after this encounter,roulette went to the cleveland police department and gave a statement that he had witnessed the shooting and named matthews as the shooter.matthews was subsequently arrested.
during matthews trial,the prosecution,led by assistant prosecutor carmen marino,also presented the testimony of charles paxton,a jailhouse informant.paxton testified that he was introduced to matthews by corrections officers while in jail.paxton stated that matthews had confessed to him that he shot price two times because price had been him.matthews purportedly told him that price was not the first man he had killed in cleveland.paxton also testified that matthews told him that he had given drugs to price on credit,but had not been paid.
both roulette and paxton claimed that they received no consideration for their testimony.roulette testified that he had not entered a plea to charges pending against him and he was probably going back to prison.roulette purported reason for testifying was his friendship with price and being a good citizen.paxton testified that he had been told by another inmate not to testify,had been offered money not to testify,and had been threatened by both matthews and some corrections officers once it was learned inside the jail that he was going to be a witness at the trial.paxton claimed that he came forward because he did not think it was right to kill someone and brag about it.
in addition to attacking the credibility of roulette and paxton,matthews offered the testimony of several witnesses.evelyn roulette,roulette wife,testified that roulette had not been in her apartment that evening as he claimed,was a liar,and could not see without his glasses.francis barrett,the man paxton claimed told him not to testify,stated that his cell was next to paxton and he never saw or heard paxton being threatened by matthews or any correction officers.matthews also offered the testimony of a quanita muwwakkil,who originally had also been charged with price murder.muwwakkil testified that she did not know price or matthews nor did she witness any shooting on the evening in question.
during his closing,assistant prosecutor marino addressed defense counsel argument that the two witnesses did have deals for leniency,notwithstanding their testimony to the contrary 
the of witnesses like roulette and paxton saying,well,what happens a year from now when nobody else is around,means to suggest to you that we are going to surreptitiously behind your back stand here and tell you one thing and then lie to you go to somebody else and a say now that the case is over let give this guy a break.you know that not fair really because we live our life as morally as you live yours.we accept your tax money to uphold the public trust.
state matthews,ohio app d,quoting from the trial transcript.
matthews first trial ended in a mistrial when the jury was unable to reach a verdict.a second trial began on august,which resulted in conviction.three days after the conviction,the trial court sentenced matthews to imprisonment of fifteen years to life on the murder charge and three years on the firearm specification,to be served consecutively.
before matthews trial,roulette had been indicted on seven felony charges,unrelated to the above action,in three separate cases for forgery,uttering,grand theft of a motor vehicle,theft with a violence specification,and breaking and entering.on august,ten days after matthews was sentenced,roulette pleaded guilty to lesser included misdemeanors in all three cases,with the approval of assistant prosecutor marino.during the plea proceedings,roulette attorney stated 
the court is well familiar with the facts leading up to this plea bargaining today.your honor,i would just point out that through extensive discussions with marino in the major trial division and the cuyahoga county prosecutor office and detective qualey of the cleveland police homicide unit,it my understanding that without the testimony of my client,the convicted murderer known as laj matthews would not be behind bars today.it my client testimony that put him behind bars.
nothing can excuse roulette prior criminal history or criminal behavior,but one thing remains a fact is that he has risked his own life,the life of his wife,who is in the courtroom today,and the safety of his family so that this murderer was brought to trial and convicted and is currently serving his time.we would ask the court consideration and also ask for an immediate sentencing taking into consideration of the foregoing factors.
roulette received a suspended sentence of six months of incarceration and five years of probation.the court had the following exchange with roulette 
the court let me make one thing real clear.while you benefitted from the plea bargain presently before this court is well known to you,it is well known to the prosecutor office and it is well known to the defense counsel and it well known to this court,but you come back here with a dirty urine,you come back here not having paid this these court costs and that restitution in equal monthly installments,i going to put you in jail you understand me 
the defendant yes,sir.
the court do you have any questions whatsoever 
the defendant quite clear.
the court you drop off the straight and narrow,roulette,and you gone,no matter what happens.
the defendant thank you,your honor.
the court we understand each other 
the defendant quite clear.
the court fine.
when paxton met matthews in the county jail,paxton had already pleaded guilty to separate charges of theft and extortion,felonies.on may,prior to matthews trial,paxton was sentenced to one year in prison in the first case and eighteen months in prison on the second case.the sentences were to run concurrently.
on august,paxton attorney filed a motion to withdraw the guilty pleas in the two cases.he argued that paxton was not properly advised that his guilty pleas would make him a parole violator,thus causing the sentences to be served consecutive to what the parole board imposed.however,in both paxton plea hearing and his sentencing,the court explained that the guilty pleas could be a violation of his parole.
a hearing was held the following day.assistant prosecutor marino appeared on behalf of the prosecution,although he had not been involved in paxton cases prior to that time,and made no objection to the motion.the assistant prosecutor offered amended indictments to the court,one for petty theft and one for coercion,both misdemeanors.paxton pleaded guilty to both charges.before resentencing,paxton attorney stated,your honor,paxton entered guilty pleas to the offenses on may.i would just like the court to take into account the cooperation that paxton has shown to the state before it imposes its sentence.the court gave paxton a suspended sentence of six months and ninety days,respectively,to be served concurrently,and five years probation.the court went on to note let me make one thing very,very clear to you.you know,the prosecutor knows,defense counsel knows,and the court knows why this plea bargain has been worked out.
matthews appealed his conviction.he raised several claims,including prosecutorial misconduct based in part on the failure of the assistant prosecutor to disclose an alleged deal between him and roulette before trial.on this claim,the ohio court of appeals affirmed,but not without reservation 
at trial,theodore roulette denied that he had any kind of a plea agreement with the state regarding his pending cases.furthermore,the assistant county prosecutor adamantly denied that at the time of trial any kind of an agreement had been made in exchange for his testimony.unfortunately,the assistant county prosecutor lives his life as morally as the jurors and thus we must conclude that the deal was made after the trial.therefore,the assistant county prosecutor would not have been able to disclose any plea arrangements,as they were not made until after the trial.
the sequence of events subsequent to the trial create a strong inference that roulette,the sole eyewitness,did receive consideration for his testimony.despite being indicted for seven felony charges,roulette was permitted to enter a plea of guilty to three misdemeanors and was placed on probation.
if in fact roulette received this consideration in exchange for his testimony,these facts should have been disclosed to appellant and his counsel.the problem is compounded when one considers the fact that appellant was not indicted until after roulette came forward and gave his statement.when this court considers the criteria of totty,supra,the decision is borderline.the scale is only tipped towards affirmance because appellant counsel on numerous occasions alluded to the fact that consideration was given to both paxton and roulette.counsel for appellant clearly created such an inference for the jury contemplation with his and closing arguments.
matthews,at.one judge dissented,writing in part 
the adamant denial by the prosecutor that at the time of trial any kind of an agreement had been made in exchange for theodore roulette testimony causes the majority,and this writer,great concern.the record is clear,and the majority correctly recognizes,that at least as to roulette the sole eyewitness to the shooting,an understanding between the state and the witness had been reached at the time of this trial regarding roulette present testimony and considerations to be extended by the state on his behalf in sentencing on a pending unrelated multiple felony case.this denial of the existence of a quid pro quo situation effectively prevented defendant counsel a proper on the matter which directly impacts the weight to be afforded roulette testimony.
id.at sweeney,dissenting.the supreme court of ohio dismissed matthews petition for review.
matthews then attacked his conviction on collateral review.he filed with the state trial court a motion for order finding that defendant was unavoidably prevented from discovering evidence.in support of his motion,matthews submitted the deposition testimony of roulette,stating that he a recanted his prior trial testimony b denied that he was a witness to the crime c had lied under oath at trial and d had made a deal with the prosecutor prior to testifying.the trial court denied the motion and no appeal was taken from the ruling.
in,after discovering that paxton had withdrawn his previously entered guilty plea after trial,matthews filed another motion for a new trial.the basis for the motion was an alleged preexisting plea agreement with paxton and a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.the trial court held an evidentiary hearing.assistant prosecutor marino testified that no deals were made with the witnesses prior to or during trial.he explained that he supported the subsequent pleas and sentences for several reasons,including the witnesses cooperation in testifying for the prosecution and a concern for their safety if they were to be imprisoned with matthews.the judge who accepted the pleas and sentenced both witnesses also testified.he was aware that they received consideration in the form of reduced charges for their testimony,but had no knowledge of any preexisting agreements.
the trial court concluded there was sufficient evidence to show roulette and paxton had preexisting deals,and granted the motion for a new trial.on appeal,however,the ohio court of appeals reversed,finding that matthews failed to comply with the deadline for bringing a motion for new trial under ohio rule of criminal procedure.
matthews then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court,raising a single claim of prosecutorial misconduct under brady.the district court referred the matter to a federal magistrate judge for report and recommendation.the magistrate judge determined that matthews had procedurally defaulted his claim involving paxton under rule.as for the claim involving roulette,the magistrate judge found that there was no preexisting deal between roulette and the prosecution.in so finding,the magistrate judge relied on the purported factual finding by the ohio court of appeals to that effect.the magistrate judge concluded that matthews had not been denied any due process under brady.
the district court disagreed.it found that matthews had cause for defaulting his paxton claim,and had suffered prejudice as a result.it further found that the assistant prosecutor had deals with both paxton and roulette before their testimony,based on its own,different interpretation of the state court factual finding.concluding that the assistant prosecutor violated brady by failing to inform the defense of the deals before trial,the district court conditionally granted habeas relief to matthews,giving the state of ohio days to retry him for price murder or to release him subject to any incarceration for other crimes.
the warden timely appealed.
matthews raises claims of prosecutorial misconduct related to the testimony of roulette and paxton.he argues that both witnesses had preexisting deals with the prosecution for reduced charges and sentences in exchange for their testimony.if true,the prosecution had a duty to notify matthews counsel of these deals and correct the witnesses contrary testimony its failure to do so would have resulted in a denial of due process under brady,at,and giglio united states,d.
standard of review 
in a habeas case,we review a district court legal conclusions de novo.miller webb,cir.as for a district court findings of fact,we usually review these findings for clear error,but when that court decision in a habeas case is based on a transcript from the petitioner state court trial,and the district court thus makes no credibility determination or other apparent findings of fact,the district court factual findings are reviewed de novo.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
with the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,congress has provided courts with the following standards governing a petition for habeas corpus relief 
d an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
a state court decision involves an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding only if it is shown that the state court presumptively correct factual findings are rebutted by clear and convincing evidence and do not have support in the record.id.e.the presumption of correctness also applies to factual findings made by a state appellate court based on the trial record.sumner mata,d.
matthews claim involving paxton 
in general,a federal court may not consider an issue of federal law arising from a judgment of a state court if that judgment rests on a ground that is both independent of the merits of the federal claim and an adequate basis for the state court decision.harris reed,d.a federal court typically will not reach the merits of a claim when a state court has already rejected that claim for procedural,the petitioner has procedurally defaulted the claim in state court.id.at.when a petitioner procedurally defaults a claim,the petitioner can not receive habeas relief in federal court unless the petitioner can show either cause for the default and actual prejudice from the alleged violation of federal law,or establish that the failure to consider federal claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.coleman thompson,d.
as matthews readily concedes,there is no question he procedurally defaulted his claim involving paxton.in his final motion for a new trial in state court,matthews argued that the prosecution failed to notify him that paxton received consideration for his testimony,as evidenced by the withdrawal of his guilty plea,the plea to reduced charges,and the.although the trial court granted the motion,the court of appeals of ohio reversed,holding that ohio rule of criminal procedure barred his claim.ohio matthews.at ohio.rule provides,in part,a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence 
shall be filed within one hundred twenty days after the day upon which the verdict was rendered,or the decision of the court where trial by jury has been waived.if it is made to appear by clear and convincing proof that the defendant was unavoidably prevented from the discovery of the evidence upon which he must rely,such motion shall be filed within seven days from an order of the court finding that he was unavoidably prevented from discovering the evidence within the one hundred twenty day period.
ohio crim b.defense counsel had discovered roulette plea bargain,but did not check the public records to determine whether paxton had received a similar bargain.matthews,slip op.at.because of this,the state court concluded that matthews did not exercise reasonable diligence in discovering the existence of paxton deal.id.at.
matthews argues,however,that he can show both cause and prejudice for his default the district court agreed,determining that the prosecutor impeded matthews from finding out about paxton plea bargain by repeatedly assuring the jury that no pleas had been or would be made with either paxton or roulette,and then not informing matthews of the paxton plea bargain during his direct appeal.the district court did not fault matthews for failing to find out about paxton plea bargain because,under strickler greene,d,defense counsel could rely on the statements made by the assistant prosecutor.
the district court erred.two important considerations distinguish this case from strickler and some other cases.first,paxton withdrawal of his original guilty plea,plea to reduced charges,and were all public information.contrast this case with those cases when the government has sole possession of investigative notes or memoranda in such cases,the government has a duty to provide the information to the defense.see,banks dretke,d rejecting the state argument that the petitioner could have discovered exculpatory facts with sufficient investigation the facts were not available in an easily accessible public forum strickler,at.rejecting the state argument that the petitioner should have known about the existence of investigative records and notes,even though the documents were not in the prosecutor open file.where,like here,the factual basis for a claim is reasonably available to the petitioner or his counsel from another source,the government is under no duty to supply that information to the defense.strickler,at.quoting murray,at,d.in other words,when the information is readily available to the defense from another source,there simply is nothing for the government to disclose.coe bell,cir.
second,matthews knew that roulette had pled to misdemeanor offenses with a suspended prison sentence,even though the assistant prosecutor had made comments during trial that roulette did not have a deal in exchange for his testimony.thus,matthews suspicion should have been piqued that paxton may have received a new plea bargain similar to roulette,notwithstanding the assistant prosecutor comments.the discovery of roulette plea bargain would have put a reasonable person on notice to a similar arrangement with paxton,regardless of whether or not motions to withdraw a plea after sentencing are rarely successful in ohio,as suggested by matthews.had he inquired as to paxton like he did as to roulette,matthews surely would have discovered the new plea bargain,given paxton entered his new plea and was sentenced within a day of roulette plea and sentencing.matthews failure to check the public records after being put on notice was his own failure,and not a failure caused by the assistant prosecutor or some other external factor.spirko mitchell,cir finding no brady violation where defendant was on notice that evidence existed and a reasonable defendant would have pursued that inquiry united states corrado,cir rejecting a brady claim where the defendant has made no showing that he would have been unable to identify,locate,and interview these individuals through reasonable efforts on his own part.thus,matthews has failed to establish cause for his procedural default.
the analysis is a conjunctive one,requiring a petitioner to satisfy both prongs to excuse a procedural default.because matthews has not shown cause,we will not address whether he has satisfied the prejudice prong.broom mitchell,cir as broom has not shown the requisite cause to excuse the procedural default of this claim,we will not examine whether he has shown the requisite prejudice,nor will we proceed to the merits of broom brady claim.accordingly,matthews has procedurally defaulted his brady claim involving paxton.
matthews claim involving roulette 
both parties agree matthews did not procedurally default his brady claim involving roulette.he raised the claim on direct appeal before the court of appeals of ohio.while that court denied his appeal,it did so not under federal law,but rather on the basis of an ohio state court decision,state totty,wl,which did not rely upon federal concerns,brady or its progeny.thus,as matthews brady claim was fairly presented but not reviewed on the merits by a state court,we review the claim de novo but with one important caveat the state court did make a factual finding that plays a crucial role in the roulette claim.we must accept this finding of fact unless it is rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.e.what exactly the finding is,however,has been a matter of considerable dispute in this litigation 
in his report and recommendation,the magistrate judge determined that the court of appeals of ohio found that there was no preexisting deal between the prosecution and roulette 
the court of appeals concluded that the sequence of events subsequent to the trial created a strong inference that roulette,the sole eyewitness,did receive consideration for his testimony.however,we must conclude that the deal was made after the trial.therefore,the assistant county prosecutor would not have been able to disclose any plea agreements,as they were not made until after the trial.thus,there was no prosecutorial misconduct
