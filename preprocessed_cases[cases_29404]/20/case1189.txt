background 
in august murphy was convicted and sentenced to death for the capital offense of murdering jason erie during the commission of a robbery.the texas court of criminal appeals tcca summarized the facts presented during the guilt phase of murphy trial as follows 
as the state evidence demonstrated,murphy was in a car riding with friends around texarkana during the early morning hours of september.there had been heavy consumption of alcohol and marijuana throughout the previous day.the group passed an individual who appeared to be having car trouble and who had attempted to elicit their help.at the suggestion of a friend,murphy agreed to drive back with an aim to jack or rob the stranded driver.after returning to the stranded motorist,murphy and his friends helped the vehicle.the driver,jason erie,provided a small reward to murphy and his friends for their help and returned to his car.murphy then stepped from his vehicle,and,armed with a gun,demanded erie wallet.initially,erie protested and refused to hand over his property.as he finally began to comply,murphy fired a single shot from close range into the victim forehead and retrieved the stolen wallet from the spot it had fallen.it was later discovered along a nearby road where murphy told investigators it had been discarded.erie was alive when rescue workers arrived,but died a short time later.
murphy and his friends fled through arkansas,to tennessee,and finally ended up in arlington,texas,where they were apprehended by police.murphy girlfriend,christina davis,who was with murphy throughout the duration of these events,testified that she had fought with murphy on the day prior to the murder in which he struck her several times.she also explained to the jury how she and murphy had fought the day they were arrested and how murphy continued to hit her and threatened to shoot her in the leg to keep her from leaving.
murphy state,slip op.at.may,unpublished.murphy,an african american,was convicted and sentenced by an jury.of the six potential jurors who were questioned for voir dire,five were peremptorily struck by the bowie county district attorney the state.one was accepted by the state but peremptorily struck by the defense.the defense objected to the state striking of the venirepersons the trial court held a batson hearing.although the trial court ruled that murphy had failed to make a prima facie showing of discrimination as to his batson objections,it nonetheless required the state to offer reasons for the exercise of its challenges.alternatively,the trial court ruled that the state reasons were valid and.the trial court thus overruled murphy batson objections.
on direct appeal,the tcca affirmed murphy conviction and sentence murphy did not seek certiorari review in the supreme court of the united states.murphy filed a state application for writ of habeas corpus in the trial court in october the trial court subsequently entered findings of fact and conclusions of law recommending murphy application be denied.in april the tcca adopted the trial court findings and conclusions and denied murphy habeas corpus relief.
in february murphy filed the instant petition for writ of habeas corpus in district court.in june the director moved for summary judgment.an evidentiary hearing took place before the magistrate judge mj in june on whether the state court determination that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the reasons offered by the prosecution for peremptorily challenging jurors were was unreasonable.the director presented the original prosecutor,al smith smith,as a witness murphy presented trial counsel,craig henry henry,as a witness.the mj then filed her report and recommendations,recommending that the court grant the director summary judgment as to all of murphy eight claims murphy timely filed objections.after de novo review of the mj report and recommendations,in august the district court agreed with the summary judgment recommendation as to seven of murphy eight claims but did not accept such recommendation as to the batson claim on which the mj had held the evidentiary hearing.
instead,the district court accepted the mj findings on that batson claim and denied relief.the district court thus agreed with the mj determination that the differences in the questions asked of versus venirepersons during voir dire could be explained by reasons other than a desire to exclude potential jurors because of their race that venireperson ladonna smith smith was not similarly situated to venireperson cellers because the evidence showed cellers had been convicted of a felony while smith had only been arrested for an unknown nonfelony offense and that the state court rejection of the batson claim because smith and cellers were not similarly situated was not unreasonable because the evidence did not show smith had ever been convicted and her lone arrest was years prior to murphy trial.murphy filed a notice of appeal from the district court judgment.in september the district court denied murphy a coa as to the seven issues it granted the director summary judgment,but it agreed to issue a coa as to murphy batson claim.
discussion 
murphy filed his section petition for a writ of habeas corpus after the effective date of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa.in a habeas corpus appeal,this court reviews the district court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo,applying the same standards to the state court decision as did the district court.busby dretke,cir citation omitted.
under aedpa,this court may not grant relief on a claim the state court has adjudicated on the merits unless the adjudication of the claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.a state court decision is deemed contrary to clearly established federal law if it relies on legal rules that directly conflict with prior holdings of the supreme court or if it reaches a different conclusion than the supreme court on materially indistinguishable facts.busby,at citing williams taylor,d.a state court decision constitutes an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if it is objectively unreasonable.pondexter dretke,cir citing williams,at.in order for a federal court to find a state court application of supreme court precedent unreasonable,the state court decision must have been more than incorrect or erroneous.wiggins smith,d.we presume the state court findings of fact are correct,and the petitioner bears the burden of rebutting this presumption by clear and convincing evidence.e.
whether the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law.
batson introduced a evidentiary framework for evaluating claims of racial discrimination in jury selection.at.first,the defendant must make a prima facie showing that the state has exercised peremptory challenges on the basis of race.id.at.second,if the requisite showing is made,the burden shifts to the state to produce a explanation for striking the venireperson at issue and thus rebut the defendant prima facie case.id.at.unless a discriminatory intent is inherent in the state explanation,the reason offered will be deemed race neutral.hernandez new york,d.finally,under the third step,the trial court must determine whether the defendant has carried his ultimate burden of proving purposeful discrimination.batson,at.a state trial court finding of the absence of discriminatory intent is a pure issue of fact that is accorded great deference and will not be overturned unless clearly erroneous.hernandez,at.our role on appeal is to determine whether the trial court determination of the prosecutor neutrality with respect to race was objectively unreasonable and has been rebutted by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.cockrell,d.
the findings and conclusions of the trial court and adopted by the tcca relevant to the instant batson issue include the following 
murphy argues those reasons relied on by the state to exercise its peremptory challenges against minority venire members were,in fact,pretextual in nature and were used to mask discriminatory intent.the three struck venire members of whom murphy complains on this appeal are set out as follows accompanied by the reasons prosecutors felt a peremptory challenge was appropriate and what attempts were made by defense counsel to show the reasons were pretextual 
venire member felt he was predisposed to not impose the death penalty,which he felt was used too often.gladney indicated he believed there should be a medicine to change people who commit these kinds of crimes.he expressed a belief that there would have to be no doubt in his mind before deciding the death penalty was appropriate.he had children the same age as murphy,who was at the time of his trial.he showed up for voir dire wearing a and chewing gum,indicating,to prosecutors,a lack of respect for or recognition of,authority.venire member gladney also felt that karla faye tucker a recent prisoner of death row should not have been executed,that the term society did not include prison,and that a person became less violent with age.finally,prosecutors say they exercised a strike because of venire member gladney beliefs concerning law enforcement and the criminal justice system.
in response,the defense attempted to engage in a comparative analysis to demonstrate that white venire members were not struck despite the fact they,too,were chewing gum or expressed a belief that there must be no doubt before a punishment of death is imposed.additionally,counsel for murphy attempted to demonstrate that the state engaged in disparate questioning of minority and caucasian venire members in order to unfairly exclude those minority members.
venire member expressed an ongoing concern that jury service would unduly interfere with her attempts to attend nursing school.also,she had originally indicated on the juror questionnaire that,while the death penalty may be appropriate in some cases,she could not personally return a verdict that assessed the death penalty.although this response was later changed,the prosecutor remained unsatisfied johnson would be willing to answer the special issues so that the punishment would be death.prosecutors felt venire member johnson religious beliefs would interfere with her ability to render a verdict,and they were concerned about a comment she made that her decision might be affected by the fact that she and murphy are the same age.she also stated that,in order to find murphy guilty,the other parties to the murder would have to testify.finally,prosecutors expressed the subjective belief that venire member johnson was not steadfast in her beliefs and was the type of person who would try to accommodate whomever she was talking with at the time.
despite the opportunity to do so,counsel for murphy made no effort to refute or rebut the state reasons for striking this venire member.
venire member indicating on her questionnaire that she had never been arrested,prosecutors discovered that venire member cellers had at least two prior arrests.there were indications she had been convicted of theft,which she denied until confronted.she also had been arrested for forgery,for which she provided an explanation that prosecutors said they found incredible.venire member cellers also admitted she had a sister who had experienced previous confrontations with police.
counsel for murphy argued that prosecutors engaged in disparate questioning of venire member johnson sic because the only inquiries made were of her past criminal background.this occurred despite the fact that a white venire member,ladonna smith,also had a prior criminal history,but the state never questioned her or inquired about it 
after reviewing the available record,we can discern no abuse of discretion behind the trial court decision to overrule murphy batson objections.the trial court could have reasonably concluded the state explanations were valid,and the peremptory strikes were not racially motivated.
murphy,slip op.at,first footnote added and second footnote in original.
the district court accepted the following findings from the mj report and recommendations 
the court first notes that the reasons given by the prosecution for peremptorily excusing the five venirepersons were.robinson stated that her service on the jury could cause a family conflict,because one of her children was friends with the defendant,while another child was friends with the victim.in her questionnaire,cellars denied that she had been arrested or convicted of any criminal offenses.under questioning,she admitted being both arrested and convicted,within the past ten years,of shoplifting and of cashing a stolen check,then claimed that she was in fact innocent and gave an unlikely explanation.johnson gave inconsistent answers the prosecution attempted to challenge her for cause on two occasions,only to be interrupted by the trial court,which rehabilitated her.both brewer and gladney consistently confused beyond a reasonable doubt with no doubt.further,brewer appeared not to believe in,or not to understand,the concept of parole,and gladney was personally opposed to the death penalty.
to establish pretext,murphy attempted to show that similarly situated white venirepersons were treated differently.he pointed out that the prosecution failed to use one of its peremptory challenges on cora elder elder,a,despite her also responding that she would have to be without a doubt of the defendant guilt in order to sentence him to death.however,a close examination of the voir dire reveals that,unlike brewer and gladney,elder quickly backed off from that position under questioning.accordingly,this court finds that elder was not similarly situated to brewer and gladney.murphy also pointed out that a non venireperson named ladonna smith had,like venireperson cellars,been arrested and denied this fact on her questionnaire,but,unlike venireperson cellars,the prosecution never questioned her on this point.the trial court denied murphy challenge as to venireperson smith without explanation,and without requiring the prosecutor to respond.
while the prosecution reasons for peremptorily challenging venireperson cellars were valid,its failure to ask similar questions of venireperson ladonna smith,who appeared similarly situated,do es raise an inference of pretext.since a finding of pretext as to a single juror requires that a conviction be vacated,see alabama ex rel,d,this court held an evidentiary hearing in order to determine why juror smith was not also questioned about her criminal history.
trial prosecutor al smith testified that to him,convictions were more significant than arrests,and recent arrests were more significant than older ones.he testified that venireperson smith criminal history consisted of only an arrest,not a conviction that the arrest was over years old,and that the notation of the crime for which she was arrested,asc,was not a crime that he even recognized,but in any event,it did not appear to be a felony.he also testified that because venireperson smith was one of the last venirepersons questioned,she was not likely to be called to serve and he was tired at the time he was questioning her,so he just decided to hurry up at sic get through her voir dire without asking her about the arrest.finally,he testified that he probably would have peremptorily challenged her on the basis of the false answer about her arrest if she did become eligible for the petit jury.
prosecutor smith explanation is not without problems.because he did not know the crime for which venireperson smith was arrested,the prudent course would have been simply to ask her,rather than to peremptorily challenge her.his claim that he was trying to hurry through the voir dire because she was near the end of the pool is belied by the fact that he took almost three times as much time with smith as he did with cellars.
notwithstanding these discrepancies,that venireperson smith arrest did not result in a conviction and was more than twenty years old establishes that she was not similarly situated with venireperson cellars,so the difference in the questioning they were subjected to can not be said to have resulted from no other reason besides race.the court,therefore,finds that the state rejection of murphy batson challenge was not unreasonable.
murphy dretke,slip op.at,unpublished.the district court noted that i n reviewing the record,the court did not find any examples of disparate questioning other than those set forth in specific detail by the magistrate judge in her findings.id.at.the district court agreed that the differences in the questions could be explained by reasons other than the desire to exclude venirepersons because of their race.id.in response to murphy objection that the mj erred by not finding cellers and smith similarly situated,the district court considered what evidence was introduced at the hearing and noted that nothing indicated that smith was convicted or that the term asc referred to a felony offense.id.at.moreover,the district court,like the mj,could not say that the trial court rejection of murphy batson claim was unreasonable because the facts that smith was not convicted and that her arrest occurred years before murphy trial render ed her situation sufficiently distinguishable from venireperson cellars.id.
murphy argues the trial court batson adjudication and the district court evaluation of its further evidentiary hearing and subsequent findings against him resulted in a decision that was unreasonable in light of the evidence presented and contrary to clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court.murphy asserts that through examination of the trial record and the evidentiary hearing,it can be concluded that the state did not ask the same questions of venirepersons compared to the venirepersons and that the questions asked of the venirepersons were designed to elicit disqualifying information.murphy argues that the record shows that the state deviated from its script used to question prospective jurors during its questioning of venirepersons.
as to gladney,murphy asserts that the defense noted for the record that the state did not object to one prospective caucasian juror,john smith smith,who also showed up chewing gum,or to another prospective caucasian juror,elder,who had a similar definition of beyond a reasonable doubt as gladney.murphy cites emerson state,for the proposition that a neutral explanation for a peremptory strike against a member of a protected group is suspect when the state did not use an unexhausted peremptory against a similar juror who was not a member of that group.moreover,murphy contends the defense stressed at the batson hearing that disparate questioning had been used on gladney.see keeton state,noting disparate questioning can evidence pretext.
murphy contends the evidentiary hearing was subject to the risks of distortion and imprecision from the passage of time because it took place years after the actual voir dire.murphy also argues that the mj and district court incorrectly determined that smith was not similarly situated to cellers and that such disparate questioning was related to reasons.murphy maintains prosecutor smith explanation for peremptorily challenging cellers is flawed because smith was merely commenting on unknown factors to the court,such as that was not known by him to be a felony.murphy stresses he should not be held to a search that did not explain any conviction of smith years after his case was tried,when a search at the time of voir dire might have produced evidence that smith was convicted and what crime represented.without any information about whether smith was convicted and what stood for,murphy argues prosecutor smith explanation that recent arrests were more significant than older ones is not logical.murphy also points to henry testimony that he recalled caucasian venirepersons being told about the definitions and circumstances of capital murder and being asked about issues of the case,while the venirepersons were asked about reasonable doubt and their criminal background.henry also stated that most african americans in bowie county were southern baptists and had a different understanding of reasonable doubt,which was a method that the state could use to disqualify venirepersons.
the director responds that murphy disparate questioning claims lack merit.the director argues that the record does not support murphy contention that the state disparately questioned venirepersons or that the stated reasons for the strikes at the batson hearing were pretextual.while the director acknowledges that the peremptory striking of five out of six venirepersons does appear to be suspect,he emphasizes that murphy has failed to prove his claims of discrimination before two factfinding courts and that the state accepted the sixth venireperson,who was then struck by the defense.
the director argues that the district court did not err in concluding that the state court decision to deny murphy relief was reasonable.first,the director notes that murphy provides very little record evidence to support his conclusory claims.the director challenges murphy citation in his brief to the entire voir dire record and thus contends murphy has not met rule c of the rules governing section cases in the united states district courts,which requires a petitioner to plead facts in support of his claims.see,koch puckett,cir holding petitioner conclusory allegations failed to establish valid ineffective assistance of counsel claim ross estelle,cir reemphasizing that mere conclusory allegations do not raise a constitutional issue in a habeas proceeding.
the director argues the record instead demonstrates that potential jurors were treated the same,regardless of race.the director asserts that although the state did immediately question two of the three venirepersons it struck due to their expressed personal opposition to the death and record demonstrates that the state likewise immediately questioned a caucasian venireperson,barbara whittington,about her views on the death penalty and ultimately struck her based on those views.the director maintains that the other venireperson struck due to her death penalty views,robinson,was not immediately questioned on the death penalty because her questionnaire,in addition to indicating a reluctance or hesitancy to impose the death penalty,indicated a stronger family conflict concern in the state fact that one of robinson sons was good friends with murphy,and another son knew the victim.the state eventually questioned robinson about her questionnaire answer on the death penalty,where she had indicated she could not personally assess it,and decided to strike her based on such views.the director argues this corroborates prosecutor smith assertion that he used the voir dire questionnaires to tailor his examination of potential jurors.
as to gladney,the director responds to murphy pretext arguments by noting that while caucasian venireperson smith was also chewing gum,this passing similarity of an affection for gum hardly impeaches the state motivations regarding gladney.unlike gladney,smith showed himself to be an extremely strong potential juror for the state.in particular,smith stated he favored the death penalty and perceived the job of criminal defense attorneys as finding loopholes.the director notes the defense excused smith.the director also argues that exami
