rudolph hawthorne appeals from a december,judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york nina gershon,judge denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.because the appellate division of the new york state supreme court,second department,issued a reasonable decision on the merits of petitioner claim,to which we are required to defer,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
this appeal arises out of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed by rudolph hawthorne,who at the time was proceeding pro se hawthorne is incarcerated pursuant to a state court judgment convicting him,after a jury trial,of criminal possession of a weapon and assault on one milton tennessee the facts elicited at trial demonstrated that,on or about october,tennessee and another man,kelvin armstead,were attacked by a man wielding a hammer.armstead,who sustained approximately ten blows,died of his wounds tennessee,who sustained only one to two blows and survived the attack with severe brain damage,is paralyzed on his right side and unable to speak.
on november,the day after the crime was discovered,hawthorne was briefly interviewed in connection with the attack by detective edgecombe,the lead investigator on the case.the interview took place at the local police precinct,but hawthorne was not placed in custody.on november,he voluntarily returned to the precinct at approximately to conduct a supplemental interview.after several hours of interrogation,hawthorne confessed to another investigator,detective bardin,that he had committed the attacks on tennessee and armstead.
although hawthorne had not been read his rights earlier in the interview,bardin testified that,immediately after hawthorne began to implicate himself in the crime,bardin stopped the interview and read hawthorne his miranda rights.hawthorne signed a waiver of his miranda rights at on november,and thereafter dictated a written confession to detective bardin the confession,signed by hawthorne at that night,was the only evidence connecting hawthorne to the crime.
after exhausting his state court appeals,hawthorne filed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus on september,alleging that his confession was the result of a violation of his miranda rights that his counsel was ineffective at a suppression hearing regarding that confession and that the prosecutor in his case had engaged in misconduct.the petition was referred to magistrate judge cheryl pollak,who on july,in a thorough and detailed report and recommendation the report,recommended denial of the petition in full.as relevant here,the report held that petitioner miranda claim had not been exhausted in the state courts and that,because petitioner had already taken his permitted direct and collateral state appeals,the claim was also procedurally defaulted.hawthorne spitzer,cv,wl,at july.
on september,judge gershon adopted the report in its entirety and denied the petition for habeas corpus.in pertinent part,she held that petitioner had not established that his counsel had rendered ineffective assistance at a suppression hearing conducted pursuant to people huntley,the huntley hearing,or the hearing hawthorne spitzer,cv,wl,at.judgment was entered on december.
we granted a certificate of appealability on july,on the following issues whether petitioner had established prejudice for the procedural default of his claim that his miranda rights were violated and whether petitioner received ineffective assistance of counsel during the huntley hearing,where i counsel failed to either of the detectives who interrogated petitioner on the day he confessed to the crime,and ii counsel allegedly refused to permit petitioner to testify on his own behalf 
discussion 
we review a district court denial of a writ of habeas corpus de novo,and review any factual findings for clear error.drake portuondo,cir.as a result of our de novo review,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
ineffective assistance of counsel 
petitioner argues that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel when his huntley counsel failed to either detective edgecombe or detective bardin,the two detectives who among others interrogated him on november.in order to determine whether a federal habeas petitioner was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel,courts follow the rule set out in strickland washington,d 
a convicted defendant claim that counsel assistance was so defective as to require reversal of a conviction has two components.first,the defendant must show that counsel performance was deficient.this requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the sixth amendment.second,the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.this requires showing that counsel errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial,a trial whose result is reliable.unless a defendant makes both showings,it can not be said that the conviction resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that renders the result unreliable.
the petitioner argued in the appellate division of the new york state supreme court that he had been prejudiced by huntley counsel failure to examine the detectives br.of appellant at,people hawthorne,dep t,leave to appeal denied.the appellate division,while vacating another of petitioner convictions,summarily denied relief on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.hawthorne,at,holding that t he defendant remaining contentions are without merit.
we are required to defer to a state court adjudication of an issue on the merits,unless the state court decision is contrary to,or involve s an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law or is based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.for the purposes of aedpa deference,a state court adjudicate s a state prisoner claim on the merits when it disposes of the claim on the merits,and reduces its disposition to judgment.when a state court does so,a federal habeas court must defer to the state court decision.sellan kuhlman,cir quoting d alteration in the original.a summary disposition constitutes a disposition on the merits.harrington richter,d 
aedpa unquestionably requires deference to a state court summary disposition of an appeal.see id.at.where a state court decision is unaccompanied by an explanation,the habeas petitioner burden still must be met by showing there was no reasonable basis for the state court to deny relief.where,as here,a state appellate court decides an issue of federal law in a summary fashion,see hawthorne,at,we exercise aedpa deference by asking,first,what arguments or theories could have supported the decision of the state court,and second,whether it is possible jurists could disagree that those arguments or theories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior decision of the supreme court.harrington.at.as explained below,the decision of the appellate division merits such deference.
the evidence presented at trial was available to the appellate division when it determined petitioner strickland claim.although petitioner huntley counsel did not either detective at the huntley hearing regarding the voluntariness of petitioner confession,trial counsel conducted a thorough of both detectives before the jury.detective edgecombe testified,on,that neither he nor any other detective had threatened or otherwise coerced petitioner during the first several hours of interrogation.detective bardin testified similarly on direct and.it would not be an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law for the appellate division to have determined that the evidence elicited by the defendant at trial would likewise have been elicited by competent counsel at the huntley hearing,and that that evidence did not merit suppression of the confession 
we determine that the decision of the appellate division was not contrary to,nor did it involve an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court,d.although we might not ha
