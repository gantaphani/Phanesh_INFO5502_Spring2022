petitioner brett lang appeals the district court denial of his motion to vacate his resentencing pursuant to.petitioner contends that because he argued that the principle announced in booker applied to his resentencing,he is entitled to have booker apply retroactively despite the fact that booker was decided after his resentencing became final.we disagree and affirm the decision of the district court.
petitioner was the second most culpable member of a major drug conspiracy,which distributed cocaine and heroin for approximately four years in through.the government,using wiretaps,raids,and undercover buys disrupted the conspiracy,which led to the indictment of sixteen individuals.
petitioner was indicted on november.the indictment,as modified by the superseding indictment of february,charged petitioner with eight counts involving drugs,firearms,and the unlawful use of a telephone facility.specifically,petitioner was charged with one count of conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute heroin and cocaine under one count of aiding and abetting the distribution of heroin under a and two counts of possession with the intent to distribute a controlled substance under a two counts of using a firearm during a drug trafficking offense under c and two counts of unlawful use of a telephone under b.petitioner pled not guilty,and after a jury trial,was convicted on july,of five of the charges against him.this included conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute cocaine and heroin,two counts of possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance,and two counts of using a firearm during a drug trafficking offense.petitioner was sentenced on november,to a total of months imprisonment months as to the conspiracy count,months as to each possession count to run concurrently with each other and the conspiracy count,and months as to the firearms count,to run consecutively to the other counts petitioner appealed,and the sixth circuit affirmed in an unpublished opinion on november.united states lang,cir unpublished.
on august,petitioner filed a motion to vacate pursuant to.on march,the district court denied that motion.this court affirmed that denial on march.lang united states,cir unpublished.
petitioner subsequently filed a second motion to vacate under,which the district court transferred to the court of appeals pursuant to the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat.this court dismissed petitioner second motion to vacate without prejudice for want of prosecution on december.by order of april,this court granted petitioner permission to file a successive motion limited to the question of whether petitioner firearm conviction was still valid under bailey united states,d holding that use in a statute prohibiting the use of a firearm during a drug offense means that a defendant actively employed such firearm.
on may,the district court vacated petitioner conviction for the firearm offense,and ordered that petitioner be resentenced.petitioner was resentenced on june.prior to resentencing,apprendi new jersey,d was decided,and the district court proceeded at sentencing under the assumption that apprendi applied.the district court sentenced petitioner to a total of months months on the conspiracy count,and months on each of the possession counts,to run concurrently to each other but consecutively to the conspiracy count.petitioner appealed his conviction,which was affirmed by this court in united states wingo.cir unpublished.as relevant here,petitioner challenged the imposition of consecutive sentences,arguing that the drug quantities that triggered the mandatory stacking provisions of the sentencing guidelines were based on facts that were not alleged in the indictment and submitted to a jury id.at.this court,although labeling petitioner challenge clever,concluded that he could show no apprendi error because the district court sentence was within the statutory maximum for that count.id.the court thus affirmed petitioner sentence.id.at.petitioner appealed to the supreme court,which denied certiorari.see lang united states,d.petitioner petitioned for rehearing of that denial,which was denied on may.see lang united states,d.on june,the supreme court decided blakely washington,d,and subsequently decided united states booker,d.
in light of this new precedent,petitioner moved again for relief under,arguing,inter alia,that his sentence of june,was unconstitutional because of the holdings of blakely and booker.the government moved to transfer this case to the court of appeals,arguing that petitioner motion was a successive petition pursuant to and therefore must be certified by a panel of the court of appeals.the district court denied the motion to transfer,concluding that it was petitioner first motion to vacate his june,sentence.on september,the district court denied petitioner motion on its merits,holding that booker was not retroactive and thus did not apply to petitioner,because his resentencing became final before blakely was decided.petitioner moved for rehearing,which was denied on november.petitioner filed a timely notice of appeal on december.
the government argues that petitioner motion to vacate should be dismissed as a second or successive motion that was improperly filed in the district court.whether or not petitioner motion is second and successive within the meaning of is,like all questions of statutory interpretation,an issue that we review de novo.see united states morris,cir citing united states hans,cir.
section provides that a second or successive motion must be certified as provided in section by a panel of the appropriate court of appeals.section b provides a procedure for filing a second or successive motion,which requires,inter alia,that the motion originate in the court of appeals and be authorized by a panel.moreover,in order for the court of appeals to approve the filing of a second or successive motion,the petitioner must allege certain substantive facts,which petitioner here undisputedly can not show.b.if we were to construe petitioner motion as a second or successive motion within the meaning of,petitioner motion would not have been properly filed,and should be dismissed on that basis.
courts have not,however,construed second or successive to encompass all motions or habeas petitions that are numerically second in the sense that they are literally the second motion filed in re bowen,cir see also slack mcdaniel,d holding that second habeas petition raising claims dismissed in previous mixed petition was not second or successive stewart,d holding that habeas petition raising claim previously dismissed as premature was not second or successive.in bowen,this court held that a state habeas petitioner did not present a second or successive petition where he filed a second petition raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim that he was barred from raising in his original petition for habeas corpus.at.the bowen court reasoned that courts defining second or successive generally apply abuse of the writ decisions,including those decisions that predated aedpa.id.at.the court continued under the abuse of the writ doctrine,a numerically second petition is second when it raises a claim that could have been raised in the first petition but was not so raised,either due to deliberate abandonment or inexcusable neglect.id.citing mccleskey zant,d.implicitly affirming this practice,the court applied that standard to bowen claim.id.at.
other courts of appeals have applied similar principles and held that motions or petitions for habeas corpus were not second or successive when the second action challenges a judgment or portion of a judgment that arose as a result of a previous successful action.see hepburn moore,cir per curiam every circuit that has addressed the issue has agreed that,under the aedpa,when new claims originate at resentencing,those claims may be brought in a subsequent habeas petition without the necessity of obtaining permission from the circuit court before filing the petition.in re taylor,cir section motion was not second or successive when it raised claims that originated at resentencing esposito united states,cir per curiam section motion challenging resentencing was only second or successive to the extent that it challenge d the underlying conviction or seeks to vacate any component of the original sentence that was not amended quoting galtieri united states,cir walker roth,cir per curiam we hold that a second habeas petition attacking for the first time the constitutionality of a newly imposed sentence is not a second or successive petition.united states scott,cir per curiam allowing motion to challenge ineffective assistance of counsel at resentencing see also dahler united states,cir united states barrett,st cir noting that decisions have created an exception where the second petition challenges parts of the judgment that arose as the result of the success of an earlier petition and noting that that exception did not apply luckett mcdaniel,wl,at cir,unpublished same.by contrast,no circuit that has addressed the issue has held that a motion or a habeas petition that addresses an issue that originates at resentencing is a second or successive petition.
in the instant case,petitioner is contesting issues that originated at his resentencing.petitioner challenge concerns the district court reliance upon drug quantities at resentencing to apply the stacking provisions of d section d provides that i f the sentence imposed on the count carrying the highest statutory maximum is less than the total punishment,then the sentence imposed on one or more of the other counts shall run consecutively,but only to the extent necessary to produce a combined sentence equal to the total punishment.at resentencing,petitioner was sentenced for three convictions one conviction for conspiracy,and two convictions for possession.with respect to the conspiracy count,the district court appl ied an apprendi type approach to the conspiracy count and determin ed that the maximum sentence on the conspiracy count was years.at.however,because the district court determined that the drug quantity findings from petitioner prior sentencing remained appropriate,the district court determined that the guidelines range was above the statutory maximum.it thus considered itself bound by the guidelines to apply the d stacking provisions and run the sentences for the possession convictions consecutively to the sentence for the conspiracy conviction.this challenge to the guidelines stacking provisions originates from petitioner resentencing at his original sentencing hearing,petitioner was sentenced to months on the conspiracy count,and the guidelines stacking provisions played no role in the sentence because this is petitioner first motion challenging his second sentence,we can properly consider the motion on its merits,as did the district court we agree with our sister circuits that,where a claim originates at resentencing and could not have been challenged at the original sentencing proceeding,the first motion challenging that claim is not a second or successive motion within the meaning of,regardless of whether another motion has been previously filed.
despite the fact that petitioner appeal from his resentencing became final before the supreme court decided blakely,let alone booker,petitioner argues that his sentence should be vacated so he can be resentenced under those precedents.petitioner does not dispute that this court has held that booker does not apply retroactively to motions.humphress united states,cir,cert.denied,d.moreover,humphress makes clear that booker announced a rule of criminal procedure,not a substantive rule.id.at without question,this is a procedural rule.citing schriro summerlin,d.petitioner nevertheless argues that booker applies retroactively to his case because of the supreme court holding in davis united states,d.
in davis,the court faced the issue of the propriety of the court of appeals judgment that a change in the law of that circuit after the petitioner conviction may not be successfully asserted by him in a proceeding.id.at.davis was convicted for failing to report for induction into the armed forces after being drafted.id.at.davis had failed to keep the board apprised of his current mailing address.id.at.as a result,the draft board communications attempting to arrange a physical were returned to it.id.at.after two failed attempts the draft board labeled davis delinquent,which potentially accelerated the time for his induction.id.during davis direct appeal,the supreme court decided gutknecht united states,d,which held that the selective service regulations that accelerated the induction of delinquent registrants by shifting them to first priority in the order of call were punitive in nature and,as such,were without legislative sanction thus a registrant could not be prosecuted for failing to comply with an induction order issued pursuant to those regulations.davis,at.davis was declared a delinquent under the same regulation as gutknecht,but was prosecuted under a similar but separate regulation.id.at.the court of appeals remanded davis case to the district court for consideration in light of gutknecht.id.at.the district court held that davis induction was not accelerated by his delinquency status,and therefore gutknecht was inapplicable.id.at.it affirmed davis conviction,as did the court of appeals.id.at.while davis case was pending for certiorari,the court of appeals decided united states fox,cir,a case that was indistinguishable from davis case.davis,at.the supreme court denied certiorari of davis direct appeal,and the court of appeals denied rehearing.id.at.davis then sought relief pursuant to.id.on collateral review,the ninth circuit held that its earlier affirmance was the law of the case and precluded davis from relief.id.at.the supreme court reversed.the court first noted that the ninth circuit decision was inconsistent with the court opinion in sanders united states,d,where the court held that even though the legal issue raised in a motion was determined against the applicant on the merits on a prior application,the applicant may nevertheless be entitled to a new hearing upon showing an intervening change in the law.davis,at.quoting sanders,at.the court then held that t he same rule applies when the prior determination was made on direct appeal from the applicant conviction,instead of in an earlier proceeding,if new law has been made since the trial and appeal.id.alterations in original quoting kaufman united states,d.the court concluded that the court of appeals erred in holding that the law of the case,as determined in the earlier appeal from the petitioner conviction,precluded him from securing relief under on the basis of an intervening change in law.id.
petitioner interprets this holding to mean that,where a petitioner argues a claim on direct appeal,and his claim is denied,and an intervening change in law vindicates the petitioner position,that petitioner can obtain relief on that claim under.we disagree.in our view,subsequent decisions from this court and the supreme court suggest that the exception in davis only applies to substantive conduct.
in teague lane,d,the plurality held that,with two exceptions,new rules should not be available on habeas corpus.the first exception is for certain kinds of primary,private individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal authority to proscribe id.at.internal quotation marks omitted,that is,teague may not apply when the new rule concerns substantive conduct.the second exception is for procedural rules that implicate the fundamental fairness of the trial.id.at.teague,which davis,suggests that substantive rules and procedural rules receive different treatment on collateral review.
davis can be read consistently with teague by limiting the exception in davis to substantive conduct.the supreme court opinion in bousley united states,d,provides support for this reading.there,the court considered whether the court decision in bailey united allowed a petitioner to vacate a guilty plea pursuant to a motion.the court refused to apply teague to the petitioner claim.id.at.although the court noted that no new constitutional rules were made by bailey,which merely interpreted statutory la
