this is an appeal from an order of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york david trager,judge construing petitioner alzonzo cook pro se petition as a application and dismissing it as pursuant to d.construing cook notice of appeal as a motion for a certificate of appealability,we granted the certificate limited to the following issues w hether cook,a state prisoner,properly challenged the revocation of his parole under rather than whether a state prisoner challenging parole revocation must obtain a certificate of appealability to appeal a district court denial of relief and whether the one year statute of limitations provided by the and effective death penalty act of,stat.aedpa applies to a state prisoner petition.cook new york state bd.of parole,cir.we agree with the district court that a state prisoner challenging his or her parole revocation must file under section and that the time bar imposed by section d applies to such an application.inasmuch as we conclude that the petition was properly considered an application under section,we do not reach the other issue that we certified whether section c requires a person seeking to appeal the denial of a petition under section first to obtain a certificate of appealability from us.because this is cook first federal habeas petition and construing it as a section petition might cause cook to forfeit unintentionally any otherwise meritorious claims for federal habeas relief he might have,however,we vacate the district court judgment and remand the case to the district court to afford cook an opportunity to withdraw his petition pursuant to adams united states,cir per curiam,and also to enable the district court to determine whether the time limitation imposed by section d has in fact run.

discussion 
standard of review 
we review the district court grant or denial of habeas corpus de novo.lanfranco murray,cir.we are,however,bound by the district court findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous.a a.
ii.jurisdiction under or 
cook styled his request for relief in the district court as a petition for habeas corpus under.section authorizes the supreme court,any justice thereof,the district courts and any circuit judge within their respective jurisdictions,a,to grant a writ of habeas corpus to a prisoner in custody in violation of the constitution or laws or treaties of the united states,c.
the fact that cook invoked section did not,however,require the district court to treat it as a section petition.on the contrary,if an application that should be brought under is mislabeled as a petition under section,the district court must treat it as a section application instead.james walsh,cir.i t is the substance of the petition,rather than its form,that governs.id.
the district court correctly treated cook petition as an application under section.by its terms,section applies to application s in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court on the ground that the person applying is in custody in violation of the constitution of the united states.a.that characterizes cook petition precisely.james,at.
cook argues,however,that section is not applicable to his petition because his custody is pursuant to an order of the parole board rather than a state court.cook bases his argument on a series of cases in which we concluded that federal prisoners whose complaints were not directed at the imposition of their sentences could seek habeas relief under and thereby avoid the strictures of section,section analog for federal prisoners.see,carmona united states bureau of prisons,cir holding that administrative sanctions imposed for possession of narcotics while federally incarcerated may be challenged under section murphy united states,cir per curiam noting that a challenge to federal extradition was properly brought under section chambers united states,cir holding that a petition relating to calculation of credit for time served during federal detention was properly brought under section.but,as we observed in james,section,which is the vehicle by which persons in federal custody may assert that their sentence violates the federal constitution or federal law,is critically narrower than section,by which persons in state custody may challenge that custody 
a claim under section that a state prisoner is in custody in violation of federal laws is broader than a claim that the imposition of one sentence is illegal.a federal due process challenge claiming state incarceration beyond that authorized by a judgment and sentence would fall within this broader category of claims.the plain language of the pertine
