sometime in either late or early,donald mohler,robert long,and roberto camero began smuggling marijuana into the united states from the bahamas.robert long and mohler brought loads of fifty to pounds of marijuana to columbus,ohio,which they distributed through mohler aunt,karen climer collins.
after the arrest of several of their couriers,mohler and robert long stopped dealing marijuana and began selling cocaine.mohler and robert long began bringing to columbus cocaine supplied by rodolfo fernandez.robert long and mohler concluded their partnership in early.at that point,karen collins hereinafter referred to as karen long married robert long,and the longs continued to deal cocaine supplied by fernandez.
initially,fernandez fronted the longs kilogram of cocaine every two months.after about two years,fernandez began fronting the longs an entire kilogram every two months.this continued until,when mohler contacted robert long again.mohler could give robert long a better price on the cocaine than robert long received from fernandez,so the longs began dealing with mohler instead.on october,undercover police arrested patrick paden,one of mohler couriers,with one kilogram of cocaine.
attempting to steal from his supplier,juan sierra,mohler told sierra that he lost two kilograms in the arrest.sierra discovered mohler deception and terminated their relationship.sierra then asked robert long to assume mohler role.the longs paid sierra,and sierra delivered one kilogram for the money and fronted a second kilogram.
in november of,the longs purchased a new home on blue valley road,outside of lancaster,ohio,for.the longs initially occupied the blue valley residence in april of,but then moved to florida in december of.the longs sold the blue valley property in april of for.petitioner,an attorney,handled the closing on the longs behalf.
after the longs moved to florida,they directed their ohio cocaine business through donald and marilyn ross who lived in central ohio.donald ross made approximately two trips each month to to pick up cocaine from sierra,and another to deliver payment.donald and marilyn ross handled loads of up to eight kilograms per month.
in exchange for their assistance,the rosses received a portion of the profits and a home at faber avenue.petitioner handled all paperwork related to the purchase and sale of the faber property in a manner intended to disguise the transaction real purpose.karen long testified that petitioner knew the house was being bought with drug money.he said he would come up with something.bob robert long said petitioner worked on it and that when he made the contracts.at.
before preparing the faber paperwork,petitioner received quantities of cocaine for personal use as gifts from the longs.donald ross and robert long delivered the drugs.robert long later claimed that he sometimes paid petitioner for his legal services with cocaine.
according to karen long,petitioner knew everything about the longs drug business.she and her husband spoke with petitioner about their enterprise every time they met.karen long passed information from petitioner to the rosses that helped the rosses evade law enforcement.at one point,for instance,karen long told the rosses to stop using telephones because petitioner had a tip that the rosses were under investigation.
on july,karen long told the rosses to take in cocaine proceeds to karen long mother,so that her mother could post bond for karen long nephew,charles sullivan.petitioner told karen long to post the bond because he feared sullivan might start talking to police about the longs drug trade.karen long later testified that she and her husband usually followed petitioner advice.
on july,law enforcement executed a number of search warrants at homes belonging to karen long,members of her family,and donald and marilyn ross.petitioner contacted the longs in florida,informed them of the raids,and traveled to florida to meet with them.at petitioner direction,the longs sold many of their assets and returned to ohio.
the longs gave petitioner from the sale of their assets.after petitioner received the money,he placed liens on the longs remaining pieces of real estate to prevent the government from attaching them.
a grand jury subpoenaed records of all monies paid to,given to,or handled by petitioner for the longs.on march,petitioner prepared and produced two letters summarizing monies the longs paid to him for his activities.in those letters,petitioner indicated that the longs paid him between may,and july,and from august,until february.these estimates dramatically understated the amount of money petitioner actually received because petitioner did not include the.
the rosses obtained counsel,michael holbrook,a friend of petitioner.holbrook discussed with them the possibility of cooperating before indictment.while holbrook represented the rosses,petitioner organized a rendezvous at a local bar with both the rosses and the longs without holbrook present.by chance,holbrook entered the bar,saw the meeting,and argued with petitioner about speaking with his clients without his knowledge.shortly thereafter,holbrook ceased representing the rosses.
petitioner also met with kathy macdonald,who worked with the rosses in their distribution network.petitioner told macdonald not to say anything to anyone.macdonald asked petitioner if he was scared,because she knew he received cocaine in exchange for legal services performed for the longs.petitioner told her he was not worried because the authorities could only convict him for money laundering.
two other individuals who worked for the rosses,sally and lonnie huff,met with petitioner.petitioner told the huffs that perjury would result in nothing more than a fine or a very light sentence.additionally,petitioner informed the huffs that the government could revoke any immunity it offered once the huffs incriminated themselves by testifying.the huffs also met with karen long and petitioner in petitioner office.during these meetings,petitioner and karen long developed stories the huffs could relay in the event the government offered them immunity or otherwise compelled them to testify.following their instructions,the huffs later told the grand jury they knew nothing of the longs drug business.
procedural history 
on may,the grand jury indicted the longs and nineteen on numerous counts of drug trafficking and money offenses.until september of,petitioner continued to represent robert long.karen long retained michael mcginley.on september,the grand jury returned a superseding indictment that added ten additional defendants,including petitioner.in light of his indictment,petitioner moved to withdraw as robert long counsel.the district court granted the motion on september.on march,prior to trial,robert long and rodolfo fernandez,two of the ross,requested a separate trial.they argued that the evidence introduced against the would unfairly prejudice them.the court rejected their respective motions.
on march,the day before trial was scheduled to begin,petitioner filed a motion for severance requesting that he be tried separately from robert long.petitioner argued that he planned to call robert long as a witness in his defense.
at the trial,petitioner testified that he represented the longs.he admitted receiving gifts of cocaine from robert long,delivered either by donald ross or robert long himself.petitioner acknowledged handling the longs financial transactions and conceded that it would take a rocket scientist to know that they are somehow involved in the drug trade.at.yet throughout his testimony,petitioner denied both that he knew the extent of the longs cocaine enterprise and that he willfully participated in any of the longs criminal activity.counsel for robert long represented at a pretrial conference that he did not know whether his client would invoke his fifth amendment privilege if called as a witness in a joint trial the district court denied the request for severance.
beginning on march,the government jointly tried petitioner along with several including robert long and rodolfo fernandez.requests for severance were renewed throughout the trial and denied.the trial lasted nine weeks and involved more than seventy witnesses.on april,the jury convicted petitioner,robert long,and fernandez on all counts.petitioner received a sentence.in his appeal to this court,
petitioner challenge d his convictions on the grounds that he was precluded from fully presenting his defense because of the assertion of privilege on behalf of his robert long,and the evidence was insufficient to show he knew of and joined the conspiracies.with respect to his sentence,petitioner claim ed the district court erred by denying him a reduction in his base offense level either for acceptance of responsibility or for being a minimal participant in the conspiracy granting an enhancement for using a special skill in the commission or concealment of the offense finding he was responsible for laundering funds in excess of and denying him a downward departure because of factors not adequately taken into account by the guidelines.
united states ross,cir.on july,we affirmed petitioner conviction.id.with regard to his right to present a defense claim,we determined that petitioner was not denied his right to present a defense rather,the jury did not believe him.id.at.petitioner petitioned for certiorari,which the supreme court denied on november.see ross united states,d.
petitioner filed his habeas petition on november.petitioner attached several exhibits,including an affidavit from holbrook.holbrook,who testified for the government at petitioner trial,claimed that the attorney office contacted him prior to trial and asked him to speak with petitioner about a plea bargain.according to holbrook,the assistant attorney,robyn jones hahnert,stated that there was no need for petitioner to go to jail,and sic the possibility of avoiding him permanently losing his license.at.holbrook then relayed this information to petitioner and his counsel,lew williams.
according to holbrook,the meeting revealed that williams did not understand the case or the sentencing guidelines and could not properly advise his client.holbrook further indicated that he told petitioner that he was in real trouble because lew had no idea about anything on sic the case and that he needed to be educated real fast because it was too late to get another lawyer.at.holbrook also claimed that hahnert told him that williams never contacted her about a possible plea.finally,holbrook expressed concern over the unprofessional manner in which williams him at petitioner trial.holbrook affidavit noted that i n a casual meeting in the coffee shop later that day,i was privy to a comment made to me by an attorney for one of the about lew performance.he questioned his preparation i was already disgusted with lew and did not say anything.id.
petitioner also attached his own affidavit to his habeas petition petitioner claims that he asked williams investigate the plea offer but that williams did not do so until the day of trial,at which point the government no longer expressed interest.petitioner claimed that he would have pleaded guilty had he received a plea offer that did not involve incarceration.
the government responded with an affidavit from hahnert.hahnert acknowledged that during a pretrial meeting with holbrook,holbrook expressed concern that his friend,petitioner,did not fully grasp the severity of his situation.hahnert advised holbrook that she offered petitioner a plea bargain that would require he plead to a money laundering charge.if petitioner cooperated,the government would include a provision for a downward departure pursuant to.hahnert also averred that the plea offer never included a recommendation of probation,nor did she ever indicate that petitioner might not lose his license to practice law.rather,hahnert stated that the district court had discretion to place petitioner on probation if the government made a motion,and petitioner had a better chance to regain his license in the future if he pleaded guilty to a money laundering charge instead of a cocaine distribution charge.finally,hahnert denied asking holbrook to take the plea offer to petitioner on behalf of the attorney office.
petitioner attached a second affidavit from holbrook to the reply brief he filed with the district court.holbrook claimed 
robyn hahnert did not say that she would recommend neither sic probation nor keeping his license to practice law.she did discuss that a plea to laundering,a base level offense,would receive a motion.with acceptance of responsibility and potential for a minor role this would have placed petitioner in the area of potential probation or half way house.both attorneys present were aware of the guideline ramifications of the plea offer meant sic.there was not a recommendation sic offer but the comment that petitioner did not necessarily need to go to jail.
at.holbrook also clarified that robyn did not say that she would recommend anything about the license and that he holbrook was not acting as an agent for the government when he relayed information to petitioner.id.
on july,the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation recommending that the district court deny the petition.petitioner filed objections to that report on july.on september,without an evidentiary hearing,the district court adopted the report and recommendation.
on october,petitioner filed a timely notice of appeal.the district court granted petitioner a certificate of appealability on november.
discussion 
initially,petitioner argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to inform him of a plea offer that he would have accepted.the district court rejected this contention on the briefs,and petitioner asserts he should have at least received an evidentiary hearing.petitioner also raises a litany of other less substantial ineffective assistance arguments 
we begin with petitioner claim that he should have at least received an evidentiary hearing before the district court rejected his argument that his counsel alleged failure to relay a plea offer constituted ineffective assistance.this court reviews a district court decision to deny a ineffective assistance of counsel claim without an evidentiary hearing for abuse of discretion.blanton united states,cir see also etheridge united states,cir prewitt united states,cir.

petitioner primary ineffective assistance of counsel claim is that his attorney failed to act on a plea offer made by the attorney office prior to trial.in support of his argument,petitioner cites the holbrook affidavit,in which holbrook swears,according to petitioner,that the ausa had contacted him prior to trial,and indicated that she would offer the appellant a plea whereby he could possibly retain his license.pet r br.at.holbrook then relayed his communications to petitioner and his counsel.since the attorney office denies having made an offer that would not involve jail time and possibly allow petitioner to retain his license,petitioner argues a factual dispute exists that warrants an evidentiary hearing.
the government attached hahnert affidavit to its reply opposing the petition.hahnert averred that she never made a plea offer to holbrook that would guarantee or even recommend probation.hahnert acknowledged possibly allowing petitioner to plead to money laundering charges and receive a
