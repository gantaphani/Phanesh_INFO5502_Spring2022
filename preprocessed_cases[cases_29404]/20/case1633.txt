the state of ohio indicted petitioner billy joe sowell for murder,with a stipulation that he could receive the death penalty.relying on advice of his counsel,sowell opted to be tried by a panel rather than by a jury.sowell counsel was confident that one of the three judges on the panel would refuse to recommend death.the panel nevertheless imposed the death penalty,and sowell direct and collateral appeals through the ohio courts were unsuccessful.on federal habeas review,however,the district court granted a writ of habeas corpus,finding that sowell jury waiver was not knowing and intelligent,and that his counsel was ineffective.we reverse the district court grant of a writ of habeas corpus to sowell because he has not demonstrated that his jury waiver was not knowing and intelligent or that his counsel was ineffective.
facts and procedural history 
as the facts that underlie sowell death penalty are not in controversy,we rely on the ohio court of appeals version 
the record discloses that sowell and calvert graham resided in adjacent apartments on the third floor of an apartment building in downtown cincinnati.sowell was the resident manager of the building and became acquainted with graham,who performed occasional odd jobs at the apartment building.after graham became a resident in sowell apartment building,the two men developed a friendly relationship and visited one another in their respective residences.
on may,three days prior to the instant offenses,sowell was a guest in graham apartment.also present were donna edwards edwards,a woman with whom graham shared the apartment,and pam billups a former prostitute who had been visiting graham and edwards.graham offered two marijuana cigarettes to sowell,which he accepted.thereafter sowell left the apartment in the company of billups and proceeded to a nearby restaurant where he purchased dinner for her.en route to the restaurant,sowell smoked the second marijuana cigarette,having consumed the first at graham residence.thereafter the pair made their way to a hotel where sowell rented a room.there was conflicting testimony concerning the events that transpired thereafter.however,it is not disputed that sowell eventually lost consciousness,having consumed an unspecified quantity of wine during the evening in addition to the marijuana.the next morning sowell made his way back to his residence,stopping along his route to obtain breakfast for billups.
sowell next encountered billups on the afternoon of may.billups was in the company of edwards and the trio passed in the doorway of a store but did not acknowledge one another.as will be seen,this seemingly inconsequential meeting gained significance later in the day.
that evening sowell returned to his apartment building after,according to his testimony,visiting no less than five taverns and consuming at least one double shot of vodka at each stop.upon returning to his apartment building sowell realized that he was not in the mood to retire for the evening,and instead presented himself at graham apartment.graham greeted sowell and invited him inside,where edwards and billups were also present.graham produced a marijuana cigarette which was consumed by all four occupants.
sowell testified before the trial court that following the consumption of the marijuana,he fell asleep for a short time.when he awoke the others were still present and sowell discovered that approximately had been removed from his trouser pocket.at first sowell thought that the trio was playing a joke upon him however,his requests for the return of his money received no response.sowell further testified that graham then picked up a knife and ordered sowell to leave the residence.sowell complied and departed,but he was extremely angry as a result of his loss.
both billups and edwards told the trial court that sowell visit to the apartment on the day in question was at first friendly.however,sowell soon became agitated and accused billups of being unsociable in that she did not speak to him earlier that afternoon.sowell also accused billups of stealing from him during their encounter three days earlier.when sowell referred to billups in terms meant to insult her pedigree,graham ordered sowell to leave the premises.sowell left,stating that he was going to obtain his gun,return and shoot billups.
sowell went directly to his apartment where he directed his wife,lenora waugh waugh,to bring his gun to him.waugh complied with that request,as well as with sowell instructions to accompany him to graham apartment.upon returning to graham door,waugh,at sowell instruction,knocked and indicated to those inside that she was a woman named portia.graham responded to the door and opened it.edwards and billups testified,and the trial court found,that sowell forced his way into the apartment,firing a bullet from his handgun into the ceiling as he entered.sowell demanded to know billups whereabouts and threatened to shoot her.graham was able to calm sowell and began to escort him from the apartment and to close the door,whereupon sowell suddenly turned and shot graham in the abdomen.as graham fell,sowell fired a second shot into graham skull.graham fell to the floor,mortally wounded.
sowell next made his way to the closet in which billups was cowering,and fired three bullets into her body.sowell next placed the gun to billups forehead and pulled the trigger.however,the gun did not expel a bullet because it no longer contained ammunition.sowell left the apartment after warning edwards not to leave the premises or he would shoot her also.sowell returned to his apartment,obtained money and made his way to a nearby tavern where he was apprehended by the police.
sowell testified regarding the shootings and told the court that he returned to graham apartment to demand his money and that he was confronted by graham,who was armed with a knife.sowell stated that it was only after graham made a furtive movement that sowell began shooting at graham,and that one of the bullets struck the ceiling.sowell explained his conduct as follows it just,i just clocked out.when i seen that person going this way i just pivoted,i pivoted on my gun,i was shooting,i was angry,i started shooting,i just started shooting everybody i seen.

the trial court proceeding 
on may,a hamilton county grand jury indicted sowell on one count of aggravated murder in violation of ohio revised code a,and one count of attempted murder in violation of a and a.the aggravated murder count contained a capital specification alleging that the aggravated murder was part of a course of conduct involving the aggravated murder of one person and the attempt to murder another.see a imposition of the death penalty for aggravated murder is precluded,unless the following is specified in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt the offense at bar was part of a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing of or attempt to kill two or more persons by the offender.
on october,sowell appeared before the trial judge,judge crush.sowell waived his right to a jury trial and asked to be tried by a panel,as ohio capital scheme allows.see.trial began on october,and on october the panel unanimously found sowell guilty of all charges,including the capital specification.the sentencing phase also called the mitigation phase was held on november,and,on the following day,the panel sentenced sowell to death on the aggravated murder count and to years on the attempted murder count.
the direct appeal 
sowell appealed to the ohio court of appeals,which affirmed the conviction and sentence on august.sowell,wl.the supreme court of ohio similarly affirmed,on november,see sowell,ohio,and the supreme court denied certiorari,see sowell ohio,d.this ended sowell direct appeal.thus far,sowell had not complained that his waiver of jury trial had been invalid.
the state proceedings 
on december,sowell filed in the hamilton county court of common pleas a petition that raised claims for relief,the of which argued that sowell jury waiver was not knowing,voluntary,and intelligent.his sole support for this claim was an affidavit attached to the petition,in which he averred that he had waived his right to a jury trial only because his counsel had assured him that he would not receive a death sentence if he went with a panel.specifically he stated,i would not have waived my right to a trial by jury if my counsel had not informed me that such a waiver would mean that my life would be spared.at.though the trial court could have found that he had procedurally defaulted on this claim because he could have raised it on direct appeal,see ohio cole,ohio,ohio setting out ohio rules for raising new claims on appeal,the court instead found a more indirect default by holding that sowell self serving affidavit was insufficient to rebut the presumption of validity established by his and his attorney assurances to the trial court that the waiver was knowing and intelligent.overall,the court granted summary judgment to the state.
with respect to his jury trial waiver,sowell appealed to the ohio court of appeals and argued that he was entitled to relief because he was promised a life sentence by his trial attorneys if he waived his right to a jury trial.at.in a new claim,he further argued that 
trial counsel was ineffective due to their waiving a jury trial without adequately assuming that appellant life would be spared.a jury should only be waived if counsel has received sufficient assurances that a three judge panel will in fact spare the accused life.to try the case without sufficient assurances does not meet the prevailing standards of practice for capital defense attorneys.
at citations omitted.the ohio court of appeals agreed with the trial court that sowell affidavit was not enough to rebut the presumption established by sowell representations to the original trial court that his waiver was knowing and valid.ohio sowell,ohio app d.the ohio court of appeals did not address sowell current ineffective assistance argument,apparently finding that it was procedurally defaulted.see id.at.sowell subsequent appeal to the supreme court of ohio,which appeal again raised the jury waiver issue,was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.ohio sowell,ohio.
the initial federal habeas petition,and the murnahan application 
sowell filed a federal habeas petition in april of,but the district court dismissed the petition without prejudice for lack of exhaustion,finding that sowell could perhaps raise his ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claims via the supreme court of ohio murnahan application procedure however,the ohio courts denied his murnahan motions.ohio sowell,ohio.
the present federal habeas petition 
sowell renewed his federal habeas petition on may,raising claims.only two of these claims are involved in the present appeal.they are as follows 
fifth ground for relief.the action of trial counsel deprived petitioner sowell his right to the effective assistance of counsel during the trial phase of his case in violation of the fifth,sixth,eighth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution.
ground for relief.petitioner sowell waiver of a jury trial which was not knowingly,intelligently and voluntarily entered violated his rights as guaranteed by the sixth,eighth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution.
at.sowell fifth claim asserted that counsel had not received sufficient assurances that a jury waiver would avoid the death penalty,and the claim asserted that sowell waiver of a jury trial was constitutionally inadequate.
for the next five years,the parties litigated various issues,including discovery,expansion of the record,merits briefing,and whether sowell should be granted an evidentiary hearing.in the warden sought to have of sowell the claim but not the due to procedural default.on february,the district court issued an opinion and order finding that six of the claims were defaulted,but that the claim was not.the following month,on march,sowell filed a motion for an evidentiary hearing on various of his claims,including the fifth ground but not the.earlier,on january,sowell had filed a traverse that requested an evidentiary hearing on the claim.on september of the same year,the district court issued an opinion and order that granted an evidentiary hearing for the fifth and the claims on the grounds that the state court findings were inadequate to resolve the factual dispute of whether petitioner jury waiver was induced by erroneous assurances on the part of his trial attorneys at.the court also allowed sowell to expand the record by including an affidavit from martin pinales,one of his two trial attorneys,on the jury waiver issue.this was the second expansion of the record granted by the court regarding the jury waiver issue,since earlier in the litigation the court had allowed sowell to add to the record the correspondence between pinales and counsel on this issue.
the district court conducted an evidentiary hearing on april,at which sowell presented four witnesses pinales,sowell,gelbort a neuropsychologist,and donald schumacher an.at this hearing,pinales testified to his belief that sowell life would be spared by a panel because of inferences from his discussion with judge crush at a pretrial conference pinales admitted that he strongly suggested to sowell that he choose the panel to avoid the death penalty.sowell testified that he had faith and conviction and belief in his attorney and he thought that he was going to get the death penalty by waiving the jury.at.gelbort opined that sowell ability to reason,ponder and project into the future were in the bottom two percent of the population.schumacher stated that pinales counseling of client with abnormally low deficient because the downside of the choice was not explained by counsel or in the waiver colloquy with the court.
on october,the district court partially granted a conditional writ of habeas corpus,finding that sowell had properly waived his right to a jury in relation to the guilt phase of his trial,but not the sentencing phase.the court left undisturbed sowell to sentence for attempted murder,and gave ohio the option of retrying sowell entirely,or of leaving the conviction in place and imposing any sentence ohio law permits,other than death.the court did not address sowell other grounds for relief.the warden filed a motion to alter or amend,which the court denied,and a motion to stay,which the court granted.the warden,currently margaret bradshaw,now appeals.
discussion 
since sowell filed his habeas petition prior to,standards apply.powell collins,cir.under those standards,we review de novo a district court legal conclusions in granting a writ of habeas corpus,and for clear error the district court factual findings.wolfe brigano,cir.the writ of habeas corpus may only issue if the state court proceedings were fundamentally unfair as a result of a violation of the constitution or laws or treaties of the united states.see a estelle mcguire,d.the state court factual findings are entitled to a presumption of correctness,which is rebuttable only by convincing evidence.d now repealed mcqueen scroggy,cir.this presumption only applies to basic,primary,or historical facts,and to implicit findings of fact,logically deduced because of the trial court ability to adjudge the witnesses demeanor and credibility.mcqueen,at.the presumption does not apply to mixed questions of law and fact,or questions of law,both of which are reviewed de novo.coleman mitchell,cir.
procedural default 
abandonment of the jury waiver claim in sowell appeal 
contrary to the warden argument,sowell did not abandon his claim in his appeal.sowell first raised the jury waiver issue in his proceedings before the ohio trial court as his cause of action,arguing that petitioner sowell waiver of a jury trial was not a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to a jury trial because petitioner was advised by his counsel that if he waived his jury trial,he would not receive the death penalty.at.he raised this argument again before the ohio court of appeals.and on appeal to the supreme court of ohio,he raised it again,this time with a little more legal argument.
presentation of jury waiver claim on grounds other than those presented to the state court 
sowell argued to the state courts that his waiver was not knowing because he acted in reliance on his counsel erroneous assurances,but he did not argue,as he does now,that his waiver was not knowing because he did not understand what he was giving up,due to the trial judge and sowell attorney failure to warn him adequately of the dangers of his choice,and due to his own mental deficiencies.nevertheless,the district court considered these latter grounds.the warden contends that this was error,and argues that the court should have found these grounds procedurally defaulted.consequently,the warden argues,the is distinct from that presented to the state courts,and it is hence procedurally defaulted.
the legal ground underlying this argument is the principle that the doctrine of exhaustion requires that a claim be presented to the state courts under the same theory in which it is later presented in federal court.wong money,cir but see prather rees,cir i f the difference is merely a variation in the legal theory,rather than a different legal claim,then the petitioner has exhausted his claim.in wong,the petitioner had argued to the state courts that her counsel was ineffective for failing to present an insanity defense,but on appeal she attempted to argue in addition that her counsel was ineffective for prematurely abandoning the search for an expert who would say she was insane,even though two experts had already found that she was not insane.wong,at.the panel found that the latter claim advanced a new theory,and was procedurally defaulted.id.at.
it is not necessary for us to determine whether sowell has raised a different legal claim here,or merely presents a variation in legal theory,because we are persuaded that the warden,by advising the district court that she would not object to the testimony of gelbort that supported the claim,has waived her right to object.
failure to attach sufficient documentation to support sowell jury waiver and ineffective assistance claims when he raised them in state proceedings 
the warden final default argument fails because she did not raise it below.the warden contends that sowell defaulted both of the claims relevant to this appeal by failing to satisfy ohio requirement that a petitioner in a proceeding produce more than a affidavit to rebut the presumption that a proceeding on the record was somehow invalid.see ohio kapper,ohio,a petition for relief is subject to dismissal without a hearing when the record indicates that the petitioner is not entitled to relief and that the petitioner failed to submit evidentiary documents containing sufficient operative facts to demonstrate that the guilty plea was coerced or induced by false promises.the ohio courts rejected sowell claim for this reason.see at ohio sowell,ohio app d.the sixth circuit has recognized ohio courts dismissal for failure to provide documentation as a sufficient basis for finding a procedural default.see lorraine coyle,cir finding that the failure to attach documentation can result in a procedural default.
however,the warden did not make this argument to the district court.the warden concedes that the failure to raise the issue before the district court may mean that the argument is forfeited.procedural default is a defense that the state is obligated to raise and preserv e if it is not to lose the right to assert the defense thereafter.trest cain,d internal quotation marks omitted.further,procedural default is not a jurisdictional matter,and a court of appeals is not required to raise the issue of procedural default sua sponte.id.nonetheless,this court may consider a default argument,if it so wishes.see,elzy united states,cir while procedural default is not a jurisdictional bar to review of such a claim,and the government failure to raise the default may operate as a forfeiture of its right to defend on that ground,we nonetheless may raise these issues sua sponte.citations omitted.in light of the resources that have been expended by the district court and the serious consequences facing sowell,and because the warden did not make this argument to the district court,we exercise our discretion not to reach the issue.
ii.expansion of the record and evidentiary hearing 
notwithstanding the warden additional argument,the district court,under our precedent,had the authority to conduct a hearing on the claims that were the basis of the district court judgment.the district court held that the state court finding is subject to review and an evidentiary hearing in this court under d and d.the district court concluded that because sowell was not attempting to present evidence that was not presented,at least in some fashion,to the ohio courts,cause and prejudice was not required.
the warden challenges that decision by the district court,arguing that sowell needed to demonstrate cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justice before the district court could hold an evidentiary hearing.however,in abdur rahman bell,cir,we explained that even though the cause and prejudice requirement had to be met for petitioner to be entitled to a hearing,the district court nonetheless has inherent authority to hold an evidentiary hearing even if petitioner is not entitled to one.abdur rahman,at because the district court properly ordered an evidentiary hearing pursuant to its inherent authority to do so,the issue of whether petitioner is entitled to an evidentiary hearing via a showing of cause and prejudice is irrelevant and will not be addressed.it was therefore not error for the district court to exercise its inherent power to hold an evidentiary hearing,without undertaking a cause and prejudice analysis.
iii.knowing and intelligent waiver 
reaching now the merits,we conclude that sowell has failed to present enough evidence to rebut the presumption of a knowing and intelligent jury waiver.we review de novo the largely legal question of whether a petitioner waiver of a jury trial was knowing,intelligent,and voluntary.lott coyle,cir 
to find a constitutional error,the district court merged the validity of the waiver with the question of ineffective assistance of counsel.the district court found that 
s ince the constitution does not require an colloquy,and because the validity of a jury waiver is to be determined from the totality of the circumstances,the conduct of a defendant attorney must also be considered.in other words,counsel has a duty,along with the trial court,to ensure that the defendant understands the nature of the right and the consequences of waiving the right.counsel recommendation to waive trial by jury does not amount to constitutional ineffectiveness if the recommendation was reasonable trial strategy.
sowell anderson,no,wl,at,see also id.the duty to ensure that a criminal defendant jury trial waiver is knowing and intelligent rests primarily with the trial court,but is also shared by counsel.the district court cited no legal precedent to support its commingling of the doctrines,and this court has found none.therefore,we decline to follow the mixing approach,and instead consider each claim separately on the merits.
the only issue with regard to whether sowell waived his jury right is whether he intelligently consented.according to the supreme court,the right to jury trial in serious criminal cases is a fundamental right and hence must be recognized by the states as part of their obligation to extend due process of law to all persons within their jurisdiction.duncan louisiana,d.although under the common law,defendants were not allowed to waive this right,the supreme court has held that defendants can do so,under certain conditions 
not only must the right of the accused to a trial by a constitutional jury be jealously preserved,but the maintenance of the jury as a fact finding body in criminal cases is of such importance and has such a place in our traditions,that,before any waiver can become effective,the consent of government counsel and the sanction of the court must be had,in addition to the express and intelligent consent of the defendant.and the duty of the trial court in that regard is not to be discharged as a mere matter of rote,but with sound and advised discretion,with an eye to avoid unreasonable or undue departures from that mode of trial or from any of the essential elements thereof,and with a caution increasing in degree as the offenses dealt with increase in gravity.
patton united states.emphasis added.federal rule of criminal procedure a accordingly provides that cases in which a defendant is entitled to a jury trial shall be so tried unless the defendant waives a jury trial in writing with the approval of the court and the consent of the government.it is undisputed that sowell signed such a written waiver.see.as all of the other formal aspects of a jury waiver were complied with as well,the intelligent consent of sowell is the sole component of a jury waiver that is at issue in the present case.
the district court in this case imposed requirements on the jury waiver procedures that are not constitutionally required.compliance with the requirements of federal rule of criminal procedure a creates a presumption that the waiver is a voluntary,knowing and intelligent one.united states cochran,cir see also united states sammons,cir.although we will not presume waiver from a silent record,the burden of demonstrating that a waiver of jury trial was not valid lies with the defendant who waived it.the supreme court has expressly held that 
a determination of guilt by a court after waiver of jury trial could not be set aside and a new trial ordered except upon a plain showing that such waiver was not freely and intelligently made.if the result of the adjudicatory process is not to be set at naught,it is not asking too much that the burden of showing essential unfairness be sustained by him who claims such injustice and seeks to have the result set aside,and that it be sustained not as a matter of speculation but as a demonstrable reality.
adams united states ex rel.mccann.
this court in united states martin,cir,identified in dicta some specific aspects of a jury trial about which a defendant should have at least some knowledge before waiving a jury trial.the court observed that 
a defendant ignorant of the nature of the jury trial right can not intelligently weigh the value of the safeguard.a defendant,therefore,should have both the mental ability and some knowledge of the jury trial right before he is allowed to waive it.a technical knowledge of the jury trial right,however,is not what is required.a defendant is sufficiently informed to make an intelligent waiver if he was aware that a jury is composed of members of the community,he may participate in the selection of the jurors,the verdict of the jury must be unanimous,and that a judge alone will decide guilt or innocence should he waive his jury trial right.knowledge of these essential attributes is generally sufficient to enable a defendant to make a knowing and intelligent decision.
martin,at citations omitted.in martin,however,the court explicitly stated that there is no constitutional requirement for the trial court to conduct a colloquy with the defendant prior to a jury waiver.id.at 
in sammons,this court considered the martin passage and expressly stated that the elements of a knowing jury waiver outlined therein are not constitutionally required.see sammons,at.specifically,the sammons court stated 
the statement that this knowledge is sufficient is not,of course,equivalent to a statement that it is constitutionally required.in fact,the seventh circuit has held that a defendant who understood that the choice confronting him was,on the one hand,to be judged by a group of people from the community,and on the other hand,to have his guilt or innocence determined by a judge had knowingly and intelligently waived his right to trial by jury.
id.emphasis in original.the court went on to hold that w hile the district court failed to conduct the suggested colloquy in this action,the record does not disclose any evidence that sammons was so unaware of the rudimentary elements of trial by jury that his waiver can not stand.id.
the district court erred in treating the dicta in martin as setting forth a statement of constitutional law.see sowell,wl,at.the sixth circuit has held that in order for a jury waiver to be knowing and intelligent as a matter of constitutional law,the record must reflect at a bare minimum the following understandings on the part of the defendant that the jury is composed of twelve members of the community,that the defendant may participate in the selection of the twelve jurors,that any verdict rendered by the jury must be unanimous,and that a judge alone will decide guilt or innocence if a jury trial is waived.emphasis added.the district court added that b oth sammons and martin require that a defendant be aware of and understand that any verdict returned by a jury must be unanimous.id.sammons does not support that proposition.rather,the sammons court merely quoted martin unanimous requirement,and then stated that martin was not necessarily establishing constitutional requirements.see sammons,at.contrary to the district court decision,neither case established a constitutional requirement that the defendant understand that the verdict must be unanimous.
in applying the law,as the district court saw it,to the facts,the court found several deficiencies in sowell waiver.the first alleged deficiencies relate to what was and,more importantly,what was not contained in the colloquy between the trial court and sowell regarding his waiver of a jury trial the district court found the trial court colloquy first lacked an inquiry as to whether sowell understood that he had the right to participate in the selection of jurors.sowell,wl,at.this inquiry is recommended by martin.martin,at.however,as described above,neither sammons nor martin mandated that a colloquy discussing the defendant understanding of his role in selecting a jury was a constitutional requirement for jury waiver.martin,at sammons,at.consequently,the trial judge did not commit constitutional error by failing to include this question in the colloquy.
the district court was also disturbed that the trial court failed to ask sowell during the colloquy if he understood that the jury would decide whether or not to recommend a death sentence and that such a decision by the jury must be unanimous.sowell,wl,at.the district court also found the colloquy insufficient because the trial court did not ask sowell if anyone promised or induced him to waive his right to a jury trial or if he understood that a jury waiver would still leave him eligible a death sentence.id.martin does not list these alleged deficiencies in its passage recounting aspects of a generally sufficient colloquy,martin,at,and there is no basis for concluding that it was constitutional error for the trial court not to conduct inquiries on these specific issues.
the district court found that the sum of all of these deficiencies demonstrate d that petitioner waiver of his right to a jury trial was not knowingly made.sowell,wl,at.however,the martin court clearly held that colloquies are not constitutionally required and that an extremely perfunctory waiver with no colloquy was constitutionally adequate.martin,at.further,although capital cases do require a more extensive colloquy than other types of cases,the simple fact that the case is capital does not mandate an exhaustive colloquy.see lott,at a capital a colloquy much more perfunctory than that in the present case was constitutionally sufficient.thus,the cumulative effect of these alleged colloquy deficiencies does not require a finding that sowell waiver was not intelligent.
another deficiency that the district court found involved the virtual absence of any state court findings on the issue of whether petitioner jury trial waiver was knowing and intelligent,because t he state courts refused to inquire as to the validity of the waiver of trial by jury,beyond review of the colloquy and the waiver form.sowell,wl,at.the district court again noted in this context that the waiver colloquy was deficient in that petitioner was never advised that both verdicts had to be unanimous before a death sentence could issue.id.at emphasis in original.however,as previously noted the colloquy was not constitutionally deficient.further,ohio courts have held that it is necessary for a petitioner in a proceeding to produce more than a affidavit in order to rebut the presumption that a proceeding on the record was valid see kapper,at.thus,the ohio courts decisions to look only at the colloquy and the written waiver was reasonable.see,at ohio sowell,ohio app d.
further,the district court concluded from evidence presented at the evidentiary hearing that information conveyed either directly or indirectly from defense counsel caused sowell to believe that he would not receive a capital sentence if he waived a jury.sowell,wl,at.pinales testified at the hearing as follows 
pinales i believed that i would not be involved in a death penalty case if there was a panel.i believe d that because that was my impression of what judge crush said to me.did i convey that to my client absolutely.did i tell him that this is etched in tablets that i brought down from a mountain absolutely not.
do you recall if you would have stated it to him in terms of a promise 
no,i would not have said it as a promise.
at see also id.at i did not say to sowell,y ou waive a jury,and you will not be given the death penalty.i believe from the tone of everything i said,that was certainly the connotation,but that was could swear that i said those specific words.
the record reflects that pinales formed a strong impression from the discussions with judge crush during the conferences in this case that judge crush would not impose the death penalty.pinales,assuming he had a sound strategy that would spare sowell life,advised sowell that he should waive his right to a jury trial.sowell thought it was best to trust his attorney,so he waived his right.unfortunately for sowell,the three judge trial ended with a capital sentence.it might be significant whether pinales led sowell to believe,and whether sowell in fact believed,that the panel of judges could not deliver the death penalty because,for example,the law allowed juries but not to deliver the penalty,or whether it was only an estimation or prediction that they would not deliver it.such a distinction indicates a difference between a mistake of law which if corrected could have changed sowell choice and taking a risk to lessen the chance of a death sentence.neither the district court nor the parties focused on this distinction.they appear,to varying degrees,to assume sowell was taking a risk.this record contains no evidence that pinales told sowell that the panel of judges could not impose the death penalty,and sowell has not presented evidence to support a finding that he believed that the panel could not impose the death penalty.to the extent that the district court implied that sowell made a mistake of law,that sowell believed that a panel could not sentence him to death,it committed clear error.sowell took a litigation risk and lost these facts alone do not create a constitutional violation.
the district court conclusion that sowell did not intelligently consent to jury waiver was also based on the court findings that sowell had a low level of cognitive skills and comprehension and,limited intelligence.the former finding was supported by the district court observations of sowell during the evidentiary hearing and testimony by pinales the latter finding was supported by expert testimony.we can not say that these findings are clearly erroneous.the district court concluded that it is clear that the petitioner exhibited comprehension deficits and that petitioner decidedly misapprehended that,if he waived his right to a jury trial,he would not be sentenced to death.sowell,wl,at.even with limited cognitive skills and intelligence,however,the question still turns on just what sowell misapprehended.even with comprehension deficits and limited intelligence on the part of sowell,there is no basis for concluding that he thought that he was legally guaranteed not to be sentenced to death.the record supports at most that sowell understood his chances of avoiding the death penalty were much greater if he waived a jury trial.such misapprehension,even if exacerbated by comprehension deficits and limited intelligence,still amounts to the taking of a calculated litigation risk and thus still does not amount to a lack of intelligent consent.
the dicta in martin did not establish the precise minimal constitutional requirements for an intelligent waiver.in contrast,this court in sammons approved of the statement by the seventh circuit that there is a knowing and intelligent waiver where the defendant understood that the choice confronting him was,on the one hand,to be judged by a group of people from the community,and on the other hand,to have his guilt or innocence determined by a judge sammons,at citing united states ex rel.williams derobertis,cir.the evidence only supports a conclusion that,despite his intellectual limitations,sowell understood this choice.hence,sowell jury waiver survives constitutional scrutiny,and a writ can not issue on the ground that it did not.
iv.ineffective assistance of counsel 
as sowell made a constitutionally effective waiver of his right to a jury trial,his only remaining claim is ineffective assistance of trial counsel.sowell,however,has not demonstrated that his counsel performance was unreasonable.a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel presents a mixed question of law and fact therefore we review both the state court and district court determinations de novo.our de novo review includes both the performance and prejudice components of an ineffective assistance claim.coleman mitchell,cir citations omitted.
ineffective assistance of counsel claims are generally governed by strickland washington,d,in which the supreme court established a inquiry 
first,the defendant must show that counsel performance was deficient.this requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the sixth amendment.second,the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.this requires showing that counsel errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial,a trial whose result is reliable.unless a defendant makes both showings,it can not be said that the conviction or death sentence resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that renders the result unreliable.
strickland,at.in determining whether an attorney conduct was deficient,the supreme court stressed that the proper standard for attorney performance is that of reasonably effective assistance,viewed as of the time of counsel conduct,id.at,and considered in light of all the circumstances,id.judicial scrutiny of counsel performance must be highly deferential.id.at.because of the difficulties inherent in making the evaluation,a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance that is,the defendant must overcome the presumption that,under the circumstances,the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.id.citation omitted see also miller francis,cir cobb perini,cir.
neither the warden nor the district court cited the strickland test,apparently assuming the ineffective assistance of counsel claim was intertwined with the jury waiver claim.however,sowell must demonstrate a strickland violation to receive a writ for a violation of his sixth amendment rights because of the ineffectiveness of his counsel.
the first step of strickland requires that sowell demonstrate that pinales performance was seriously deficient.that is,sowell must overcome a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance,strickland,at,and show that pinales made errors so serious that he was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed by the sixth amendment.
pinales,however,did a constitutionally sufficient job.at the ohio jury waiver hearing,judge crush asked pinales and sowell other attorney,counsel of course have discussed this waiver with the defendant at length at.pinales replied,absolutely,your honor,and sowell other attorney agreed.id.at see also id.at sowell answering yes to judge crush question whether he had discussed the waiver with his attorneys.sixteen years later,at the district court hearing,pinales did not recall the specifics of his conversation with sowell,and only recalled that they had discussed waiving the jury.see at see also id.at pinales,when asked whether you informed sowell that his jury waiver was still a method to be convicted and sentenced to death,answering,i ca recall that specific.i probably said it,but i probably also said that,very strongly,that i believe that he would not be facing the death penalty if he waived a jury.pinales did not recall that sowell had any difficulty in understanding the jury waiver issues at the time.id.at.this evidence does not show that pinales performance was constitutionally deficient.further,the simple fact that pinales mistakenly thought that judge crush would not impose death does not mean that pinales was acting unreasonably.
furthermore,there is strong evidence that everything came down to pinales recommendation,and it did not matter how much sowell may or may not have been informed of what he was giving up and risking.both pinales and sowell testified that sowell trusted pinales implicitly,and decided to waive solely because of pinales recommendation.see at pinales testifying that billy joe totally relied on the advice that i was giving he was like a lost puppy in the jail,and i think i became his only friend.so i certainly think he relied on what i said.id.at pinales,when asked whether he recalled sowell response to the recommendation to waive a jury,replying,i ca recall specifically but i can tell you his reaction to everything.it was almost whatever i wanted to do.clearly he put his faith in me.and fate.id.at sowell,when asked why he had waived his jury trial,answering,because i had faith and conviction and belief in my attorney id.at sowell,when asked whether in deciding to waive his right to a jury he considered anything other than pinales recommendation,answering,no.no.everything appears to come down to whether pinales had a reasonable basis for thinking that judge crush would not impose a death sentence.the district court did not consider this issue,and the record does not show that pinales had no reasonable basis for so thinking.
pinales recommended that sowell take a calculated risk,which he did.there was no evidence that pinales guaranteed sowell a result,or misstated the law.the district court found that pinales advised sowell that he would be spared the death penalty if he waived jury trial.sowell,wl,at.while this statement can be read in different ways,if the statement by the district court amounted to a finding of fact that pinales guaranteed that sowell would not be sentenced to death,the record does not support such a conclusion.pinales on a number of occasions specifically stated that he did not tell sowell that he would be ineligible for the death penalty if he waived his right to a jury.at pinales admitted that he probably told sowell that a death sentence was still an option if he waived a jury id.at i did not say to sowell,you waive a jury,and you will not be given the death penalty.pinales explicitly stated that he read the jury waiver to sowell.id.at i sure i must have read the jury waiver form to sowell id.at my recollection now is i sat at the table,read it to him,showed him where to sign.although pinales might now,over sixteen years later,approach the situation differently,his actions on the record of this case,concerning his advice to sowell regarding the jury waiver,did not fall below a minimal level of professional competency,and thus did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.
the court is not required to address both components of strickland if one component fails.strickland,at.thus,as sowell did not demonstrate that his counsel performed below an objectively reasonable level,the court need not discuss the prejudice component.
because sowell has failed to demonstrate that the state court proceedings denied him either his right to trial by jury or his right to effective assistance of counsel,he has failed to demonstrate that those proceedings were fundamentally unfair.we therefore reverse the judgment of the district court granting the writ of habeas corpus.
i respectfully dissent because billy joe sowell sowell waiver of his constitutional right to a jury trial was neither knowing nor intelligent.what the majority labels as a calculated risk undertaken by sowell,i consider to be the height of uncertainty because sowell,an abnormally unintelligent individual,was not aware that he could still receive the death penalty if he waived his right to a jury trial.in light of the standards of review that we must apply,i would affirm the district court grant of a conditional writ of habeas corpus because a jury trial waiver is not knowing and intelligent when a defendant is not aware that he or she could be sentenced to death.
risk is not synonymous with uncertainty.whereas risk can be managed,uncertainty is immeasurable and wild.the calculation of risk centers upon an estimation of potential loss versus potential benefit.accordingly,risk can not be managed without some knowledge of the possible downside.just as even the most sports gambler or venture capitalist would not place a bet or make an investment without knowing the size of the financial stake being risked the amount that could be lost,a criminal defendant can not fully understand the ramifications of waiving his or her right to a jury trial without knowing the potential loss that could result.such a concept resonates with even more intensity when a defendant has limited cognitive abilities.
the filing of sowell habeas petition before the enactment of aedpa impacts our review of the state court proceedings.we review de novo a state court d eterminations of law,or determinations involving mixed questions of fact and law.mapes coyle,cir.a writ of habeas corpus must be issued if the state court proceedings were fundamentally unfair as a result of a violation of the constitution or laws or treaties of the united states.powell collins,cir.the failure of the state trial court to ensure that sowell knowingly and intelligently waived his right to a jury trial in accordance with the constitutional guarantees afforded to criminal defendants rendered the state proceedings fundamentally unfair.
the primacy of the jury trial represents one of the pillars upon which our criminal justice system rests.see duncan louisiana,d t rial by jury in criminal cases is fundamental to the american scheme of justice const.art.iii,the trial of all crimes shall be by jury const.amend.vi in all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to an impartial jury.trial by jury is the normal and,with occasional exceptions,the preferable mode of disposing of issues of fact in criminal cases above the grade of petty offenses.patton united states.even though the right of the accused to a trial by a constitutional jury must be jealously preserved,a defendant can waive this core right,but only when certain safeguards have been satisfied.b efore any waiver can become effective the express and intelligent consent of the defendant must be obtained.id.t he duty of the trial court in that regard is not to be discharged as a mere matter of rote,but with sound and advised discretion,with an eye to avoid unreasonable or undue departures from that mode of trial or from any of the essential elements thereof,and with a caution increasing in degree as the offenses dealt with increase in gravity.id.at.emphasis added.
