in schlesinger councilman,d,the supreme court held that principles of comity,respect for the expertise of military judges,and judicial economy weigh against federal court intervention in pending proceedings and in favor of requiring exhaustion of all available remedies within the military justice system before a federal court collateral review councilman abstention.
timothy hennis appeals the district court decision to abstain,on the basis of councilman,and dismiss without prejudice hennis petition for a writ of habeas corpus challenging the united states army army exercise of jurisdiction over him.hennis asserts that the district court abused its discretion in its application of councilman abstention because,among other things,the extraordinary circumstances of his case justify equitable intervention by a federal court.we disagree and,therefore,affirm.
the factual and procedural history in this matter stretches over more than two decades.because much of this history is not particularly relevant to our disposition,we provide only a brief summary below.
on july,while serving as an enlisted army soldier stationed at fort bragg,north carolina,hennis was convicted in north carolina superior court on one count of rape and three counts of premeditated murder,and,thereafter,sentenced to death.on october,the supreme court of north carolina reversed his conviction and ordered a new trial.see state hennis.
on april,at retrial,hennis was acquitted of all charges.thereafter,hennis resumed his enlisted service in the army.pertinent to his contentions in this matter,it is undisputed that hennis was issued a discharge from the army on june,and reenlisted in the army one day later,on june.hennis retired from the army on july.
in,a cold case review,conducted by the north carolina state bureau of investigation,revealed that preserved dna evidence,obtained from a vaginal swab of the victim that hennis had been accused of raping and murdering in connection with his and trials,matched the dna profile of hennis.in response to that revelation,on september,the army recalled hennis from retired status to active duty to face charges for triple murder.
on december,before commencement of his,hennis filed a motion before the military trial court seeking a dismissal of all military charges,arguing that the army lacked jurisdiction over him.on april,the military trial court denied hennis motion to dismiss.
thereafter,on may,pursuant to the all writs act,hennis filed interlocutory petitions for a writ of mandamus,writ of habeas corpus,and writ of prohibition with the army court of criminal appeals.hennis petitions asserted jurisdictional challenges to the army authority and requested enjoinment of the proceedings.on may,the army court of criminal appeals issued an order staying the proceedings,but on june,it denied hennis petitions.
on july,hennis submitted a petition to the military highest court,the court of appeals for the armed forces formerly known as the united states court of military appeals on september,the court of appeals for the armed forces denied hennis petition without prejudice to seek review of his claims,including his challenges to the army jurisdiction,within the military justice system appellate review process afforded by.on october,the army court of criminal appeals lifted the stay of hennis proceedings.
on december,hennis initiated this matter by filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to in the united states district court for the eastern district of north carolina.hennis argued that his discharge from the army,his break in service between june,and june,deprived the army of jurisdiction to him for conduct that occurred before june.hennis argued that the supreme court decision in hirshberg cooke,was dispositive on the issue of the army lack of jurisdiction.
in hirshberg,the supreme court,recognizing longstanding jurisdictional interpretations of the army and navy,stated that 
except in cases of offenses in violation of article of the articles for the government of the navy,there is no authority of law giving jurisdiction to a to try an enlisted man for an offense committed in a prior enlistment from which he has an honorable discharge,regardless of the fact that he has subsequently reenlisted in the naval service and was serving under such reenlistment at the time the jurisdiction of the court was asserted.
id.at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in essence,the rule recognized in hirshberg is that once a servicemember is discharged,that servicemember can not be brought to a for any crimes that occurred before the discharge hirshberg rule.although the contours of this rule have since changed it is undisputed that the hirshberg rule applied to hennis and the army in june.
on january,the army moved to dismiss hennis petition for a writ of habeas corpus or,in the alternative,for summary judgment.in support of its motion,the army cited,among other decisions,the decision by the court of appeals for the armed forces in united states clardy,which held that where a servicemember is discharged prior to the expiration of his service contract ets date for the specific purpose of immediate reenlistment,he can be tried for offenses committed in the earlier enlistment.id.at footnote omitted clardy exception see also willenbring united states,cir.stating that t he clardy case reinforced the longstanding military tradition that,when an enlisted servicemember is discharged in order to reenlist before the expiration of his service,military jurisdiction continues,when there is no hiatus between the two enlistments internal quotation marks and citations omitted,cert.denied,d.
under the terms of the clardy exception,a discharge,a discharge given to a servicemember even before he completes his obligated term of service,clardy,at,does not deprive the military of jurisdiction because the servicemember never enters civil status and,consequently,never has a break in service for purposes of the hirshberg rule.
critically,a service member ets date must generally remain unlapsed at the time of discharge for the clardy exception to apply to the hirshberg rule.if the ets date has already lapsed at the time of discharge,the clardy exception does not apply,and the military loses jurisdiction for conduct that occurred before the discharge.see clardy,at noting that i f the servicemember had received a discharge after he had completed his actual,obligated,term of service,or had received any other discharge that unconditionally released him from the service jurisdiction would ha ve been permanently lost over offenses committed prior to such discharge this was true even though the person later might have reenlisted footnote and citations omitted see also hirshberg,at.
here,based on the clardy exception to the hirshberg rule,the army argued that it never lost jurisdiction because,among other reasons,hennis executed a reenlistment contract on june,confirming that hennis discharge on june,was for the purpose of reenlistment on june,and hennis ets date,date that his previous enlistment was scheduled to end would not have lapsed until june.by contrast,hennis argued that,on several alternative grounds,his ets date lapsed before his june,discharge.thus,there was and remains an open factual dispute between the parties regarding the date on which hennis previous term of enlistment was to end.
the district court,however,did not reach the merits of this matter because it determined that hennis petition for a writ of habeas corpus should be dismissed on the basis of the abstention principles set forth in councilman.in councilman,the supreme court held that when a serviceman charged with crimes by military authorities can show no harm other than that attendant to resolution of his case in the military court system,the federal district courts must refrain from intervention,by way of injunction or otherwise.id.at.
on march,the district court dismissed hennis petition for a writ of habeas corpus without prejudice.the district court concluded that a ttempting to resolve hennis jurisdictional challenges would be inappropriate at this time with a court martial in progress t his court,like that in councilman,discerns nothing that outweighs the strong considerations favoring exhaustion of remedies or that warrants intruding on the integrity of the military court processes.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.hennis appealed,and he also filed with this court a motion for injunctive relief,seeking a stay of his proceedings pending the resolution of his appeal.on april,this court denied hennis motion for injunctive relief 
notably,hennis petition for a writ of habeas corpus is not a collateral attack on his military conviction or death sentence,since,at the time of his petition to the district court,there was no conviction or death sentence to attack.instead,hennis petition is a collateral attack upon the army jurisdiction to convene the and the refusal of the military trial court to dismiss the charges.hennis challenges in this appeal the decision of the district court to abstain from considering the merits of his jurisdictional challenge on the basis of councilman.
this court reviews a district court decision to abstain for abuse of discretion.see,nivens gilchrist,cir reviewing for abuse of discretion the district court decision to abstain under younger harris,d richmond,fredericksburg potomac forst,cir same.a district court abuses its discretion whenever its decision is guided by erroneous legal principles.martin stewart,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
initially,hennis asserts that the district court abused its discretion by treating councilman abstention as mandatory rather than discretionary.hamdan rumsfeld,d declining to apply councilman abstention where petitioner was not a service member councilman,at.noting,in dicta,that w e have no occasion to attempt to define those circumstances,if any,in which equitable intervention into pending proceedings might be justified new cohen,discussing two exceptions to councilman abstention one for civilians and other persons indisputably not service members and one for service members who have exhausted all available administrative remedies for claims otherwise in the military justice system.our review of the district court order reveals no such error.
to be sure,we need not,and therefore do not,decide whether councilman abstention is a mandatory doctrine subject to exceptions or a discretionary doctrine.the procedural posture and holding of councilman suggest that abstention is a mandatory doctrine subject to exceptions.at.reversing the district court decision to intervene,holding that federal district courts must refrain from intervention,by way of injunction or otherwise into pending proceedings when a serviceman charged with crimes by military authorities can show no harm other than that attendant to resolution of his case in the military court system.on the other hand,the standard of review,abuse of discretion applied by a federal appellate court when considering a federal district court abstention decision suggests that abstention determinations are committed to the sound discretion of the trial court.see,nivens,at.
here,even if we assume that councilman abstention is discretionary,the record reflects that the district court engaged in some weighing and balancing of considerations identified in councilman favoring and disfavoring federal court intervention into pending military proceedings.the district court discussed the supreme court decisions to intervene rather than abstain in hamdan,and toth quarles,but,nonetheless,concluded that hennis status does not present the unique circumstances of hamdan or toth that mandate federal court intervention into an ongoing court martial.in the end,the district court held that this court discerns nothing that outweighs the strong considerations favoring exhaustion of remedies or that warrants intruding on the integrity of the military court processes.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.because the district court engaged in an analysis that weighed and balanced considerations in favor of and against federal court intervention,we can not agree with hennis contention that the district court abused its discretion by erroneously treating councilman abstention as mandatory rather than discretionary.
in the alternative,even if we assume that councilman abstention is indeed a mandatory doctrine,the district court engaging in discretionary weighing and balancing would amount to nothing more than harmless error because the district court abstained and dismissed the matter.see.t he court must disregard all errors and defects that do not affect any party substantial rights.on the hearing of any appeal the court shall give judgment without regard to errors or defects which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties.
on appeal,hennis argues that,for various reasons,the district court abused its discretion in applying councilman abstention because councilman comity rationale for abstention is not implicated by his jurisdictional challenge.we disagree.
councilman identifies two considerations of comity that together favor abstention pending completion of ongoing proceedings against service personnel.hamdan,at.while the peculiar demands of federalism that underlie younger abstention in the context of pending state court criminal proceedings are not implicated by federal court intervention into military proceedings,the supreme court stated in councilman that th is deficiency is supplied by factors equally compelling to support a comity rationale.councilman,at.
the first consideration identified in councilman arises from the unique role of the military in preparing for and fighting in wars,which requires the military to insist upon a respect for duty and a discipline without counterpart in civilian life.id.hence,the efficient operation s of the armed forces are best served if the military justice system acts without regular interference from civilian courts.hamdan,at.citation omitted.a central feature of this military discipline consideration is that t he military is a specialized society separate from civilian society with laws and traditions of its own developed during its long history.councilman,at.internal quotation marks,alterations,and citation omitted.in light of the military history and specialized society,comity further ensures that whatever federal court review is available after all available military remedies are exhausted will be informed and narrowed by the military own decisions,which avoids duplicative proceedings and may obviate the need for federal court intervention.id.at.
the second consideration identified in councilman arises from the respect that federal courts should have for the balance that congress struck between military preparedness and fairness to individual service members when it created an integrated system of military courts and review procedures,a critical element of which is the court of appeals for the armed forces consisting of civilian judges completely removed from all military influence or persuasion.hamdan,at.internal quotation marks,alterations,and citations omitted see also councilman,at.indeed,abstention in the face of ongoing proceedings is justified by our expectation that the military court system established by congress with its substantial procedural protections and provision for appellate review by independent civilian judges will vindicate servicemen constitutional rights.hamdan,at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
thus,federal courts are not at liberty to presume that the decision of the military courts would be otherwise than is required by the fundamental law of the land.councilman,at.internal quotation marks,alterations,and citations omitted.consequently,comity generally requires that a service member first exhaust all available military remedies before seeking federal court intervention into pending proceedings.see,new,at in connection with proceedings,the exhaustion requirement articulated in councilman is particularly important.
hennis argues that he exhausted all available military remedies prior to his and,because the comity rationale ceased to exist upon his exhaustion of such remedies,the district court abused its discretion
