wyman castleberry was convicted in an ohio state court of aggravated murder and aggravated robbery.after exhausting his state court remedies,castleberry petitioned the district court for a writ of habeas corpus.he argued that the prosecution withheld the following evidence in violation of brady maryland,d a statement by the victim describing his assailant in a way inconsistent with castleberry appearance,a statement to detectives indicating that the prosecution key witness had been plotting to rob the victim,and statements by neighbors of the victim describing suspicious individuals in the vicinity of the shooting who did not match castleberry appearance.the district court denied the writ.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the judgment of the district court and grant castleberry a conditional writ of habeas corpus that will result in the vacation of his conviction and sentence unless the state of ohio commences a new trial against him within days after this judgment becomes final.
background 
the charges against castleberry arose from the shooting of jose soriano,resulting in soriano death several months later.following a mistrial in july of,a second jury trial commenced in february of and concluded nine days later.castleberry was sentenced to life with parole eligibility after twenty years,plus three years of additional incarceration for the use of a firearm.
the following facts are based upon the summary provided by the ohio court of appeals in its de novo review of the final order by the state trial court denying castleberry petition for relief 
on march,detectives david morris and sharon ceckitti were dispatched to soriano apartment,which was located across the street from jason bar and near a grassy area where people from the neighborhood often gathered.soriano could not be interviewed at the scene due to his wound.from the time of the shooting until soriano death several months later,there were no significant leads in the case.morris eventually interviewed soriano parents,however,which led to his contacting kenneth chief thomas.
detectives morris and ceckitti interviewed thomas at the orient correctional institution in september of,where he was incarcerated as the result of a conviction for receiving property stolen from apartments adjacent to soriano.morris testified that right off the bat he thomas said wyman castleberry did it.according to morris,thomas did not make any requests prior to the interview,but the detective later received a request from thomas attorney to write a letter to a judge on thomas behalf.morris acknowledged that he wrote the letter and that thomas was granted early release from prison.
testifying for the prosecution,thomas said that he went to jason bar at on the evening of the shooting with his friend carl skeeter gamble.he claimed to have seen castleberry,whom he says he knew from the neighborhood,walk across the street toward the back of soriano apartment while holding a small gun,knock on the back door,and then ask for a bag of weed.thomas testified that he heard a single gunshot a couple seconds after soriano opened the door and that he then saw castleberry exit the apartment.according to thomas,castleberry asked him to say nothing to nobody about what happened when they saw each other the next day at jason bar.
parts of thomas testimony were supported by the testimony of other witnesses.one was thomas friend gamble,who testified that he had been drinking with thomas at jason bar on the night of the shooting and that he saw castleberry at the bar.according to gamble,castleberry was talking about robbing the dope man,the dude that sells weed.gamble claimed that castleberry had a gun with him as he walked up to soriano apartment,knocked on the door,and then there was a fire off.he said that later,at jason bar,castleberry told him that the dude tried to grab the gun and he shot it and the gun went off.morris,in his testimony,said that when he first questioned gamble,there was an indication that gamble was not telling the truth.gamble eventually told the truth,however,after gamble was told what thomas had said to the detectives and gamble father made a comment to his son.
another jason bar patron who supported thomas testimony was thomas bailey.bailey took the stand to say that he had heard a gunshot and,approximately one hour later,castleberry had said the guy tried to take the gun from him and it went off.
still another prosecution witness supporting thomas was orlando wilborn,who testified that he,his brother thomas wilborn,chief thomas,and gamble had been drinking at his house on the evening of the shooting.he said that some time after thomas and gamble left his house,he and his brother went to jason bar.according to orlando wilborn,he was standing near the bar when he heard a gunshot.he said that he immediately ran to his car,where his brother,who was already at the car,remarked t hose guys are crazy,they tried to rob the weed spot.
wilborn brother,thomas wilborn,also testifying for the prosecution,said that after getting a drink at jason bar,he went across the street to the grassy area to join a group of about to people,and that castleberry was standing among them with a gun.he claimed that someone in the group spoke of a place where you buy marijuana.at the time he heard the gunshot,thomas wilborn said,he could see both his roommate lamont martin and thomas standing near a wall in the grassy area.
martin was the prosecution final witness.he claimed that he saw castleberry go behind the apartment complex across the street while martin,gamble,and thomas walked to the front of the complex.according to martin,he was on his way to see if he castleberry was going to rob the dope man when he heard a gunshot and ran back to the bar.
castleberry testified on his own behalf.he claimed that he did not know soriano,had never been to soriano apartment,never owned a firearm,and did not have one in his possession on the night of the shooting.
another defense witness was james correy,who lived in soriano apartment complex.he said that on the night of the shooting he heard a gunshot as he went to answer a knock at his door by a man he identified only as albert.albert pushed him back into the apartment,from where they observed two men running between the apartments.
castleberry mother also testified for the defense.she said that on july,during the first trial that was subsequently declared a mistrial,she overheard thomas say to someone in the hallway outside of the courtroom i do know what good i can do when all i did was walk in and find him.
the conflicting testimony of the witnesses was the sole evidence presented at trial.no physical or forensic evidence was introduced to link castleberry to the crime.
