opinion of the court 
appellant percy william travillion travillion,is appealing a decision of the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania denying relief sought pursuant to.we must address two issues certified for appeal whether trial counsel was ineffective for failing properly to a witness and failing to file a motion challenging whether the conspiracies charged in counts nine and thirteen of the indictment violated the fifth amendment prohibition against double jeopardy.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm the decision of the district court.
travillion was indicted by a grand jury in on three counts related to a large drug trade in the greater pittsburgh area,in violation of and a,b a iii at trial,travillion raised the defenses that he was not a member of either conspiracy in counts nine and thirteen,and also that the drug at issue in the count ten possession charge was heroin,not crack the united states called five witnesses,including michael good,the main supplier of drugs to travillion key to the presentation of evidence was a series of phone call wiretaps,including a call between good and travillion on december.respecting this call,good testified he was checking whether or not travillion needed drugs before good left town for a couple of days,and that what was being discussed was five ounces of crack,totaling travillion attorney good on his and travillion addiction histories,the inability of good to obtain crack around december,good cooperation with the government for a reduced sentence,and travillion role in the larger organization.
travillion took the stand in his own defense,countering good testimony and claiming what was being discussed in the december phone call was not crack but rather was nine bundles of heroin,with a value of only on,the government challenged travillion on the weight and type of drugs he testified to,because heroin was not what he typically sold nor was the amount the quantity of any drug he typically purchased.travillion was convicted by a jury on all three counts,and sentenced to months imprisonment on appeal,this circuit affirmed the decision of the district court see united states travillion,cir.
travillion then filed a motion in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania,seeking to vacate,set aside,or correct his sentence by adjusting the advisory guidelines down two levels this motion alleged four reasons for collateral relief under an ineffective assistance of counsel claim 
trial counsel failed to effectively investigate and government witnesses,trial counsel failed to effectively investigate facts made known to him by petitioner constituting petitioner only realistic defense,trial counsel failed to adequately advise petitioner on the risk in his testifying on his own behalf,and trial counsel failed to adequately object to petitioner conviction on two separate counts that comprised the same conspiracy,thus exposing petitioner to double jeopardy.
travillion united states,wl,at,internal citation and quotation marks omitted.the district court denied the motion,noting that while counsel performance may have been deficient on certain issues,travillion was not prejudiced,as the evidence presented against him was overwhelming.id.at.this appeal followed.
travillion now argues counsel performance was ineffective because he failed to impeach good with his own prior testimony in a contemporaneous and factually similar case,titled by the parties as the ferguson retrial.see united states ferguson,cir affirming retrial decision by the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania.travillion also contends that counsel failed to object on double jeopardy grounds to the indictment charging two separate conspiracies in counts nine and thirteen,which caused him to be twice punished with a special assessment and an extra concurrent term of supervised release for a single conspiracy.travillion now seeks an order vacating and remanding for a new trial,or in the alternative,remanding for an evidentiary hearing.
ii.standard of 
section motion 
as a collateral challenge,a motion pursuant to is reviewed much less favorably than a direct appeal of the sentence.see,united states frady,d.indeed,relief under is available only when the claimed error of law was a fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice,and present s exceptional circumstances where the need for the remedy afforded by the writ is apparent.davis united states,d quoting hill united states,d.while issues resolved in a prior direct appeal will not be reviewed again by way of a motion united states derewal,cir,they may,however,be used to support a claim for ineffectiveness.see graziano united states,cir per curiam noting claims of error under the sentencing guidelines are generally not cognizable on collateral review unless to support an ineffectiveness claim.
in a review,we usually have the advantage of a opinion from the district judge who presided over the original trial.accordingly,the district judge is not limited to a cold written record,but is uniquely familiar with the overall circumstances of the original case.a motion under is entered on the docket of the original criminal case and is typically referred to the judge who originally presided over the challenged proceedings wall kholi,d.although a motion is sometimes loosely referred to as a habeas corpus motion,unlike a habeas petition,which usually concerns cases that arose in state court,a challenge is a motion to vacate,set aside or correct a sentence imposed in federal court.section is a corrective action,united states hock,cir per curiam,and unlike a petition,which is a separate civil action,a motion is a further step in the criminal process,united states nahodil,cir see also united states thomas,cir noting that section creates a statutory remedy consisting of a motion before the court where a movant was convicted internal citation and quotation marks omitted emphasis in original.
reviewing standard 
in a proceeding,we exercise plenary review of the district court legal conclusions and apply a clearly erroneous standard to the court factual findings.lambert blackwell,cir.the standard of review for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was set forth in strickland washington,d.to prove ineffective assistance of counsel,the movant must show 
first,that counsel performance was deficient.this requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the sixth amendment.second,the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.this requires showing that counsel errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial,a trial whose result is reliable.
at.thus,to prove a valid claim,travillion must show both deficiency and prejudice.id.
as the supreme court has stated,the constitution guarantees criminal defendants only a fair trial and a competent attorney.it does not insure that defense counsel will recognize and raise every conceivable constitutional claim.engle isaac,d.on review,we must indulge a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within a wide range of reasonable professional assistance.berryman morton,cir quoting strickland,at.in essence,the defendant must show that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness meaning reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.id.quoting strickland,at.regarding the interplay between strickland and,if travillion shows both elements of strickland,he satisfies the requirements of.see united states rad o lite of,cir p ersons can attack a conviction for fundamental defects,such as ineffective assistance of counsel.
iii.discussion 
we now turn to the two certified ineffective assistance of counsel claims before us.first,travillion claims that counsel was ineffective because he failed to michael good,on matters that would have undermined good credibility and supported travillion defense,particularly on the crack possession charge,from readily available transcripts of good testimony in the ferguson retrial.appellant br.at.second,travillion avers that counsel failure to challenge the conspiracy indictment s on double jeopardy grounds also constituted deficient performance where t he circumstances of the case amply satisfied the nominal burden required to challenge at the pretrial stage.id.travillion contends both failures of counsel prejudiced the outcome of his trial because they resulted in multiple convictions and increased sentences.
we begin,as above,with the steps outlined in strickland.at.we may address the prejudice prong first i f it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice.id.at.we will address both claims in turn,undertaking plenary review,and reminding ourselves that both deficiency and prejudice must be proven to have a valid claim for relief.id.at.
failure to adequately cross examine 
travillion avers that trial counsel performance was deficient for failing to obtain the prior testimony and michael good with contradictory and impeachment evidence from the ferguson retrial,and these errors significantly prejudiced the outcome of the trial.
in determining prejudice,a court hearing an ineffectiveness claim must consider the totality of the evidence before the judge or jury.strickland,at.travillion claims counsel prejudiced his defense,and that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.at.this alleged prejudice concerns the failure of trial counsel to utilize statements made by good at the ferguson retrial to impeach his statement that he sold travillion crack and failing to bring up good prior testimony on his mental health issues for example,during the ferguson retrial,good testified he could not remember the terminology he used for drugs with buyers and which drug he sold to another dealer in a prior deal.see appellant br.at citing app.vol.vii at.
good i served them their drugs that day,i know that.i remember that.
attorney when you say you served them their drugs,what are you referring to 
good heroin,cocaine.
attorney do you recall which one as you sit there 
good no.i do recall which that he got that day.
app.vol.vii at.travillion argues good inability to remember the type of drug sold undermines his testimony that travillion purchased crack on december,rather than heroin,as travillion alleges.this forms the basis of travillion assertion that good confusion,along with his testimony in the ferguson retrial to occasionally selling small quantities or bundles of heroin would have created reasonable doubt that the december phone conversation referenced crack.travillion argues that there is a reasonable probability that,had counsel more aggressively good,the jury would have acquitted or deadlocked on the crack possession charge.this,in turn,would have altered travillion sentence in two ways first,by exposing him to one less concurrent term of supervised release and one less special assessment and second,by precluding the district court assessment of a upward adjustment for obstruction of justice,based on its conclusion that travillion perjured himself when he testified that the drug at issue was heroin,not crack see appellant br.at.
the district court,in denying relief,held the petitioner narrow focus on the minutiae of counsel is misguided.travillion,wl,at.as the district court determined,e ven if counsel actions were deficient,there can be no prejudice because the evidence was otherwise overwhelming.id.at.this conclusion was based on the totality of the circumstances of trial evidence.the district court cited good open admi ssion that he was serving a sentence for drug trafficking crimes as well as incriminating wiretap evidence and the testimony of other witnesses against the petitioner,including sherri hunter,keeley sowell,and special agent jimenez.id.at.
like the district court,we also do not find trial counsel actions to have prejudiced travillion.the right to a fair trial does not translate into the right to a perfect trial.see gov t of the bradshaw,cir see also united states wilensky,cir.the supreme court has stated v igorous,presentation of contrary evidence,and careful instruction on the burden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means of attacking shaky but admissible evidence.daubert merrell dow,d.
it is true that circuit courts,including ours,have found counsel deficient for failing to a witness with prior inconsistent statements,see,berryman morton,cir noting the failure to using inconsistent statements from a prior trial to be deficient nixon newsome,cir determining deficiency by trial counsel for failing to confront the witness with evidence available in the transcript,however,this is not ultimately decisive under the prejudice prong.
nevertheless,the collective evidence presented by the government and the evidence elicited by trial counsel in his of good shows travillion was not prejudiced,as the outcome of the trial would not have been different.counsel strategies,as expressed in his closing argument,were to attack the credibility of good as a witness,call into question his recollection of what drug he sold to travillion,and establish a defense that travillion was not a with good,and travillion possessed heroin,not crack.counsel stated 
i f you listen to the conversations,the words,there is no question that travillion possessed heroin on that day with the intent to distribute it to someone else what we are arguing is the drug.
police say anything about the of substance no keeley say anything about that no.sherri hunter no.lamont washington no.no physical evidence.was arrested with any stuff.no drugs seized.no drugs found.no statement.no surveillance,whether it just be eyeball from police officers or videotape.nothing.
it boils down to,folks,to michael good.
i am going to argue to you that the facts and circumstances are going to demonstrate to you that it was heroin,not coke.
before we get to that,central to our theme,the government theme to get a conviction on that,you guys need to believe michael good no doubt about it,did michael good present himself to you as someone who has a firm grasp of the facts long drug history.
and then we are being asked questions about an event four years ago.imagine yourself without drug history,and fried brain cells,being asked what happened four years ago.it would be very,very difficult.
app.vol.v at.counsel was able to employ this strategy effectively through his of good,during which he elicited testimony of good addictions his lack of memory of specific events and his exchange of testimony for a reduced sentence 
travillion testified and claimed instead the drug discussed on december was heroin.on cross,however,travillion undermined his own testimony by admitting the conversation was the first ever dealing of heroin between the two further,travillion also admitted that good typically sold in large quantities,much larger than what travillion claims was being discussed in the call.
finally,it must further be noted that the district court jury charge informed the jury regarding good that 
t he testimony of an alleged accomplice,someone who said he or she participated in the commission of a crime,must be examined and weighed by the jury with greater care 
michael good may be considered to be an alleged accomplice in this case or related cases.
the jury must determine whether the testimony of the accomplices has been affected by their or by their own agreements with the government you should never convict a defendant solely upon the unsupported testimony of an accomplice unless you believe the testimony beyond a reasonable doubt.
app.vol.v at emphasis added.this charge further protected travillion by instructing the jury to heavily scrutinize good testimony as a key witness for the government 
nothing in the evidence presented shows that counsel errors in his of good were so serious,in light of all the evidence and jury instruction,to deprive the defendant of a trial whose result is reliable.see strickland,at.the totality of the evidence presented,and jury instruction concerning the reliability of good testimony,c
