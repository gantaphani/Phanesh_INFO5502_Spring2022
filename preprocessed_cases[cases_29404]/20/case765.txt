in,donald hardcastle was charged by the philadelphia district attorney office with murder,arson,and burglary.he was tried before a jury in the court of common pleas,convicted on all counts,and sentenced to death.in both his direct appeal and state collateral review proceedings,hardcastle asserted,inter alia,that the assistant district attorney who conducted the jury selection at his trial exercised her peremptory strikes in a racially discriminatory manner,thus violating the constitutional principle recognized by the supreme court in batson kentucky,d,and made applicable to hardcastle direct appeal by griffith kentucky,d.the pennsylvania supreme court twice rejected hardcastle batson claim and affirmed his conviction.
hardcastle then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus with the district court.the district court concluded that the pennsylvania supreme court ruling was both contrary to and an unreasonable application of batson,granted hardcastle petition,and ordered a new trial.for the reasons set forth below,we hold that the pennsylvania supreme court rejection of hardcastle claim on the record before it was indeed an objectively unreasonable application of batson.however,because the commonwealth of pennsylvania had requested,and been denied,a chance to present evidence in support of its peremptory strikes of from the venire,it is entitled to a hearing to present that evidence.we will,therefore,remand this matter to the district court to hold such a hearing and to then reexamine the application of batson to hardcastle claim.
factual background and procedural history 
the following material facts are drawn from the opinions issued in this case by the pennsylvania supreme court and the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.see commonwealth hardcastle,direct appeal proceedings hardcastle i commonwealth hardcastle,appeal of relief proceedings hardcastle ii hardcastle horn,wl.june,federal habeas corpus proceedings hardcastle iii.they are not in dispute.
on may,the bodies of joseph gregg and ernestine dennis were found in gregg philadelphia home.both had received in excess of thirty stab wounds and gregg home had been set on fire.several neighbors indicated that they had seen hardcastle near gregg home around the time of the murders.an arrest warrant was issued and hardcastle surrendered to the police on may.he was subsequently charged with burglary,two counts of arson,and two counts of murder.
hardcastle is an.during the course of jury selection at his trial,the prosecutor used her peremptory strikes,of which she had a total of twenty,to remove twelve of the fourteen members of the venire.the jury ultimately empaneled to hear the case contained only one.hardcastle trial counsel did not object to the commonwealth peremptory challenges during the voir dire,and the trial court therefore did not require the prosecutor to state the bases for her strikes on the record.however,following voir dire,hardcastle counsel moved for a mistrial on the grounds that the prosecutor use of the peremptory challenges violated both the state and federal constitutions.applying the standard articulated in swain alabama,d,the trial court denied this motion.the trial court similarly denied the prosecutor request for permission to state her reasons for the challenged strikes on the record 
after trial,hardcastle was convicted of two counts of first degree murder,two counts of arson,and one count of burglary.motions were filed,arguing,inter alia,that the prosecutor exercised her peremptory strikes in a discriminatory manner,thus violating hardcastle constitutional rights.a en banc panel of the court of common pleas was convened to hear the motions.at this hearing,counsel for hardcastle repeatedly requested an evidentiary hearing on the discriminatory strikes.in reply,the assistant district attorney stated that,in view of the fact that the trial had occurred six months earlier,she could not offer reasons for her strikes of black jurors and that it was no longer possible to reconstruct the voir dire.an evidentiary hearing was not granted but the panel,by a two to one vote,granted hardcastle a new trial on the jury selection issue.
on appeal,the pennsylvania superior court reversed the grant of a new trial and affirmed the conviction,holding that hardcastle failed to make the showing required by the standard established in swain.the pennsylvania supreme court initially granted allocatur but then dismissed the appeal as improvidently granted.on remand,hardcastle was sentenced to death for the murders of gregg and dennis,to to years for arson,and to to years for burglary.
following sentencing,hardcastle again appealed to the pennsylvania supreme court.by the time his case was heard by that court in november,the united states supreme court had issued its decision in batson,thereby lessening the evidentiary burden imposed on defendants in hardcastle position.as noted by the pennsylvania supreme court,this change in controlling precedent complicated its task 
the case before us presents a difficult problem for review.since the supreme court decision in batson appellant judgment of sentence,the defense did not object to the prosecutor use of peremptory challenges at the time of voir dire,the prosecution did not rebut the objection,and the trial court did not rule on the issue.defense counsel did,however,preserve the issue by making a motion for a mistrial,subsequent to voir dire and prior to trial,based on the prosecutor impermissible use of the challenges.because the issue was preserved appellant is entitled to the protections granted by batson.therefore,we must make a post hoc evaluation of the record,examining each of the commonwealth fourteen peremptory challenges to determine whether appellant has made out a prima facie case of improper use.
hardcastle i,at citation and footnote omitted.
however,rather than remanding the case to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing,the pennsylvania supreme court combed through the record itself in an effort to determine whether bases existed for the challenged strikes.after conducting this analysis,it identified the following as potential bases for the dismissal of venirepersons through the first had a sister that had been raped several years before hardcastle trial the second admitted during voir dire that she had heard about the case through media reports the third was questioned in detail by both sides about her work in caring for delinquent children,her education,and her family history the court noted that this extensive questioning gave the commonwealth attorney ample opportunity to observe responses and demeanor the fourth had a sister and nephew who had been arrested for crimes,as well as a father who had been a victim in a separate crime the fifth initially testified that she would not follow the judge instructions if she felt that something else was better law,but later stated after further questioning that she would follow the judge instructions the sixth had attended her brother trial,in which he was convicted on robbery charges the seventh was a for the commonwealth and had a brother who had been a victim of violent crime the eighth was a registered nurse who had six children,one of whom,a son,had been convicted of rape the ninth was a unemployed high school graduate and the tenth was a single bartender who initially indicated that he would do whatever he thought was right,but later stated that he would follow the judge instructions.hardcastle i,at.
in turning next to venirepersons and,the court concluded these strikes were justified by more general explanations,finding that the commonwealth had the opportunity to observe the witnesses and their response to questioning prior to exercising the peremptory challenge and that although the commonwealth had ample challenges remaining,there were no challenges offered to two black jurors,one of whom ironically was challenged by the defendant.id.at.based on the foregoing,the pennsylvania supreme court concluded that hardcastle failed to establish a prima facie case of improper use of peremptory challenges under batson.id.the court similarly rejected the remaining claims raised by hardcastle on direct appeal and affirmed both his conviction and sentence.
when again presented with the batson claim in considering hardcastle appeal of the denial of his post conviction relief act pcra claim,see.et,the pennsylvania supreme court refused to exempt hardcastle from the requirement that claims raised in pcra proceedings must not have been previously litigated.the court therefore rejected his claim that intervening decisions of the united states supreme court required it to reach a different conclusion on collateral review than it had on direct review if finality means anything it must mean that our decision on the merits in this case,as to which certiorari was denied by the united states supreme court,can not be affected by decisions in other cases decided three and four years later.id.
following exhaustion of his state remedies,hardcastle sought a writ of habeas corpus from the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.although the petition raised unexhausted claims,both sides conceded that procedural bars prevented hardcastle from raising his unexhausted claims in state court.accordingly,the district court held that hardcastle petition was not a mixed petition and thus was not subject to dismissal.hardcastle iii,wl at.following a thorough analysis of the merits,the district court further held that the pennsylvania supreme court resolution of hardcastle claim was both contrary to and an unreasonable application of batson.it therefore granted the writ and,after concluding that an evidentiary hearing would not be helpful,ordered a new trial.id.at.this appeal followed.
ii.jurisdiction 
the district court exercised jurisdiction over hardcastle petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to and.we have jurisdiction to review the district court final order granting hardcastle petition pursuant to and.the commonwealth is not required to obtain a certificate of appealability prior to seeking review of a district court decision to grant a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.cristin brennan,cir citing fed.b 
iii.standard of review 
because the district court d id not hold an evidentiary hearing and engage in independent,but rather limit ed the habeas evidence to that found in the state court record,our review of its final judgment is plenary.scarbrough johnson,cir.
hardcastle petition for a writ of habeas corpus was filed after april and thus is subject to the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,et aedpa.gattis snyder,cir.under aedpa,when a federal court reviews a state court ruling on federal law,or its application of federal law to a particular set of facts,the state court decision must stand unless it is contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.lam kelchner,cir quoting d.when a federal court reviews a state court findings of fact,its decision must stand unless it was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in a state court proceeding.id.quoting d.
it is by now that batson claims constitute mixed questions of law and fact for purposes of federal habeas corpus review.see riley taylor,cir en banc.the governing standard for such determinations is provided by the supreme court decision in williams taylor,d.under williams,a state court decision is contrary to the supreme court clearly established precedent if the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in the court cases or if the state court confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of the court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from its precedent.lockyer andrade,d quoting williams,at.
state court determinations of mixed questions of law and fact constitute an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law when the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.id.at quoting williams,at.under the unreasonable application clause,t he state court application of clearly established law must be objectively unreasonable a decision that is merely incorrect or erroneous is insufficient to justify relief.id.as the supreme court recently clarified,objectively unreasonable is not synonymous with clear error,as t he gloss of clear error fails to give proper deference to state courts by conflating error even clear error with unreasonableness.id.at.
thus,i t is not enough that a federal habeas court,in its independent review of the legal question is left with a firm conviction that the state court was erroneous.id.citation omitted.rather,that application must be objectively unreasonable.id.stated a different way,a federal habeas court should not grant the petition unless the state court decision,evaluated objectively and on the merits,resulted in an outcome that can not reasonably be justified under existing supreme court precedent.werts vaughn,cir quoting matteo,at.
iv.discussion 
we begin by noting our agreement with the pennsylvania supreme court observation that the retroactive application of batson causes unique evidentiary problems for reviewing courts,as the batson inquiry with which we are all now familiar did not occur during voir dire in these cases.thus,we are aware of the difficulties faced by both the pennsylvania supreme court and the district court in reviewing the record in this case.
nevertheless,we can not conclude,even under the deferential standard of review contained in aedpa,that the pennsylvania supreme court resolution of hardcastle claim amounted to an objectively reasonable application of batson.specifically,even accepting the pennsylvania supreme court proffered justifications for the challenged strikes at face value,the court still failed to identify adequate bases for the striking of venirepersons and,and thus should have terminated its analysis and found the existence of a batson violation at step two of the inquiry and failed to conduct a full and complete step three analysis with respect to the challenged strikes of venirepersons.
however,exercising plenary review over the final judgment of the district court,we similarly reject its decision to grant habeas corpus relief on the basis of the current evidentiary record.instead,based on the facts of this case,in which the commonwealth offered to state the bases for its strikes immediately following voir dire and in which both sides have,at various times,sought a hearing,we conclude that the district court erred in granting habeas corpus relief without first providing the commonwealth with the opportunity to present evidence in defense of the challenged peremptory strikes.the commonwealth prior observations of the difficulties it will have in recalling the reasons for its peremptory strikes should not now preclude it from making that effort when it has requested the opportunity to do so.remand is therefore appropriate.
background 
the supreme court decision in batson has been interpreted as establishing a inquiry for determining the constitutionality of challenged peremptory strikes.see riley,at first,a defendant may establish a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination in selection of the petit jury solely on evidence concerning the prosecutor exercise of peremptory challenges at the defendant trial.id.quoting batson,at.once the defendant makes a prima facie showing of racial discrimination step one,the prosecution must articulate a explanation for its use of peremptory challenges step two.if it does so,the trial court must determine whether the defendant has established purposeful discrimination step three.id.throughout this process,t he ultimate burden of persuasion regarding racial motivation rests with,and does not shift from,the defendant.id.significantly,d eference in a batson case must be viewed in the context of the requirement that the state courts engage in the batson inquiry described above.id.at.
in reviewing this matter,we begin by noting the incomplete nature of the pennsylvania supreme court analysis of hardcastle batson claim on direct appeal.simply stated,the court conflated steps one and two of the batson analysis in the sense that it identified and then analyzed potential justifications for the challenged strikes something that should not occur until step two in its step one analysis of whether hardcastle had successfully established a prima facie case.the court then proceeded to step three,only to conclude that hardcastle had failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination,thus indicating that,technically speaking,its analysis never proceeded beyond step one.
the pennsylvania supreme court apparently recognized this error when,in its subsequent decision regarding hardcastle appeal of the pcra court decision,it acknowledged as follows 
notwithstanding the language in our opinion on direct appeal to the effect that hardcastle had not made out a prima facie case,the extensive analysis of the record for reasons indicates that our post hoc analysis actually presumed the existence of a prima facie case,evaluated the evidence and all the relevant circumstances as the trial court would ordinarily do pursuant to batson,and resolved the ultimate issue by deciding that the commonwealth had not used its peremptory challenges improperly.
hardcastle ii,at.in view of this ruling,we will follow the lead of the district court in examining the pennsylvania supreme court decision on direct review,see hardcastle i,as modified by its opinion on collateral review,see hardcastle ii.stated alternatively,we will treat hardcastle i as representing the pennsylvania supreme court full analysis of hardcastle batson claim.
we further note that we will read the pennsylvania supreme court acknowledgment in hardcastle ii of the existence of a prima facie case in hardcastle i as a concession that hardcastle had satisfied his burden at step one.in view of the fact that twelve of the prosecutor peremptory strikes were exercised against members of the venire,we have no doubt that this concession was appropriate.see rico,cir noting that o ne way to establish a prima facie case at step one is to show a pattern of peremptory challenges of jurors of a particular race citing batson,at.even in the absence of such a concession,however,the pennsylvania supreme court decision to proceed to steps two and three moots the issue of whether hardcastle made a sufficient showing at step one.see hernandez new york,d holding that o nce a prosecutor has offered a explanation for the peremptory challenges and the trial court has ruled on the ultimate question of intentional discrimination,the preliminary issue of whether the defendant had made a prima facie showing becomes moot.thus,we will focus our discussion on steps two and three.
as detailed in the district court opinion and summarized above,the pennsylvania supreme court,in considering hardcastle direct appeal,examined the record in an effort to identify bases for the twelve challenged strikes.it articulated what it considered to be specific and facially credible bases for the striking of venirepersons through.however,it was unable to do so with respect to venirepersons and and therefore offered only the following general justifications for these strikes the commonwealth had the opportunity to observe the witnesses and their response to questioning prior to exercising the peremptory challenge and although the commonwealth had ample challenges remaining,there were no challenges offered to two black jurors,one of whom ironically was challenged by the defendant.hardcastle i,at 
in addressing the question whether the justifications identified by the pennsylvania supreme court for the striking of venirepersons and are sufficient to satisfy the commonwealth burden of production,we note that the supreme court has purposely set a relatively low bar at step two.it therefore is rare for a case to be decided at this stage of the analysis.indeed,t he second step of the batson analysis does not demand an explanation that is persuasive,or even plausible.purkett elem,d per curiam.rather,the sole issue at step two is the facial validity of the prosecutor explanation.unless a discriminatory intent is inherent in the prosecutor explanation,the reason offered will be deemed race neutral.id.at.
further,the supreme court has emphasized the necessity of maintaining the analytical distinction between steps two and three,as step two merely places upon the prosecutor the burden of producing an explanation i t is not until the third step that the persuasiveness of the justification becomes step in which the trial court determines whether the opponent of the strike has carried his burden of proving purposeful discrimination.id.at step three,
implausible or fantastic justifications may and probably will be found to be pretexts for purposeful discrimination.but to say that a trial judge may choose to disbelieve a silly or superstitious reason at step three is quite different from saying that a trial judge must terminate the inquiry at step two when the reason is silly or superstitious.the latter violates the principle that the ultimate burden of persuasion regarding racial motivation rests with,and never shifts from,the opponent of the strike.
the reasons presented at step two,however,must be reasons,not merely a denial of discriminatory motive or an affirmation of good faith.see id.at.what batson means by a legitimate reason is not a reason that makes sense,but a reason that does not deny equal protection.id.
under this standard,we need not conduct at step two an analysis of the purportedly explanations proffered by the pennsylvania supreme court with respect to venirepersons through.however,the justifications for the striking of venirepersons and fail to satisfy even the minimal burden of production required at step two.the pennsylvania supreme court assertion that the striking of venirepersons and was simply because the prosecutor had an opportunity to observe them during voir dire is inadequate on its face.indeed,t he record contains no evidence whatsoever about any juror demeanor or the prosecutor observations or impressions thereof.hardcastle iii,wl at.thus,this explanation amounts to nothing more than a statement that the prosecutor acted on intuition and with the absence of discriminatory intent.we have repeatedly rejected such vague and general claims in the past.see united states casper,cir holding that,because t he batson court stated that explanations must be clear and reasonably specific,e xplanations based on a prosecutor mere good faith or intuition do not suffice.citations omitted united states clemons,cir noting that,a lthough the reason need not approach the level justifying a challenge for cause,the batson court emphasized that the prosecutor must assert a clear,specific reason beyond his intuitive judgment or his good faith.quoting batson,at.
we reject them again here.indeed,to say,as the pennsylvania supreme court did,that a prosecutor step two burden may be satisfied based solely upon her opportunity to observe the jurors during voir dire creates an exception which threatens to swallow the rule.as hardcastle correctly argues,the same could be said regarding almost any peremptory strike,and the acceptance of the explanation proffered by the pennsylvania supreme court for the striking of venirepersons and would render step two meaningless,as any prosecutor could bypass it by briefly questioning and observing the prospective juror prior to exercising the strike.
second,the fact that the prosecutor had enough peremptory strikes to remove the two remaining venirepersons,but chose not to do so,can not demonstrate the absence of discriminatory intent in the striking of the other twelve from the venire.see jones ryan,cir rejecting a similar argument and noting that w e doubt the significance of including a single black on the panel if,at the same time,the government used most of its peremptory challenges to strike blacks with backgrounds similar to the white jurors ultimately selected.quoting clemons,at see also clemons,at holding that the striking of a single black juror could constitute a prima facie case even when blacks ultimately sit on the panel and even when valid reasons exist for striking other blacks.thus,absent further justification for the striking of venirepersons and,we can not conclude that the pennsylvania supreme court decision to proceed to step three in justifying the strikes of venirepersons and was an objectively reasonable application of batson.
step three 
we further hold that the failure of the pennsylvania supreme court to conduct an adequate analysis at step three with respect to the challenged strikes of venirepersons also precludes a finding that its application of batson was objectively reasonable.step three requires a court conducting a batson inquiry to address and evaluate all evidence introduced by each side including all evidence introduced in the first and second steps that tends to show that race was or was not the real reason and determine whether the defendant has met his burden of persuasion.riley,at citation and internal quotations omitted.in riley,we placed particular emphasis on the state courts failure to consider all of the evidence before them in determining whether the justifications offered by the prosecutor were pretextual 
the state courts in this case rejected riley batson claim without discussing any of the ample evidence that throws into question the explanations offered by the prosecutor for striking two of the black jurors and there is nothing relevant in the record that might otherwise support the state courts decisions.thus,we do not know why the state courts found the state explanation was plausible and credible in light of the other evidence.it is because of the state courts omission of a requirement under the third step of the batson an ultimate determination on the issue of discriminatory intent based on all the facts and the state argument founders.
id.at italicized emphasis added.
after close analysis of the record,we reach the same conclusion here.in so doing,we note that a judge considering a batson challenge is not required to comment explicitly on every piece of evidence in the record.id.at.however,some engagement with the evidence considered is necessary as part of step three of the batson inquiry,and this requires something more than a terse,abrupt comment that the prosecutor has satisfied batson.id.at citations and internal quotations omitted.
here,t he pennsylvania supreme court decision does not indicate that the court engaged in any analysis or consideration of the credibility of the potential justifications that it had proffered.rather,the court decision reads as if the court accepted the justifications at face value.hardcastle iii,wl at.accordingly,as in both jones and riley,we lack an adequate step three analysis to which we may defer.the commonwealth should be given the opportunity it requests to demonstrate that its exercise of peremptory strikes was justified under the batson third step.in addition,hardcastle should be afforded the opportunity to show any weaknesses he may find with the justifications for the strikes.
thus,in view of the state of the evidentiary record,we reject hardcastle argument in favor of affirmance although we agree with the district court statement that it will be difficult at this late date to reconstruct the bases for the challenged strikes,we can not agree with its conclusion that,under the facts of this case,the commonwealth is not entitled to attempt to do so or that the state of the evidentiary record will not be improved as a result thereof.in so holding,we are persuaded by the fact that,despite the prosecutor offer to state the bases for her peremptory strikes on the record immediately following voir dire and her subsequent request for some form of hearing,the commonwealth has never been provided with either a state or federal forum in which to present evidence in defense of its actions in this case.
we further note that neither the prosecutor concession during oral argument before the en banc court of common pleas that she could not recall the precise bases for the challenged strikes nor the passage of time mandates a contrary result.as we have previously held 
t here will undoubtedly be relief proceedings in which the state,by reason of death,absence,or faded memory,will be unable to produce a prosecutor with a specific recollection of the reason for a challenge alleged to violate batson.courts frequently are required to draw inferences from circumstantial evidence regarding a state of mind,however,and we are unwilling to rule out the possibility that the state may be able to satisfy its step two batson burden by tendering circumstantial evidence.
johnson,at.indeed,we have expressly rejected the notion that our prior precedent mandates relief in situations in which the prosecutor concedes that he or she can not remember the bases for a challenged strike 
harrison ryan,cir,is distinguishable because the prosecutor in that case offered no explanation for excluding one of the six black venirepersons he had struck from the jury,but simply asserted at a hearing before a federal magistrate that he could not recall his reasons.it was based on the prosecutor assertion that he did not know the reason he struck a black venireperson,coupled with the absence of any other explanation,that this court affirmed the order for a new trial.we do not read harrison to suggest that a state can not be permitted to reconstruct the prosecutor rationale for excluding a juror during a later batson hearing when the prosecutor admits to having no recollection of his motivations at the time.
johnson,at emphasis added.our conclusion that such difficulties in reconstructing voir dire do not foreclose an evidentiary hearing is further supported by the supreme court resolution of similar situations.see cockrell,d noting that evidence presented at a batson hearing two years after voir dire was subject to the usual risks of imprecision and distortion from the passage of time,but nevertheless concluding that the court of appeals erred in refusing to grant a certificate of appealability batson,at.remanding for a hearing despite the petitioner concession that it would be all but impossible to reconstruct the prosecutor rationale for the challenged strikes burger,dissenting.
thus,while the retroactive application of the supreme court ruling in batson undeniably causes many problems,we do not believe the weight of this burden should be borne solely by the commonwealth.it is difficult in the context of a trial to fault hardcastle counsel for failing to request an evidentiary hearing following voir dire.it is equally unfair to require the commonwealth to retry hardcastle without first being provided with the opportunity to defend its conduct in the prior trial.given the batson court emphasis on the subjective intent of the prosecutor,we find it difficult to imagine a situation in which it would be appropriate to take the extraordinary step of granting habeas corpus relief without first providing the state with a hearing at which it could offer evidence in support of the challenged strikes if,as in this case,it desires to do so.
finally,having concluded that further proceedings are required,we must address the parties arguments as to the appropriate forum.although both sides request a hearing as an alternative remedy,hardcastle seeks to have the matter handled by the district court while the commonwealth asserts that the state courts must be given the first opportunity to rule on the new evidence submitted.
as we have previously held,w e do not have authority under the federal habeas statutes,or,to remand a habeas corpus petition to a state court for an evidentiary hearing.keller petsock,cir.federal district courts,by contrast,may conduct such hearings.see id moreover,even if we were able to remand directly to the state court,neither this court nor the supreme court has held that the state courts should,after having foregone the opportunity to hold an evidentiary hearing and resolve the issue,be given another opportunity to do so.id.therefore,to the extent that the commonwealth asserts in its submission that we should grant the writ conditioned upon a hearing in st
