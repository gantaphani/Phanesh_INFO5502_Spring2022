petitioner donovan simpson,an ohio inmate,seeks habeas relief from his convictions for aggravated murder,murder,five counts of attempted murder,aggravated arson,and five counts of felonious assault,all arising from a fatal arson.an ohio jury convicted him under an aiding and abetting theory for assisting another individual in preparing a molotov cocktail and helping the individual flee after throwing the bomb at a house,resulting in the death of a child sleeping inside.simpson claims that four of his statements made on april,april,june,and june,were erroneously admitted into evidence in violation of miranda arizona,d,and its progeny,as well as in violation of the fifth amendment.for the reasons set forth below,we find that the june statement was properly admitted into evidence but that the state court admission of the statements made on april,april,and june was contrary to and an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent at the time the conviction became final.these errors were harmless as to simpson convictions for aggravated arson and felonious assault,so we deny relief as to those convictions.however,the errors were not harmless as to the convictions for aggravated murder,murder,and attempted murder,so we grant simpson a writ of habeas corpus as to those convictions.
factual background 
the last state court decision on the merits,see garcia andrews,cir,is that of the court of appeals of ohio on simpson direct appeal.that court set forth the facts as follows 
in the early morning hours of october,a fire broke out at south wheatland avenue in columbus,ohio.at the time,aleta bell and three of her four children,shenequa,age five,elijah,age three,and myesha,old,were asleep in the house.also sleeping in the house were two men,terrance hall and gary williams,myesha father.hall was awakened early that morning by a loud crash of glass.he found the house engulfed in flames.after running out of the house,hall was able to wake aleta bell and williams,who were sleeping with myesha in the same room.they were able to get out of the house.unfortunately,they were not able to reach the two children who were sleeping in a back bedroom.members of the columbus fire department cfd arrived on the scene and were able to find the two children and take them directly to children hospital.however,as a result of the injuries sustained in the fire,shenequa bell died days later.elijah bell survived,but suffered serious injuries.
by indictment filed august,appellant was charged with thirteen counts relating to the fire at south wheatland avenue.appellant was charged with two counts of aggravated murder for the death of shenequa bell,in violation of.both counts contained death penalty specifications pursuant to a.appellant was also charged with five counts of attempted murder of the five other people in the house,in violation of and one count of aggravated arson,in violation of and five counts of felonious assault,in violation of.appellant entered a not guilty plea to all of the charges and proceeded to a jury trial.
before his trial,appellant sought to suppress four verbal statements he made to police officers prior to being indicted.two of these statements,one on april and another on april,were made to officers while appellant was incarcerated in the licking southeastern correctional institution for an unrelated crime.both of these statements were recorded.no miranda warnings were given to appellant before he made these statements.the other two statements,one on june and one on june,were made at columbus police headquarters.both of these statements which were essentially confessions were videotaped.appellant was read his miranda rights before these statements were made and he signed a form indicating he understood and waived those rights.after an evidentiary hearing,the trial court denied his motion thereby permitting the state to introduce these statements into evidence at trial.
the following key testimony was presented during the state case.
detective edward kallay,a homicide detective who was the primary investigator in this matter for the columbus police department cpd,testified that,in january,he had a conversation with a man named adiyat diggs.based upon that conversation,kallay believed that appellant might have information about a suspect who the police thought could have been involved in starting this fire.on april,detective kallay and federal special agent ozbolt spoke with appellant at the southeastern correctional institution in licking county where appellant was incarcerated.their conversation was recorded.
detective kallay testified that appellant told him that he had picked up a man named daryl pumpkin kelly the day before the fire and took him to a bar to meet a woman named leah appellant waited outside while daryl kelly went into the bar.when kelly and leah came out,appellant heard leah tell kelly to take care of this for me.appellant told detective kallay that he got a call from an excited daryl kelly the next morning who said he needed another ride.when appellant picked kelly up,he said that kelly smelled like gasoline.daryl pumpkin kelly was a suspect even before appellant provided this information.
leah was leah smith,a former friend of aleta bell who lived in the other half of the house at south wheatland avenue.days before the fire,leah had moved out of the house.the two had been involved in a dispute earlier in the summer of,when aleta bell accused leah of forging a driver license with aleta personal information but with leah picture.when aleta found the driver license,she took it back.leah later broke into aleta home and stole the driver license.leah was charged with and pled guilty to one count of burglary arising from that incident.
three days later,on april,detective kallay and special agent ozbolt went to the southeastern correctional institution to talk with appellant again.in a recorded conversation,appellant again implicated leah and kelly in the fire at south wheatland avenue.following this conversation,the officers obtained appellant release on probation so that he would cooperate with them in their investigation.however,appellant failed to cooperate,leading the officers to believe that appellant had more to do with the fire than he was admitting.due to appellant failure to cooperate with the investigation and failure to abide by the terms of his probation,detective kallay arrested appellant on june.
after he was arrested,appellant was taken to cpd headquarters and interrogated by detective kallay and special agent ozbolt.the interrogation was videotaped.it is undisputed that,prior to being questioned,appellant was read his miranda rights.during questioning,appellant admitted his involvement in starting the fire.he said that he met leah and kelly the day before the fire when leah asked appellant to take kelly somewhere that night.later that evening,kelly and appellant took two empty bottles of alcohol and filled them with gasoline.they brought the bottles to leah who showed them how to make a molotov cocktail.appellant and kelly then went to the area of south wheatland avenue and drove into an alley.after smoking some crack,kelly got out of the car with the two bottles and,a few seconds later,appellant heard glass break and then saw kelly running back towards the car without the bottles.the two sped away to a crack house,where they paged leah.she arrived and paid them both with crack cocaine.
detective kallay further testified that,following these admissions,he made arrangements to have appellant take a polygraph test.on june,appellant was brought again to the cpd to take the test.it is undisputed that appellant was read his miranda rights again.however,detective kallay testified that appellant was uncooperative so the test could not be performed.appellant lack of cooperation was confirmed by the testimony of randy walker,who had been hired to administer the test.nevertheless,while in the room waiting to take the test,appellant made more admissions regarding his involvement in the fire.again,this interrogation was videotaped.
appellant recorded statements of april,april and his videotaped confessions of june and june were played for the jury over appellant objections.
the state then called stanley bowen,a deputy sheriff for licking county.deputy bowen was employed as a supervisor at the jail in which appellant was incarcerated in april.deputy bowen testified that he overheard appellant ask why did they charge the bitch too.it was her idea to start the fire.in addition,an inmate,who was in a cell next to appellant,testified that appellant told him all about the fire.he said that appellant told him there were three people involved,and that they used molotov cocktails to firebomb the house.
after deliberating,the jury returned verdicts finding appellant guilty of all five counts of attempted murder and felonious assault,guilty of one count of aggravated arson,guilty of the lesser included offense of murder of shenequa bell,and guilty of the aggravated of shenequa bell,also finding appellant guilty of the death penalty specification because the aggravated murder was part of a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing of,or attempt to kill,two or more persons.
state simpson,wl,at,ohio app.lexis,at ohio.july.
we note the following additional undisputed material facts that do not appear in the state court factual recitation.the april interview was held in a conference room in the warden office.simpson was pulled from the general prison population and escorted to the warden office by prison guards.appellee br.at.during the interview,the officers,on the one hand,accused simpson of being with kelly at the time of the incident but,on the other hand,told him that he was not a suspect.the april interview occurred while simpson was in the prison infirmary.q okay.and again,how was that meeting arranged a they just came down there the infirmary.
on direct appeal,the court upheld all of the convictions,but it vacated the sentence for reasons not material to this case.at,the court imposed discrete sentences for each conviction.on count i,murder,the court imposed a sentence of fifteen years to life in prison.on count ii,aggravated murder,the court imposed a sentence of life in prison,with thirty years before parole eligibility.on counts iii vii,attempted murder,the court imposed a sentence of eight years in prison on each of the convictions.on count viii,aggravated arson,the court imposed a sentence of nine years in prison.on counts ix xiii,felonious assault,the court imposed a sentence of eight years in prison on each conviction.the court found that counts i and ii merged for purposes of sentencing.the court ordered that the felonious assault sentences,counts ix xiii,would be served concurrently to each other and would merge with the attempted murder sentences,counts iii vii,for purposes of sentencing.the court further ordered that the sentence on count ii would run consecutive to the sentences for counts iii vii,which would also run consecutive to each other,and consecutive to the sentence on count viii.stated more plainly,the court sentenced simpson to five consecutive terms attempted murder,for a total of forty years,plus a term aggravated arson,plus a term of at least thirty years aggravated murder.this adds up to a total term of imprisonment of no less than years,and potentially life,in prison.
procedural background 
simpson filed his original petition for writ of habeas corpus,pursuant to,on february,asserting numerous grounds for habeas relief.on april,the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation finding all of simpson claims either procedurally defaulted or meritless,save the claims regarding his two april statements and his two june statements.the magistrate judge found that the admission of the april statements,if in error,was harmless.the magistrate judge directed the state to supplement the record regarding the june statements to allow for further evaluation.the district court overruled simpson objections to this report and recommendation on august.on november,the magistrate judge issued a second report and recommendation finding the remaining claim regarding the june statements to be meritless.the district court overruled simpson objections to this report and recommendation on january,and,therefore,dismissed simpson petition.simpson timely appealed,and this court granted a certificate of appealability as to the admission of simpson april and june statements.
we review a district court decision regarding questions of law in a habeas proceeding de novo.avery prelesnik,cir.
simpson federal habeas petition was filed subsequent to the passage of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa in and,thus,its provisions govern this court review.under aedpa,a federal court may not grant habeas relief unless the state court adjudication of the claim either 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.under the contrary to provision,a federal habeas court should grant the writ if the state court arrived at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than the supreme court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.boykin webb,cir quoting williams taylor,d.under the unreasonable application clause,a habeas court may grant the writ if the state court identified the correct legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applied that principle to the petitioner case.boykin,at.
june statements 
though the april statements occurred first,their relevance was tied to the june statements because the state used the april statements to cast doubt on the veracity of aspects of simpson june statements,in which he sought to minimize his involvement in the planning and carrying out of the arson.we therefore begin the analysis with the june statements.
june statement 
simpson june statement occurred after he had been arrested,ostensibly for violating the conditions of his judicial release.as described above,in return for his continued cooperation,detective kallay and agent ozbolt had arranged for simpson early judicial release from jail on an unrelated offense.when simpson did not promptly reestablish contact upon his release,the officers caused simpson arrest to focus his attention back on the arson investigation,even though simpson was technically arrested for violations of his judicial release,such as missing two drug tests.thus,simpson was detained on june for essentially two different reasons at the same time the release violations and the arson investigation.this presented a situation in which kallay and ozbolt could exert significant pressure through the potential consequences of his release violations in order to get simpson to cooperate in the arson investigation.
the june interview began with both officers in an interview room with simpson generally discussing simpson current arrest and his failure to contact the officers upon his release.approximately six and one half minutes into the conversation,one of the officers left,but the other officer remained in the room.
the remaining officer immediately informed simpson that,because he was technically in custody,the officer must inform him of his miranda rights.simpson initially protested even being read his rights,he asked that the officer please not read him his rights.the officer persisted and eventually read simpson his miranda rights and gave him a copy of the rights to read.simpson expressed that he understood his rights.the officer then asked are you willing to waive your rights,continue talking with us simpson responded,clearly in a negative way a sideways shake of his hand and a slight shake of his head mumbling something and then saying nah or naw and then saying i messed up last time i did that.the officer then replied,so you do want to talk to us you do or you do want to talk to us simpson responded with more negative body language and said,i mean,it ca help.
following four to five seconds of silence,the officer said,well that up to you,whether you want to talk to us or not,we not going to twist your arm or anything like that.simpson immediately responded,what all wan na talk about and the officer stated,just basically what we talking about now.we will refer to the colloquy up to this point as the first miranda interaction.everything that follows will be referred to as the second miranda interaction.
over the next one and one half minutes,simpson questioned the officer about the details of his current situation,having been arrested and going back to jail,where he would be incarcerated,what his violations were.critically,the officer did not ask simpson any substantive questions instead only responding to simpson questions and explaining that he was arrested for violating the terms of his release.
the other officer then came back into the interview room.there was an second period of silence,and the first officer then asked,so do you want to talk to us about any of this or not simpson responded by mumbling something,and even the tenor of his response is unclear.the second officer,who had not been present during the first miranda interaction,then said,all right,since its a custodial interview,which means you under arrest for that stuff,it pretty customary that we advise you of your rights first.simpson responded that the first officer had already discussed the miranda rights.the first officer presented simpson with a waiver of rights form and said,just go ahead and look that over,and if you willing to talk to us,just go ahead and sign the waiver,and we can move on.just need to make sure you understand all that.simpson began reading the form and said,i mean,this right here,it really do make no difference,you know what i saying,sign it or not.the second officer responded,that what we saying,but its a formality,and that what we required by law to do.
at this point in the interview,it is apparent that simpson was still struggling with the fact that,while he has been arrested for violations of his release conditions,the interview is more about the arson.he indicated the waiver of rights form and said,this thing right here,i mean,talking about may be used against me.for what the second officer responded,well what would happen if you came out and said that,you know,i killed one of the people with inaudible.then,you know,if you tell us that,and we did advise you of your right,we lose that statement in court.simpson then executed the waiver of rights form.
miranda warning 
simpson argues that the officers violated miranda when they questioned him after he expressed his desire to remain silent.in his brief,simpson focuses exclusively on the first miranda interaction.simpson argues that,at that point,he had clearly invoked his desire to remain silent,so the interview should have ceased.the warden,surprisingly,accepts the premise that this is the only relevant discussion.see resp.br.at accepting simpson transcription of the relevant portion of the june interrogation.
the warden argues that,at the conclusion of the first miranda interaction,simpson inclination remained unclear.however,at that point in time,simpson had said,naw,and i messed up last time i did that.tellingly,the officer responded by asking,so you do want to talk to us you do or you do want to talk to us by virtue of the first question,it is clear that the officer understood simpson to be leaning towards saying that he did not want to talk.if that were not enough,simpson responded with additional dismissive,negative body language and said,i mean,it ca help,and then a noticeable silence elapsed.thus,if the analysis were to end here,the warden would likely be incorrect that simpson desire to remain silent was in doubt.
but the analysis does not end there.simpson focuses on too narrow of a slice of the colloquy and,instead,we must look at the entire conversation,which includes both the first miranda interaction and the second.viewed in its entirety,we conclude that the officer honored simpson initial inclination to remain silent because the officer did not ask any material questions and,instead,only responded to simpson inquiries.once the other officer returned,they returned to the issue of miranda,and simpson executed the waiver of rights form.
when viewed in this light,the officers actions were not inappropriate.as a matter of first principles,miranda is only directed at interrogation or its functional equivalent the police may not continue an interrogation after the interviewee has invoked his right to remain silent.rhode island innis,d restricting the definition of interrogation for miranda purposes to express questioning and words or actions by the police that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.here,the officers did not ask simpson any material questions until they revisited the issue of whether he wished to waive his miranda rights and discuss substantive matters,to which simpson immediately consented.
similarly,even simpson concedes that,when a suspect does not clearly invoke his right to remain silent or when the invocation is ambiguous,officers may follow up with clarifying questions.davis united states,d see also berghuis thompkins,d,wl,at june,stating there is no principled reason to adopt different standards for determining when an accused has invoked the miranda right to remain silent and the miranda right to counsel at issue in davis.here,simpson initially indicated a desire to remain silent.when the officer responded,well that up to you,whether you want to talk to us or not,we not going to twist your arm or anything like that which was,in context,a statement simpson immediately responded by asking the officer what he wanted to talk about.he then asked several questions of the officer until the second officer returned.thus,the officers were faced with an individual who had indicated that he did not want to talk and yet continued to talk.accordingly,it was not unreasonable or impermissible for the officers to have circled back to the miranda issue to clarify whether simpson wished to waive his rights before asking him any substantive questions.indeed,the supreme court encouraged such clarifying questions in davis,at,and four justices would have required that officers seek clarification in the face of an ambiguous invocation of miranda rights.id.at.souter,concurring.
finally,it is that a suspect voluntary,unsolicited statements after an invocation of miranda rights are not excluded.edwards arizona,d.this is because,in the unsolicited statement scenario,the officers have scrupulously honored the suspect invocation and have not interrogated him.though simpson is not a case of unsolicited statements,the edwards line of cases is relevant for what it assumes that it is permissible for the officers still to be in the same room with the interviewee for at least some period of time after he invokes his right to remain silent.the officers need not immediately leave the room they simply may not continue questioning or badgering the suspect.but,for simpson to prevail,his theory must be that the officers should have immediately,in a matter of seconds,left the room when he said,i mean,it ca help.this is not the law,so there was nothing wrong with the officers remaining in the room for the few seconds until simpson asked the officers what they wanted to talk about,nor was there any prohibition on the officers answering simpson questions.
in sum,there are at least three arguments to support the validity of simpson waiver of his miranda rights.furthermore,simpson has not pointed to any supreme court case indicating that the officers actions in these or similar circumstances were improper.accordingly,we find that the officers validly obtained the waiver of simpson miranda rights prior to the june interview.
fifth amendment coercion 
simpson next argues that,even if the officers did not violate miranda,his june statement was coerced in violation of the fifth amendment prohibition on compelled confessions.he does not claim that the officers utilized improper physical tactics.instead,he claims that they used a combination of threats and promises,which had the cumulative effect of overbearing his will.
whether a confession was voluntary depends upon the totality of all the surrounding circumstances both the characteristics of the accused and the details of the interrogation.schneckloth bustamonte,d.the supreme court has held that the combination of threats and promises may rise to the level sufficient to overbear an interviewee will,rendering any confession the product of impermissible coercion.lynumn illinois,d see also ledbetter edwards,cir recognizing that,in the face of a powerful combination of threats and promises,even a defendant who is completely innocent might well confess.however,as a plurality of the supreme court noted in missouri seibert,d,maintaining that a statement is involuntary even though given after miranda warnings and voluntary waiver of rights requires unusual stamina,and litigation over voluntariness tends to end with the finding of a valid waiver.id.at.see also berkemer mccarty,d c ases in which a defendant can make a colorable argument that a statement was compelled despite the fact that the law enforcement authorities adhered to the dictates of miranda are rare.accordingly,it is clear that a defendant faces an uphill climb when,as here,he argues that a confession was involuntary even though he properly received and waived his miranda rights.and as an implicit derivative principle,in light of these candid statements from the supreme court,the facts of a given interview must be especially egregious to lead to the conclusion that a state court application of supreme court involuntariness case law was unreasonable for purposes of habeas relief under aedpa.
although the june interview came about as the result of simpson arrest for violation of his release conditions,it must be remembered that simpson previously had agreed to cooperate with the officers in return for his early release.thus,simpson was familiar with the officers,and that he would interact with them after his release should have come as no surprise to simpson.simpson points to two threats made by the officers during the interview.first,the officers warned simpson that he faced a new felony charge for failure to comply with his release provisions and guaranteed that the felony charge would be filed unless he provided information about the arson.second,they stated,this is your opportunity.cause if not,you going down with kelly,and guess what being an accomplice carries the same penalty as the person that threw the bottle we proven to you that we do play games.we do bluff.the officers also stated,you are not the focus of our investigation.but if we leave this room tonight with no answers,you will be you are looking at the rest of your life,possibly the death death row.if that the game you want to play,peanut,we take you there.
in addition to these threats,simpson also points to promises of leniency that he claims contributed to the overbearing of his will.with regard to the charge for violating his release conditions,one of the officers stated,you want to help yourself,now the time to help yourself.cause that charge ai been filed yet.with regard to the arson,the officers stated that they ultimately wanted to get pumpkin kelly and leah and that,if he confessed to his involvement,the officers would work with him and talk to whomever.simpson also points to the following colloquy 
kallay we did not accuse you of anything.we not gon na accuse you of anything except being there.
simpson see,that,that a crime man.
kallay it,it could be a crime if you continue doing what you doing.
simpson contends that this statement implied that he would not be charged if he admitted to being there and implicated kelly and leah.
in addition to those highlighted by simpson,another aspect of the interview bears upon simpson decision to implicate himself.simpson has several children.it seems that,upon his release from jail,he had been living with his youngest son,and he was with this son when he was.he was clearly concerned about being away from his son,and the officers played upon this.several times,they suggested that simpson tell the truth so that he could get back to his son.and,more effectively,the officers played on simpson conscience,making repeated comparison between simpson children and the child killed in the fire.the video shows that this tactic was extremely effective one can almost see the emotional struggle going on in simpson mind.
simpson primarily relies upon lynumn illinois,d,as clearly established supreme court law holding that threats and promises may combine to render a confession involuntary.there,the court held that a defendant confession to selling marijuana was involuntary.id.at.the defendant testified that,immediately upon entering her apartment,the officers threatened that she would never see her children again if she did not confess but assured her that they would recommend that the prosecutor not charge her if she cooperated.id.at.the court held that,under these circumstances,it was clear that the confession could not be deemed voluntary in fact,the state conceded that the confession was coerced but argued that the error was harmless.id.at.
the major flaw in simpson reliance upon lynumn is that the lynumn defendant had not received miranda warnings before the confession indeed,lynumn predates miranda by three years.as the more recent cases,like berkemer and seibert,teach,it has become much more difficult to argue the involuntariness of a confession if miranda warnings have been given and the rights have been waived.
thus,we must analyze simpson case under the more general involuntariness doctrine.as we stated in ledbetter 
in determining whether a confession has been elicited by psychological means that are unconstitutional,this court looks at the totality of the circumstances concerning whether a defendant will was overborne in a particular case.factors to consider in assessing the totality of the circumstances include the age,education,and intelligence of the accused whether the accused has been informed of his constitutional rights the length of the questioning the repeated and prolonged nature of the questioning and the use of physical punishment,such as the deprivation of food or sleep.schneckloth bustamonte,d.
at.applying these factors to the june interrogation,none cuts strongly in simpson favor,and certainly not so strongly that a state court conclusion to the contrary could be deemed objectively unreasonable.though it is not clear from the record what level of education simpson has achieved,it is clear that he had extensive experience with the criminal justice system.thus,on june,the experience of being questioned by the police was not new or novel to him.furthermore,simpson had a prior,consensual relationship with the officers.he had agreed to continue speaking with them even before this specific interrogation.and though the officers did employ threats and promises in their effort to obtain simpson full disclosure,the video reveals that the most effective tactic was the play on his conscience.simply stated,under the totality of the circumstances,simpson has not met his burden of showing circumstances so severe that there is a substantial risk that his will was overborne.we therefore deny simpson habeas relief as to the june statement.
june statement 
though simpson admits that he technically waived his miranda rights during the june interrogation,he contends that the waiver was not voluntary and,thus,ineffective.his argument is more appropriately framed as two distinct attacks on the validity of his miranda waiver.first,simpson advances a pure involuntariness argument,arguing that the officers obtained the waiver by using false promises,threats,and misleading statements that he had no choice except to talk with them.we find this argument unpersuasive.second,simpson argues that the officers violated miranda by discouraging him from consulting with an attorney.this argument is significantly more persuasive,as the facts are not materially distinguishable from the facts in kyger carlton,cir,in which we found a clear violation of miranda.
coming into the june interview,simpson had already given incriminating statements on june.he had confessed to being with kelly immediately prior to the arson while kelly prepared the molotov cocktail and to driving the car before and after kelly threw the molotov cocktail at the house,though he disclaimed having been involved in the planning of the attack or having any intent to kill or harm anyone.detective kallay and agent ozbolt seem to have suspected that simpson was more involved than he claimed.they therefore proposed,at the end of the june interview,that simpson take a polygraph test.they essentially told him that,if he had been completely truthful on the,he would pass the test and they would continue to work with him and seek favorable treatment from the prosecutor.if he failed the lie detector,they would know that he was more involved than he had admitted,and the officers would recommend that the prosecutor bring the most serious possible charges against simpson.thus,the officers proposed the lie detector for two purposes.the first purpose was to test the truth of simpson june statement.the second purpose was to get simpson to confess to his true role in the arson by telling him that,if he lied,the test would pick it up,so he should come clean before the test.on june,simpson initially agreed to take the test.however,he was less than cooperative when the time actually arrived on june.
at the end of the june interview,the officers were very blunt with simpson about how his case would proceed.the relevant dialogue was as follows 
kallay tuesday morning we pick you up and bring you in for a polygraph.you pass the polygraph then we reinstate your bond.under the stipulation that you do what you told with us.you do do that,we charge you with complicity to commit agg murder,right away.
ozbolt and that ai no bullshit.
kallay that is no bullshit.you do have a choice at this time.
ozbolt let me ask you this.is that agreeable to you you gon na pass the polygraph cause if there something else you need to tell us,tell us now.
simpson no,that it.
ozbolt hmmm.
simpson what you say i charged with 
kallay complicity to agg murder.if you fail to do any of that,that exactly what you get charged with.if you want to run,you can run,but we will find you.
simpson but agg murder,but that how much time,does that carry life in jail 
kallay.life with no parole.you got a lot of incentive.and we not playing with you,that is the straight,honest to god truth.we could do that to you right now,if we wanted to.
simpson what charge me 
kallay.but what did we tell you from the beginning 
simpson alright.
kallay i want leah.so does dan ozbolt.she the one who caused this whole thing to happen.she the one who caused this whole thing to happen.she the one who needs to pay.
simpson right.
kallay pumpkin threw the fire 
simpson yes.
kallay you do have alternatives.
simspon i know.i was just thinkin,there nothing,it just straight forward 
ozbolt.it straight up.
simpson straight up,its just 
ozbolt complicity to commit aggravated murder.there no nice way to say it.that the way it is.
at the beginning of the june interview,in preparation for the polygraph exam,kallay had more strong words for simpson.he stated at various times,you do cooperate on this case,you eat the whole thing.it called agg murder conspiracy to commit if you do cooperate then there are no holds barred,and you gon na lose.you gon na spend the rest of your life in jail if you do take the test today we gon na file the paper on you today for complicity to commit agg murder.it that simple.
voluntariness of miranda waiver 
simpson claims that the promise that if he took and passed the polygraph,he would be released which kallay admitted was a false promise and the strong language indicating that simpson had to take the polygraph or else be charged with aggravated murder,had the combined effect of overbearing his will,rendering his waiver of rights involuntary.the government bears the heavy burden of proving the voluntariness of a waiver of miranda rights.miranda,at.the voluntariness question requires an inquiry into the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation to determine if the interviewee in fact knowingly and voluntarily decided to forego his rights to remain silent and to have the assistance of counsel.fare michael,d.and,as miranda itself stated,any evidence that the accused was threatened,tricked,or cajoled into a waiver will,of course,show that the defendant did not voluntarily waive his privilege.miranda,at.
beginning with the argument regarding kallay false promise of release,simpson points to our decision in williams withrow,cir,rev in part on other grounds,d.in williams,we addressed a situation in which a police officer stated,i make you a deal.you tell us everything that happened and you tell us the truth and i confirm it on a polygraph that you telling us the truth.yeah,you walk.at.the officer subsequently formalized this into a promise of immunity if the suspect took and passed the polygraph.id.at.we held that the prisoner was entitled to habeas relief because an evaluation of the entire course of police conduct in this case establishes that williams statements were not voluntary.his statements were conditioned on his belief that he would be released if he talked.the officers promises of leniency were intended to induce williams admissions.id.at.however,williams is distinguishable because,in that case,the officer explicitly promised immunity in return for taking and passing the polygraph.by contrast,here,the officers never told simpson that he would not be charged in the arson if he passed the polygraph.they simply said that they would his bond on the previous,unrelated crime.thus,simpson was not like the suspect in williams who confessed because he believed that doing so could get him out of any charges.
as to simpson claim that the officers threatening aggravated murder charges if he did not participate in the polygraph rendered his waiver voluntary,the state court and the district court held that these were all essentially true statements.to be sure,they had a very strong influence on simpson decision to waive his rights on june he repeatedly indicated that he felt as if he did not have a choice,and even said that he felt that he was being railroaded.but the state court and district court were correct that the officers were telling simpson the truth about his predicament.in light of his june statement,the officers already had enough evidence to charge him in the arson.in essence,the officers were merely informing simpson of the options before him.so simpson was correct that he did not have much of a choice,but this was simply an acknowledgment of reality.
simpson cites no authority,much less clearly established supreme court authority,indicating that a waiver is involuntary if made after hearing the truth,or that officers may inform an interviewee of reality only when that reality is bright and cheery.mccalvin yukins,cir we are not prepared to forbid police from conveying to suspects the seriousness of the crime for which they are being investigated.though the case may exist in which the ugly truth could be presented in such an overwhelming and combative way that a suspect would lose his free will,the circumstances of the june interrogation do not strike us as that case.accordingly,neither the false promise regarding the polygraph nor the blunt statements regarding simpson options are sufficient to warrant habeas relief.
right to counsel 
simpson next contends that the police violated miranda by suggesting that he needed an attorney only if he was lying.when the polygraph examiner,officer walker,began discussing simpson miranda rights and indicated that simpson had the right to have counsel present,simpson replied,oh,i can have an attorney present.walker responded,you,you can always have an attorney present.it is my understanding that you wanted to take the test.id.simpson understandably seems to have taken this to mean that,if he wanted an attorney present,he would not be able to take the test that day.furthermore,he had already been told that if he did not take the polygraph that day,he would be charged with aggravated murder immediately.but,for the reasons stated above,this is not problematic under miranda because it was essentially the truth.the problem arises in what happened next 
walker do you follow what i sayin that if you telling me the truth,then you wo have a problem with the test.if you lying,then,uh,yeah,if i was lying,i probably would,i probably get an attorney,i probably would take the test.
simpson oh.
walker yea,well,that me.but that a decision that,yeah,you know,you have to make.this part of the form is wordy and lengthy.what this says is,that you are giving me permission to give you the exam.
simpson claims that we have held a materially identical exchange to violate miranda.in kyger,we addressed a situation in which the following transpired 
officer steve,do you understand them rights 
kyger yes,sir.
officer alright,having them rights in mind,would you answer some of our questions,without an attorney present 
kyger i just as soon have an attorney cause,you know ya say there been a shooting involved and that a serious charge.
officer yes it is but we investigating.we not saying you shot anybody.we just investigating.now,if you got something to hide,i can understand you not wanting to sign that.if you ai got nothing to hide,you know,you can answer our questions.
kyger i ai got nothing to hide.
officer okay.but you do want to answer our questions without an attorney present now 
kyger you know,i answer a certain amount,you know.
officer okay,you know well you know you have the right to stop at any time.that inaudible 
kyger where do i sign at 
officer just where it says sign.
kyger okay kyger then signs.
at emphasis added.in light of this colloquy,we found that kyger statement was a request for counsel,such that the interrogation should have stopped immediately.id.at.importantly,however,we went on to state that 
even if kyger request was equivocal,the subsequent statement by the police now,if you got something to hide,i can understand you not wanting to sign that.if you ai got nothing to hide,you know,you can answer our questions.was an inappropriate effort at pressuring kyger to answer,rather than an appropriate attempt to get kyger to clarify his response.this would also render this questioning constitutionally infirm.see miranda,at.disapproving of just such a tactic davis united states,d approving the use of clarifying questions.
id.citation omitted.as the kyger court noted,miranda itself spoke ill of an interrogation technique in which the interrogator tries to dissuade a suspect from speaking with an attorney by saying joe,i only looking for the truth,and if you telling the truth,that it.you can handle this by yourself.at.
the warden concedes that the statement in kyger is similar to the statement by officer walker in this case.however,the warden seeks to distinguish the cases on the temporal basis that kyger involved a suspect who had stated that he wanted to speak to an attorney whereas simpson had not yet requested counsel.we find two faults with the warden attempt at distinction.
first,kyger expressly stated that the officer statement was inappropriate even if kyger had only made an equivocal request for counsel,as opposed to a clear request for counsel.at.here,though simpson statement was certainly not an unequivocal request for counsel,it was at least an equivocal expression that he was considering speaking to counsel.indeed,that officer walker responded with a clarifying statement you,you can always have an attorney present.it is my understanding that you wanted to take the test.which was appropriate under davis,at.shows that officer walker thought that simpson might have been requesting counsel.thus,because simpson statement was an equivocal statement about his desire for counsel,kyger is on all fours.
second,and more troubling,to accept the warden distinction would be to accept a rule that police may not discourage interviewees from persisting with their request for counsel after they have already requested counsel,but may preemptively discourage them from seeking the advice of counsel after informing them of the right to counsel but before they actually request counsel.the warden offers no authority,and we are aware of none,endorsing such a strange proposition.in essence,to accept the warden distinction would be to approve the following alteration of the miranda warnings you have the right to an attorney,but you only need to exercise that right if you are guilty or are lying.this would be an unreasonable rule and an unreasonable reading of miranda,which expressly disapproved of such a tactic.miranda,at.
here,officer walker indicated to simpson that he only needed a lawyer if he had lied or intended to lie,and such a tactic is highly likely to taint an interviewee calculus.the obvious takeaway from the perspective of someone in simpson position is that,if he requested an attorney,he would be admitting to lying,which would result in his immediately being charged with aggravated murder.thus,his only other option,as stated by officer walker,was to take the polygraph that day without the assistance of counsel.
framing the issue in this way is inherently coercive and violative of miranda.furthermore,in so doing,officer walker crossed the line from stating the truth to distorting the truth and,arguably,to giving legal advice.officers run a high risk when they move into the realm of offering advice.it is quite possible that,had simpson spoken with an attorney,the attorney could have arranged for a polygraph at a later date.officer walker essentially advised simpson to the contrary.as the fifth circuit in a case in which officers responded to an equivocal request for counsel by stating that an attorney could not relate the suspect story to the police,and the officer explained that an attorney would probably advise him to say nothing explained 
t he limited inquiry permissible after an equivocal request for legal counsel may not take the form of an argument between interrogators and suspect about whether having counsel would be in the suspect best interests or not.nor may it incorporate a presumption by the interrogator to tell the suspect what counsel advice to him would be if he were present.such measures are foreign to the purpose of clarification,which is not to persuade but to discern.
officer cunningham explanation of the consequences of the suspect talking to counsel might have been innocuous,even proper,had it been correct but even such explanations are perilous and,if given,must not be materially incorrect.
here they were incorrect it was simply not true,as thompson was told,that if he told his attorney he could not tell his side of the story.the point is that counsel advice about what is best for the suspect to do is for counsel,not the interrogator,to give.and it is for him to give after consultation with his client and after weighing where the suspect best interests lie from the point of view of the suspect,not from that of a policeman be he ever so well intentioned.until this occurs,it is simply impossible to predict what counsel advice would be and even if it were,the right to advice of counsel surely is the right to advice from counsel,not from the interrogator.
thompson wainwright,cir.
thompson reasoning applies with equal force here.simpson correctly viewed officer walker as having superior knowledge about his circumstances and options.officer walker crossed the line separating adversary from advisor when he said that simpson only needed an attorney if he was lying.not only was this not true as a matter of legal strategy,as lawyers routinely instruct even innocent clients not to speak with the police,but,even if it were true,it was not officer walker place to give the advice.thus,because miranda itself expressly disapproved of the tactics used here,as confirmed by kyger and because the warden attempt to distinguish kyger is unpersuasive,we find that the state court admission of the june statement was an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent.
april statements 
the june statements were preceded by two interrogations in april,on the and the,during which time simpson was in jail for a separate offense.acting on a tip that simpson might have known something about the arson,detective kallay and agent ozbolt arranged to meet with simpson in jail.in his april statements,simpson denied any involvement at all in the arson.he claimed,however,to know that pumpkin kelly and leah met the day before the incident.he also claimed that kelly had called simpson to request a ride around the time of the fire and that,when he picked kelly up,kelly was excited and smelled like gasoline.the officers did not administer miranda warnings at the outset of either interview.
simpson later moved to suppress both april statements due to the officers failure to give miranda warnings.the state court overruled the motion on the basis that simpson was not in custody under miranda during the interrogations,so no warnings were required.at trial,the prosecutor introduced the two statements for the purpose of showing that simpson had not been truthful with the police in april.the prosecutor sought to show that,because simpson lied to the officers in april by denying involvement completely,he similarly lied in his june statements when he admitted to only limited involvement.in other words,the prosecutor asked the jury to credit simpson june statements up to the point that he implicated himself at all.however,the prosecutor urged the jury not to credit the june statements insofar as simpson minimized his involvement in the arson,and pointed to the april statements as proof of why the jury should so conclude.the state appellate court affirmed the trial court ruling,and it further held that any error in admitting the evidence was harmless because the april statements were not inculpatory on their face.
the state court held that,although simpson was in prison at the time of the april statements,he was not in custody for purposes of miranda and,thus,no warnings were required.in so holding,the state court cited a string of cases from various circuits,primarily the ninth circuit decision in cervantes walker,cir that have concluded that simply being incarcerated does not,by itself,constitute custody for miranda purposes.instead,the question under these cases is whether there has been a change in the surroundings of the prisoner which results in an added imposition on his freedom of movement.id.at.the state court reliance upon this line of circuit cases was contrary to factually indistinguishable supreme court case law,mathis united states,d.
in mathis,the supreme court addressed the admissibility of statements given without miranda warnings in a case,like this one,in which the individual was in prison serving a sentence on an unrelated state crime.id.at.the government contended that the statements were admissible because the petitioner had not been put in jail by the officers questioning him,but was there for an entirely separate offense,id.at,or,in other words,because the petitioner was not in miranda custody during the interviews.the supreme court concluded that this argument was too minor and shadowy to justify a departure from the conclusions of miranda with reference to warnings to be given to a person held in custody.id.the court went on to state that restricting miranda protections to those that are in custody for the case under investigation would go against the whole purpose of the miranda decision and that there was nothing in the miranda opinion which calls for a curtailment of the warnings to be given persons under interrogation by officers based on the reason why the person is in custody.id.at.and to punctuate the matter with clarity,the court stated 
in speaking of custody the language of the miranda opinion is clear and unequivocal to summarize,we hold that when an individual is taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom by the authorities in any significant way and is subjected to questioning,the privilege against is jeopardized.
id.at.quoting miranda,at.indeed,in dissent,justice white objected to the majority cavalier extension of the definition of miranda custody.id.at.white,dissenting.
there is no relevant factual distinction between mathis and the circumstances of simpson april statements.quite tellingly,the state court never cited mathis.here,as in mathis,state agents unaffiliated with the prison isolated an inmate and questioned him about an unrelated incident without first giving miranda warnings.the supreme court ruled that such action was improper and that any resulting statements must be suppressed as there is no material factual distinction,the april statements were admitted contrary to supreme court precedent.
harmless error analysis 
on collateral review of a state prosecution,a constitutional error will not be deemed harmless if the court concludes that it had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict.fry pliler,d.if the court finds itself with grave doubt as to the effect of an error,the error was not harmless.franklin bradshaw,cir citing mcaninch,d.
in this case,as the ohio court of appeals noted,simpson statements were,by far,the most damning evidence against him.simpson,wl,ohio app.lexis,at without question,the most incriminating evidence presented against appellant at trial were his own statements.there was no physical evidence or eyewitness linking him to the arson.aside from his statements,only two other pieces of evidence potentially implicated simpson a sheriff deputy at the local jail testified that he overheard simpson ask why did they charge the bitch too.it was her idea to start the fire.and an inmate from a cell next to simpson testified that simpson told him that there were three people involved in the fire,he was one of them,and that they used molotov cocktails.
as set forth above,we have found that both april statements and the june statements were admitted in violation of miranda and its progeny,but that the june statement was properly admitted against simpson.in light of the strong role that the statements played in both the state presentation of the case and the evidence against simpson,we believe it beyond question that the errors were not harmless,at least as to some of the convictions against simpson.
the june statement was,for lack of a better description,all over the place.simpson never actually took the polygraph,but spoke at length with the man who would be the polygraph examiner.at one point,he retracted his admissions of june,returning to the position he took in april that he was not involved at all.however,after further pressure from kallay and ozbolt,simpson admitted to being even more involved than he had admitted in his june statement.he admitted to hearing leah and kelly discuss the arson one week before it happened that,on the day of the arson,he heard leah tell kelly that she wanted the house blown up and that he heard leah tell kelly how to make a molotov cocktail.simpson admissions on june were,by far,the strongest evidence of not only his involvement in the arson,but also the extent of his knowledge and involvement before,during,and after the arson.
however,even in the june statement,simpson still maintained that he had not been involved in the planning of the arson or in making the molotov cocktails,and had no intent to kill anyone.thus,to prove that simpson acted with the purpose of causing the death of another,the state needed something more than simpson own admissions.creatively,the state turned to simpson april denials to prove this element.
the state court found the april statements to be harmless for the simple reason that they were not facially inculpatory.however,this misses the point.again,kyger is instructive 
the state appeals court and the district court held that the error of admitting kyger november statements was harmless because the statements were exculpatory.the state continues to make this argument.their argument is that the admission of these statements was not only not prejudicial to kyger,it was helpful to him.we are unpersuaded by this argument.we know better than to think that the prosecution admitted evidence and emphasized it in its opening and closing statements purely out of such a benign motive.kyger statements contradicted hard physical evidence and made him look like a liar.as the second circuit has noted 
a defendant false exculpatory statement is admissible at trial to show his consciousness of guilt and may be an important part of the government proof.if the statement was taken in violation of the defendant constitutional rights,the fact that it was meant to exculpate does not make it any less subject to suppression.
kyger,at emphasis in original quoting united states quiroz,cir citations omitted see also innis,at.by incriminating response we refer to any response whether inculpatory or exculpatory that the prosecution may seek to introduce at trial.emphasis in original miranda,at.t he prosecution may not use statements,whether exculpatory or inculpatory,stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against.emphasis added.the kyger concurrence echoed this sentiment 
kyger comments during the interrogation were in my opinion highly inculpatory because they showed,in light of the real facts,that he was lying.the prosecution took full advantage of these lies at trial,repeatedly juxtaposing what kyger told the police with what the physical evidence actually showed.
kyger,at merritt,concurring.accordingly,it is that the april statements were not harmless merely because they were facially exculpatory.
the warden argues that the june statements and the other evidence are sufficient to convict simpson for the crimes of which he was charged he had admitted to seeing kelly make the molotov cocktails,vaguely knowing that kelly and leah had a problem with aleta bell,driving the car when kelly got out with the molotov cocktails,and driving the car away when kelly returned.however,the warden makes this argument under the assumption that both june statements were properly admitted,whereas we have already concluded that the june statement should have been suppressed.in any event,simpson contends that,regardless of the other evidence,the admission of the april statements made him appear to the jury to be a liar,thus casting heavy doubt on the full truth of his june statements.this was specifically harmful,simpson claims,with regard to the charges of aggravated murder,murder,and the five counts of attempted murder,which the jury was instructed were specific intent crimes,meaning that simpson must have acted with the purpose of causing death as opposed to merely knowing that death was a likely result.purpose was defined for the jury as requiring proof of a conscious objective of producing the specific result,here a specific intention to purposely cause the death of another.simpson contends that,if the jury had not found the purpose element to have been proven,it would have acquitted him of all the murder and attempted murder counts.we agree.
the state offered no direct evidence that it was simpson purpose to kill anyone as,even in his most revealing statement of june,simpson had specifically denied knowing that kelly intended to blow up the house.instead,the state introduced evidence tending to establish kelly purpose to kill aleta bell and asked that the jury infer that simpson shared this intent.thus,whether the jury was willing to make this inference depended,in large part,on whether the jury believed simpson june statements admitting to participation but disclaiming knowledge or purpose.in other words,the strength of the inference depended upon the jury appraisal of simpson credibility.as simpson correctly notes,the jury deliberated for a long period of time approximately hours over three days and,a few hours before reaching a verdict,asked whether there was difference between purposely caused the death and purposeful killing,indicating that the jury was wrestling with the concept of purpose.
at oral argument,counsel for the warden conceded,as the record reflects,that the state only evidence in support of its theory that simpson shared kelly intent and purpose was based on an adverse credibility finding as to simpson.nevertheless,the warden contends that,even if the april statements are taken out of the picture,there was still enough evidence to show that simpson was a liar.the warden points to a lie that simpson told the officers as to kelly whereabouts,but this was only marginally relevant,if at all,as it does not concern the extent of simpson involvement in the crime and,at trial,this statement was not played to the jury because the prosecutor did not believe it added anything.thus,the jury likely did not rely upon this lie to make its adverse credibility determination.
the warden also points out that,in his june statement,simpson at one point reverted back to claiming no involvement at all in the arson.but,as we have now found,the june statement was inadmissible,so the warden may not rely upon that statement for purposes of an adverse credibility determination.furthermore,saying that the jury could have made an adverse credibility determination based solely on the june statements goes against the weight of how matters progressed at trial.the june interviews themselves,which were played to the jury,contained many statements by the officers accusing simpson of lying in his april statements.furthermore,the prosecutor emphasized this point in his questioning of the officers before the jury,were you always concerned that he might have minimized his involvement based upon his minimization or denial of involvement in his prior interviews.
in sum,although the jury perhaps could have made the requisite adverse credibility determination notwithstanding the april interviews,it is much more likely that the jury did not in fact do so in light of the heavy emphasis placed by the officers and the prosecution on the april lies.we therefore hold that the admission of the april statements was not harmless as to those convictions that required as an essential element a specific intent to cause the death of another aggravated murder,murder,and attempted murder.this finding is reinforced when the error in admitting the april statements is combined with the error in admitting the june statement.when viewed together,these statements show a person who initially denied any involvement but who then steadily admitted to more involvement with each subsequent interview.a juror faced with this progression of successive revelations of deeper involvement would not have very far to extrapolate from simpson june admissions to the state theory of purpose.remove the april statements and the june statement,however,and this juror would have to make a rather blind leap to infer the state theory of purpose based solely on the june statement.
however,though we find the errors not harmless as to the specific intent crimes,the same does not hold true for the general intent convictions of aggravated arson and five counts of felonious assault.this is so because simpson june statement was properly introduced against him.his admissions in that statement,standing alone,would be more than adequate to allow a reasonable juror to convict on the general intent crimes.simpson,therefore,is not entitled to relief as to those convictions.accordingly,we grant in part and deny in part simpson request for a writ of habeas corpus.simpson convictions of aggravated murder,murder,and attempted murder are void.simpson must still serve the remainder of the sentence imposed on his convictions for aggravated arson and felonious assault 
for the reasons set forth above,we grant in part and deny in part simpson petition for writ of habeas corpus and remand to the district court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
i concur in the majority opinion except with regard to the june statement.i would grant habeas relief as to this statement as well.
i agree with the majority that when simpson made the statement.i ai done nah i messed up last time i did that,giving two variations of the word no,along with accompanying negative body language,and then followed up with the statement that it could help,he unequivocally invoked his miranda rights i do not agree,however,that it was permissible for the officers to later circle back to the miranda
