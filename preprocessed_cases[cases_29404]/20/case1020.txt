after his third death sentence for the murder of irvin and rose bronstein was affirmed by the maryland courts,john filed a federal habeas corpus petition.the district court granted in part his petition on the ground that the removal of intoxication as a statutory mitigating factor at his violated the ex post facto clause.but the court rejected his claims concerning a potentially coercive allen charge,the failure to bifurcate the sentencing hearing,and ineffective assistance of trial counsel.

in march,filed a petition for habeas corpus in the united states district court for the district of maryland,raising claims.he asserted,inter alia,that the change to the maryland death penalty statute,which removed intoxication from the list of statutory mitigating factors,violated the ex post facto clause of article i,of the constitution.further,he argued that the trial judge erred in giving an charge to the sentencing jury after it indicated that it was split on whether he was a first degree principal.see allen united states.moreover,he claimed that he was denied due process when the trial judge refused to bifurcate the sentencing proceedings.in his view,the jury should have first determined whether he was a first degree principal before any evidence regarding aggravating and mitigating factors was presented.finally,he alleged ineffective assistance of counsel during his trial.
the district court granted in part petition for writ of habeas corpus based on his ex post facto claim.it further concluded that his other claims either were procedurally defaulted or did not provide a basis for relief.see nuth,d.

we review de novo the district court decision to grant or deny habeas relief to a state prisoner.spicer roxbury corr,cir.in addition,because the state court adjudicated the merits of ex post facto claim,our review of its decision is limited by the deferential standard set forth in d,as interpreted by the supreme court in williams taylor,d.bell jarvis,cir en banc,cert.denied,bell beck,d thus,federal habeas relief may not be granted unless the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.
clearly established federal law refers to the holdings,as opposed to the dicta,of th e court decisions as of the time of the relevant decision.williams,at.further,a decision is contrary to the court clearly established precedent if the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in the court cases,or confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of th e court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from its precedent.id.at.
finally,a decision involves an unreasonable application of the court precedent if the court correctly identifies the governing legal rule but applies it unreasonably to the facts of a particular prisoner case,id.at,or was unreasonable in refusing to extend the governing legal principle to a context in which the principle should have controlled.ramdass angelone,d opinion of kennedy.the court has stressed that 
i n d,congress specifically used the word unreasonable,and not a term like erroneous or incorrect.under d unreasonable application clause,then,a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.rather,that application must also be unreasonable.

at the time the bronsteins were murdered,maryland death penalty statute listed several mitigating circumstances,including intoxication,g.effective july,intoxication was removed from that section.both before and after the change,the statute contained a provision which allowed the jury to consider a ny other facts which the jury or the court specifically sets forth in writing that it finds as mitigating circumstances in the case.g.the maryland court of appeals described the effect of the change 
previously the burden was on the murderer to prove by a preponderance of the evidence diminished capacity as a result of intoxication.if the jury found that fact,then the statute determined that it was mitigating and that it was to be considered in weighing whether the aggravating circumstance outweighed intoxication and any other mitigating circumstances.after the change,the murderer has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence both the fact of diminished capacity due to intoxication and that it is a mitigating circumstance.
booth iv,at citations omitted.
during the sentencing proceedings,asked that the verdict form contain the language,but his request was denied.on direct appeal,he argued that the refusal to include that language on the verdict sheet violated the ex post facto clause because it required him to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that intoxication was a mitigating circumstance.
the maryland court of appeals found no constitutional violation because the change did not fit into one of the three categories of ex post facto laws identified in collins youngblood,d.booth iv,at.these categories include punishing as a crime an act previously committed,which was innocent when done making the punishment for a crime more burdensome after its commission and depriving one charged with a crime of any defense available at the time the act was committed.collins,at.quoting beazell ohio.the state court further held that the change was merely procedural.booth iv,at.
the district court disagreed.it found that t he change in the statute that was applied to,which effectively lowered the prosecution burden of proof by increasing the burden placed on the defendant,falls within the fourth ex post facto category,d at.this category encompasses e very law that alters the legal rules of evidence,and receives less,or different testimony,than the law required at the time of the commission of the offence,in order to convict the offender.calder bull,dall.the district court noted that the continuing vitality of this category was recently affirmed in carmell texas,d,d at.it then held that the state court conclusion that the statutory amendment in case did not fit into any of the ex post facto categories violate d supreme court precedent and therefore wa s contrary to clearly established federal law,as well as constitute d an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.id.at.
we underscored above the standard of review in habeas cases because it severely restrains the authority of the federal courts,and because,as john hart ely once noted in a different context,f amiliarity breeds inattention.john hart ely,democracy and distrust a theory of judicial review.in looking afresh at the district court grant of the writ,the question before us is not whether the state court misconstrued or unreasonably applied present supreme court precedent when it failed to consider the fourth category of ex post facto clause violations.rather,the issue is whether that category was clearly established at the time of the state court decision.it clearly was not 
to begin with,the supreme court clarification in carmell that the fourth category continues to exist,see at,is not germane to this inquiry.in carmell,the court held that an amendment to a texas statute removing the requirement that a victim testimony be corroborated in certain sexual offense cases fell within the fourth category of ex post facto clause violations.id.at.nevertheless,carmell came down almost eight years after the decision of the maryland court of appeals in the case at bar.carmell thus does not meet the requirement that the guiding precedent of the court be as of the time of the relevant decision.williams,at.
in addition,as far back as beazell,the supreme court identified the types of ex post facto clause violations without so much as mentioning calder fourth category.at.the court offered this explanation for the exclusion 
expressions are to be found in earlier judicial opinions to the effect that the constitutional limitation may be transgressed by alterations in the rules of evidence or procedure.see calder bull but it is now well settled that statutory changes in the mode of trial or the rules of evidence,which do not deprive the accused of a defense and which operate only in a limited and unsubstantial manner to his disadvantage,are not prohibited.
beazell,at.
even more significantly,the supreme court in collins appeared to validate beazell omission of the fourth category in holding that a texas statute allowing an appellate court to reform an improper verdict rather than order a new trial did not violate the ex post facto clause.at.the court first reproduced beazell confident summar y of the meaning of the clause.id.at.then,after noting that t he beazell definition omits the reference by justice chase in calder to alterations in the legal rules of evidence,the court explained that cases subsequent to calder make clear that this language was not intended to prohibit the application of new evidentiary rules in trials for crimes committed before the changes.id.at.further,the court stated without qualification that t he beazell formulation is faithful to our best knowledge of the original understanding of the ex post facto clause legislatures may not retroactively alter the definition of crimes or increase the punishment for criminal acts.id.at.indeed,collins ends by reiterating that the constitution contemplates only three types of ex post facto clause violations 
the texas statute allowing reformation of improper verdicts does not punish as a crime an act previously committed,which was innocent when done nor make more burdensome the punishment for a crime,after its commission nor deprive one charged with crime of any defense available according to law at the time when the act was committed.its application to respondent therefore is not prohibited by the ex post facto clause of art.i.
id.at.see also cal.dep t of corr.morales,d identifying the types of ex post facto laws without mentioning the fourth category.
this textual evidence accounts for justice ginsburg observation in carmell that if one considers the context of the full text of the collins opinion,then a strong case can be made that collins pared the number of calder categories down to three,eliminating altogether the fourth category.at.ginsburg,dissenting.and the chief justice,who wrote the opinion in collins,joined justice ginsburg dissent in carmell.indeed,even the carmell majority acknowledged that collins is rather cryptic on the status of the fourth category.id.at.
thus,all of the justices in carmell agreed that collins did not offer clear guidance on the present viability of the fourth category.further,it made eminent sense for the maryland court of appeals to rely on collins,for it had been decided only two years earlier.in view of these critical facts,we are compelled to conclude that the district court erred in holding that the state court acted contrary to or unreasonably applied clearly established federal law.when the state court rendered its decision,there was nothing clearly established about the fourth category.it was therefore not unreasonable for the state court to discount it.
the district court erred for another reason.after stating that p rocedural changes,even those which disadvantage a defendant,do not fall into any of the four calder categories and therefore do not violate the ex post facto clause,the court went on to hold that the change in g was not procedural 
it does not alter the type of evidence that is admissible during the sentencing proceeding,nor does it merely change the procedure for determining mitigating circumstances.rather,it imposes on the defendant an additional burden,he must now show not only that intoxication substantially impaired his ability to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or conform his conduct to the requirements of law,but also that this constitutes a mitigating circumstance.the amendment thus imposes an impermissible change in the amount or degree of proof.

but t he constitution deals with substance,not shadows.cummings missouri,wall.the amendment did not change the elements of the crime of murder during the commission of a robbery.nor did it alter the fact that this crime was punishable by death in maryland,a fact of which state law gave clear notice.the amendment also did not remove intoxication as a possible mitigating circumstance in death penalty proceedings.indeed,it did not remove any mitigating factors from the jury consideration.
further,after the amendment the defendant continued to have the burden of producing evidence of intoxication and of persuading as many jurors as possible to find as a fact that he was intoxicated.the district court failed to make a critical distinction between the concepts of consideration and weight.as the state court of appeals explained,b oth before and after the amendment,the amount of weight to be given to intoxication as a mitigating circumstance turned on the judgment of each individual juror.booth iv,at.so,for example 
a juror who finds that the defendant was intoxicated and who is instructed that intoxication is to be considered as a mitigating circumstance but who personally believes that intoxication does not excuse responsibility for one conduct,will give very little weight in the balancing process to intoxication when honoring a statutory declaration that it is a mitigating circumstance.
id.at.the amendment merely altered the procedure for determining whether the fact of intoxication,if found,is mitigating.and it did so only modestly.this was a change in the procedures by which a criminal case is adjudicated,as opposed to a change in the substantive law of crimes.collins,at.
indeed,this procedural change is far less disadvantageous to defendants such as than several others which have been found not to violate the ex post facto clause.see,collins,d dobbert florida,d evans thompson,cir united states mest,cir.for example,in dobbert ten of twelve jurors in a capital case recommended life imprisonment.the trial judge overruled the jury and imposed the death penalty.under the law in effect at the time of the murders,the jury recommendation was binding on the trial judge.but the law was changed,rendering t
