opinion of the court 
jose juan chavez alvarez appeals the district court denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.he contends that the government is violating his right to due process by detaining him,pursuant to c without a bond hearing since june.we will reverse the district court order and remand with instruction to grant the writ of habeas corpus and ensure that chavez alvarez is promptly afforded a bond hearing.
chavez alvarez,a citizen of mexico,entered the united states at a young age without inspection and later adjusted to lawful permanent resident status.he married a united states citizen,but is now divorced.he has two sons who are united states citizens.in,while serving in the united states army in south korea,a general court martial convicted him of giving false official statements,sodomy,and violating the general article it sentenced him to eighteen months of imprisonment.he served thirteen months in prison and was released on february.
immigration customs and enforcement agents arrested chavez alvarez on june,and served him with a notice to appear,charging him with being removable under a a iii for his conviction on an aggravated felony.he was ordered detained without bond under c and sent to york county prison.
the total number of days that chavez alvarez has been held in civil detention since his arrest,of itself,gives us reason for pause.however,we judge the reasonableness of a detention during the removal process by tak ing into account a given individual detainee need for more or less time,as well as the exigencies of a particular case.diop,cir.our close review of this record has been significant to our deliberation about the constitutionality of chavez alvarez detention.and so,we begin by summarizing what happened in the immigration court.
shortly after his arrest,chavez alvarez obtained counsel and challenged the government case for removal.the immigration judge accepted pleadings on june,chavez alvarez argued against removability.ten days later,the government,pursuant to a a ii,added a charge that chavez alvarez was removable on the ground of being convicted for two or more crimes involving moral turpitude.roughly five weeks after he was arrested,on july,the immigration judge denied chavez alvarez request for a bail hearing filed two days after his arrest on june,ruling that he was subject to mandatory detention under section c in compliance with matter of joseph,bia.
between august and october of,the immigration judge held two hearings.during this time,chavez alvarez denied that he was removable on the new charge,and challenged the government claim that his earlier conviction made him removable.two issues emerged during these hearings whether the manual for courts marshal which the government used to categorize his crime has the effect of law and,whether chavez alvarez eighteen month sentence arose from all of his crimes,or just the sodomy conviction.chavez alvarez said at the october hearing that,if necessary,he would request a h waiver of inadmissibility,pursuant to h.
the fifth hearing was held on november,almost five months into chavez alvarez detention.the immigration judge ruled that chavez alvarez was removable.specifically,he concluded that sodomy by force is a crime of violence under a and b,qualifying as an aggravated felony under a f.but,the immigration judge also told chavez alvarez that he would consider a h waiver,and encouraged him to have a petition for an alien relative form i filed on his behalf to accompany the waiver.
over the next four months,the immigration judge held four more hearings.during this time,it became clear that chavez alvarez was seeking only a standalone waiver this brought up a question of whether and when chavez alvarez had been admitted to the country.the immigration judge then requested briefing on the implications of the ruling in matter of sanchez,bia,to chavez alvarez eligibility for the waiver.
on march,at the final hearing,nine months after he was arrested and detained,the immigration judge issued an oral decision denying chavez alvarez application for a h waiver.this was the sole remaining issue.chavez alvarez stated that he was reserving his right to appeal.
on april,approximately months after his arrest and detention,chavez alvarez appealed to the board of immigration appeals bia.the government filed a motion with the bia for a summary affirmance,but the bia affirmed the immigration judge decision in a precedential decision on march,over months after chavez alvarez arrest and detention.chavez alvarez then petitioned this court for review of the bia decision 
chavez alvarez says that the government is violating his due process rights by detaining him for an unreasonable amount of time without conducting a hearing at which he would have the opportunity to be released on bond the law applying to chavez alvarez issue is well established.it was long ago decided that the government has authority to detain any alien during removal proceedings.wong wing united states.before,significant numbers of aliens convicted of serious crimes were taking advantage of their release on bond as an opportunity to flee,avoid removal,and commit more crimes.demore kim,d.congress fixed this problem by enacting section c,expanding the range of serious crimes for which the government was required to detain convicted aliens.notably,section c does not give the attorney general any authority to release these aliens on bond.id.at.
the supreme court left no doubt that the government authority under section c to detain aliens without an opportunity for bond complies with the constitution.id.at.however,as we discuss below,we read demore as also recognizing that there are limits to this power.diop,leslie attorney of the united states,cir.
when the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the law in demore,it also gave us insight into how,from a due process perspective,section c allowance of detention without bail worked.the court reiterated the fundamental idea that aliens are protected by constitutional due process.demore,at citing reno flores,d.but,it put the alien issue in perspective,saying i n the exercise of its broad power over naturalization and immigration,congress regularly makes rules that would be unacceptable if applied to citizens.id.at quoting matthews diaz,d.the court went on to say that applying reasonable presumptions and generic rules to groups of aliens for purposes of due process can be consistent with the idea that aliens can be treated differently.id.at quoting flores,at see also carlson landon.
the court,in essence,concluded that congress lawfully required the attorney general to make presumptions of flight and dangerousness about the alien solely because he belonged to the group of aliens convicted of the types of crimes defined in section c these presumptions,demore says,justified the alien detention and eliminated the need for an individualized bond hearing they were the reason the alien detention without a bond hearing was not an arbitrary deprivation of liberty.id.at such detention necessarily serves the purpose of preventing deportable criminal aliens from fleeing prior to or during their removal proceedings,thus increasing the chance that,if ordered removed,the aliens will be successfully removed.
eight years after demore,we addressed the question of whether the government use of section c to detain an alien for almost three years without a bond hearing complied with due process.diop.citing earlier decisions by the supreme court,we recognized the importance of judicial deference to the executive branch in immigration matters,negusie holder,d,but also noted that a court must use its independent judgment to decide whether a detention is reasonably necessary to secure removal.diop,at quoting zadvydas,at.although the government cited to demore and argued it had authority to detain diop for as long as the removal process takes,we highlighted justice kennedy concurring opinion in demore,which made it clear that balancing competing interests was implicit in the supreme court ruling that section c was constitutional.he said 
s ince the due process clause prohibits arbitrary deprivations of liberty,a lawful permanent resident alien such as respondent could be entitled to an individualized determination as to his risk of flight and dangerousness if the continued detention became unreasonable or unjustified.
demore,at citing zadvydas davis,d.importantly,he added 
were there to be an unreasonable delay by the ins in pursuing and completing deportation proceedings,it could become necessary to inquire whether the detention is not to facilitate deportation,or to protect against risk of flight or dangerousness,but to incarcerate for other reasons.
id.at kennedy,concurring.considering this,along with the attention the court gave to the average length of removal cases,we concluded that the court in demore expected the detentions under section c to be brief,and that this expectation was key to their conclusion that the law complied with due process.diop,at citing demore,u.at.for all of these reasons,we said t he constitutionality of this practice is a function of the length of the detention t he constitutional case for continued detention without inquiry into its necessity becomes more and more suspect as detention continues past certain thresholds.diop,at.
by its very nature,the use of a balancing framework makes any determination on reasonableness highly in circumstances like those in demore,it is not arbitrary or capricious to use a presumption that the alien will flee or be dangerous in the case of every detainee for the purpose of eliminating the need for bond hearings,because the cost of their deprivation of liberty is outweighed by the need or benefit of detaining this whole group to achieve the goals of the statute.the relative weight of the competing interests in cases like these favor the government position.yet,due process requires us to recognize that,at a certain point which may differ case by the burden to an alien liberty outweighs a mere presumption that the alien will flee is dangerous.at this tipping point,the government can no longer defend the detention against claims that it is arbitrary or capricious by presuming flight and dangerousness more is needed to justify the detention as necessary to achieve the goals of the statute.as we said in diop,section c implicitly authorizes detention for a reasonable amount of time,after which the authorities must make an individualized inquiry into whether detention is still necessary to fulfill the statute purposes of ensuring that an alien attends removal proceedings and that his release will not pose a danger to the community.id.at.in diop case,we weighed the goals of the statute against the personal costs to his liberty resulting from his detention of roughly two years,eleven months,and concluded that diop detention was unconstitutional.id.
in diop,however,our balancing also took into account our finding that the government was responsible for creating unreasonable delays.id.at.in contrast,chavez alvarez does not accuse the government of creating unreasonable delays.he attributes the length of his case to complex issues.the government uses chavez alvarez position to defend the reasonableness of the detention here,pointing to our statement in diop that every case is unique and requires different amounts of time.see id.building on this idea,the government says where its handling of the case is reasonable,and the length of the case is due mostly to issues raised by the alien,we have no authority to rule that the length of the detention is unreasonable.
the flaw in the government argument is that it too closely ties the reasonableness of the detention to the way it acted during the removal process.the primary point of reference for justifying the alien confinement must be whether the civil detention is necessary to achieve the statute goals ensuring participation in the removal process,and protecting the community from the danger that he or she poses.see demore,at.therefore,it is possible that a detention may be unreasonable even though the government has handled the removal case in a reasonable way.diop,at i ndividual actions by various actors in the immigration system,each of which takes only a reasonable amount of time to accomplish,can nevertheless result in the detention of a removable alien for an unreasonable,and ultimately unconstitutional,period of time.
the government next wants us to judge the reasonableness of the detention based upon chavez alvarez handling of the case.it argues that chavez alvarez created the circumstances that resulted in his long detention and he is not,therefore,deserving of any relief.it takes care,however,to alter its position from the one it took in a case we decided in.leslie.there,it asserted unsuccessfully that the petitioner decision to appeal his removal order was the reason for a lengthy detention,undermining his claim that the detention was unconstitutional.we granted leslie petition,ruling that the government position would effectively punish leslie for pursuing applicable legal remedies.id.at alteration in original quoting oyedeji ashcroft,d.in this case,the government acknowledges that chavez alvarez raised complicated issues that required time to argue and decide,but it wants us to focus on the fact that,thus far,his challenge has been unsuccessful.it argues that chavez alvarez has been merely delaying his inevitable removal.
although,as we will explain,we are not persuaded that chavez alvarez case is little more than a delay tactic,we get the point that the government is trying to make certain cases might be distinguishable from our holding in leslie.an argument could be made that aliens who are merely gaming the system to delay their removal should not be rewarded with a bond hearing that they would not otherwise get under the statute requiring a bond hearing in such cases might return us to the very situation that congress was trying to fix.
because we conclude that chavez alvarez did not act in bad faith,we do not need to decide here whether an alien delay tactics should preclude a bond hearing.however,the government argument requires us to consider how we are to distinguish arguments made in good faith from those that are not.the issue of good faith is necessarily decided on the individual circumstances,but the analysis is more complex than the method posed by the government counting wins and losses.the most important consideration for us is whether an alien challenges aspects of the government case that present real issues,for example a genuine factual dispute poor legal reasoning reliance on a contested legal theory or the presence of a new legal issue.where questions are legitimately raised,the wisdom of our ruling in leslie is plainly relevant we can not effectively punish these aliens for choosing to exercise their legal right to challenge the government case against them by rendering the corresponding increase in time of detention as reasonable.leslie,at.
the case for chavez alvarez removal is grounded in his crimes that happened many years before immigration and customs enforcement detained him.before the immigration judge,chavez alvarez questioned whether the government correctly alleged that he was convicted of an aggravated felony under a f.this,in turn,made it necessary to study whether the manual for courts marshal had the effect of law.he later argued that he was eligible for a h waiver,and this created a number of unique questions centering on the issue of whether chavez alvarez has been legally admitted to the country for purposes of the waiver.we can not find any evidence that chavez alvarez raised any of these issues,nor requested any continuance,for the purpose of delay.as everyone agrees,the legal questions were complex and unusual,and there is no evidence in the record that the immigration judge viewed chavez alvarez as stalling or wasting the court time with frivolous arguments.in fact,the immigration judge said the following before issuing the removal order 
burch,i want to thank you and also shagin,as well as the government for the arguments that each of you have made.they have been very learned and they have referenced some decisions that actually have been used in a number o
