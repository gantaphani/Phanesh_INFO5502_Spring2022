in,william scott macdonald was convicted after a bench trial in the circuit court of the city of colonial heights,virginia,of two offenses the misdemeanor offense of contributing to the delinquency of a minor,in contravention of virginia code section and the felony offense of violating the commonwealth criminal solicitation statute,found in section.the criminal solicitation statute provides that a ny person age eighteen or older who commands,entreats,or otherwise attempts to persuade another person under age eighteen to commit a predicate felony,a felony other than murder,shall be guilty of a felony.
the predicate felony for macdonald criminal solicitation offense was the commonwealth crimes against nature statute,which criminalizes,inter alia,carnal knowledge by one person of another by the anus or mouth,an act commonly known as sodomy.a.macdonald was sentenced to ten years in prison with nine years suspended for criminal solicitation,plus twelve months on the misdemeanor offense.upon release,macdonald was placed on probation and compelled to register as a sex offender.
in,after failing to obtain relief on direct appeal and in state postconviction proceedings,macdonald filed a petition in the eastern district of virginia.macdonald alleged,among other things,that his criminal solicitation conviction,insofar as it was predicated on the provision of virginia code section a,contravened the constitution.more specifically,macdonald contended that the predicate provision had been rendered invalid by the supreme court decision in lawrence texas,d striking down texas statute as facially violative of fourteenth amendment due process clause.the district court rejected macdonald constitutional challenges to section a and dismissed his petition.see macdonald holder,cv,wl,the opinion 
on october,macdonald filed a timely notice of appeal.he thereafter requested the issuance of a certificate of appealability coa from this court.see c a.we granted his coa request on april,identifying the issue for appeal as whether virginia code section a is unconstitutional either facially or as applied in macdonald case,in light of the supreme court lawrence decision.the coa circumscribes this appeal to an examination of the constitutionality of a single aspect of section a,which provides 
if any person carnally knows any male or female person by the anus or by or with the mouth,or voluntarily submits to such carnal knowledge,he or she shall be guilty of a felony.
we herein use the term provision to refer to the foregoing portion of section a as explained below,we are constrained to vacate the district court judgment and remand for an award of habeas corpus relief on the ground that the provision facially violates the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.
macdonald was years old at the time of the events giving rise to his state court convictions on the evening of september,macdonald telephoned amanda johnson,a young woman he had met through a mutual acquaintance.macdonald and johnson arranged to meet that night at a home depot parking lot in colonial heights.when they arrived at the parking lot,macdonald got into the backseat of johnson vehicle and they drove to the nearby home of johnson grandmother.johnson went into her grandmother residence to retrieve a book,and when she returned to the vehicle macdonald asked her to suck his dick.j.macdonald also suggested that they have sex in a shed in johnson grandmother yard.johnson declined both proposals,however,and she drove macdonald back to the home depot parking lot.
nearly three months later,in december,macdonald filed a report with the colonial heights police maintaining that johnson had abducted and sexually assaulted him.macdonald thereafter met with and was interviewed by detective stephanie early.macdonald advised early that,sometime in september,johnson had paged him and asked that he meet her in the home depot parking lot.macdonald stated that,once they met,he got into johnson car and she drove them away.when macdonald asked johnson where she was going,she did not respond.macdonald told her,t his has got to stop,lose my number,i married,do call me anymore.macdonald also advised detective early that he and johnson stopped at a location on canterbury lane in colonial heights,and at that point johnson forcibly removed his penis from his pants and performed oral sex against his will.id.macdonald acknowledged that he knew johnson was only seventeen years old.
soon thereafter,detective early met with and interviewed johnson,who gave a sharply conflicting account of what had occurred.crediting johnson version of the events,early secured three arrest warrants for macdonald,charging the felony criminal solicitation offense the misdemeanor offense of contributing to the delinquency of a minor and the misdemeanor offense of knowingly giv ing a false report as to the commission of a crime to the police with the intent to mislead,in violation of virginia code section.see.macdonald was arrested on january.he was prosecuted in the juvenile and domestic relations court of colonial heights on the false police report charge,and in the circuit court on the other two charges.
on may,macdonald pleaded guilty to filing a false police report,in connection with his false complaint to detective early.as a result,he was sentenced to twelve months in jail,with six months suspended.on june,macdonald moved in the circuit court to dismiss the criminal solicitation charge on the ground that the predicate felony the provision violated his due process rights.relying on lawrence texas,macdonald asserted that the supreme court had invalidated all state statutes that prohibit consensual sodomy between individuals with the capacity to consent.a bench trial was conducted in the circuit court on july,where johnson,early,macdonald,and macdonald wife testified after the trial had concluded,on july,the circuit court denied the motion to dismiss,ruling that the provision was not being unconstitutionally applied to macdonald.the following day,the court found macdonald guilty of solicitation to commit a felony,the provision,and deferred ruling on the misdemeanor offense of contributing to the delinquency of a minor.on august,the circuit court convicted macdonald of the misdemeanor offense,and it sentenced him on both offenses.
macdonald appealed his circuit court convictions to the court of appeals of virginia.in doing so,he argued that,in light of lawrence texas,the provision was facially invalid insofar as it relates to consensual sodomy between unrelated individuals who have reached the age of consent,by infringing on the liberty interests protected by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.macdonald thus maintained that the provision could not serve as a predicate felony for the criminal solicitation offense.
in january,the state court of appeals ruled that macdonald lacked standing to assert the facial due process claim and dismissed his appeal.see macdonald commonwealth,wl.in that regard,the court relied on its ruling in mcdonald commonwealth,the previous appeal related to other criminal proceedings involving petitioner macdonald,specifically his prior convictions on four counts of violating virginia provision,twice each with two young women who were sixteen and seventeen years old.there,the court of appeals had rejected macdonald fourteenth amendment due process claims,holding that,because his offenses involved minors,his claim failed and he thus lacked standing to pursue a facial challenge.see mcdonald,at citing ulster cnty.allen,d as a general rule,if there is no constitutional defect in the application of the statute to a litigant,he does not have standing to argue that it would be unconstitutional if applied to third parties in hypothetical situations.in the present case,on september,the supreme court of virginia summarily denied macdonald pro se petition for appeal,and then,on november,denied his petition for rehearing 
on september,macdonald,again proceeding pro se,filed his petition in the eastern district of virginia.therein,macdonald theorized that his conviction was in violation of the ex post facto guarantee of the constitution because the provision is facially unconstitutional and also because it carries punishments that are in direct conflict with equal protection of the law.macdonald maintained,as he had at each previous opportunity,that the lawrence decision invalidated all state provisions,and that the supreme court acted in accordance with numerous prior precedents that struck down laws impinging upon the liberty guarantees of the fifth and fourteenth amendments.id.at.the district court,i n deference to petitioner pro se status,trifurcated macdonald constitutional challenges into an ex post facto claim a facial due process attack and an due process challenge to the provision.see opinion 
in its opinion,the district court dismissed macdonald ex post facto claim to the extent that it differs from the facial attack,as procedurally barred under the rule of slayton parrigan.see opinion see also supra note.proceeding to macdonald facial due process challenge,the district court employed the deferential d standard of review to withhold relief.see infra part iii.the court concluded that the virginia court of appeals had reasonably applied ulster county to decide that macdonald lacked standing to pursue such a claim because his conduct was not constitutionally protected.see opinion.finally,determining that the provision was constitutional as applied to macdonald,the district court endorsed the state court rationale that,because the commonwealth had properly treated as children,and because the lawrence decision had stressed that t he present case does not involve minors,at,the provision could constitutionally serve as a predicate offense under the solicitation statute.see opinion.the district court further explained,
the court of appeals of virginia determination is based on clearly established federal law.virginia considers persons aged sixteen and seventeen to be children,and the supreme court in lawrence explicitly stated that the ruling did not apply to sexual acts involving children.thus,the holding that is not unconstitutional as applied to macdonald is not contrary to,or an unreasonabl e application of,federal law.

the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa governs a federal court handling of a petition filed by a state prisoner.we review de novo a district court denial of a petition.see deyton keller,cir.pursuant to aedpa,however,when a habeas petitioner constitutional claim has been adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings,we may not grant relief unless the state court adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.
in this appeal,macdonald pursues both facial and due process challenges to the provision.he contends not only that the provision was unconstitutional as applied to him,but also that lawrence texas compels the facial invalidation of the provision under the fourteenth amendment even though,as the supreme court of virginia emphasized,lawrence did not involve minors,macdonald argues that t he lawrence court did not preserve those applications of texas sodomy law to the extent that it would apply to minors or in any other circumstance.it invalidated the law in toto.br.of appellant.macdonald maintains that he possesses standing to pursue his facial challenge under the due process clause because the provision was rendered unconstitutional by lawrence.he relies on established supreme court authority for the proposition that standing exists 
where the statute in question has already been declared unconstitutional in the vast majority of its intended applications,and it can fairly be said that it was not intended to stand as valid,on the basis of fortuitous circumstances,only in a fraction of cases it was originally designed to cover.
br.of appellant quoting united states raines,d.
macdonald next asserts that the virginia courts have impermissibly interpreted lawrence as authorizing them to recast the provision which by its terms bans all sodomy offenses and apply the provision solely to sodomy offenses that involve minors.in explaining his position,macdonald contends that 
t he courts of the provision wrongly substitute s the judicial for the legislative department of the government and creates a dangerous precedent to encourage legislatures to set a net large enough to catch all possible offenders,and leave it to the courts to step inside to announce to whom the statute may be applied.
br.of appellant at quoting ayotte planned parenthood of new,d.macdonald further argues that the virginia courts rewriting of the provision was contrary to the intent of virginia general assembly,because the judicially rewritten statute is at odds with other virginia criminal statutes regulating the sexual conduct of persons over eighteen with younger persons.prohibiting carnal knowledge of a child between thirteen and fifteen prohibiting persons over eighteen from certain indecent acts with children under fifteen,including soliciting sodomy.
more particularly,virginia code section a prohibits any person over eighteen from proposing certain sexual conduct including sodomy to any child under the age of years.the foregoing provision,macdonald maintains,was plainly not intended to criminalize activity with minors fifteen or older.he thus contends that virginia judicial rewriting of the provision,rendering it applicable to the solicitation of sodomy from a minor under eighteen,runs afoul of the age specification any child under the age of years embedded in section a.macdonald further asserts that the judicial redrafting of the provision by the virginia courts contravened his due process rights because he did not have and could not have had fair notice that the provision would be construed in a way that renders it applicable to his conduct.
the commonwealth responds to macdonald contentions by maintaining that lawrence did not establish the unconstitutionality of solicitation statutes generally,or macdonald solicitation in particular.br.of appellee.positing that lawrence simply does not apply to statutes that criminalize sodomy involving a minor,virginia emphasizes the district court determination that the provision is constitutional as applied to macdonald.the commonwealth then asserts that macdonald lacks standing to pursue a facial challenge to the provision under the supreme court ulster county decision,because the provision can be constitutionally applied in various circumstances,including those underlying this appeal 
put succinctly,the ulster county decision does not operate to deny standing for macdonald to pursue a facial due process challenge to the provision.under the article iii requirement,a litigant must assert a concrete interest of his own.see lujan defenders of wildlife,d explaining that article iii requires that the plaintiff has suffered an invasion of a legally protected interest,that there is a causal connection between the injury fairly traceable to the challenged action and that it is likely that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision citations omitted.the virginia courts ruled that macdonald had not asserted his own concrete interest in his facial challenge,but rather was pursuing the interests of third parties,in that the provision is constitutional as applied to him.under that theory,macdonald could only pursue a facial challenge to the provision as it applies to others.this determination of the jurisdictional predicate for standing to sue relied entirely on an unfavorable legal resolution of the merits of macdonald constitutional claim.in turn,our resolution of macdonald claim informs at least under the theories propounded by the state and district courts whether macdonald possesses standing to assert a facial challenge to the provision.
in ulster county,the supreme court assessed a habeas petition filed by three state prisoners,challenging a new york statute that permitted a jury to presume that two firearms found in the vehicle in which they were riding had been jointly possessed by them all.the second circuit declared the statute facially unconstitutional,emphasizing its broad reach in potentially applying the presumption to vehicle occupants who may not know they are riding with a gun or who may be aware of the presence of the gun but not permitted access to it.at quoting allen cnty.court,ulster,cir.
the supreme court reversed the court of appeals,however,ruling that the second circuit had unnecessarily addressed the issue of the statute facial invalidity.according to the court,the presumption was constitutionally applied to the three ulster county petitioners,in that the firearms had been discovered in a handbag belonging to the vehicle fourth occupant a female.the court explained the applicable principle as this 
a party has standing to challenge the constitutionality of a statute only insofar as it has an adverse impact on his own rights.as a general rule,if there is no constitutional defect in the application of the statute to a litigant,he does not have standing to argue that it would be unconstitutional if applied to third parties in hypothetical situations.
ulster,at.the court ruling on standing to pursue a facial challenge,as in this case,depended on an unfavorable threshold resolution of an challenge.if the statute had been unconstitutionally applied to the petitioners in ulster county,their own rights would have been adversely affected,and,therefore,reaching the merits of their facial challenge may have been appropriate.
because,as we explain below,the provision is unconstitutional when applied to any person,the state court of appeals and the district court were incorrect in deeming the provision to be constitutional as applied to macdonald.macdonald is thus asserting his own concrete injury,and the state court standing determination,as endorsed by the district court,was contrary to and involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states 
in lawrence,the supreme court plainly held that statutes criminalizing private acts of consensual sodomy between adults are inconsistent with the protections of liberty assured by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.at.the statute declared invalid in lawrence provided that a person commits an offense if he engages in deviate sexual intercourse with another individual of the same sex.id.at.the conduct for which the lawrence defendants were prosecuted qualified as deviate sexual intercourse,in that it amounted to contact between any part of the genitals of one person and the mouth or anus of another person,that is,sodomy.id.the supreme court granted certiorari on three issues whether the criminalization of strictly homosexual sodomy violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment more broadly,whether criminalization of sodomy per se between consenting adults contravened the fundamental liberty and privacy interests protected by the fourteenth amendment due process clause and whether bowers hardwick,d,which upheld against facial challenge a georgia statute criminalizing all sodomy,should be overruled.
on the third question,relating to bowers hardwick,the court readily concluded that t he rationale of bowers does not withstand careful analysis bowers was not correct when it was decided,and it is not correct today bowers hardwick should be and now is overruled.lawrence,at though acknowledging the equal protection argument as tenable,the court premised its constitutional holding on the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,surmising that if it were to invalidate the statute under the equal protection clause,some might question whether a prohibition would be valid if drawn differently,say,to prohibit the conduct both between and participants.id.at emphasis added.the court underscored that,although the conduct proscribed by the texas statute might be sincerely condemned by many as immoral,t hese considerations do not answer the question before us the issue is whether the majority may use the power of the state to enforce these views on the whole society through operation of the criminal law.id.at.the lawrence court thus recognized that the facial due process challenge in bowers was wrongly decided.because the invalid georgia statute in bowers is materially indistinguishable from the provision being challenged here,the latter provision likewise does not survive the lawrence decision 
the commonwealth efforts to diminish the pertinence of lawrence in connection with macdonald challenge to the provision an enactment in no way dissimilar to the texas and georgia statutes deemed unconstitutional by the supreme court runs counter to martin ziherl.in that case,the supreme court of virginia evaluated the constitutionality of a state statute having nothing to do with sodomy,but instead outlawing ordinary sexual intercourse between unmarried persons.the state supreme court nonetheless acknowledged that lawrence was sufficiently applicable to require the statute invalidation.
the martin decision reversed the trial court judgment against the plaintiff,who sought damages because the defendant had infected her with herpes.the defendant had demurred to martin motion for judgment,pointing out that virginia law barred tort recovery for injuries sustained while participating in an illegal activity.in its ruling,the state supreme court concluded that there was no relevant distinction between the circumstances in lawrence and those in martin,recognizing that,but for the nature of the sexual act,the provisions of the challenged statute are identical to those of the texas statute which lawrence determined to be unconstitutional.martin,at n the provision,of course,prohibits the same sexual act targeted by the texas statute that failed constitutional muster in lawrence.
although both parties in the martin case were adults,there is no valid reason why the logic of that ruling should not have applied with equal force to the ruling of the court of appeals of virginia in macdonald case.it is not sufficient that the martin plaintiff was doubtlessly more deserving of the court sympathy than macdonald.true enough,the supreme court implied in lawrence that a state could,consistently with the constitution,criminalize sodomy between an adult and a minor.see lawrence,at documenting emerging awareness that liberty gives substantial protection to adult persons in deciding how to conduct their private lives in matters pertaining to sex emphasis added id.at pointing out that,in thirteen states where sodomy was yet proscribed,there is a pattern of nonenforcement with respect to consenting adults acting in private emphasis added id.at the present case does not involve minors.it does not involve persons who might be injured or coerced or who are situated in relationships where consent might not easily be refused.it does not involve public conduct or prostitution.emphasis added.the court ruminations concerning the circumstances under which a state might permissibly outlaw sodomy,however,no doubt contemplated deliberate action by the people representatives,rather than by the judiciary.
recently,we had occasion to consider a facial challenge to a much different statute,but the analysis in that case informs the issue presented here.see united states moore,cir.moore,who had been convicted under g for being a felon in possession of a firearm,asserted a facial challenge to g under the second amendment and the supreme court decision in district of columbia heller,d we explained that,u nder the well recognized standard for assessing a facial challenge to the constitutionality of a statute,the supreme court has long declared that a statute can not be held unconstitutional if it has constitutional application.moore,at citations omitted.moore contended that the supreme court decision in heller,which struck down the district of columbia general prohibition on the possession of handguns,rendered g firearm restriction violative of the second amendment.the heller court took care to observe however,that certain proh
