opinion of the court 
introduction 
this matter comes on before this court on an appeal from an order entered on april,dismissing appellant kenneth miller petition for habeas corpus under on the ground that it was not timely.the circumstances of the case are straightforward.miller shot and killed carey mccrae in philadelphia on august,and as a consequence a jury convicted him on october,in the philadelphia common pleas court of murder in the first degree and possession of an instrument of a crime.the jury subsequently set the penalty for the murder at life imprisonment following which the court imposed this sentence along with a concurrent sentence of one to two years on the possession count.miller appealed but the superior court of pennsylvania affirmed his conviction on september.see commonwealth miller,table inasmuch as miller did not seek allocatur from the pennsylvania supreme court,the direct proceedings in his prosecution ended with the superior court decision.
on april,miller filed a pro se petition for relief under the pennsylvania post conviction relief act,in the common pleas court.that court,after appointing counsel for miller who filed an amended petition,denied him relief on september.miller appealed but the superior court affirmed the denial of relief on august,see commonwealth miller,table,and the pennsylvania supreme court denied allocatur on june,see commonwealth miller,table.miller then filed a timely petition for certiorari which the supreme court of the united states denied on november.see miller pennsylvania,d.
on october,more than one year after the supreme court of pennsylvania denied his petition for allocatur but less than one year after the supreme court of the united states denied his petition for certiorari,miller filed his petition for habeas corpus.in his petition he alleged various constitutional errors which,in view of our disposition of this appeal,we need not describe.the district court referred the petition to a magistrate judge who filed a report and recommendation suggesting that the court dismiss it as untimely.the district court accepted the recommendation and denied miller petition by an order and memorandum dated march,and entered april.in its memorandum the court adopted the magistrate judge order but nevertheless explained itself why the petition was untimely.the court pointed out that under d,a provision of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,there was a period of limitation governing a petition for habeas corpus filed by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court and that the limitation period runs from the latest of 
a the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review 
b the date on which the impediment to filing an application created by state action in violation of the constitution or laws of the united states is removed,if the applicant was prevented from filing by such state action 
c the date on which the constitutional right asserted was initially recognized by the supreme court,if the right has been newly recognized by the supreme court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review or 
d the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.
the court observed that section d became effective on april,but noted that we provided in burns morton,cir,that there would be a grace period following its enactment in cases in which a prisoner conviction had become final before april.thus,inasmuch as miller conviction became final on october,the court indicated that ordinarily he would have had until april,to file his petition in the district court.
the court explained,however,that the april,date had been extended because miller filed his state petition in april,and it was pending when d became effective.the circumstance that the state proceeding was pending was significant because d provides that t he time during which a properly filed application for state or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation under d.the court said that section d tolling was applicable until june,when the supreme court of pennsylvania denied allocatur and accordingly the court concluded that,absent further tolling,miller had been required to have filed his habeas corpus petition on or before june,for it to be timely.in making these calculations the court did not mention miller petition for certiorari.of course,inasmuch as miller filed his petition on october,it was untimely according to the district court.
finally the district court considered miller contention that he was entitled to tolling beyond the period allowable under section d.in this regard miller contended that he was entitled to equitable tolling because he had been delayed in the prosecution of his petition for habeas corpus by his need to engage a private investigator.the court rejected this argument on the ground that miller had not been diligent and thus it entered the order denying the petition.
miller then appealed and sought a certificate of appealability pursuant to c a which provides that u nless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability,an appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a state court.this court denied the petition with an order reading as follows 
the foregoing request for certificate of appealability is denied,as the district court correctly concluded that the claims raised in miller petition pursuant to are barred under the applicable statute of limitations.see d burns morton,cir stokes district attorney of the county of philadelphia,cir.appellees motion to file their response nunc pro tunc is granted.
miller then petitioned for panel rehearing leading us to enter an order providing that t he certificate of appealability is granted with respect to the issue pertaining to stokes district attorney of the county of philadelphia,cir,and the matter is referred to a merits panel.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
miller raises two points on this appeal.first,he contends that the actual filing of a petition for writ of certiorari tolls the time to apply for writ of habeas corpus under the aedpa at d a.as will be seen this point implicates our holding in stokes district attorney of the county of philadelphia,cir,cited in both our original order denying a certificate of appealability and our order granting rehearing.of course,inasmuch as miller filed his petition for habeas corpus more than one year after the supreme court of pennsylvania denied him allocatur but less than one year after the supreme court of the united states denied his petition for certiorari acceptance of his argument would mean that his petition was timely.miller second point is that he is entitled to equitable tolling because in prosecuting his habeas petition he has demonstrated vigilance,tenacity and tremendous effort but has been confronted with an unfortunate minefield of conflicting statutes,circuits,linguistics and mindsets.br.of appellant at.we,however,will not consider the equitable tolling argument as it is not within the scope of the issue on which we granted a certificate of appealability.see banks horn,cir.to the extent that we exercise jurisdiction we do so on the basis of and c a and our review is plenary.see johnson rosemeyer,cir.
iii.discussion 
as we set forth above we are concerned on this appeal with the applicability of stokes and thus we commence our discussion by describing that opinion.in stokes the petitioner,stokes,had been convicted at a jury trial in pennsylvania in proceedings completed on direct appeal in.after he initially was unsuccessful in a state relief proceeding he filed a second petition for such relief but the state trial court denied that petition on january.he appealed from that denial but the superior court affirmed the denial on december,and the supreme court of p
