the state appeals a district court judgment granting david lefevre petition for writ of habeas corpus.the district court found that lefevre right to was violated because the leg shackles the court required him to wear during trial prevented him from attending bench conferences and moving freely about the courtroom during trial.the state argues that the shackles did not prevent lefevre from preserving actual control of his case or destroy the jury perception that lefevre was representing himself,and therefore lefevre shackling did not violate his right to.we hold that lefevre shackling did not violate his right to,reverse the district court judgment,and deny lefevre petition for writ of habeas corpus.
the district attorney of jefferson parish,louisiana,charged lefevre with armed robbery,kidnapping,and aggravated burglary.lefevre chose to represent himself at trial.the district judge allowed him to do so,provided lefevre accepted his previously appointed lawyer,john benz,as standby counsel.on the morning of trial,lefevre moved to have his leg shackles removed.the trial court denied lefevre motion,ordering that his handcuffs be removed but not his leg shackles.while the court did not offer any reason why it refused to remove lefevre leg shackles,the judge attested in a later affidavit that lefevre was maintained in leg shackles during his trial due to his multiple prior attempts to escape from custody,and that he had been advised by jail transporting personnel that lefevre was going to try and escape from the courtroom.lefevre does not contest in this appeal the trial court decision to shackle him.
after denying lefevre motion to remove his leg shackles,the trial court proceeded to select the jury.upon lefevre request,benz handled jury selection.the prosecutor and lefevre then gave their opening statements,and the prosecutor examined,and lefevre,the first two witnesses.lefevre performed these tasks while sitting at or standing behind counsel table so that jurors could not observe that he was wearing leg shackles.
during the state examination of the second witness at trial,lefevre objected because the witness was providing rambling answers beyond the scope of the prosecutor questions.benz requested to approach the bench,and benz and one of the prosecutors proceeded to the bench to discuss the matter with the trial judge while lefevre remained at counsel table.benz asked the court to direct the witness to respond to the questions,and the court did so.
following opening remarks and the examination of the first two witnesses,the trial court,outside of the presence of the jury,recommenced taking testimony in connection with a pending motion to suppress.after denying the motion,the judge asked lefevre if he wanted to reconsider representing himself.lefevre replied that he did not want to give up his right to speak totally,and he inquired whether benz could play a bigger role.the court responded,t hat between you and benz,and benz stated,i can only advise him.
the jury returned to the courtroom,and the state called its third witness.during her testimony,the witness made an identification of lefevre.lefevre objected,and benz requested to approach the bench.following benz argument and the prosecutor response,the court denied lefevre objection.
during the testimony of a state witness on the second day of trial,lefevre objected.benz requested a bench conference and stated that the objection was based on the fact that the witness was about to testify that lefevre had committed the crime of simple escape.the court overruled the objection.
the trial court convicted lefevre of all counts,and the judge imposed a sentence in excess of years imprisonment.after appeal to the louisiana fifth circuit and the louisiana supreme court,lefevre sentence was reduced to years 
lefevre then filed an application for relief in state court.he raised the same claims he later raised in his petition ineffective assistance of appellate counsel invalid waiver of the right to counsel under the sixth and fourteenth amendments denial of the right to counsel at critical stages of trial when lefevre was excluded from bench conferences denial of the right to by his exclusion from bench conferences denial of the due process right to be present at all critical stages of trial and denial of due process by being compelled to wear shackles when representing himself.the state district court rejected lefevre first and sixth claims on the merits and denied claims through as successive under article e of the louisiana code of criminal procedure for failure to raise them in a previous application.lefevre,however,had not filed a previous application.the state appellate court and the louisiana supreme court denied review.the louisiana supreme court denial ended the state process.
lefevre then filed a petition in federal court,raising the same claims as his state application for relief.the magistrate judge appointed counsel to represent lefevre and held an evidentiary hearing.lefevre argued that the shackles prevented him from participating in bench conferences because he could not approach the bench without exposing them to the jury,and he did not think he would be able to step up on the platform on which the bench was located with his ankles restrained.three jurors testified at the evidentiary hearing that they noticed that lefevre never moved from behind the table while the prosecutors moved at will throughout the courtroom.one juror testified that she thought lefevre was not allowed to move because he was a prisoner and might try to escape.another juror noticed that the lawyers approached the bench,but lefevre did not go with them.she found this unusual because that what you normally see in a courtroom,movement by the attorneys.and in his case,he was representing himself.if he wanted to move around,i would have expected him to move around.
following the evidentiary hearing and briefing,the magistrate judge found a violation of lefevre sixth amendment right to and recommended the grant of habeas relief.the district court adopted the magistrate report and recommendation and ordered the state to retry lefevre or release him within days.the state appeals from this judgment.this court has undeniable appellate jurisdiction over the government appeal of the grant of habeas relief.
in a habeas appeal,we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and review its conclusions of law de novo,applying the same standard of review to the state court decision as the district court under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,a federal court must defer to a state court decision with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
however,the deferential aedpa standard does not apply when the petitioner fairly presents his claim to the state court,the state court does not adjudicate the claim on the merits,and the claim is not procedurally defaulted the federal court then conducts a de novo review in this case,the district court determined that the state courts did not adjudicate lefevre claims on the merits because the state court denied lefevre claims regarding a violation of his right to as a successive petition the court also concluded that there was not an adequate procedural bar because lefevre had not filed a prior application and similar claims,claims which are the subject matter of a petitioner first application,are not regularly deemed to be barred as successive.because the state court did not adjudicate lefevre claim on the merits,and the claim was not properly dismissed pursuant to an adequate procedural bar,the district court conducted a de novo review of lefevre claim that his right to had been violated.
as established in faretta california,a defendant has a sixth amendment right to a pro se
