kenneth wayne morris morris sought a coa on the issue whether the presentation of a factually stronger habeas claim in federal court than in the state courts always mandates a dismissal without prejudice based on the exhaustion principle.morris dretke,cir.we granted morris a coa on that exhaustion issue and asked the parties to specifically address the following 
w hether morris presentation of additional evidence of mental retardation in federal court beyond that which he presented in the state courts is exhausted because it only supplemented his state atkins virginia,d claim or is unexhausted because it fundamentally altered his state atkins claim and if morris claim is thus rendered unexhausted,whether he has met any exception to excuse exhaustion.
id.at.for the following reasons,we determine that morris presentation of new evidence merely supplemented the atkins claim he had already presented to the state courts his atkins claim meets exhaustion per b a and the district court erred in dismissing morris atkins claim for want of exhaustion.therefore,we vacate the order of dismissal without prejudice and remand with instruction to conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine whether morris is mentally retarded and thus categorically ineligible for the death penalty pursuant to atkins.see at.holding the eighth amendment places a substantive restriction on the state power to take the life of a mentally retarded offender internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
background 
in december morris was convicted and sentenced to death for the capital offense of murdering james moody adams.on direct appeal,the texas court of criminal appeals tcca affirmed morris conviction and sentence the supreme court of the united states denied certiorari.the tcca then denied morris application for writ of habeas corpus.in april morris initiated federal habeas proceedings.the district court denied morris habeas relief and denied him a coa.this court also denied morris a coa.morris did not seek certiorari review in the supreme court.texas set an execution date of april.
on june,the supreme court held that the eighth amendment protects against the execution of mentally retarded defendants.atkins,at.atkins claims are applicable to defendants on collateral review.bell cockrell,cir.those defendants whose convictions were already final on direct review,like morris,had one year to file their atkins claims under d c.on april,within ten months after atkins was decided,morris filed a successive application for writ of habeas corpus in state district court.the sole legal basis for morris successive state writ was atkins application to him as a mentally retarded person facing execution.morris argued that his application met the subsequent application requirements of article,section,of the texas code of criminal procedure because the constitutional legal basis for his claim,atkins,was unavailable at the time he filed his previous state habeas corpus application.
in his successive state application,morris referenced the american association on mental retardation aamr standard for determining mental retardation 
mental retardation refers to substantial limitations in present functioning.it is characterized by significantly subaverage intellectual functioning,existing concurrently with related limitations in two or more of the following applicable adaptive skill areas communication,home living,social skills,community use,health and safety,functional academics,leisure,and work.mental retardation manifests before age.
aamr,mental retardation definition,classification,and systems of support ed morris also referenced the nearly identical definition of mental retardation in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders 
the essential feature of mental retardation is significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning criterion a that is accompanied by significant limitations in adaptive functioning in at least two of the following skill areas communication,home living,skills,use of community resources,functional academic skills,work,leisure,health,and safety criterion b.the onset must occur before age years criterion c.
american psychiatric association,diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders text,ed.
morris recognized the lack of intelligence quotient iq evidence in his record but noted various school records obtained by his counsel,including a letter concerning morris official withdrawal from the public schools special assignment campus morris also supported his claim of retardation with evidence regarding his adaptive deficits affidavits from family members and friends noting he can not read or write with any proficiency and had always been very suggestible and easily influenced notes from a mental health expert appointed for his trial,jerome brown,indicating morris was intellectually limited and had learning problems and partial school records classifying morris as learning disabled and indicating he dropped out at age after repeating the eighth grade,having failed the third,fifth,and eighth grades and most of his special classes.
in addition,morris included an affidavit from psychologist richard garnett who reviewed the above materials in an attempt to determine whether there was sufficient evidence to support a motion for a hearing to determine whether or not morris might meet the criteria for mental retardation as defined by current psychological theory.garnett offered his informed,professional opinion that there were indeed sufficient indicators to suggest that morris has mental retardation and h e should be given the opportunity for a professional assessment and evaluation as a part of that review,and then go before the court for a determination.morris indicated that brown had made a determination that he was not mentally retarded.however,garnett noted that brown for some reason apparently did not administer a test of intellectual level.morris contended that brown testing and methodology rendered his mental retardation assessment scientifically unreliable,in light of his not having used any intelligence testing instrument.
morris argued that together all the evidence he submitted demonstrated his deficiencies in the following specific adaptive behavioral skill areas conceptual,referring to morris inability to read and write and his failures in functional academics social,referring to morris inability to obey the law and follow rules,and his inability to avoid victimization and practical,referring to morris inability to develop instrumentalities of daily living or occupational skills,and his inability to maintain a safe environment.
furthermore,morris maintained that gerald bierbaum,one of the attorneys signing morris successive application,had approached the trial court to request that counsel be appointed so an expert could be obtained to perform intellectual testing and to request a modification of the execution date.morris contended that the trial court would consider such request if the state did not oppose it and that the attorneys who signed morris successive writ conferred with the harris county district attorney office,which was so opposed.morris argued that an evidentiary hearing was necessary to develop and fully present all available evidence supporting his claim of mental retardation under atkins.morris then expressly requested the following leave to file his successive state writ,the appointment of counsel,the necessary resources to establish his claims,and an evidentiary hearing.the tcca dismissed morris successive state habeas application as an abuse of the writ on april,
on april,morris filed a request with this court for authorization to file a successive federal habeas petition.morris based his request on the same information he presented in the state courts.this court stayed morris execution and tentatively granted his motion to file a successive petition.we held that morris had made a prima facie showing that the claim to be presented in the proposed successive habeas application had not been previously presented in any prior application to this court such claim relied on a previously unavailable new rule of constitutional law,which had been made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the supreme court and he should be categorized as mentally retarded.in re morris,cir.our authorization for morris to file his successive habeas petition was tentative in that it was dependent on the district court finding that the requirements under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa for such filing had been met.id.at citing b.
on april,morris moved the district court for appointment of counsel and approval of the retention of expert and investigative assistance the court granted this motion on may.morris then filed a skeletal petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal district court on may,which he amended on july.this petition raised the sole issue whether atkins constitutional bar against execution of the mentally retarded applied to morris.in addition to the evidence previously presented in the state courts and the fifth circuit,morris presented new evidence supporting his retardation claim to the district court,including an affidavit from clinical psychologist susana rosin who recently tested morris iq and level of adaptive and conceptual functioning.morris presented two affidavits from james patton who holds a doctorate in special education and disabilities patton reviewed morris iq results along with all the materials presented to the state courts.
morris scored a verbal iq of,a performance iq of,and a iq of on the wechsler adult intelligence tests administered by rosin.the first prong of the aamr definition of mental retardation is performance on an appropriate intellectual assessment instrument that is two standard deviations below the mean,which is approximately on the on the wide range achievement administered by rosin,morris scored less than on each conceptual skill subtest reading,arithmetic,and spelling.on the vineland adaptive behavior scales vabs tests rosin administered,morris achieved standard scores of in communication,in social,and in daily living.the second prong of the aamr definition of mental retardation is performance on an appropriate adaptive behavior instrument that is two standard deviations below the mean,which is approximately on the vabs and the,according to patton.rosin unequivocally diagnosed morris with mental retardation.morris presented a second affidavit from rosin which refuted respondent claim that morris was malingering during the testing.patton opined that morris functions intellectually and adaptively within the mentally retarded range and that this condition predated his birthday.
morris also presented a new affidavit from garnett stating that his review of rosin findings strengthened his opinion that morris is mentally retarded and recommending that a court hold a full hearing on the retardation issue.morris presented affidavits from morris original trial counsel stating that they never asked their mental health expert to test morris for mental retardation,but rather to determine whether morris posed a threat of future danger.finally,morris presented a document purportedly signed by brown,stating that he performed no formal intellectual testing of morris in connection with his evaluation and another document purportedly signed by garnett reconfirming his diagnosis of morris as mentally retarded.
the director moved to dismiss and for summary judgment.morris responded to both motions and requested the district court conduct an evidentiary hearing.in an order entered december,the district court denied the director motion to dismiss and accepted submission of morris successive federal petition under b denied the director motion for summary judgment and dismissed morris amended petition without prejudice.in that order the district court determined that because morris had not presented his atkins claim to the state courts in its current with substantive evidence the state courts did not have a fair opportunity to apply atkins to the substance of morris now better documented habeas claim.therefore,morris had not exhausted his atkins claim.see b a west supp.the district court indicated,however,that it would equitably toll the time morris will have spent in federal court should he return after having exhausted any available state court remedies.on january,the district court entered an order denying morris motion to alter or amend judgment under rule e,or alternatively for the issuance of a coa.morris then noticed his appeal and filed a request for coa with this court.on july,we granted morris a coa on the issue of exhaustion.morris,at.
discussion 
b a requires that federal habeas petitioners fully exhaust available state court remedies before proceeding in federal court the longstanding exhaustion requirement is not jurisdictional,but reflects the policy of comity,which is designed to give state courts the initial opportunity to consider and correct alleged violations of their prisoners federal rights.anderson johnson,cir.this court reviews de novo the legal question of whether a federal habeas petitioner has exhausted state court remedies.id.citing,in part,wilder cockrell,cir 
the exhaustion requirement is satisfied when the substance of the federal habeas claim has been fairly presented to the highest state court.mercadel cain,cir.such presentment can take place via direct appeal or state habeas proceedings.orman cain,cir.a s a general rule dismissal is not required when evidence presented for the first time in a habeas proceeding supplements,but does not fundamentally alter,the claim presented to the state courts.anderson,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also id.at citing vasquez hillery,d.
for example,in anderson,where the highest state court denied anderson petition without holding an evidentiary hearing,even though he presented more and stronger evidence an affidavit from a key eyewitness not called at his trial in his federal habeas petition,this court determined that the new evidence did not fundamentally alter his ineffective assistance of counsel iac claim and therefore held that anderson had properly exhausted.at see also dowthitt johnson,cir finding that dowthitt had exhausted his iac mental illness claim where he had presented detailed assertions of his paranoid schizophrenia to the state courts,even though he later offered additional affidavits by mental health experts opining on that same diagnosis to the federal court that were not previously presented to the state courts.
however,evidence that places the claims in a significantly different legal posture must first be presented to the state courts.anderson,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted see,graham,at,concluding that graham new offering of several affidavits of alibis and eyewitnesses,a police report,two psychologist reports,and a firearms report to the federal court but not the state courts rendered his iac and actual innocence claims unexhausted.the exhaustion inquiry that courts whether additional evidence fundamentally alters or merely supplements the state necessarily case and fact specific.anderson,at.

the district court dismissal without prejudice of morris successive federal habeas petition was premised entirely on that court legal conclusion that the new evidence presented for the first time to the federal court rendered morris atkins claim unexhausted.
whether the district court erred in finding that morris additional evidence presented in federal court rendered his atkins claim unexhausted.
morris contends he argued consistently and identically in state and federal court that he is mentally retarded and thus his execution is barred by the eighth amendment pursuant to atkins.morris argues that although the evidence he was able to introduce in the district court was greater than that introduced in the state courts,his underlying,singular atkins claim was not fundamentally altered and thus was properly exhausted in the state courts.for this proposition,morris primarily relies on vasquez,anderson,and dowthitt.
in vasquez,the district court pursuant to rule of the federal habeas rules directed the federal habeas petitioner and the state to provide additional statistical data in order to supplement and clarify the state court record presented for review.at.the state objected that the additional evidence drastically altered the petitioner equal protection challenge already presented to the state courts,such that the claim was rendered unsuitable for federal habeas review without prior consideration by the state courts.id.the supreme court rejected the state argument and held that the supplemental evidence presented did not fundamentally alter the legal claim already considered by the state courts,and,therefore,did not require that hillery be remitted to state court for consideration of that evidence.id.at.emphasis added.
in dowthitt,the habeas petitioner argued that he had been deprived of the effective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel had failed to present a mitigation defense based on his mental illness.at.in state court proceedings,dowthitt presented his strickland washington,d,claim based on evidence his counsel on habeas located,including a hospital form and air force records indicating dowthitt suffered from mental illness.dowthitt,at.however,on federal habeas,dowthitt additionally produced affidavits from two mental health experts whose clinical impressions were that dowthitt had paranoid and schizophrenic mental problems.id.at.morris notes this decision was made pursuant to the exhaustion standards laid out in graham,at,and joyner king,cir whether the claim before the federal court is in a significantly different and stronger evidentiary posture than it was before the state courts.this court found that dowthitt did not allege new facts via the affidavits of the two experts because all crucial factual allegations were before the state courts at the time they ruled on the merits of dowthitt habeas petition.dowthitt,at.because dowthitt had presented to the state habeas court his assertions that he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia,this court determined the expert affidavits added little to those claims and did not run afoul of the exhaustion requirement.id.finding consideration of the affidavits not precluded.
morris argues that this court in anderson employed a different framework for analyzing new evidence not presented to the state courts on habeas.in state court habeas proceedings,anderson argued under strickland that his attorney was ineffective for failing to investigate and present the testimony of an eyewitness named arthur gray,whose testimony would have excluded anderson as the perpetrator.anderson,at.anderson did not include any evidence to support this allegation.id.however,in federal court,anderson attached arthur gray affidavit stating that anderson was not present at the scene of the crime.id.while the court conceded that the exhaustion standard in the situation where new evidence is presented to the federal court which has not been presented to the state courts was nebulous,id.at,the court recited although exhaustion inquiries are,as a general rule dismissal is not required when evidence presented for the first time in a federal habeas proceeding supplements,but does not fundamentally alter,the claim presented to the state courts.id.at internal quotation marks omitted citing caballero keane.cir.the court held the exhaustion principle was satisfied,noting in an admittedly close case that several factors weighed in favor of exhaustion.anderson,at.
first,as morris explains,the ineffectiveness portion of anderson state habeas brief was remarkably detailed in both fact and law.id.the brief explained anderson counsel lack of investigation into the eyewitness arthur gray and what he could have testified to at trial.id.second,anderson was diligent and consistent in arguing his claim the new evidence gray affidavit does not fundamentally alter anderson state claim it merely confirms what he has been asserting all along.id.as such,the additional evidence was a supplement to the state court record but did not place his claim in a significantly different legal posture.id.third,the court noted that anderson did not attempt to expedite federal review by withholding essential facts from the state courts.id.at.any failure to develop facts was not the result of a lack of diligence if the state court had held an evidentiary hearing,gray exculpatory testimony likely would have been elicited,as it was in the federal proceedings.id.
morris stresses the court in anderson considered joyner and related fifth circuit precedent of limited relevance because such cases were decided before or without reference to vasquez.at.morris also emphasizes the case and nature of the inquiry whether new evidence just supplements or fundamentally alters a claim.see id.
morris attempts to distinguish his case from those cases in which courts of appeals have found new evidence presented for the first time in federal court rendered the petitioner claim unexhausted,arguing unlike in those cases,in his case the additional evidence did not transform his atkins claim into an entirely new claim finally,morris contends graham has no import because it does not mention vasquez.
in sum,morris likens his case to particularly that of the petitioner in anderson and applies the factors therein.morris asserts,first,his state petition was remarkably detailed in fact and a general,conclusory allegation of mental retardation.second,morris argues he diligently brought forth all the evidence he had or could obtain before filing and applied all of the existing law and authorities.moreover,at the state court level,morris requested counsel be appointed and funds be granted so he could establish his atkins claim.last,morris contends he did not deliberately withhold any portion of his claim in order to expedite federal review or to obtain a more favorable forum.therefore,morris insists the district court erred in dismissing his atkins claim.
the director responds that the district court was within its discretion in dismissing morris federal habeas petition without because morris new evidence fundamentally alters his claim under established federal law.the director insists that morris additional evidence,the newly generated iq evidence,is so fundamental to his claim of mental retardation that,standing alone,it would have warranted successive review in the state courts.
the director first points to the significance of the new evidence as a major factor in determining whether the advanced claim is exhausted.the director argues that kunkle dretke,cir,controls.in state court,the petitioner,kunkle,only presented a conclusory affidavit from trial counsel contending that there was abundant mitigating evidence including a troubled home life and a family history of mental illness to support his iac claim.id.at.however,in federal court,kunkle presented actual evidentiary support,including an affidavit from his mother and a detailed psychological report.id.the director notes that this court emphasized the significant difference between asserting a conclusory theory and actually backing up that theory with concrete evidence this court found kunkle claim unexhausted.id.at.
second,the director argues that morris does not meet the factor of whether the evidence is ascertainable from that extant record or discoverable from existing data.see vasquez,at.finding statistics presented existing data in a more reliable way see also dowthitt,at noting newly presented affidavits were based on discoverable medical records.
the director next maintains that by applying the above factors to morris case,his new iq evidence fundamentally alters his atkins claim.the director argues that in the state courts,morris presented no iq data at all,much less an iq score below.with the new evidence,stresses the director,morris atkins claim turned around degrees because his iq test scores alone could withstand a summary dismissal,regardless of any additional data supporting the other prongs of mental retardation.see ex parte williams,wl,at,cochran,joined by meyers,concurring in dismissal unpublished opinion.in addition,the director contends,unlike vasquez,morris missing iq data could never have been educed from the existing record morris alleged diagnosis of mental retardation depends on the five iq tests administered on successive federal habeas review and interpretation of those results.also,the director notes that morris iq evidence was not requested,as in vasquez,as an interpretive aid for meaningful review.the director maintains morris new evidence sheds new light on his claim that the state courts should be given the opportunity to review.
the director also suggests that,although not intentionally,morris is attempting state court bypass to achieve a more favorable forum and can not demonstrate he acted diligently in state court.finally,the director argues that in light of ongoing development of state court procedures implementing atkins,justice would be better served by insisting on exhaustion.that is,the federal court premature adjudication of morris stronger atkins claim would deprive the state court of the potential opportunity to make important law on successively presented and facially stronger atkins claims in the context of article,section.
in reply,morris distinguishes his case from that of kunkle.morris notes the court there concluded kunkle had not exhausted this ineffective assistance claim because kunkle possessed this additional information at the time he filed his second state petition,yet failed to present these significant additional facts.at.unlike kunkle,morris did not possess the iq scores and affidavits concerning those scores when he filed his second state habeas petition.morris instead presented all the concrete evidence he did have to support his atkins claim and requested resources to develop further evidence he argues he did not possess the evidence and deliberately bypass state court.moreover,morris argues kunkle has little import here because the decision relied not on anderson,but rather on graham,which did not mention vasquez.morris also discounts any reliance on the unpublished williams as to any supposed threshold evidentiary requirement for atkins claims because williams has no precedential value.
the district court here found that morris supported his successive state application with little more than speculation.the court primarily cited joyner,at,for the proposition that comity and federalism require new factual allegations in support of a previously asserted legal theory first be presented to the state courts.the court then concluded that the expanded nature of morris atkins claim rendered his successive petition unexhausted.we disagree.
after thorough case and review of morris situation,this court concludes that the new iq evidence presented for the first time in federal court,although it indeed factually bolstered his sole atkins claim,did not render morris atkins same legal eighth amendment claim he presented to the state courts and supported with pertinent,if not conclusive,evidence of low intellectual functioning and adaptive deficits,from childhood fundamentally altered and thus unexhausted.we find morris case falls much closer on the spectrum to the cases where this court has found new evidence merely supplemented the petitioner claims.therefore,the district court erred in finding that the new evidence rendered morris atkins claim unexhausted in the state courts.
similar to the petitioner in dowthitt,morris has produced on federal habeas additional evidentiary support indicating,beyond what the evidence he produced in the state habeas courts indicated,that he is mentally retarded.the same crucial intellectual and adaptive deficiencies alleged by morris in the state led garnett to conclude morris indeed sufficiently possessed the required indicators for mental retardation to merit further professional assessment and court been affirmed by such additional professional assessment evidence presented to the federal court.see dowthitt,at noting the crucial facts of dowthitt mental illness of the paranoid,schizophrenic type had already been presented to the state courts and thus finding the expert affidavits further supporting that mental illness exhausted.
as were the petitioner claims in anderson,morris claim is unquestionably in a comparatively stronger evidentiary posture than it was in state court,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.but,similarly,several facts militate in favor of exhaustion in this admittedly close case.id.first,thorough review of morris successive state habeas brief reveals that his atkins claim was remarkably detailed in both fact and law.anderson,at.morris unquestionably brought his eighth amendment claim pursuant to atkins.he also properly outlined the aamr definition for mental retardation,since adopted by the tcca as one of texas current standards for determining mental retardation,briseno,at,and noted the necessity to meet all three essential prongs of the definition.see id.morris also clearly acknowledged that iq evidence was lacking in his particular case but still insisted t here is good reason to believe that morris is retarded because of the documented history of adaptive deficits,including morris inability to read and write and his failure in functional academics,inability to obey the law and follow rules,inability to avoid victimization,inability to develop instrumentalities of daily living and occupational skills,and inability to maintain a safe environment,all of which were attested to by the sworn affidavits and school records presented to the state courts.
moreover,morris saw fit to present an expert affidavit,which,albeit preliminarily,provided a psychologist acknowledgment of and support for morris mental retardation claim.morris has consistently asserted that he is mentally retarded and that,given the opportunity and resources,intellectual tests would confirm that.as in anderson,the new evidence the district court allowed morris to develop here does not fundamentally alter his state claim it functions as a supplement to the record presented to the state court,but does not place the claim in a significantly different legal posture.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
as we also noted in anderson in reaching our conclusion,despite what the director argues here,we see nothing in this record that shows morris attempted to expedite federal review by deliberately withholding essential facts from the state courts.id.at citing vasquez,at.there is no evidence that morris intentionally withheld any previous iq testing results or chose to forego any provided opportunity for the proper iq testing.
morris case is distinguishable from the petitioner in graham because it was ascertainable what further evidence morris would be providing to the federal court if he could develop scores indicative of low intelligence and evaluation of those results.in contrast,graham presented an abundance of new evidence to the federal court that had not been presented,even abstractly,to the state several affidavits from eyewitnesses and alibi witnesses,who had not previously been mentioned in graham state habeas proceedings a psychologist report regarding the unreliability of the identification testimony by the state main witness and a police ballistics report showing a weapons discrepancy.at.moreover,this court also took into consideration graham freedom to pursue his actual innocence claim in a evidentiary hearing,see id.at citing graham texas board of pardons and paroles,and that his iac claim had been dismissed without prejudice by the tcca,see at citing ex parte graham.in contrast,morris atkins claim was dismissed by the tcca as an abuse of the writ 
morris case is also distinguishable from kunkle,the chief case the director relies on,because there kunkle only presented to the state courts a conclusory affidavit from trial counsel regarding mitigation evidence of kunkle troubled home life and his family history of mental illness.at.only at the federal level did kunkle produce an affidavit from his mother and a psychological report.id.here,morris presented school records and multiple affidavits from his family members with personal knowledge of his learning and adaptive issues.plus,kunkle had a second procedural opportunity to present such new evidence to the state courts his federal habeas petition had been dismissed as mixed because it contained exhausted and unexhausted claims.id.at.this court noted that kunkle provided no explanation of why he did not present to the state court the same materials he had prepared and submitted to the federal court.id.at.here,morris presented his single atkins claim to both the federal and state courts he also explicitly acknowledged what particular evidence he lacked and requested a chance to acquire it 
moreover,we note the director points to no binding authority that requires an iq test specifically,that is,entirely alone,at the core,or as any singular threshold,to provide the basis for a finding of mental retardation.instead,the aamr definition of mental retardation adopted by the tcca in briseno requires a showing of three interdependent prongs.at.likewise,the texas health and safety code section,also adopted by the tcca as an alternative standard to the aamr definition for a petitioner to show his mental retardation,defines mental retardation as significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning that is concurrent with deficits in adaptive behavior and originates during the developmental period.health safety code ann.vernon briseno,at.thus,iq evidence standing completely on its own can not provide the turn the director insists it does to withstand summary dismissal.see,briseno,at psychologists and other mental health professionals are flexible in their assessment of mental retardation thus,sometimes a person whose iq has tested above may be diagnosed as mentally retarded while a person whose iq tests below may not be mentally retarded.stevenson state,a low iq score by itself,however,does not support a finding of mental retardation.finally,the unpublished concurrence in williams suggesting otherwise,wl,at,fails to establish any threshold factual burden based on iq alone for atkins claims.
morris specifically presented to the state courts a sworn affidavit from a psychologist who,after reviewing all the other testimonial and school record evidence likewise presented to the state courts,made the crucial preliminary factual allegation that there was a probability morris indeed suffered from mental retardation.although in federal court morris has additionally presented iq scores and expert assessment of those scores,the crucial fact that morris possessed sufficient indicators for a diagnosis of mental retardation had already been presented to the state courts.the substance of morris atkins claim was fairly presented to the highest state court,the tcca.thus,we find as a matter of law on this record that morris atkins claim was not presented to the federal court in a significantly different legal posture than in the state courts and that the new evidence presented did not fundamentally alter his atkins claim.because we find that morris new evidence has met the exhaustion requirement of b a for his atkins claim to continue in federal court,this court need not reach any argument concerning any exception to exhaustion.
in his prayer for relief,morris requests that we remand his case to the district court for an evidentiary hearing.we agree to so remand and note the following.in cases where the legal question is whether the new evidence a petitioner puts forth for the first time on federal habeas on a particular claim already asserted on state habeas is exhausted under b,subparts d and e of concerning factual development are not implicated.dowthitt,at.in dowthitt,we specifically considered that although both the director and the petitioner argue d this issue as one of factual development under d and e,it is more accurately analyzed under the exhaustion rubric of b.id.at.we explained that if new evidence on the particular claim is determined to be exhausted under b a,such evidence is not precluded from review and can properly be considered by the federal court.see id.at.we thus rejected the approach whereby a petitioner would have to meet the factual development requirements of e to be entitled to have his new evidence on the particular claim be reviewed in federal court.see id.at nn.
instead,this circuit classifies these specific cases as presenting the question whether the new evidence,not previously presented to the state courts but presented for the first time to the federal court,has met the exhaustion requirement of b a,see id.we do not in this case ask the question whether the petitioner has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in state court proceedings.e.here,morris,having met the b a exhaustion requirement on the iq evidence presented for the first time on federal habeas,need not additionally overcome the obstacles of e.see dowthitt,at.thus,because there is,and can be,no lingering concern about factual development in morris case,under rule a of the rules governing section cases in the united states district courts,the federal court here retains full discretion to grant morris an evidentiary hearing.see,murphy johnson,cir clark johnson,cir.
conclusion 
having carefully reviewed the record of this case and the parties respective briefing and arguments,for the reasons set forth above,we conclude the district court erred in finding that morris presentment of new evidence to the federal court rendered his atkins claim unexhausted per b a.therefore,on this record and in light of our holding,we vacate the district court order dismissing morris claim without prejudice and remand with instruction to conduct an evidentiary hearing on the merits of morris atkins claim.
vacated and remanded with instruction.
while i join in the judgment vacating the district court order dismissing morris petition,i write separately to explain my rejection of the state argument that morris is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing because he failed to develop the factual basis of his atkins claim before the court of criminal appeals.
if a habeas applicant has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in state court proceedings,a federal habeas court may not hold an evidentiary hearing on the claim unless certain conditions are met it is undisputed that morris did not present iq evidence during his state habeas proceedings for the simple reason that it did not yet exist.lack of presentation,however,is not the same as failure to develop.in williams taylor the supreme court addressed the meaning of the word failed in e.the court rejected a reading of the statute,and found that u nder the opening clause of e,a failure to develop the factual basis of a claim is not established unless there is lack of diligence,or some greater fault,attributable to the prisoner or the prisoner counsel.
the state argues that morris failed to exercise diligence in developing his atkins claim,and therefore should be barred from receiving an evidentiary hearing.the state observes that although atkins had been decided ten months before morris execution date,he waited until five days before his execution date to file affidavits in support of his claim.in addition,the state contends that morris failed to make an request for funds to develop his iq evidence,and that his condition was previously discoverable in any event since he was greater than eighteen years of age.
the state argument ignores the fact that in his successive habeas application before the court of criminal appeals,morris requested that the court appoint him counsel and provide him with the necessary resources to establish his claims.as part of the evidence he wished to further develop,morris cited the need for intellectual testing.the court denied this request by dismissing morris application as an
