a state court jury convicted roy jackson of felony murder,armed robbery and carrying a firearm during the commission of a felony.the michigan court of appeals affirmed the and firearm convictions and reversed the conviction.in reaching these conclusions,the state court denied jackson claims that his confession was involuntary,that his miranda waiver was not knowing or intelligent and that the admission of hearsay statements violated the confrontation clause.because the state court decisions were neither contrary to,nor an unreasonable application of,supreme court precedent,we affirm the district court denial of jackson habeas petition.
on december,a group of men robbed a dollar value store in detroit,michigan,and shot and killed the store owner,hani zebib.after an initial investigation,the police contacted jackson and asked him to come to the police station to answer questions about the jackson did at,january.
at that morning,detroit police investigator barbara simon advised jackson of his miranda rights,which jackson waived,and began interrogating him.during the interrogation,jackson denied any involvement in the crimes.the officers nonetheless arrested jackson and moved him to the homicide department for holding.at,simon again interrogated jackson,and jackson again denied committing the crimes.after the second round of questioning,officers returned jackson to his holding cell in the homicide department,where he sat in isolation for the rest of the day.
the next day,officers interviewed tykee ross.as part of the interrogation,the officers gave ross a polygraph examination,and ross eventually signed a statement implicating jackson in the robbery and murder.
after ross fingered jackson in the crimes,the officers interrogated jackson again.at,sergeant maria again advised jackson of his miranda rights,which he again waived,and proceeded to interrogate him.during the interrogation,jackson continued to deny any involvement in the crimes,after which the officers asked jackson to take a polygraph test.at,investigator andrew sims advised jackson of his rights,and,at,sims began the test.the polygraph ended at that night,with jackson still denying any involvement in the crimes.after the polygraph,sims continued to interrogate jackson,and,twenty to thirty minutes later,jackson changed his story,confessing to the robbery and the murder.
at later that night,simon again met with jackson and advised him of his rights once more.jackson told her that he understood his rights and,at,he signed a waiver of his miranda rights.he then signed a statement admitting that he shot zebib while robbing the store with ross and demel dukes.jackson concluded the statement by saying,i sorry for what happened.i did mean for anyone to be shot and killed.i so very sorry.ja.
the state charged jackson,ross and dukes with armed robbery,felony murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.the three defendants were tried jointly but before two separate for jackson,the other for ross and the juries convicted all three defendants of felony murder.comp.laws,and armed robbery,id,and jackson jury also convicted him of possessing a firearm during the commission of a felony,id.
the court sentenced jackson to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole on the murder count,a concurrent term of years on the robbery count and a consecutive term of two years on the count.jackson appealed to the michigan court of appeals.the michigan court of appeals reversed jackson conviction,but it affirmed his and firearm convictions.the michigan supreme court denied leave to appeal.
jackson filed a habeas petition in federal court,challenging the state court conclusion that his confession was voluntary,its conclusion that his miranda waiver was knowing and intelligent and the state court admission of hearsay statements at trial.the district court denied jackson petition but granted a certificate of appealability on each issue.
this case,the parties agree,is covered by the and effective death penalty act of.to prevail on any of his three requests for habeas relief,as a result,jackson must show not only that the state courts erred in ruling on his constitutional claim but also that their decision was contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,supreme court precedent.see id.d.
jackson first argues that the state court admission of his confession at his criminal trial violated due process because he made it involuntarily.see miranda arizona,d.c ertain interrogation techniques,it is true,are so offensive to a civilized system of justice that they must be condemned under the due process clause.miller fenton,d.accordingly,when a criminal defendant can show that coercive police activity caused him to make an involuntary confession,due process prohibits the government from relying on the statement.colorado connelly,d see also reck pate,d holding that an interrogation violates due process if the suspect will is overborne at the time he confessed.whether an interrogation rises to the level of coercion turns on a spectrum of factors the age,education and intelligence of the suspect whether the suspect was advised of his miranda rights the length of the questioning and the use of physical punishment or the deprivation of food,sleep or other creature comforts.schneckloth bustamonte,d.
consistent with these factors,the michigan courts reasonably determined that jackson interrogation was not coercive.jackson voluntarily reported to the police station and agreed to be questioned.before asking any questions,the officers advised jackson of his miranda rights,which he waived no fewer than four times during the interrogations.and when jackson ultimately confessed,he added a statement of remorse,saying he was sorry for what happened,ja that it was his conscience,not the police,that overbore his prior efforts to disclaim any responsibility for the robbery and murder.other contextual clues point in the same direction.jackson told the officers that he could read and write and that he understood the rights he was waiving.at no point during the questioning did jackson indicate that he did not understand his rights.he never said he was tired,confused or uncomfortable.and he confirmed in his written confession that he was not deprived of food,water or use of the restroom.ja.
nor was jackson unfamiliar with the criminal justice system.he had six juvenile indictments filed against him prior to this arrest.he was not ill,injured or under the influence of drugs or alcohol.he never asked for an attorney.he never asked the agents to stop questioning him.and he acknowledges that he was not threatened,harmed or promised anything to compel his confession.all things considered,this is not the rare case in which a suspect can make a colorable argument that a statement was compelled despite the fact that the law enforcement officers adhered to the dictates of miranda.berkemer mccarty,d.jackson,in short,has not shown that the prophylactic miranda warnings were not prophylactic enough.
jackson counters with the following facts the interval between his first interrogation and his last one was hours he signed his written confession in the early morning hours at the end of these serial interrogations and he could read at only a level.the officers questioning,however,never exceeded two and a half hours at a time jackson never said he did not understand the miranda warnings,even after receiving them multiple times and he never expressed any lack of understanding regarding the confession he was signing.
these circumstances do not rise to the level of the kinds of fact patterns that the supreme court has condemned still less do they show that the michigan courts unreasonably applied these of which did not even involve miranda warnings,as here.see,mincey arizona,d holding that a confession was involuntary where officers questioned the defendant over his objection for four hours while he was incapacitated and sedated in an unit greenwald wisconsin,d holding that a confession was involuntary where officers questioned the defendant for more than hours while depriving him of food,sleep and medication beecher alabama,d hol
