joseph sleeper was convicted of first degree murder in massachusetts superior court.the supreme judicial court sjc affirmed sleeper conviction,commonwealth sleeper,and the united states district court for the district of massachusetts denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.sleeper spencer,d.the sole ground certified for appeal is sleeper claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney promised in his opening statement to present an insanity defense even though he knew or should have known that the court would not allow the jury to consider the defense.the sjc confronted this argument head on,concluding that counsel alleged promise was a misstatement rather than a broken promise and was,in any event,inconsequential.because the sjc determination that sleeper suffered no prejudice is reasonable in light of controlling supreme court precedent,we affirm without resolving sleeper contention that counsel performance was deficient.
a.the crime 
sleeper and his wife,victoria,separated in march she filed for divorce several months later and obtained a protective order barring sleeper from the marital home.in august,after months of separation,victoria began dating another man.sleeper soon became aware of this new relationship.
on september,victoria and her male friend left the area for a labor day weekend vacation.while they were away,sleeper made numerous telephone calls and entered victoria home in an effort to determine her whereabouts.victoria returned,alone,on september.that evening,sometime before,sleeper confronted victoria at home.after chasing her into the bedroom,sleeper stabbed her at least eight times with a knife.two of the stab wounds severed her ribs,and the deepest wound went between six and and seven inches into her chest.sleeper noticed that victoria was still breathing but did not telephone for an ambulance.she remained conscious for approximately four to five minutes after being stabbed,and died a few minutes later.
sleeper left victoria home at about several hours later,he entered a nearby state police barracks and told the trooper at the front desk that he had just killed his wife.in explaining what had happened,sleeper told the officers who questioned him that he had gone to the home to confront victoria about her new relationship and that he had obtained the knife he used to kill her from a toolbox in her home.
b.the trial 
sleeper counsel filed a motion seeking funds for a psychological examination on october.in support of the motion,counsel asserted that facts exist to substantiate a defense of either partial or total mental defect of the defendant.the court granted the motion and counsel retained ronald ebert,a forensic psychologist,to examine sleeper.counsel filed ebert report with the court on april.on may,counsel filed requests for jury instructions that included both instructions on an insanity defense pursuant to commonwealth mchoul,and instructions on mental impairment negating the mens rea required for murder,pursuant to commonwealth gould.
the trial began on may.sleeper counsel delivered his opening statement immediately after the prosecutor opening.he began by conceding that joseph sleeper killed his wife,he stabbed her at least eight times viciously in the chest and other parts of her body.he then explained that,we are not going to sit here and pretend,to play games as to who done it you here to determine whether or not joe sleeper committed first degree murder,second degree murder,manslaughter,or was insane at the time he did it.counsel then detailed sleeper early adult life,his marriage to victoria,and how he began to drink and feel that things were coming apart in his heart after the first time he saw his wife with another guy in a pickup truck.counsel described the night of the killing from sleeper perspective,describing sleeper mental state as insane and absolutely frenzied.counsel ended his opening statement with this request put yourself in the real world,please,and then make a determination as to whether this was a premeditated and planned scheme,a first degree murder case,which it is not or something that built in this man and drove him crazy.that is what happened.
sleeper testified at trial.he claimed that he went to victoria home on the night of the crime to borrow a car from one of their sons.he also testified that he encountered victoria outside the home and that she invited him to come inside.he admitted that they argued.when he followed victoria into her bedroom in an effort to stop her from calling the police,he claimed he saw a condom and a knife in an open chest of drawers.at that point,sleeper said,everything just went crazy.i started seeing a,a ferris wheel with the numbers on it i grabbed the knife and i had stabbed her.after the stabbing,i was spinning all around,i remember spinning,i remember i did know what to do and i went down.in short,sleeper claimed that he was unaware of what he was doing when he killed victoria.
ebert testified as an expert witness for sleeper.ebert opined that sleeper was a alcoholic and was suffering from an acute state of depression with psychotic features.although ebert acknowledged that sleeper was not insane,he opined that sleeper had a diminished capacity to act with criminal intent when he killed victoria.
wesley profit,then the director of forensic services at bridgewater state hospital,offered expert rebuttal testimony.profit opined that sleeper was not suffering from any major mental illness,that he did not lack criminal responsibility at the time of the killing,and that he had the ability to harbor malice.on,however,he conceded that he had not formed an opinion as to whether sleeper suffered from a diminished capacity.
during the charge conference after the conclusion of the evidence,the court agreed to provide instructions regarding counsel mental impairment defense.sleeper counsel requested an insanity instruction notwithstanding the expert testimony,but the court denied this request.
in his closing statement,sleeper counsel began,we are not asking you to make a determination as to whether or not joseph sleeper stabbed his wife eight times in the heart what you going to have to determine is the state of mind joseph sleeper was in at the time.counsel emphasized,this is not a first degree murder case this is the act of someone that was in a frenzy,that had a diminished capacity of intent.he contrasted the testimony of ebert and profit,emphasized ebert opinion that there was a diminished capacity in this man intent to perform premeditation and his intent to perform malice,and noted that profit had not contradicted ebert opinion on diminished capacity.after discussing sleeper relationship with victoria and the events on the night he killed her,counsel returned to the psychological testimony and again repeated ebert conclusions and credentials.
the court instructed the jury that it could convict sleeper of first degree murder if sleeper committed either premeditated murder or murder with extreme atrocity or cruelty.it also instructed on the lesser included offenses of second degree murder and voluntary manslaughter.over the commonwealth objection,the court informed the jury that it could consider evidence of sleeper mental state at the time of the offense in determining whether he acted with the mens rea required for either first or second degree murder.the court also instructed the jury on sleeper claim that he was at most guilty of manslaughter because he committed the crime in the heat of passion with adequate provocation.
the jury ultimately convicted sleeper of first degree murder because it determined that he acted with premeditation.it,however,rejected the commonwealth contention that sleeper was also guilty of committing the murder with extreme atrocity or cruelty.
c.the appeal 
sleeper appealed his conviction directly to the sjc,asserting assignments of error.as to ineffective assistance,sleeper argued that his trial counsel was ineffective because counsel improperly promised that he would present an insanity defense in his opening statement even though he knew or should have known that no evidence would be introduced to support that defense.the sjc reviewed his claim under the ineffective assistance of counsel standard it uses on direct review of first degree murder cases whether there was an error in the course of the trial by defense counsel,the prosecutor,or the judge and,if there was,whether that error was likely to have influenced the jury conclusion.sleeper,at quoting commonwealth wright.using this standard,the sjc held that sleeper counsel was not ineffective.id.at.although the court found that counsel no doubt misspoke when he informed the jury that it would be asked to consider whether sleeper was insane,the court held that the misstatements did not amount to a broken promise counsel references to insanity were consistent with his argument that sleeper suffered from mental impairments that negated the mens rea required for a first degree murder conviction.id.for similar reasons,the court concluded both that i n the context of the entire trial,counsel statement was inconsequential and no reasonable juror would feel disappointed by the defense.id.
d.the federal habeas corpus petition 
sleeper subsequently filed a petition for habeas corpus in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts,asserting six different grounds for relief.as to ineffective assistance,the district court rejected sleeper arguments that the sjc failed to fully adjudicate sleeper federal claim on the merits.sleeper,d at.although conceding that the question before the sjc was a close one,the district court then dismissed sleeper ineffective assistance claim because it determined that the sjc analysis was not objectively unreasonable.id.at.
on november,the district court issued a certificate of appealability coa.the sole claim certified for appeal was sleeper ineffective assistance of counsel claim.
this case is governed by the standards of review established by the and effective death penalty act aedpa,and the strickland test for ineffective assistance of counsel claims.strickland washington,d.we briefly review the relevant law in both areas before turning to the merits of sleeper claim.
under aedpa,if a state court has adjudicated a habeas petitioner claim on the merits,a federal court may issue the writ only if the state court adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to clearly established federal law,involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.d.
a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite from that reached by the supreme court on a question of law,or if the state court decides the case differently than the supreme court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.williams taylor,d.
a state court decision unreasonably applies clearly established federal law if the state court correctly identifies the governing legal principles,but i applies those principles to the facts of the case in an objectively unreasonable manner ii unreasonably extends clearly established legal principles to a new context where they should not apply or iii unreasonably refuses to extend established principles to a new context where they should apply.dipaolo,cir citing williams,at.if the state court does not expressly apply the federal standard but resolves the issue under a state law standard that is more favorable to defendants than the federal standard,then the reviewing court will presume the federal law adjudication to be subsumed within the state law adjudication.teti bender,cir quoting mccambridge hall,cir.to be unreasonable,the state court application of existing legal principles must be more than merely erroneous or incorrect.williams,at.we agree with the second circuit that some increment of incorrectness beyond error is required.francis stone,cir.the increment need not necessarily be great,but it must be great enough to make the decision unreasonable in the independent and objective judgment of the federal court.mccambridge,at.
in reviewing a habeas corpus petition under aedpa,a federal court will presume that the state court findings of fact are correct.for this purpose,the term facts refers to basic,primary,or historical facts,such as witness credibility and recitals of external events.sanna dipaolo,cir quoting bryson ward,cir.the habeas petitioner may defeat the presumption of correctness only with clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.e see also ouber guarino,cir.the presumption of correctness is equally applicable when a state appellate court,as opposed to a state trial court,makes the findings of fact.norton spencer,cir quoting sumner mata,d.
ineffective assistance of counsel 
the supreme court has explained that an ineffective assistance of counsel claim requires both deficient performance and prejudice.strickland,at.
to establish that counsel performance was deficient,a defendant must show that it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under the circumstances.id.at.this is a highly deferential review,making every effort to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight.id.at.as the supreme court emphasized in yarborough gentry,the sixth amendment guarantees reasonable competence,not perfect advocacy judged with the benefit of hindsight,d.when examining counsel conduct,the court considers the facts of the particular case from counsel perspective at the time.strickland,at.counsel has wide latitude in deciding how best to represent a client,gentry,at,and benefits from a strong presumption that he or she rendered adequate assistance and exercised reasonable professional judgment in making all significant decisions.strickland,at.
to establish prejudice,the defendant must show that,but for counsel unprofessional error,there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different.see wiggins smith,d finding prejudice where there was a reasonable probability that at least one juror would have struck a different balance strickland,at.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.strickland,at.
although sleeper must prove both deficient performance and prejudice to prevail on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim,a reviewing court need not address both requirements if the evidence as to either is lacking.as the supreme court has recognized,i f it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice,which we expect will often be so,that course should be followed.strickland,at.we take this path here and address only sleeper claim of unfair prejudice,leaving unresolved both his argument that the sjc erred in finding that counsel references to insanity were mere misstatements and his contention that counsel performance was deficient.we begin by explaining why the sjc ruling is entitled to aedpa deference and then turn to sleeper specific challenges to the sjc ruling.
aedpa deference 
sleeper argues that the sjc ruling should be reviewed de novo for two related reasons.first,he asserts that deference is unwarranted because the sjc analyzed his ineffective assistance of counsel claim under a state law standard that fails to satisfy the requirements of federal law.in the alternative,he argues that de novo review is required even if the sjc used an acceptable legal standard because the court did not engage in a fully developed prejudice analysis.neither argument has merit.
the sjc reviewed sleeper ineffective assistance of counsel claim by asking whether there was an error in the course of the trial by defense counsel,the prosecutor,or the judge and,if there was,whether that error was likely to have influenced the jury conclusion.sleeper,at quoting commonwealth wright.because this court has previously determined that the standard used by the sjc in analyzing sleeper claim is at least as protective of defendants as the federal ineffective assistance of counsel standard,see horton allen,cir,cert.denied,d,we will presume the federal law adjudication to be subsumed within the state law adjudication.teti,at quoti
