on june,a jury found marshall jackson guilty of robbery,attempted murder,and of being a habitual offender under indiana recidivist statute.see.at sentencing,the judge enhanced jackson sentence by thirty years because of jackson status as a habitual offender.jackson contends that the resulting sentence was improper because one of the two convictions that the jury relied upon to make the habitual offender determination was obtained in violation of his sixth amendment right to counsel.he advanced this claim,among others,in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court,see,and the district court denied the petition.we granted jackson request for a certificate of appealability and certified the following issue for appeal was the petitioner denied counsel in violation of the sixth amendment we now affirm.
on march,jackson and his brother,louis jackson,pleaded guilty to theft in a lake county superior court.several weeks later,jackson and his brother,represented by counsel,appeared in court for sentencing on march.after listening to statements by jackson,louis,and their attorney,the judge stated the court now sentences both defendants to not less than one nor more than ten years and orders them committed to the department of corrections for assignment to a proper institution execution of sentence is withheld until april.tr.of marshall jackson sentencing at.jackson appeared in court on may,for execution of his sentence although the record does not include a transcript of that proceeding,the court minute entry indicates that jackson appeared without counsel for the reason that the attorney previously representing him is no longer in the practice of law.minute order at.because the record does not contain a transcript of the may appearance,it is unclear whether or to what extent the court addressed the fact that jackson did not have an attorney present.the court written order on that date simply states the court after reviewing the investigation now sentences the defendant,marshall jackson,to not less than one nor more than ten years.sentence suspended.the defendant is placed on probation for a period of two years.id.
approximately five years later,on june,a jury found jackson guilty of attempted murder,armed robbery,and of being a habitual offender under indiana recidivist statute.the jury determination that jackson was a habitual partially on the theft jackson sentence by an additional thirty years for a total sentence of seventy years.on direct appeal,the indiana supreme court affirmed jackson conviction as well as his sentence.see jackson state.
several years later,on may,jackson,pro se,filed a petition in state court for relief from the theft conviction.he alleged,inter alia,that he was denied the right to counsel at sentencing because counsel was not present at the may,appearance.the trial court found that jackson had waived his sixth amendment claim by failing to incorporate his original and first amended petitions into his subsequent amended petitions and,as such,did not address the merits of the issue.
on appeal,the indiana court of appeals found that the trial court erred in refusing to consider the claims raised in jackson original and subsequent amended petitions.see jackson state.the indiana court of appeals rejected jackson claim on the merits,however,finding that the absence of counsel at the may,proceeding was not a violation of jackson right to counsel,and even if it was,that jackson was not prejudiced.see id.at.to support this conclusion,the indiana court of appeals relied on two indiana cases,guajardo state,holding that reversal was not required where defendant had already served out his sentence because the error had been mooted and the denial of counsel at sentencing did not affect the validity of the underlying conviction,and ford state,holding that even if counsel inability to address the court on defendant behalf at sentencing was a violation of defendant right to counsel,it did not prejudice the defendant because his sentence was mandated by statute.see id.the court observed 
although jackson was not represented by counsel on may,he appeared for sentencing on march.jackson attorney was present and spoke on his behalf at the sentencing hearing of march.the transcript of the march sentencing indicated that the trial court sentenced jackson to not less than one year nor more than ten years and ordered him committed to the department of correction for proper assignment.although the execution of the sentence was withheld,the trial court ultimately suspended the entire sentence and placed him on probation for two years.jackson acknowledged at his guilty plea and initial sentence hearing that he would receive a one to ten year sentence.even if jackson right to counsel was violated,jackson has failed to show how he was prejudiced.at the time of jackson sentencing,the statute he was convicted of violating required the sentence that jackson received.the fact that the trial court ordered all of jackson sentence to be suspended is diametrically opposed to his contention that he was prejudiced.additionally,given that any error in sentencing would not affect the validity of the conviction,resentencing would serve no apparent purpose and jackson offers none.
id.on march,the supreme court of indiana denied transfer.jackson next filed a petition for state relief from his robbery and attempted murder convictions,raising several grounds for relief including ineffective assistance of counsel at trial and ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal.the court denied relief on all but one of jackson claims and jackson initiated an appeal.jackson failed to perfect the appeal,however,and voluntarily terminated it on june.
on march,jackson,again pro se,filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the northern district of indiana challenging the use of his allegedly constitutionally infirm theft conviction to enhance his current sentence.the district court denied jackson petition.jackson then filed an application for a certificate of appealability,and the district court denied his application.on december,we granted jackson request for a certificate of appealability on the following issue was petitioner denied counsel in violation of the sixth amendment to the constitution at his may,sentencing hearing 
ii.analysis 
availability of federal relief 
jackson claims that his theft conviction was obtained in violation of his sixth amendment right to counsel therefore,he claims that the use of that conviction to enhance his current sentence is unconstitutional.because jackson seeks to challenge his current sentence by attacking a fully expired conviction used to enhance that sentence,our first task is to determine whether federal relief is available to a prisoner in jackson situation.to that end,we asked the parties to consider the applicability of our decision in smith farley,cir,in which we held that federal review of a fully expired conviction that has been incorporated into a new enhanced sentence is limited to situations in which the petitioner had no access to collateral review because state procedures were wholly absent,or constitutionally deficient.id.at.smith is no longer controlling on this issue,however,in light of two intervening supreme court decisions that address the availability of relief to petitioners who assert that an unconstitutional prior conviction was used to enhance their current sentence.see daniels united states,d and lackawanna county dist.att y coss,d.we therefore direct our attention to those decisions.
in daniels and lackawanna,the supreme court confirmed that,in general,habeas relief is not available to petitioners who challenge a fully expired conviction used to enhance a subsequent sentence in a petition brought under or.see daniels,at.at lackawanna.at.the supreme court held that if a prior conviction used to enhance a federal sentence is no longer open to direct or collateral attack in its own right because the defendant failed to pursue those remedies while they were available or because the defendant did so unsuccessfully,then that defendant may not collaterally att
