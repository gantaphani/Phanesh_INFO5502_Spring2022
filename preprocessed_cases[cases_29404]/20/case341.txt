this is the fourth in a series of recent cases to come before us challenging new york state murder convictions on grounds that the evidence presented to the jury could support only a conviction for intentional murder under penal law,and not depraved indifference murder under see garbutt conway,cir parker ercole,cir rivera cuomo,cir.in each of these cases,the petitioner advanced the somewhat perverse argument that he should be released from state custody because the evidence suggests he is in fact more culpable than the jury had found him to be.in each case,the new york courts rejected that argument,and in each case,we affirmed the dismissal of the petition for habeas corpus,recognizing that it is not our place to tell new york courts that they do not understand evolving new york law.
the trend continues here.appealing from a judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york raymond dearie,judge denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus under,darnell epps petitioner,epps,or darnell contends that the evidence at his trial was insufficient to support his conviction for murder as an accomplice because his brother darryl,the principal who in fact shot the victim,clearly acted with the intent to kill.the appellate division of the new york supreme court rejected this argument,holding that,under new york law at the time epps conviction became final,the evidence was sufficient to support the jury verdict.see people epps,dep t.
upon review of the record and the arguments of counsel,we conclude that the appellate division decision was not contrary to,or based on an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court.we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court dismissing epps petition,substantially for the reasons stated by judge dearie in his thorough and memorandum and order of may.see epps poole,cv,wl may.we write merely to locate this case within the jurisprudence of our court and that of the new york court of appeals.
background 
in view of epps conviction,we recite the pertinent facts in the light most favorable to the verdict.see,garbutt,at.
in the early morning hours of march,darnell epps was sitting in a van parked outside a convenience store when he was informed by an acquaintance,jesus plazza,that derek warren who was inside the store with a friend,randy jiles was calling darnell a pussy.darnell seemed unperturbed and drove off in the van.some time later,however,while warren and jiles were still inside the store,darnell phoned the store and asked for plazza,who was standing outside selling drugs.when plazza came to the phone,darnell told him to leave the store because something might happen,it was not safe there.plazza and some others left the scene,while warren,jiles,another customer named kenny,and two store employees remained inside.
at approximately,darnell entered the store,followed by his brother,darryl,who came in fast.darryl,brandishing a gun,approached warren,grabbed him around the neck,and said i told you to stay out of this store.warren then st u ck his arm up on the gun and t he gun went off.darnell instinctually drew his own gun,and pointed it at jiles.darryl rapidly fired four more shots into warren head and neck.as darnell later testified,everything happened so fast that he did not know whether the first shot was intentionally fired by darryl or whether the gun had gone off by accident.although police later confirmed that the only bullets fired came from darryl gun,darryl himself was somehow shot in the encounter.
darnell turned himself in five days later.he gave conflicting accounts in two written and two videotaped statements,initially telling police that an latino man had shot warren,but later admitting that his brother was the shooter and had asked that darnell back him up.darnell was charged with one count of murder,one count of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree,and one count of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree,each under an acting in concert theory.
after darryl pleaded guilty to intentional murder,darnell was tried before a jury and,on october,found guilty of murder he was acquitted on the weapons possession charges.on november,he was sentenced to an indeterminate term of seventeen and years to life in prison,the same sentence received by his brother.
on appeal,darnell argued that,because darryl actions were intentional and not reckless,the evidence was insufficient to convict darnell as an accomplice to murder.the appellate division denied the claim as both unpreserved and without merit and affirmed his conviction by order of april.people epps,dep t.leave to appeal was denied on september,and his conviction became final on december.clay united states,d a judgment of conviction becomes final when the time expires for filing a petition for certiorari contesting the appellate court affirmation of the conviction.establishing period for filing petition for writ of certiorari 
on june,before epps conviction became final,the new york court of appeals decided people hafeez,in which it reversed a murder conviction based on accomplice liability where the attack on the victim was quintessentially intentional.id.at.thereafter,epps moved to vacate his conviction under new york criminal procedure law,arguing that hafeez had changed new york murder law such that his conviction could no longer be deemed to be supported by the evidence.by decision dated august,the supreme court,king county,denied the motion,concluding that,even if hafeez marked a change in the law,epps was not entitled to relief.the appellate division affirmed,holding that e ven under the standard espoused in people hafeez,which was decided after this court rendered its decision and order on the defendant direct appeal,but before his conviction became final,the evidence was legally sufficient to establish the defendant guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.people epps,dep t internal citations omitted.
on august,epps filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under.he argued that,under new york law at the time his conviction became final,the evidence produced at trial was consistent only with an intentional murder and,consequently,insufficient to support his conviction for murder as an accomplice.he also raised a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.the district court denied the petition on both grounds.see epps poole,cv,wl may.we granted a certificate of appealability on the sufficiency claim and now affirm the judgment of the district court.
discussion 
we review de novo a district court denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.see henry ricks,cir.the writ may not issue for any claim adjudicated on the merits by a state court unless the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court of the united states,or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.the state court findings of fact are presumed to be correct unless the petitioner can rebut this presumption by clear and convincing evidence.id.e.the petitioner bears the ultimate burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that his constitutional rights have been violated.jones vacco,cir.
in cases challenging the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a criminal conviction,our concern is not with the state courts application of the state law defining the offense,but rather with the state courts application of federal law,and,in particular,the sufficiency standard set forth by the supreme court in jackson virginia,d.under this standard,the relevant question is whether,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.
we therefore review sufficiency challenges to convictions under a doubly deferential standard of review.garbutt,at.we defer first to the jury verdict,drawing all inferences in its favor.see,united states archer,cir.second,we defer to the state courts rejection of the defendant constitutional arguments,at least insofar as it did not result from an unreasonable determination of the facts or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.see garbutt,at.a third layer of deference applies in cases like this one,where the state appellate court assessment of the evidence is intertwined with its interpretation of a complex and evolving body of state law,with which the state courts have far more familiarity than we have.id.at.
under new york law,a person is guilty of murder when,u nder circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life,he recklessly engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of death to another person and thereby causes the death of another person.penal law.in contrast,a person is guilty of intentional murder when w ith intent to cause the death of another person,he causes the death of such person or of a third person.id.both murder and intentional murder under section qualify as murder in the second degree and are class a i felonies under new york law.id.
at the time of darnell trial and conviction,the controlling decision on the elements of murder was people register.under the register regime,in order to convict a defendant on a charge of murder,a jury was required to find,beyond a reasonable doubt,that the defendant recklessly engaged in conduct which created a grave risk of death to another person thereby causing the death of another person under circumstance evincing a depraved indifference to human life.policano herbert,summarizing the law as of june.the mens rea for murder was recklessness,and the statutory phrase under circumstance evincing a depraved indifference to human life defined the factual setting,viewed objectively,in which the conduct occurred.id.
in policano herbert,the court of appeals described the hallmarks of the register regime as twofold 
first,even though an attack by its very nature presents compelling circumstantial evidence of intent to cause death,we considered the question of the defendant state of mind to be a classic matter for the jury 
second,the factual setting in which the conduct must occur,viewed objectively register standard for determining whether there are circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life was fulfilled if a defendant actions created an almost certain risk of death by,for example,shooting the victim in the head multiple times at close range.
policano herbert.notably,the fact t hat a defendant acts virtually guaranteed the victim death did not,in and of itself,preclude a guilty verdict on a theory of depraved indifference.id.at.there can be little doubt,therefore,that,under the law as it stood at the time of darnell conviction on october,the evidence justified the jury verdict.
darnell argues,however,that,by the time his conviction became final,in december,new york law on murder had changed such that his conviction was no longer supported by the evidence.it is true that,between the years and,the court of appeals issued a remarkable series of decisions people hafeez,people gonzalez,people payne,people suarez,and people feingold,that incrementally pointed the law in a different direction.policano,at,internal quotation marks omitted.as the court of appeals later explained,during this time one of the elements of murder under circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life gradually and perceptibly changed from an objectively determined standard the register formulation to a mens rea.id.at.ultimately,in feingold,decided in july,the court of appeals reversed register and held that depraved indifference to human life is a culpable mental state.at.inasmuch as a finding of indifference to human life depraved or otherwise is incompatible with a finding of a specific intent to cause death,darnell argues that the jury verdict of october,which became final on december,can not be reconciled with the evidence at trial tending to show that his brother,the principal,acted with the specific intent to kill.
however,the new york court of appeals has made it abundantly clear that the current understanding of the elements of murder under which the mens rea is no longer recklessness,but depraved indifference to human life does not apply retroactively to persons whose convictions became final before the offense was redefined.policano,at,accordingly,the success of darnell argument depends upon a determination that the offense was redefined in july with the court of appeals decision in people hafeez,the only one of the cases mentioned above to have been decided before his conviction became final.in policano,the court of appeals declined to identify where along this trajectory a majority of the court may have effectively passed the point of no return the limit beyond which,hard as it may have tried,it was simply not possible to reconcile its developing case law with register and sanchez.at.as we discuss momentarily,deferring to a more recent decision of the appellate division of the new york supreme court,we do not believe that hafeez marked the point of no return.we therefore address darnell sufficiency claim under the law of new york as stated in register in and reaffirmed in sanchez in.
first,however,we briefly address an issue that has led to some confusion in this matter why should the principal intent dictate the outcome of a case concerning the accomplice mental state 
under section of the new york penal law,w hen one person engages in conduct which constitutes an offense,another person is criminally liable for such conduct when,acting with the mental culpability required for the commission thereof,he solicits,requests,commands,importunes,or intentionally aids such person to engage in such conduct.based on the plain meaning of the statute,it would seem that accomplice liability does not depend on the mental state of the principal,but rather,on the mental state of the accomplice combined with the conduct of the principal as the court of appeals held in people flayhart 
penal law imposes accessorial liability on an accomplice not for aiding or encouraging another to reach a particular mental state,but rather for intentionally aiding another to engage in conduct which constitutes the charged offense while himself acting with the mental culpability required for the commission of that offense.
second emphasis added.
however,in people hafeez,the new york court of appeals stated that a defendant can be convicted for murder under a theory of accomplice liability only if he intentionally aided the codefendant in commission of the crime and shared the codefendant culpable mental state.at.emphasis added.similarly,when this issue was raised at oral argument in the case at bar,both parties agreed that new york law requires proof of a shared intent or community of purpose between the accomplice and principal,in order to impose accessorial liability on the accomplice.
this language of shared intent and community of purpose appears to be a relic of construing section of the former penal law,which did not contain a mens rea requirement.as the new york court of appeals explained in,in order to prevent the imposition of criminal liability for the principal crime on someone who may have been merely present without intending to aid in the offense,the courts construing section of the former penal law required proof that the aider or abettor share d the intent or purpose of the principal actor.people kaplan,quoting,inter alia,people la belle,final alteration in kaplan.as the court of appeals recognized in kaplan,the need for this requirement was eliminated with the adoption of section in the revised penal law,but the shared intent or purpose language from earlier cases still appears occasionally even in cases arising under the modern statute.id.at.
if new york law does not,in fact,require that an accomplice and principal share the same mental state,then the evidence of darnell conduct in this case would support his conviction of murder irrespective of the evidence tending to show that darryl,the principal,acted with the intent to kill.nevertheless,given the confusion surrounding this issue and the agreemen
