backgrounda.facts 
on august,rafael colon had his car stolen at gunpoint.while colon was stopped at an intersection,a man placed a gun to his head and ordered him out of his car.a second man lunged through the window,shifted the transmission into park,turned off the ignition and took the keys.the gunman then took the victim necklace from his neck.during this time,colon was with the gunman for approximately thirty seconds,and the scene was illuminated by streetlights.the gunman then told colon to leave,and colon complied.
after the incident,colon contacted the police.police reports described the gunman as a,male with black hair and brown eyes.the reports did not include any indication of visible scars and did not contain a description of the second assailant.
one week later,while responding to a disturbance call,the police officers found colon car at a house where harding was present.harding was arrested originally for disorderly conduct as a result of the disturbance.he gave the officers permission to search my car,at.the police found documents bearing colon name still in the vehicle.harding was charged with armed robbery and possession of a stolen motor vehicle.police placed harding,pounds and another suspect,carl page,pounds,in a lineup with four other men,who were to in height and weighed from to pounds.colon identified both harding and page as the perpetrators,but the lineup identification was later suppressed as impermissibly suggestive.
trial court proceedings 
at trial,colon identified harding as the perpetrator.according to colon testimony,he had seen harding on five occasions prior to his identification.these sightings occurred in the context of court proceedings in which harding was clearly the subject of the prosecution.the state trial court found that colon encounter with the gunman while his necklace was being removed provided a sufficient independent basis for identification and allowed the identification.
harding presented a defense of alibi and mistaken identity.he testified that he was recovering from unrelated injuries at his mother home when colon car was stolen.on the date the crime allegedly occurred,part of his head was shaved revealing two partially healed,red scars containing nine and twelve stitches respectively.harding mother,brother and two of his cousins all testified that he was at his mother house at the time of the carjacking.
harding also testified that artric jordan had loaned him the car and had given him the keys.harding asserted that he did not know that the car was stolen.to establish that jordan had stolen colon car,harding sought to introduce evidence that jordan lived within a block of the scene of the carjacking and had been arrested for armed carjacking less than a month after colon car was stolen.the trial court precluded him from introducing this evidence however,the court did permit harding to show a mugshot of jordan to colon in court.colon testified that he had never seen jordan before and did not see him the night of the carjacking.harding nevertheless was allowed to,and did,argue that jordan had stolen colon car.
harding had several prior convictions,including one for armed robbery.prior to trial,the defense submitted a motion in limine to exclude certain information regarding these convictions.in response,the trial court ruled that,if harding testified,the prosecution could elicit that he had been convicted of previous felonies and the dates of these felonies however,the sentences harding received and the nature of his offenses were inadmissible because the jury would tend to convict him just because he an armed robber,app.at.
the prosecution did not elicit harding prior convictions on,but harding attorney did raise the issue on over the prosecution objections.during,the prosecution had questioned harding about giving the police a false name and address when he was arrested.on,harding counsel followed up on this questioning by asking harding why he had done this.harding replied,you know,it puzzle me right now today,that is one of the fear that you have of polices really,its one of the fears,you know,app.at to.then,the following examination took place

a jury convicted harding on both the armed robbery charge and the possession of a stolen motor vehicle charge.the trial judge sentenced him to concurrent prison terms of years on the charge and fourteen years on the possession charge.
state appellate court proceedings 
harding appealed his conviction on three grounds.the two issues relevant to his current habeas petition are that the trial court erred by excluding evidence that jordan had committed another carjacking shortly after colon car was stolen,and that his trial attorney was ineffective for eliciting testimony about the details of his prior convictions.the illinois appellate court affirmed the trial court decision.
the state appellate court addressed whether it was error to refuse to admit evidence of a subsequent carjacking committed by jordan.the court treated this claim as an evidentiary challenge and held that evidentiary decisions were committed to the sound discretion of the trial court.the appellate court explained that,at trial,harding attempted to introduce evidence jordan committed a car theft.he intended to use this evidence to show that subsequent theft revealed a common scheme and similar modus operandi.the appellate court,however,found no meaningful link between the two car thefts it noted the different times of the thefts,types of location,number of occupants in the vehicle and the use of a real gun during the armed robbery of colon rather than the use of a toy gun in the subsequent robbery jordan was alleged to have committed.in light of the differences between the crimes,the appellate court held the state trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to admit this evidence.
the state appellate court also addressed the ineffective assistance of counsel claim.employing the test of strickland washington,d,the court first noted that the decision to introduce evidence of prior convictions ordinarily is a question of trial strategy.on the second prong of strickland,the court noted that the erroneous admission of other crimes evidence is harmless where properly admitted evidence is so overwhelming that no fairminded jury could vote for acquittal,at.the court determined that the error did not affect the outcome of the case and was therefore harmless.the court explained that conviction was based on the victim identification of harding at trial,testimony from an officer that colon car was found in harding possession and testimony that harding claimed the car was his.the court further noted that,harding statement from the witness stand that it is okay,i explain it,indicated his acquiescence to the introduction of his prior convictions.see id.quoting trial transcript included at,at.finally,the appellate court noted that the trial court had granted the defense counsel request to strike the testimony and had instructed the jury to disregard the testimony as to the armed robbery.the appellate court concluded that this instruction was sufficient to remedy any error.
after unsuccessfully petitioning for leave to appeal to the illinois supreme court,harding filed a state petition for relief.he raised eight new claims.as the district court recounted 
he argued that his due process rights were violated when the state knowingly elicited false testimony from one of its police officer witnesses he was denied his amendment right to confront and that false testimony he was denied due process because the state knowingly suppressed evidence his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise issues on direct appeal his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to interview artric jordan he was denied a fair and impartial jury because his trial attorney failed to challenge prospective jurors for cause he was denied due process when one of the officers on the case destroyed evidence of a suggestive and fabricated other reports introduced into evidence and he was denied due process based upon the excessive delays during the appellate process.
at.the state trial court denied harding any relief.harding appealed the dismissal of his petition,but the state appellate court affirmed the dismissal of the relief.after harding counsel was allowed to withdraw from the case,harding requested a rehearing and later filed a petition for leave to appeal to the illinois supreme court.both were denied.
district court proceedings 
harding filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus,which raised the same claims that his petition for relief addressed,plus one new claim.the district court then appointed an attorney to represent harding.counsel then filed an amended petition,which reduced the issues to ineffective assistance of counsel and the exclusion of jordan carjacking arrest.the district court denied relief with respect to both claims.
the district court first addressed the ineffective assistance of counsel claim.the court concluded that this claim had not been procedurally defaulted and that harding had not forfeited the error by acquiescing in his attorney questioning.the court explained further that harding fairly presented this claim to the illinois state court and that,when harding answered his attorney questions,he was trying only to appear cooperative.because harding had no opportunity to oppose or comment on his attorney questioning,he could not have been acquiescing.the district court further noted that the state court ruling addressed the question of acquiescence only after it had addressed the merits of the ineffectiveness claim.the state decision therefore did not rest on an independent state procedural ground accordingly,ruled the district court,it was proper for the federal court to consider the merits of harding claim.
on the merits of this claim,the district court recognized the test of strickland washington,d,as controlling and noted that it required harding to demonstrate that his counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that the deficient performance so prejudiced his defense that it deprived him of a fair trial.at.the district court then determined that the state court had made no findings on counsel performance.consequently,the district court addressed this issue for the first time.the court found that counsel strategy was to elicit testimony regarding the prior convictions in an effort to explain why harding had lied to the police about his name and address.the court also found that harding counsel knew the information was prejudicial because he had argued previously that the same evidence was unduly prejudicial in an effort to suppress it.after describing defense counsel strategy as and its execution as atrocious,the court concluded that counsel performance fell well below an objective standard of reasonableness.at.
the district court then decided that the state court determination on the prejudice prong of strickland was not an unreasonable application of strickland.although the district court did not agree that the evidence against harding was overwhelming,it nevertheless concluded that the state court decision on prejudice was not so wide of the mark as to be unreasonable.id.at.the district court then recounted the evidence that supported the conviction,including that the victim was with the gunman for thirty seconds the street was illuminated by lights the victim recognized harding as the gunman the victim did not recognize jordan from a photograph the police officer testified that harding had told him the car was his and the victim papers were found in the car.finally,the district court noted that the state appellate court relied on the jury instruction to disregard the reference to a prior armed robbery,potentially the most prejudicial aspect of the questioning.therefore,the district court rejected harding ineffective assistance of counsel claim.
the district court next addressed harding due process claim.focusing on whether harding fairly presented the issue to the state courts,the district court noted that harding had stated in one introductory sentence that t he court refusal to allow him to introduce the evidence violated his constitutional right to introduce evidence in his own defense and denied him a fair trial.id.at quoting harding appellate brief on direct appeal,at.his argument and supporting discussion for this claim,however,addressed it as an evidentiary issue and not a constitutional claim.consequently,the state appellate court had addressed it as such.the district court further noted that harding subsequent petition to the state supreme court was a verbatim copy of his appellate brief.the district court viewed his appeal and unchanged petition to the supreme court as an indication that the nature of the claim remained the same.id.at.harding amended federal habeas petition,however,uses constitutional terms to make his argument.the district court concluded that,although the governing legal principles differ ed,the thrust of his argument was parallel to his argument in state court therefore,it proceeded to consider the merits of his claim.id.
on the merits of the claim,the court first noted that evidence of jordan carjacking arrest was properly excluded under state evidentiary requirements.therefore,the issue,said the district court,was whether the state evidentiary ruling inhibited the defendant sixth amendment right to present a defense.the court noted that a state law does not infringe on a person right to present a defense unless it is arbitrary or disproportionate to the purpose it is designed to serve.id.at alteration in original quoting rock arkansas,d.the state rule at issue was the equivalent of federal rule of evidence b,which,the court noted,does not violate this principle.the court further noted that the differences in the two carjackings were sufficiently significant to make the state court ruling to exclude evidence of jordan arrest for carjacking a reasonable one.therefore,the district court rejected harding due process claims.
after the court rejected the petition on both claims,it certified those issues for appeal.
discussion 
the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa provides that a writ of habeas corpus only shall be granted if the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.under this provision,a federal habeas court must find that the state application of federal law was unreasonable and not simply erroneous or incorrect.see williams taylor,d.a n unreasonable application of federal law is different from an incorrect application of federal law.id.at.the habeas applicant has the burden of proof to show that the application of federal law was unreasonable.see woodford visciotti,d.
ineffective assistance of counsel claim 
we first examine whether the district court erred in ruling that the state appellate court reasonably determined that harding was not deprived of a fair trial based on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
procedural default 
the state first submits that harding waived his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel because the state court found that harding had acquiesced to his counsel line of questioning regarding his prior convictions.if this characterization is correct,it shall preclude our review because a state prisoner may only obtain federal habeas review if he has exhausted state remedies and avoided procedurally defaulting his claim.see thomas mccaughtry,cir.
the procedural default doctrine stems from federalism principles,specifically the idea that federal courts will not disturb state court judgments based on adequate and independent state law procedural grounds.dretke haley.ed d.a federal court may address a habeas petition when the last state court decision did not expressly rely on an independent and adequate state ground but instead depended on or involved the resolution of a federal claim.see coleman thompson,d.i f the decision appears to rest primarily on a merits determination of the petitioner claims,or to be interwoven with those claims,and does not clearly and expressly rely on the procedural default,there is no independent and adequate state ground.farmer litscher,cir.therefore,this court must determine if the state court based its decision on an adequate and independent state ground or on resolution of harding federal claim.
here,the state appellate court discussed the merits of harding claim under strickland washington.the court spent several paragraphs discussing the prejudice prong.only one paragraph of this discussion addresses acquiescence,and it appears in the middle of several other reasons the court uses to demonstrate that harding was not prejudiced.the court first noted that any deficient performance by his counsel would be harmless because of the overwhelming evidence against the defendant.then the court mentions harding acquiescence.later,the state court also found that the judge limiting instruction was sufficient to remedy the questions.we think that the state court approach is most accurately characterized as addressing the merits of the ineffective assistance claim and,in the course of that analysis,providing three reasons why harding was not prejudiced by counsel questions.therefore,the last state court ruling did not rest expressly on an independent state ground.we may consider the merits of harding claim.
we agree with the district court estimation that harding answering of his attorney questions can not be characterized reasonably as acquiescence.harding did not have an opportunity to oppose or comment on his attorney decision to ask such questions before they were presented to a jury.harding never expressly agreed to his attorney line of questioning by indicating his willingness to answer the questions.notably,the state trial judge made it clear to harding that it was not his place to determine the course of questioning.harding had no real choice but to attempt to appear cooperative.
because harding ineffective assistance of counsel claim was not waived,we must determine if the state appellate court reasonably held that harding had received effective assistance of counsel.the state appellate court correctly identified the federal standard for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as the test laid out in strickland washington,d.the test provides that the attorney performance must fall below an objective standard of reasonableness,and the attorney deficient performance actually must have prejudiced the petitioner.see id.at.we shall examine each of these considerations.
performance of counsel 
we first examine whether the state appellate court reasonably applied the first prong of strickland,regarding the performance of harding counsel.the district court determined that the state appellate court did not make a finding on whether counsel performance was objectively unreasonable.the state contests this conclusion by noting that the state appellate court observed that admitting evidence of prior crimes is generally a matter of trial strategy.the state equates this description with a determination by the trial court that counsel performance was reasonable.as a result,the state suggests that the district court should not have evaluated the merits of counsel performance but instead should have confined its evaluation to a determination of whether the state appellate court decision was an unreasonable application of the first prong of strickland.
the state accurately notes that the state appellate court described the attorney decision to introduce evidence of other crimes as generally a matter of trial strategy it then assumes that this description by the appellate court amounts to a definitive estimation of the performance of harding attorney.we can not accept this view.the state appellate court did not conclude that harding employed a reasonable trial strategy or that his performance was reasonable.the district court correctly determined that the state appellate court did not make a finding under the first prong of strickland on the reasonableness of the attorney performance.accordingly,the district court correctly reviewed this issue de novo.
the supreme court has not set out a specific checklist to determine whether an attorney performance falls below an objective standard of reasonableness.see strickland,at.instead,an attorney conduct will be judged against prevailing norms to determine if it was reasonable in light of the surrounding circumstances.see id.also,a court must be highly deferential when evaluating an attorney performance.see id.at.in order to give the attorney a fair evaluation,every effort must be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight,to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel challenged conduct,and to evaluate the conduct from counsel perspective at the time.id.at.
the performance of harding counsel must be examined in light of the circumstances surrounding harding testimony.harding counsel recognized the possible prejudice of having harding prior convictions presented before a jury.accordingly,he filed a motion in limine to have the evidence excluded.the trial court also recognized that the nature of harding prior convictions would prejudice the jury when it ruled that the nature of harding prior convictions could not be introduced and that the jury could be told only that he had been convicted of felonies on certain dates.
during,the prosecution introduced the fact that harding had given the police a false name.in the questionable trial strategy at issue here,harding counsel then tried to explain to the jury why harding had given the police a fals
