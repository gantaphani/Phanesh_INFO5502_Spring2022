the state of delaware appeals from the order of the district court for the district of delaware conditionally granting the petition of darrell stevens for a writ of habeas corpus.see stevens.corr,d.the state raises two arguments on appeal that the ineffective assistance claim upon which the district court granted federal habeas relief was unexhausted and is thus procedurally barred,and in the alternative,that the state courts application of strickland washington,d,was not objectively unreasonable under d.
facts and procedural backgrounda.facts 
on march,at about,tracey auterson went with some friends to a bar called d pizza restaurant.sometime that evening,marvin lindsay,auterson boyfriend,with whom she had been living until earlier that week,arrived at d.the two quarreled,after which lindsay left the bar.at approximately,auterson called lindsay at his home and asked if she could stay with him that night,rather than return to her parents home where she had been staying.he said she could stay with him but he declined her request to come pick her up at the bar.
according to auterson testimony,after the phone call she started to walk to lindsay home,about a walk from d.on the way,she was grabbed from behind,dragged into an apple orchard,and forcibly raped.during the struggle,she scraped her attacker genitals with her fingernails.later she fainted.when she regained consciousness,the assailant was still with her,but he subsequently fled.auterson was unable to identify her attacker because she was lying on her stomach part of the time and was told to keep her eyes closed when she was later rolled over onto her back.
after the assailant fled,auterson ran out of the orchard and shortly thereafter,at approximately,she went to lindsay home and told him that she had been raped.lindsay noted that auterson clothes were in disarray and that she was upset.lindsay testified,however,that at the time he was not sure whether he believed her story.lindsay spent about a half hour to calm auterson down,after which they both went to sleep.
lindsay left for work at about.after discussing the incident with his,lindsay called auterson at approximately to tell her she should report the rape to the police and that if she did not call the police she should go to her mother home.according to auterson,at about,she returned to the scene of the rape because she needed a cigarette and believed she lost her cigarettes in the orchard.while there,she found the tank top that she had been wearing the previous evening.she then became frightened and returned to lindsay home.
after lindsay returned from work at about,auterson called the police.detective young interviewed auterson that afternoon at lindsay home and in lindsay presence.young and auterson then returned to the orchard where,in an area of the orchard where the ground appeared compressed,they found her underpants and a wallet belonging to stevens.
thereafter,detective young and auterson went to the hospital for a physical examination.semen was removed from auterson vagina and blood and semen were found on her skirt.dna testing revealed that both semen samples matched stevens dna and the blood was consistent with stevens blood type and not auterson.young and auterson then went to the police station where detective young reinterviewed auterson,this time on audiotape.auterson was unable to give detective young a physical description of her assailant.
auterson testified that she had never seen stevens before,had never been on a date or otherwise socialized with him,and had not danced with him on the night in question 
q have you ever seen the defendant before 
q okay.did you ever socialize with that man before that you recall today 
a i do recognize him,no.
q did you ever go out with him,date him did you ever have any sexual relations with him ever in your life 
q would you be able today to identify him as the person who was with you in the orchard that night 
a to tell you the truth,no.
auterson also testified that,although she had been at d for more than seven hours,she only consumed about one and a half glasses of beer.she did acknowledge that,when she left the bar,she was buzzed but not seriously impaired.stevens,d at.
stevens was arrested on march.he admits that he was also at d on march.according to stevens,he got very drunk,having consumed approximately four pitchers of beer and one or two shots of alcohol that evening.stevens was able to recall many details of his actions in the bar that evening such as ordering a tuna sub but only eating half of it,app.at,and ordering four pitchers of beer,app.at,but he was unable to remember anything after leaving the bar.he did testify that he was fairly certain that he left the bar alone,app.at,and that his next memory was waking up the following morning in a driveway behind the bar without his wallet.app.at.he further testified that he did not know auterson,although he may have seen her at d on march 
q the young lady who testified here tracey auterson,do you know her 
a no,sir,i do.
q you do recall 
a i might have seen her at the bar.
q but you do have any specific memory of that 
a no,sir i do know her personally.
after stevens arrest,the police examined him and found a scrape,sore,or abrasion of some sort on his scrotum.a photograph of this mark was shown to the jury.
stevens was charged with unlawful sexual intercourse and sexual penetration.under delaware law at the time of stevens trial,a person could be convicted of unlawful sexual intercourse if the following elements were present intentional sexual intercourse with another person without the other person consent,when the other person was not a voluntary social companion on the occasion of the particular sexual intercourse in question and when the other person had not consented to sexual intercourse with the person in question for the previous twelve months.ann.tit,a repealed under delaware law,if the prosecution failed to establish that the defendant and the victim were not voluntary social companions,the crime of unlawful sexual intercourse was reduced to unlawful sexual intercourse.ann.tit,repealed.
stevens trial 
to defend stevens,his mother,peggy lane,hired dennis reardon.because stevens has no memory of what he did after leaving d,he could not affirmatively deny engaging in sexual intercourse with auterson.instead,reardon trial strategy was to argue that stevens did not have sexual intercourse with auterson,but,in the alternative,to argue that if he had sex with her,it was consensual.in support of the latter,stevens testified that he does not get violent when he is drunk.that testimony was corroborated by the testimony of maureen stokes,a former girlfriend of stevens.reardon suggested to the jury that auterson must have lied to lindsay about being raped in order to cover up having consensual sex with stevens.
reardon also tried to elicit from stokes a confirmation of stevens explanation of the mark on his genitalia.at trial,the prosecution argued that this mark corroborated auterson claim that she scraped her attacker genitalia.according to the prosecution,her claim was further corroborated by the blood found on her skirt.in the prosecution view,the mark on stevens genitalia undermined the defense consensual sex theory.stevens testified that he had a history of herpes and that the mark on his scrotum was a herpes sore,not a scratch.reardon attempted to corroborate stevens history of herpes by testimony from stokes.reardon had apparently failed to discuss with stokes his intention to question her on this subject,because stokes testified that she was unaware that stevens ever had herpes.despite the prosecution emphasis of this point on of stokes,reardon continued to press the issue on redirect.stokes again denied ever knowing that stevens had herpes,despite having been in a close and intimate relationship with him for about a year.
reardon also called two witnesses who were present at d on the evening of the rape.kathy theodorakos,the owner of d,testified that before she left the bar that evening,between and,she saw stevens and he was not drunk.karen cates,a friend of stevens,testified that she saw him dancing that evening with a group of people that included auterson but she did not see him dancing with auterson.she also testified that when she saw stevens dancing at approximately,he appeared to be drunk or high but was not falling down or stumbling.cates also testified that when she was driving home at about,she saw stevens walking by himself in a direction toward his home,which was in a different direction than the apple orchard.
stevens was convicted of unlawful sexual intercourse by a jury in delaware superior court in february and he was thereafter sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole or the reduction of his sentence for twenty years.in june,stevens conviction and sentence were affirmed by the delaware supreme court on appeal.stevens state.
proceedings 
according to lane,stevens mother,it was her understanding when she hired reardon to represent her son that reardon was going to hire a private investigator to attempt to locate potentially favorable witnesses because stevens had little recollection of the night of the alleged rape due to his heavy drinking and his subsequent memory lapse.in particular,since stevens could provide almost no information to assist reardon in finding people who were at d on the night of the alleged rape,lane agreed to pay the investigator fees.reardon did not,however,hire an investigator.stevens maintains that until the first day of the trial he and his mother were unaware of reardon failure to hire an investigator.
according to a statement by lane submitted in support of stevens motion for relief,kathy theodorakos,the owner of d,told her that reardon met with theodorakos at d prior to trial and that she gave him the names of additional people he should contact.at.reardon,however,merely left his business cards with theodorakos and asked her to pass them out and have people call him.reardon also apparently contacted approximately ten possible witnesses suggested by stevens or lane.
after stevens was convicted,lane hired two private investigators to try to identify individuals with information relevant to her son case.on october,stevens filed a motion for relief in delaware superior court in which he raised an ineffective assistance of counsel claim alleging,inter alia,reardon failure to conduct an adequate investigation.stevens identified various potential witnesses,attached the investigators summaries of interviews with the witnesses they had located,and submitted letters from three potential witnesses.some of the letters and interview notes included attacks on auterson,attributing to her a reputation for promiscuity and for liking violent sex,and some contained information from people claiming to have been present at d on the night in question and to have seen stevens and auterson dancing and socializing together at the bar.for example,jan and randy miller both claimed that they saw stevens and auterson dancing and drinking together,that auterson appeared to be drunk and was kissing stevens,and that stevens and auterson left the bar together.
the superior court ordered reardon to file a response to stevens ineffective assistance of counsel claims.reardon submitted an affidavit stating that because of the degree of stevens intoxication and his memory lapse,stevens was unable to give me anything to work on as far as forming a defense.stevens,d at quoting appellant appendix at,stevens state.reardon stated that after reviewing the evidence and talking to witnesses,he decided that the only defense possible was to attempt to persuade the jury that auterson consented to sex with stevens,then she attempted to cover herself by telling her boyfriend she was raped.id.at alternations in original quoting appellant appendix at,stevens.
reardon identified ten names of possible witnesses that stevens and his mother had provided and attested that all of the above were contacted by me either personally or by phone prior to trial.id.at quoting appellants appendix at,stevens.his affidavit does not describe the extent of the contacts or the information he obtained from them.of the ten names given to him by stevens and his mother,reardon apparently issued subpoenas to five of them,and four testified at trial.only and as to the events at d on the night in question.reardon affidavit did not deny lane claim that reardon simply left business cards with theodorakos,rather than following up himself with the names she provided to him.stevens filed a response to reardon affidavit in which stevens noted reardon failure to hire a private investigator as promised and reardon failure to pursue the leads given to him by theodorakos.
the superior court referred the matter to a commissioner who concluded that stevens had not established either of the two prongs necessary to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim under strickland.the superior court issued an order adopting the recommendations of the commissioner.state stevens,wl,at.july,appending commissioner report.stevens appealed the denial of his motion to the delaware supreme court.the delaware supreme court affirmed the denial of relief.stevens state.
in march,stevens filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to.stevens claimed he was denied the effective assistance of counsel,contending that reardon was deficient in several ways relating to the investigation or lack thereof and the preparation of the case before trial.in the appendix accompanying his opening brief in the habeas proceeding,stevens presented for the first time in any court affidavits unsigned from various witnesses in support of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.at.three weeks later,stevens submitted revised copies of the affidavits signed by the affiants.
the district court convened an evidentiary hearing limited to addressing the reasonableness of reardon performance on behalf of stevens.the district court described reardon testimony at the hearing by saying u nfortunately,and incredibly,reardon had virtually no recollection regarding the extent of his pretrial investigation or much else concerning his representation of stevens.stevens,d at.reardon could not locate any of his files related to stevens case and was unable to refute any of the testimony by stevens and his mother concerning representations he had made to them prior to trial.he did not recall failing to pursue all the leads theodorakos gave him but did testify that it fit his normal practice to have left his business cards with her and asking her to have witnesses call him long distance.finally,although reardon could not recall discussing the hiring of a private investigator with stevens mother,he admitted that he had never hired an investigator in more than thirty years of practice.id.
on july,the district court conditionally granted stevens habeas petition based on the ineffectiveness claim.stevens,d at.the state of delaware appeals,arguing first,that steven ineffective assistance claim is procedurally barred because he had not exhausted his state remedies,and second,that the state courts application of strickland was neither objectively unreasonable nor prejudicial.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
we review de novo a district court determination of whether an issue has been exhausted.whitney horn,cir.this court also conducts a plenary review of a district court legal conclusion but reviews its factual conclusions using the clearly erroneous standard.id.
the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa altered the standard of review that a federal habeas court must apply to a state prisoner claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court.see williams taylor,d interpreting d see also dunn colleran,cir explaining williams.under aedpa,in conducting a habeas analysis a federal court must presume that the factual findings of both state trial and appellate courts are correct,a presumption that can only be overcome on the basis of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.e duncan morton,cir,cert.denied,d.a federal court may not issue a writ of habeas corpus unless the state court adjudication of the claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.
the supreme court in williams interpreted the contrary to clause of this provision as follows a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by this court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than this court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.williams,at.additionally,the williams court interpreted the unreasonable application clause as allowing a federal habeas court to grant the writ if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from this court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.id.the court further explained that under the unreasonable application clause,a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.rather,that application must also be unreasonable.id.at.
the clearly established federal law applicable to stevens claims of ineffective assistance of counsel is the familiar test the court articulated in strickland washington,d.under strickland,stevens must first establish that reardon performance was constitutionally deficient by showing that his representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.strickland,at.second,stevens must show that there is a reasonable probability that reardon deficient performance prejudiced his defense to the extent that counsel mistakes omissions may well have affected the outcome of the case against him.id.at.the supreme court recently reconfirmed that counsel failure to conduct an adequate investigation must be scrutinized under the strickland test.see bell cone,d subjecting counsel failure to adduce mitigating evidence to the performance and prejudice components of strickland.
discussiona.exhaustion 
before a federal court can consider granting a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to a person incarcerated pursuant to a state court judgment,the petitioner must first exhaust any available state court remedies.b lambert blackwell,cir.to satisfy the exhaustion requirement,the petitioner must fairly present all federal claims to the highest state court before bringing them in federal court.whitney horn,cir.state remedies are not deemed exhausted if the petitioner has the right under the law of the state to raise,by any available procedure,the question presented.c.
a failure to exhaust will be excused when the habeas petitioner claims are procedurally barred under state rules.whitney,at citing gray netherland,d see also b b i.under such circumstances,federal courts may not consider the merits of such claims unless the petitioner can establish cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justice to excuse the procedural default.see whitney,at mccandless vaughn,cir citing coleman thompson,d.
here,the state argues that stevens has failed to exhaust his state remedies because the ineffective assistance of counsel argument he made in the district court was stronger than the one he made in the state courts,and therefore stevens federal claim is procedurally barred.specifically,stevens submitted to the superior court that heard his collateral case copies of letters and investigator notes that he or his mother had apparently solicited after his trial.stevens claimed the persons who wrote the letters or who had been interviewed should have been called for trial to provide impeachment testimony against auterson and to testify that stevens and auterson had danced together and left the bar together.the state argues that the letters offered to the superior court differ from the affidavits offered to the district court.in fact,the superior court said it viewed stevens unverified allegations with grave suspicion.
stevens responds that the affidavits presented no new facts but rather merely recite facts already submitted to the state courts.the district court agreed,as do we.the affidavits presented in the district court do not fundamentally alter the legal claim already considered by the state courts.vasquez hillery,d.for this reason,stevens submission of the affidavits does not render his claims unexhausted.we therefore turn to the substantive claims of stevens habeas petition.
ineffective assistance of counsel 
stevens claims that reardon performance as his counsel was constitutionally deficient because he made an inadequate effort to identify favorable witnesses and failed to hire a private investigator.the district court concluded that because the purpose of hiring a private investigator would have been to assist with the identification of favorable witnesses,these two claims merge into the single claim that reardon attempts to identify witnesses were inadequate.stevens,d at.assessing this claim,the district court concluded that reardon failure to conduct an investigation to try to locate witnesses was objectively unreasonable and that stevens was prejudiced by this failure to investigate.id.at.to evaluate the district court conclusions,we turn to the strickland test.
we have held that t he standard by which we judge deficient performance is an objective standard of reasonableness,viewed to the extent possible from the attorney perspective at the time,without the distorting effects of hindsight.duncan morton,cir quoting strickland,at.in addressing the reasonableness of an attorney representation,a reviewing court must be deferential in its scrutiny because it is all too easy to conclude that a particular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable in the harsh light of hindsight.bell cone,d citing strickland,at.furthermore,a party claiming ineffective assistance must identify specific errors by counsel,and the court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel conduct was reasonable.strickland,at.
it happens that strickland also involved an ineffectiveness claim relating to a duty to investigate.the supreme court did not offer any special standards concerning the duty to investigate,but it did say that counsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.id.at.a decision not to investigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances,and the habeas court must apply a heavy measure of deference to counsel judgments.id.the court observations in strickland speak to the issues raised in this case 
the reasonableness of counsel actions may be determined or substantially influenced by the defendant own statements or actions.counsel actions are usually based,quite properly,on informed strategic choices made by the defendant and on information supplied by the defendant.in particular,what investigation decisions are reasonable depends critically on such information.for example,when the facts that support a certain potential line of defense are generally known to counsel because of what the defendant has said,the need for further investigation may be considerably diminished or eliminated altogether.and when a defendant has given counsel reason to believe that pursuing certain investigations would be fruitless or even harmful,counsel failure to pursue those investigations may not later be challenged as unreasonable.
id.emphasis added.
reardon claimed that the only way to defend stevens given the proof that there had been sexual contact between stevens and auterson was to argue that auterson consented to sex with stevens.the state courts accepted that strategy as reasonable.the district court also concluded the strategy was reasonable but found that reardon was deficient in how he carried out this reasonable strategy.in particular,the court noted that despite the fact that reardon knew that he could not rely on stevens to recount the events of the night in question,reardon affidavit merely states that he contacted the ten individuals that stevens and his mother asked him to contact and that he interviewed auterson boyfriend.
in contrast to the district court view o
