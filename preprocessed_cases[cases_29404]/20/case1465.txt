petitioner dewitt mcdonald moves this court to grant him permission to file a second or successive habeas corpus petition pursuant to b.for the following reasons,we authorize mcdonald to file a second habeas corpus petition with the district court.
on june,the common pleas court of erie county,ohio,entered a jury guilty verdict for mcdonald,convicting him of complicity to commit the following offenses aggravated murder with a firearm specification murder with a firearm specification improperly discharging a firearm into a habitation with specifications for harm and a firearm felonious assault with a firearm specification attempted aggravated murder with a firearm specification and felonious assault with a firearm specification.the evidence presented at trial included the testimony of krista harris who had initially provided mcdonald with an alibi when testifying before a grand jury.at trial,however,harris recanted her initial grand jury testimony,testifying instead on behalf of the prosecution.indeed,as summarized by the court of appeals of ohio,
harris stated that mcdonald was supposed to meet her in a motel room a few blocks from the shooting scene,but he did not show up until sometime after.when he did arrive,according to harris,he appeared nervous and shaken.harris also testified that the next morning she overheard a telephone conversation between mcdonald and turner in which the shooting was discussed and mcdonald stated that they had to get the gun.mcdonald left and returned with turner a short time later turner was carrying a duffle bag.the trial judge merged the first two counts and sentenced mcdonald to life in prison.

on may,after pursuing his claims on direct appeal,mcdonald filed a habeas corpus petition with the united states district court for the northern district of ohio,which was denied on may.the district court also denied mcdonald a certificate of appealability.on february,mcdonald was again denied a certificate of appealability in response to his filing a notice of appeal with the district court.
in yet another reversal of her story,on december,krista harris signed an affidavit in which she stated that the prosecutor in mcdonald trial,kevin baxter,coerced her into a nonconsensual sexual relationship by threatening false criminal charges.moreover,harris stated that baxter used these threats to coerce her into providing perjured testimony in mcdonald case.these allegations were also corroborated by edward jay baxter,kevin baxter brother,who stated in an affidavit signed on april,that kevin baxter coerced krista harris to lie in a shooting,then forced her into a non consensual relationship.
after unsuccessfully pursuing multiple avenues for appeal of his conviction in state courts in reliance on this newly discovered evidence,mcdonald,pursuant to b,now seeks authorization to file a second petition of habeas corpus with the district court.mcdonald argues that such a petition should be granted because his conviction was based upon,in part,perjured testimony,constituting a violation of his rights under the due process clause.in addition,mcdonald argues that this court should grant him permission to file a second habeas corpus petition because 
the factual predicate for the claim could not have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence and the facts underlying the claim,if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole,would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that,but for constitutional error,no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.
the present motion before the court requests authorization to file a second habeas corpus petition in accordance with the requirements of b a before a second or successive application permitted by this section is filed in the district court,the applicant shall move in the appropriate court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider the application.in turn,the court of appeals may authorize the filing of a second or successive application only if it determines that the application makes a prima facie showing that the application satisfies the requirements of this subsection.b c.mcdonald argues that the claims underlying his requested second habeas corpus petition comply with b,which states in relevant part 
a claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section that was not presented in a prior application shall be dismissed unless 
b i the factual predicate for the claim could not have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence and 
ii the facts underlying the claim,if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole,would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that,but for constitutional error,no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.
as mcdonald notes,in compliance with b,his claim has not been presented in a prior application.see b a claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section that was presented in a prior application shall be dismissed.
in opposition to the instant motion,the government argues that mcdonald claim is barred because the factual predicate underlying the proffered constitutional error could have been discovered by mcdonald as early as.thus,the habeas corpus petition that mcdonald seeks permission to file would be barred by d d 
d a period of limitation shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court.the limitation period shall run from 
d the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.
consequently,the government argues that this court should,on these grounds,deny mcdonald permission to file a second habeas corpus petition.
the government arguments,however,do not take the entire text of b into account.section b c requires the relevant court of appeals to ensure that the petitioner request for permission to file a second habeas corpus petition satisfies the requirements of this subsection.emphasis added.in contrast,b charges the district court,and not the court of appeals,to dismiss any claim presented in a second or successive application that the court of appeals has authorized to be filed unless the applicant shows that the claim satisfies the requirements of this section.emphasis added.thus,investigating compliance with the statute of limitations outlined in d clearly a separate subsection from b is not within the purview of the court of appeals consideration of applications requesting authorization to file a second or successive habeas corpus petition pursuant to b.
indeed,not only does the text of the statute require this conclusion,but logic counsels that a court of appeals considering a request for authorization to file a second or successive habeas corpus petition would not consider whether or not the habeas corpus petition complies with the statute of limitations.when considering motions pursuant to b for permission to file a second or successive habeas corpus petition,the court does not have a developed record because the new petition has not yet been considered by a district court.as a result,courts of appeal can not determine whether the statute of limitations should be equitably tolled,see,souter jones,cir determining that,based upon the particular facts of the case,the petitioner had presented sufficient evidence of actual innocence to be granted equitable tolling see also pace diguglielmo,d stating that equitable tolling is available when the petitioner can demonstrate that he has been pursuing his rights diligently,and that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way,or on what date the defendant was able to discover the evidence in question through due diligence.see,granger hurt,cir finding that,because of the particular facts of the case,the period should begin after the date the information in fact became available see also randy hertz james liebman,f
