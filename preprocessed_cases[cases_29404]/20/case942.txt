walter poindexter filed a motion pursuant to,contending,among other things,that his attorney rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance when he failed to file a timely notice of appeal after being unequivocally instructed to do so.in denying poindexter motion without an evidentiary hearing,the district court declined to resolve the factual dispute concerning whether poindexter unequivocally instructed his attorney to file a timely notice of appeal.instead,the court concluded that poindexter ineffective assistance of counsel claim lacked merit because in his plea agreement,poindexter waived his right to appeal his conviction and sentence and poindexter was sentenced in accordance with the terms of the plea agreement.poindexter appeals.for the reasons stated below,we hold that an attorney renders constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel if he fails to follow his client unequivocal instruction to file a timely notice of appeal even though the defendant may have waived his right to challenge his conviction and sentence in the plea agreement.accordingly,we vacate the district court judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
on october,poindexter was charged by a federal grand jury sitting in the district of maryland with conspiracy to distribute in excess of one kilogram of heroin,a and,and three counts of distributing heroin,id.a.the conspiracy count alleged that poindexter and another individual used various locations in the city of baltimore to cut,package,stash,and sell heroin.the conspiracy count also alleged as an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy that,on january,poindexter shot and killed another man that poindexter believed was responsible for burglarizing one of the stash houses.the three distribution counts alleged that,on three separate occasions in september,poindexter sold a quantity of heroin to an fbi cooperating witness.on december,the case went to trial.after three days of trial,poindexter decided to plead guilty to the three distribution counts.
in the plea agreement,the parties stipulated to a drug amount substantially lower than the one kilogram quantity charged in the conspiracy count.for its part,the government agreed not to seek an enhancement to poindexter sentence based on poindexter alleged role in the january,shooting incident for his part,poindexter agreed not to appeal his sentence,including any issues that relate d to the establishment of the guideline range,provided the district court did not upwardly depart from the sentencing range provided for by the sentencing guidelines or the sentence imposed did not exceed the statutory maximum allowed under the law,which was twenty years imprisonment on each count 
on december,the district court held a rule hearing.see.during the hearing,poindexter acknowledged that he had discussed the appeal waiver with his attorney,understood the nature of the waiver,and agreed to be bound by the waiver.
a presentence report psr was prepared in preparation for sentencing.the psr recommended a sentencing range of to months imprisonment,based on the conclusion that poindexter total offense level was and his criminal history category was vi.in accordance with the psr recommendations,the district court sentenced poindexter to concurrent terms of months imprisonment on each count.poindexter did not file a notice of appeal.
on march,poindexter filed a motion pursuant to to vacate,set aside,or correct his sentence.in his motion,poindexter claimed,among other things,that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel when his attorney failed to file a timely notice of appeal after he unequivocally instructed his attorney to do so 
on august,the district court denied poindexter motion without an evidentiary hearing,holding,inter alia,that poindexter could not prevail on his claim that his attorney rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel when he failed to file a timely notice of appeal because poindexter was sentenced within the sentencing range established by the sentencing guidelines and,therefore,any challenge to his sentence would fall under the appeal waiver contained in the plea agreement.in so ruling,the district court incorrectly observed that poindexter appeal waiver covered an appeal of his conviction,as opposed to just an appeal of his sentence.also of note,the district court declined to resolve the factual dispute concerning whether poindexter unequivocally instructed his attorney to file a timely notice of appeal following the district court denial of a certificate of appealability,poindexter filed an application for a certificate of appealability in this court.on july,we granted poindexter a certificate of appealability on his claim that his attorney rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel when he failed to file a timely notice of appeal after being unequivocally instructed to do so.
when reviewing an appeal from the denial of a motion,we review de novo the district court legal conclusions.united states nicholson,cir.when the district court denies relief without an evidentiary hearing,the nature of the court ruling is akin to a ruling on a motion for summary judgment.id.in such a circumstance,we review the facts in the light most favorable to the movant.id.because the district court did not hold an evidentiary hearing to resolve the question of whether poindexter unequivocally instructed his attorney to file a timely notice of appeal,we must assume that poindexter did so instruct for purposes of resolving his appeal.
poindexter contends that an attorney who disregards his client unequivocal instruction to file a timely notice of appeal acts in a manner that is both professionally unreasonable and presumptively prejudicial,notwithstanding the fact that the client may have executed an appeal waiver.in response,the government submits that poindexter appeal waiver allowed the district court to dismiss his motion if the district court found his claims frivolous,either because they were covered by the appeal waiver or because they failed on the merits.
the sixth amendment provides that,i n all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to have the assistance of counsel for his defence.const.amend.vi.the supreme court has long recognized that the right to counsel includes the right to the effective assistance of counsel.mcmann richardson,d.an ineffective assistance of counsel claim requires a showing that counsel performance was deficient and the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.strickland washington,d.
the constitution of course does not give a criminal defendant the right to appeal as a matter of right.jones barnes,d.however,the united states code provides this right in,and we have recognized that a defendant can waive this statutory right.united states wiggins,cir.
in roe,d,the supreme court applied strickland to an ineffective assistance claim involving a defendant who did not give his attorney instructions on whether to file a timely notice of appeal.id.at.the defendant in that case neither asked his lawyer to file a timely notice of appeal nor consented to her not filing one.id.at.on appeal from the denial of relief under,the ninth circuit held that the defendant was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel,holding that an attorney must file a timely notice of appeal unless the defendant specifically instructs otherwise,at.
the supreme court in began its performance analysis by noting that an attorney who disregards a defendant specific instruction to file a timely notice of appeal acts in a professionally unreasonable manner.id.at.the court also noted that an attorney is under no obligation to file a notice of appeal where the defendant explicitly instructs his attorney not to file one.id.the performance issue in the attorney constitutionally deficient for not filing a notice of appeal where the defendant had not conveyed or clearly conveyed his appellate fell somewhere between these two principles.id.
the court in rejected the brightline performance rule applied in the ninth circuit as inconsistent with strickland holding that the performance inquiry must be whether counsel assistance was reasonable considering all the circumstances.id.at.quoting strickland,at.instead,the court opined that,in certain circumstances,an attorney is constitutionally required to consult with the defendant concerning the advantages and disadvantages of taking an appeal and to discover the defendant appellate wishes.id.at.the court stated that an attorney must consult with a defendant when there is reason to believe that either a rational defendant would want to appeal or the defendant reasonably demonstrated to his attorney that he was interested in appealing.id.at.in assessing whether an attorney had a constitutional duty to consult,the court indicated that several factors were relevant,including whether the conviction followed a trial or guilty plea.id.in cases involving guilty pleas,the court instructed lower courts to consider whether the defendant received the sentence bargained for as part of the plea and whether the plea expressly reserved or waived appeal rights.id.
turning to the prejudice prong,the court observed that a presumption of prejudice applies when an attorney deficient performance deprives the defendant of an appeal.id.at.thus,where the defendant unequivocally instructs an attorney to file a timely notice of appeal,prejudice is presumed because it results in the forfeiture of the appellate proceeding.see also united states,cir noting that the prejudice in failure to file a notice of appeal cases is that the defendant lost his chance to file the appeal,not that he lost a favorable result that he would have obtained by appeal.if the defendant did not so instruct his attorney and his attorney subsequently did not fulfill his consultation obligations,prejudice will be presumed if the defendant can show that,had he received reasonable advice from his attorney,he would have instructed his attorney to file a timely notice of appeal,at.whether the defendant has met the prejudice standard will turn on the facts of the particular case.id.at.however,evidence that there were nonfrivolous grounds for appeal or that the defendant in question promptly expressed a desire to appeal will often be highly relevant in making the prejudice determination.id.in demonstrating prejudice,the defendant is under no obligation to demonstrate that his hypothetical appeal might have had merit.id.at.
as noted above,the district court did not hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether poindexter unequivocally instructed his attorney to file a timely notice of appeal.accordingly,we must assume that poindexter did so instruct.this assumption is outcome determinative in this case for the following reasons.once poindexter unequivocally instructed his attorney to file a timely notice of appeal,his attorney was under an obligation to do so.under,therefore,his attorney acted in a professionally unreasonable manner.because his attorney unprofessional conduct resulted in poindexter losing his appellate proceeding,he has established prejudice under as well.
the government argues that did not involve an appeal waiver and,therefore,is distinguishable and of little assistance in this case.however,the court in stated that,once an attorney is unequivocally instructed to file a timely notice of appeal,he is under an obligation to do so.id.at.under the court holding in that case,it is only when the defendant either does not make his appellate wishes known or does not clearly express his wishes that an attorney has some latitude in deciding whether to file an appeal.id.at.simply put,reaffirms the principle that an attorney is not at liberty to disregard the appellate wishes of his client.see peguero united states,d w hen counsel fails to file a requested appeal,a defendant is entitled to a new appeal without showing that his appeal would likely have had merit.rodriquez united states,d holding that an attorney who disregards his client instruction to file a timely notice of appeal acts in a professionally unreasonable manner united states peak,cir holding that a criminal defense attorney failure to file a notice of appeal when requested by his client deprives the defendant of his sixth amendment right to the assistance of counsel,notwithstanding that the lost appeal may not have had a reasonable probability of success.
next,the government argues that application of a rule requiring an attorney to file a timely notice of appeal when unequivocally instructed to do so by his client deprives,in the appeal waiver context,the government of the benefit of its bargain.according to the government,it bargained for poindexter appeal waiver and should receive the benefit of that bargain.
plea bargaining is an important component of this country criminal justice system.blackledge allison,d,see also brady united states,d recognizing that to of all criminal convictions involve guilty pleas.as the supreme court recognized in blackledge,
p roperly administered,they can benefit all concerned.the defendant avoids extended pretrial incarceration and the anxieties and uncertainties of a trial he gains a speedy disposition of his case,the chance to acknowledge his guilt,and a prompt start in realizing whatever potential there may be for rehabilitation.judges and prosecutors conserve vital and scarce resources.the public is protected from the risks posed by those charged with criminal offenses who are at large on bail while awaiting completion of criminal proceedings.
blackledge,at.plea bargains rest on contractual principles,and,thus,each party to a plea agreement should receive the benefit of their respective bargain.united states ringling,cir.
appeal waivers also play an important role in the plea bargaining process.they not only alleviate the government of the burden of a costly appeal,but they also preserve the finality of judgments and sentences.wiggins,at see also united states blick,cir discussing the importance of appeal waivers.this court has enforced appeal waivers in a number of cases involving a variety of circumstances.see,united states johnson,cir,cert.denied,d blick,at united states general,cir united states brown,cir united states brock,cir.we will enforce an appeal waiver so long as the waiver is knowing and intelligent and the issue sought to be appealed falls within the scope of the appeal waiver.blick,at.finally,we have refused to enforce valid appeal waivers for a narrow class of claims,based on our determination that those claims were not within the scope of the waiver.id.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.this narrow class of claims involves errors that the defendant could not have reasonably contemplated when the plea agreement was executed.id.at see also united states,cir holding that a valid appeal waiver in which the defendant waived her right to appeal her sentence on the grounds specified in did not preclude her from asserting on appeal that a restitution order to which she had formally agreed was not authorized by the applicable statute united states attar,cir noting that a defendant who agreed to a general appeal waiver did not waive his right to appeal his sentence on the ground that the proceedings following the entry of his guilty plea were conducted in violation of his sixth amendment right to counsel united states marin,cir noting that a defendant could not be said to have waived his right to appellate review of a sentence imposed in excess of the maximum penalty provided by statute or based on a constitutionally impermissible factor such as race.
in the typical appeal waiver case,the government and the defendant enter into a plea agreement,wherein the defendant agrees to plead guilty and waive some or all of his appellate rights including sometimes the right to pursue relief in exchange for the government agreement to dismiss some of the charges pending against the defendant or to seek a lower sentence than the defendant could have faced had a judge or jury convicted him after a trial.after the defendant pleads guilty in the rule proceeding and the district court enters judgment,the case moves to the appellate phase.
