backgrounda.facts 
anthony horton convictions are based on a series of incidents that occurred between october and march and involved his girlfriend daughter,jessica robinson.while living with jessica family,horton allegedly entered jessica bedroom in the middle of the night and sexually assaulted her approximately twelve times.on march,jessica discovered that she was pregnant.four days later,she told her mother about the pregnancy and claimed that horton was the father.subsequently,horton was indicted and charged with four counts of first degree sexual assault of a child.see.stat.although dna testing later established that horton was not the father of jessica baby,and jessica admitted to having had sex with randy,a friend of her older brother,the state proceeded to trial on three of the sexual assault charges 
at trial,the prosecution called seven witnesses.jessica testified that horton had sexually assaulted her a number of times while he was living with her family.in october,when she was eight or,he came into her room while she was sleeping and touched her in a sexual manner.while jessica mother disbelieved the allegations,charges for first degree sexual assault of a child were brought by the state.horton pled guilty to fourth degree sexual assault and spent nine months in prison 
according to jessica testimony,horton moved back into the robinson home after his release,and,around october,his sexual assault of her,this time including sexual intercourse,resumed.jessica explained that horton often offered her gifts in exchange for remaining quiet about their illicit activity.no physical evidence was introduced at trial.
jessica testified that,when she discovered that she was pregnant,she knew that there was a possibility that randy,not horton,might be the father.she testified that tashea,her friend and horton niece,was with her when she took the home pregnancy test and that,when the test was positive,tashea inquired about the identity of the father.jessica told her that the father was randy she made no mention of horton.however,when she revealed her pregnancy to her mother four days later,she did not mention randy.only after dna testing eliminated the possibility that horton was the father did jessica finally disclose her relationship with randy to her mother,noting that she had had sex with randy only once.
debra,jessica mother,also testified.she began by discussing her relationship with horton,including his often violent conduct towards her.she then testified that jessica told her of the pregnancy on march,in the school counselor office and that she subsequently took jessica to file a police report,and then for an abortion.lastly,she testified that jessica never mentioned her relationship with randy until after dna testing revealed that horton was not the father of her baby then,jessica told her mother that she had thought it was horton baby because of the number of times that he had had sex with her,and that she had only had sex with randy once.at.
jessica cousin,keionnia,testified that,about six years before the trial,she had slept over at her aunt debra home.according to keionnia,horton,who was living with debra at the time,woke her up in the middle of the night,offered her marijuana,and,after she fell back asleep,sexually molested her.for this incident,horton was charged with first degree sexual assault of a child.he pled guilty to fourth degree sexual assault on april,and was sentenced to nine months in prison.
four other witnesses were called by the state,whose testimony is not directly relevant to this appeal 
the defense submitted the theory that jessica had a motive to fabricate evidence.in the defense view,jessica had accused horton of being the father of her child in order to avoid moral culpability for her consensual sexual activities with randy,to protect randy,and to remove horton,her primary disciplinarian,from her home.to support this theory,the defense proffered the testimony of two witnesses tashea horton,who was both a friend of jessica and horton niece and trina horton,who was both tashea mother and horton sister.the state filed a motion to exclude this testimony as irrelevant.at.
with regard to tashea horton,the trial court denied in part and granted in part the state motion.it allowed tashea to testify that she was with jessica when she took the pregnancy test.at that time,which was prior to the disclosure of dna test results,she asked jessica,who se baby is it randy,to which jessica responded,yes,i guess so.at.on,when the defense inquired why tashea would ask this question,she was permitted to explain that she had seen jessica and randy have sex twice and that jessica used to tell her sometimes that they had sex.id.at.
however,the trial court precluded tashea from testifying that jessica had told both her and her mother,trina,that jessica and randy had had sex four or five times,rather than jessica had told her mother and the court.the defense submitted that this conversation goes directly to jessica credibility.id.at.the court held,however,that the evidence was not relevant it makes no difference,the court explained,whether randy had sex with her one time or five times or ten times.id.at.in the court view,the frequency neither proved nor disproved whether horton sexually assaulted jessica.
the trial court granted the state motion to exclude the testimony of trina horton.according to the defense oral offer of proof,trina would have testified that,shortly after march,tashea confided in her about jessica pregnancy.trina,along with tashea,then confronted jessica,and jessica admitted that she had had sex with randy on four or five occasions.according to the defense proffer,trina would have testified further that she then gave jessica five days to tell her mother of the situation if jessica failed to do so,trina would do so.the trial court prohibited trina from taking the stand,holding that this evidence does not have anything to do with whether or not this defendant committed the acts he is accused of committing.id.at 
on august,horton was convicted of three counts of first degree sexual assault of a child.he was sentenced to consecutive twenty and terms in prison,followed by forty years of probation 
proceedings on direct appeal and on habeas review 
on direct appeal,the defendant argued that the trial court exclusion of trina testimony,as well as limitations on tashea testimony,violated his sixth amendment right to present a defense the wisconsin court of appeals held that trina testimony on the ultimatum would have been relevant to whatever inference of truthfulness the jury might have drawn from the timing of jessica accusations,at.similarly,the excluded testimony on the number of times jessica and randy had had sex would strengthen the defense claim that jessica named horton as the father to protect randy and minimize her responsibility for her own consensual sexual activities.id.at.
the wisconsin appellate court nevertheless affirmed horton conviction.it held that the defense,even absent the precluded testimony,had an opportunity to present fully its theory of the case therefore,horton was not deprived of the right to a fair trial.for example,jessica testified that she did not mention to her mother or to the police that randy might be the father of her baby,even though she knew it was a possibility.she also admitted telling tashea that randy was the father,long before dna test results were returned.additionally,according to the state court,it was clear that jessica was under time pressure,given that the pregnancy could not be hidden forever.id.
after horton petition for review was denied by the wisconsin supreme court,he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the eastern district of wisconsin.see.he alleged that the wisconsin trial court limitations on tashea testimony and the exclusion of trina testimony violated his constitutional rights to confrontation,to compulsory process and to present a defense the district court denied horton petition.it held that the wisconsin court of appeals conclusion that the defendant had a full and fair opportunity to present its theory of the case was not an unreasonable application of federal law.specifically,although the excluded evidence was relevant,a review of the record indicated that there was sufficient evidence to support the theory that jessica accused horton to protect randy and minimize her responsibility for her own consensual sexual activities.at quoting state anthony,wl,at.for example,horton was permitted to show that jessica gave contradictory answers concerning her familiarity with randy her boyfriend,and the number of times they engaged in consensual sexual activity.id.in light of this evidence,the district court concluded that the wisconsin court of appeals did not act unreasonably in determining that the state trial court did not deny horton the right to present a defense.
discussiona.standard of review 
we review the district court denial of horton petition de novo.hardaway young,cir.the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa mandates that horton may be granted habeas relief only if the state court adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.
under the contrary to clause,habeas relief is proper if the state court arrive d at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the court on a question of law or if the state court confront ed facts that are materially indistinguishable from a relevant supreme court precedent and reached a different result.williams taylor,d.in assessing whether the state court decision was an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent,we look to whether the decision is objectively unreasonable.id.at.the supreme court has cautioned that,in this context,unreasonable and incorrect are not synonymous a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.rather,that application must also be unreasonable.id.at.with these principles in mind,we now turn to horton sixth amendment claim.
b.the sixth amendment right to present a defense 
the sixth amendment,as interpreted by the supreme court,guarantees a criminal defendant the right to present a defense.see chambers mississippi,d.a t a minimum,criminal defendants have the right to put before a jury evidence that might influence the determination of guilt.taylor illinois,d quotation marks omitted.the supreme court has held unconstitutional the rigid application of state evidentiary rules when such an application infringes upon the right to present witnesses in one own defense,particularly when that testimony is critical to the defense theory of the case.chambers,at.holding that the rules of evidence may not be applied mechanistically to defeat the ends of justice.
this right,however,is not unlimited and may bow to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process.id.at.the state is permitted to impose reasonable restrictions on the presentation of a defense,including state and federal rules designed to assure both fairness and reliability in the ascertainment of guilt and innocence.id.at.see also united states lea,cir state courts have broad latitude to fashion rules which operate to exclude evidence from criminal trials.such rules do not abridge an accused right to present a defense so long as they are not arbitrary or disproportionate to the purposes they are designed to serve.rock arkansas,d citations omitted.the supreme court has held the exclusion of evidence to be unconstitutionally arbitrary or disproportionate only where it has infringed upon a weighty interest of the accused.united states scheffer,d.
the wisconsin court of appeals adequately articulated the governing sixth amendment standards,as set forth by the supreme court of the united states it correctly noted that the right to present a defense is not violated by every limitation placed on a defendant exploration of a witness bias.instead,it held,the right to present a defense is limited to the presentation of relevant evidence whose probative value is not substantially outweighed by its potential prejudicial effect,at.
furthermore,the wisconsin court reasonably applied the supreme court case law to the facts of this case.
tashea and trina testimony concerning their conversation with jessica 
the trial court precluded horton from asking either trina or tashea horton about their conversation with jessica,in which she admitted that she had had sex with randy on four or five occasions.because this testimony would have contradicted jessica claim at trial that she and randy had had sex only once,horton contends that its exclusion violated his constitutional right to present a defense.according to horton,this evidence substantiated the defense theory that jessica falsely accused him of sexual abuse in order to avoid punishment for her consensual sexual relations with randy it also exposed one of jessica lies and therefore impeached her credibility.the state responds that the wisconsin court of appeals did not err in concluding that,although the trial court improperly held this evidence to be irrelevant to the trial,no federal constitutional right was violated because horton had an opportunity to present substantially similar evidence.
in cases of sexual abuse,in which there are usually neither eye witnesses nor physical evidence and,consequently,the state case in large part depends on the victim testimony,courts have recognized the need to be especially sensitive to the importance of careful exploration of matters of credibility therefore,the claim that the state trial court evidentiary rulings cut off an important avenue for horton to expose potential inconsistencies in jessica testimony is worthy of close examination.to the degree that the testimony in question would have established that jessica lied when she denied having sex with anyone but horton,and when she claimed that she only had sex with randy once,it would have corroborated the defense theory that jessica was willing to falsify charges to protect herself and randy from punishment.
on the other hand,unlike the situations in the cases relied upon by the defendant the wisconsin trial court did not wholly bar horton from testing jessica claim that she only had sex with randy once.first,on,defense counsel was permitted to ask tashea what prompted her on march to ask jessica if randy was the father of the baby.tashea responded,b ecause i had seen jessica and randy have sex twice and she used to tell me sometimes that they had sex.at.this testimony substantiated the claim that jessica and randy had had sex on numerous occasions and therefore challenged directly jessica contrary account to her mother and to t
