background 
waymond jackson and donald stewart were robbed and shot by doyle johnson and al walker at the pesotum rest area on interstate near champaign,illinois.jackson died,but stewart survived.jerome white and bernice caldwell whom white refers to as his wife were charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder for hiring johnson and walker to kill the victims.at jerome white trial,johnson,the state primary witness,testified that the victims were competitors to a prostitution business run by white and caldwell at the pesotum rest area,who wanted them taken out of the game.johnson said that he and walker met white and caldwell in chicago and rode with them to champaign,illinois.during that trip,according to johnson,white offered johnson and walker each to do the job.when they arrived in champaign,johnson and walker accompanied white and caldwell to caldwell home,where they obtained a rental car and guns.
the theory of defense relied on by white counsel,michael green,was that it was jerome brother,michael white,who hired johnson and walker to shoot the two victims.this theory was consistent with johnson original statement to police,which implicated michael white.but johnson changed his story days before trial and instead implicated jerome white.green theory was contradicted by caldwell young daughter,theresa,who testified that she saw jerome white not michael and her mother meet with two men at caldwell home on the night of the murder.the police also verified that michael white had an was on a greyhound bus traveling to champaign and could not have met with johnson in champaign at the time that the murder was planned.
after his conviction was affirmed on direct appeal,white filed a petition for relief in state court which included the claims at issue in this appeal that green rendered ineffective assistance by meeting with him for just minutes before trial and failing to consult with him regarding potential witnesses and trial strategy.the circuit court dismissed his petition without an evidentiary hearing,the appellate court affirmed,and the illinois supreme court denied leave to appeal.see white i,at.white then filed a petition for habeas corpus in federal district court.as to the ineffective assistance claims that are still at issue,we held that the district court erred in dismissing his claims without conducting an evidentiary hearing.we also held that white had established that green performance prejudiced him.white i,at 
on remand from this court,the district court held an evidentiary hearing.white testified that his trial attorney,michael green,met with him twice before trial.at the first meeting,which was five months before trial and lasted minutes,white and green discussed green fee and how white would pay it.after this meeting and before trial,white telephoned green office but green did not return his phone calls.white did not meet with green again until the evening before trial.at that second meeting,which lasted minutes,they discussed jury selection issues,theresa caldwell testimony,and the possibility that bernice caldwell would testify for the state.
according to white,he asked green to explore the possibility of caldwell testifying on his behalf,but green ignored his request.green never discussed trial strategy or any other possible defense witnesses,including white himself,and never asked for information relevant to the defense.white offered an affidavit from bernice caldwell,in which she stated that she would have testified at white trial,and the transcripts of caldwell and white testimony from caldwell trial.the testimony contained in those documents is consistent with white version of what he and caldwell would have said if called to testify at his trial that he and caldwell were at her home on the night of the murder,went to bed shortly after arriving there with johnson and walker,and discovered that the guns and rental car were missing when they awoke.
white also introduced inmate visitor logs from the jail which show that green signed in and out for meetings with white twice.according to those records,the first time green signed out minutes after he signed in,and the next time he signed out minutes after he signed in.white testified that on the evening of the second visit,he was in the shower when he learned that he had visitors and that it took him five to seven minutes longer than usual to reach the visitor area.the county sheriff,who oversaw operations at the jail where green was detained before and during the trial,testified by way of deposition admitted at the hearing that it was the jail practice to record all inmate visits and that he could not remember a single incident of an officer failing to record an attorney visit during his tenure.
the district court concluded that green performance was outside the range of professionally competent representation.based on this court earlier holding that white was prejudiced by green performance,the district court granted white petition for a writ of habeas corpus.the state appeals and,for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
ii.analysis 
we evaluate white claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under the standard of strickland washington,d,which requires that a defendant show that the attorney performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,at,and that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.at henderson walls,cir.white petition was filed before the effective date of the and effective death penalty act aedpa,so we apply standards.wright walls,cir white i,at.we presume correct the state court determination of historical fact,kavanagh berge,cir,and review the district court findings of fact for clear error.griffin camp,cir.we review de novo the questions whether counsel performance was constitutionally deficient and whether that performance prejudiced the defendant.strickland,at wright,at.
deficient performance 
as the district court noted,the question which remained after our remand in white i was whether green adequately consulted with white and investigated the facts necessary for an adequate defense.the supreme court has recognized counsel duty to consult with his client as one of the basic components of adequate representation 
representation of a criminal defendant entails certain basic duties from counsel function as assistant to the defendant derive the overarching duty to advocate the defendant cause and the more particular duties to consult with the defendant on important decisions and to keep the defendant informed of important developments in the course of the prosecution.
strickland,at.a brief consultation does not by itself establish that counsel performance was inadequate.white i,at.but as we noted in the earlier appeal,if the alleged inadequate consultation caused counsel to misapprehend or fail to investigate the facts necessary for an adequate defense,then his later missteps are almost necessarily not attributable to sound strategic decisions.at.in this way,the two issues relating to green allegedly inadeq
