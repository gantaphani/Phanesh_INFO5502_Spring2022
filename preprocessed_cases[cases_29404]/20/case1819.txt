forrest woods was convicted in illinois state court of murdering omar wilson and sentenced to forty years imprisonment.after unsuccessfully appealing his sentence,he filed three petitions for relief.all were denied.he then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under.the district court denied his petition,holding that all but one issue was procedurally barred and denying relief on the single preserved issue.on appeal,woods challenges the denial of his petition.we affirm.
on the night of july,kenya wilson walked out of a bedroom in her hazel crest,illinois home and saw her brother omar at the bottom of the stairs being restrained from behind by an unknown man,later identified as forrest woods.over a span of three minutes,omar alternated between calling for his brother terrell wilson and telling kenya to go back to her bedroom.then,without a word,woods shot omar in the back of the head.
at this,kenya ran into a bathroom and shut the door.woods chased after her and tried to gain entry but fled when terrell came out of his room to investigate the gunshot.it was at this point that terrell got a brief look at woods.the police were then called,and omar was pronounced dead at the scene.
neither kenya nor terrell knew the shooter.both described him as a black man with a light complexion,round face,and a husky or stocky build.kenya initially estimated that he was between eighteen and twenty years old,stood between and,and weighed pounds.at the time of his arrest,woods was seventeen,stood and weighed approximately pounds.
to identify the shooter,the police initially presented kenya with over a thousand photos,but she did not recognize him in the initial batch.over a week later,officer raymond huggins of the chicago housing authority was at the scene of a domestic disturbance.a suspect there volunteered the following nugget of information did you hear about the shooting in hazel crest boy named did it.huggins was familiar with he had previously arrested forrest woods using that alias.
huggins then relayed the tip to officer gary gentzle,who was investigating omar murder,and gave gentzle a photo of woods.that photo was shown to kenya,along with seven other photos she immediately identified woods as the shooter.the next day both she and terrell identified woods in a lineup.the state charged woods with murder he pleaded not guilty and proceeded to trial.
at the bench trial,kenya and terrell testified to the events on the night of omar murder,and both again identified woods as the shooter.the prosecution also called officer gentzle and omar mother to testify.the defense did not call any witnesses.woods was found guilty of murdering omar wilson and later sentenced to forty years imprisonment.he then filed a direct appeal challenging his sentence but not his conviction.the illinois appellate court affirmed woods sentence,and the illinois supreme court denied him leave to appeal.
woods then filed the first of three petitions in illinois state court.the first petition raised three issues.pertinent here was woods claim that his trial counsel rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance by failing to call his brother,harold woods,as an alibi witness.attached to the petition was an affidavit from harold prepared four years after the shooting,stating,i do recall woods leaving the house anytime that night.the trial court dismissed the petition,concluding the claims should have been presented on direct appeal and were thus waived.the appellate court,however,held that woods claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was not waived and addressed it on the merits under strickland washington,d.it found that harold affidavit was inconclusive,and based on the eyewitness testimony at trial,it concluded that had harold testified it would not likely have changed the outcome of the trial and denied the petition.the illinois supreme court denied woods petition for leave to appeal.
woods then filed a second petition for relief,claiming that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to call his mother and as alibi witnesses.attached to the petition were their affidavits attesting to woods presence at home on the night of the murder.the trial court dismissed the petition,and the appellate court affirmed,holding that the claim and the affidavits should have been submitted in woods initial petition and were thus waived.it also held that woods could not establish cause and prejudice to escape the procedural bar of waiver.the illinois supreme court again denied woods petition for leave to appeal.
undeterred,woods filed a third petition for relief.in it,he raised three claims with twelve distinct.the trial court dismissed the petition as frivolous and patently without merit.on appeal,woods appointed counsel filed a motion to withdraw under pennsylvania finley,d.in the motion,counsel recited the procedural history of woods case and stated 
woods has shown no objective factor why he could not have raised these claims in his original petition,and therefore he may not seek relief in a successive petition.
with the exception of finley,the motion did not cite any federal law.woods then filed two objections restating the bases for the claims in his third petition however,he did not address the procedural bar of waiver that his counsel had cited.but he did note,without anything more,that the failure to entertain his petition would result in a miscarriage of justice.the appellate court granted the motion to withdraw and affirmed the trial court dismissal of the petition.in their respective orders,neither the trial court nor the appellate court cited or discussed federal law.and for the fourth time,the illinois supreme court denied woods petition for leave to appeal.
woods then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois.in his petition,he raised seventeen claims.the district court found that woods had procedurally defaulted all but one of those claims and that he could not escape the procedural bar under any of the applicable exceptions.concerning the merits of his preserved claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to call harold woods to testify,the district court found that in denying that claim the illinois appellate court did not unreasonably apply strickland standard for ineffective assistance of counsel and denied woods petition.
woods then moved for a certificate of appealability,which the district court denied.this court,however,granted him one on the following issues whether woods trial counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge kenya wilson ability to view the crime whether woods appellate counsel was ineffective for raising only a forfeited issue and whether woods trial counsel was ineffective for failing to identify and call alibi witnesses.this appeal followed.
the first two claims woods raises on appeal are that his appellate counsel was ineffective for raising only a forfeited issue and that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge kenya wilson ability to view the crime.the district court found that both claims were procedurally defaulted and we review that determination de novo.smith gaetz,cir.
before seeking habeas relief,a petitioner must fairly present his federal claims at each level of the state courts for their review.b a baldwin reese,d.the natural corollary of this requirement is that when a petitioner has exhausted his state court remedies and failed to properly assert his federal claims at each level of review those claims are procedurally defaulted.lewis sternes,cir.and when a state court resolves a federal claim by resting its decision on a state law ground independent of the federal question and adequate to support the judgment,we will not review the question of federal law.coleman thompson,d.any such ruling on the federal claims would be advisory,given the fact that on remand the state court would still deny petitioner relief on the independent and adequate state law ground.id.at.because this court has no power to review a state law determination that is sufficient to support the judgment,resolution of any independent federal ground for the decision could not affect the judgment and would therefore be advisory.
thus,when a state refuses to adjudicate a petitioner federal claims because they were not raised in accord with the state procedural rules,that will normally qualify as an independent and adequate state ground for denying federal review.cone bell,d.a finding of waiver by the state postconviction court is enough to establish an adequate and independent state ground.sturgeon chandler,cir.such claims are commonly referred to as being procedurally defaulted,johnson loftus,cir.and when a claim is procedurally defaulted,that bars our review of the claim,unless the petitioner can demonstrate both cause for and prejudice from the default or that a miscarriage of justice will occur if we do not consider his claims.anderson benik,cir.
in this case,woods raised his claims that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge kenya wilson ability to view the crime and that appellate counsel was ineffective for raising only a forfeited issue for the first time in his third petition.nonetheless,he argues that these claims are not procedurally defaulted because the appellate court denied his federal claims on their merits.in the alternative,woods argues that he can escape that procedural bar because it would result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice,namely,in a conviction of one who is actually innocent.gonzales mize,cir parenthesis omitted.woods does not argue cause and prejudice to escape the procedural bar.see schlup delo,d discussing the difference between cause and prejudice and miscarriage of justice.
woods argues that the illinois appellate court decided the merits of his federal claims when it summarily affirmed the trial court denial of his third petition for relief.in support,woods relies on our holding in wilkinson cowan,and language we used in lewis sternes,cir,summarizing our holding in wilkinson both cases addressed the dismissal of petitions,when the appellate court granted an attorney finley motion to withdraw.woods reads them as standing for the broad proposition that when appellate counsel files a finley motion and in response the appellate court both grants the attorney motion to withdraw and summarily affirms the dismissal of the petitioner petition,the court has rendered a merits judgment on each of the claims asserted in that petition.but a careful examination of those cases shows that our holding in wilkinson was not as broad as woods would read it.
in wilkinson we addressed a much different situation than we have here.there,the petitioner had presented his federal claims in his original petition to the trial court,and they were summarily dismissed.wilkinson,at.he appealed,and his appointed appellate counsel moved to withdraw without briefing the merits of any of the issues raised in the case.id.at.petitioner did not file an objection,and the appellate court granted the motion to withdraw and summarily affirmed the trial court denial of the petition.
in response to the habeas petition,the state argued that his claims were defaulted because he did not again present his claims in a pro se memorandum responding to the motion to withdraw or by filing his own brief addressing the issues he sought to appeal.id.we rejected the state position.id.at we simply reject the state contention that wilkinson can be charged with a procedural default under these circumstances.based on the circumstances of that case,we held that the appellate court had been presented with the petitioner claims and had addressed them on their merits.id.at see also id.at in view of the particular way in which the illinois appellate court disposed of wilkinson appeal,however,we do not believe that he procedurally defaulted the ineffectiveness claim.
in lewis we rejected a petitioner claim that he had fairly presented the appellate court with two ineffective assistance of counsel claims that first appeared in his objection to his attorney motion to withdraw.lewis,at w e reject the notion that a petitioner fairly presents his federal claim to the state courts when he raises that claim for the first time in an appellate brief after his lawyer has filed a motion to withdraw under finley.we refused to read our holding in wilkinson broadly and limited it to the precise factual and procedural posture of that case.id.at lewis construes our holding in wilkinson far too broadly.we stated 
at most,wilkinson stands for the proposition that when a state appellate court elects to summarily affirm the judgment below without having invited the appellant to identify the issues he wishes to pursue on appeal,we will construe the affirmance to have reached the merits of each issue that the petitioner properly raised in the court below.
id.at emphasis added.
simply put,the holding in wilkinson can not be divorced from its unique facts.and it certainly did not create a categorical rule that a decision is whenever an appellate court grants a finley motion and summarily affirms the trial court denial of a petition.such a blanket holding would,in fact,impermissibly restrain how state appellate courts may dispose of cases and motions to withdraw we have no power to tell state courts how they must write their opinions.coleman,at.and to prescribe such a categorical rule in these instances would rob the state courts of their autonomy.id.w e will not impose on state courts the responsibility for using particular language in every case.accord id.a broad presumption would also put too great a burden on the state courts.therefore,we reject woods argument that our cases stand for the proposition that any time the appellate court grants an attorney motion to withdraw and summarily affirms the denial of his petition it is a decision on the merits of his federal claims 
in cases such as this one,where on the face of the order it is unclear on what basis the state court disposed of a claim,we must make a determination on the record that the state court was presented with.id.specifically,we look to the nature of the disposition and the surrounding circumstances to determine whether the state court relied on an independent and adequate state law ground in disposing of the claim,or whether the state court decision fairly appears to rest on federal grounds or is interwoven with federal law.willis aiken,cir.here,our review of the record includes the motion to withdraw filed by woods appointed counsel during the appeal of his third petition.williams washington,cir looking to state court briefs to determine the basis of the appellate court holding.
the orders denying woods third petition are unclear.there are two trial court orders disposing of woods petition.one is a transcript that briefly addresses the fact that most of woods claims criticize trial tactics and should have been raised earlier it also notes that woods allegations are unsupported by anything more than his blanket bites of disapproval.the other is a mere minute order.neither states a basis for the holding or provides any reasoning they simply conclude that the petition is dismissed as frivolous and without merit.the appellate court order offers little more it briefly recounts the procedural history of woods case and states that the motion to withdraw is granted and the trial court is affirmed.these orders do not give us much to go on.but read in conjunction with all of the surrounding circumstances of woods claims,they indicate that the resolution of woods third petition neither rested primarily on federal law nor was it interwoven with federal law.coleman,at.harris reed,d.rather,the appellate court summarily applied the doctrine of waiver to dispose of woods claims.
under illinois law,a ny claim of substantial denial of constitutional rights not raised in the original or an amended petition is waived.ilcs see also people anderson,d,i n the context of a successive postconviction petition,the rule of waiver is not merely a principle of judicial administration,but,rather,an express requirement of the statute.here,the appellate court dismissed woods second petition on waiver grounds and noted that he could not escape the procedural bar by establishing cau
