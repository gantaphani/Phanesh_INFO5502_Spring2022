section d of title provides that a n application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.this standard,we recently reminded the sixth circuit,is difficult to meet.metrish lancaster,slip,at.c learly established federal law for purposes of d includes only the holdings,as opposed to the dicta,of this court decisions.howes fields,slip,at quoting williams taylor.and an unreasonable application of those holdings must be objectively,not merely wrong even clear error will not suffice.lockyer andrade.rather,a s a condition for obtaining habeas corpus from a federal court,a state prisoner must show that the state court ruling on the claim being presented in federal court was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.harrington richter,slip,at.
both the kentucky supreme court and the court of appeals identified as the relevant precedents in this area our decisions in carter,estelle smith,and mitchell united states.carter held that a instruction is required at the guilt phase,at.estelle concerned the introduction at the penalty phase of the results of an involuntary,pretrial psychiatric examination,at,and,at.and mitchell disapproved a trial judge drawing of an adverse inference from the defendant silence at sentencing with regard to factual determinations respecting the circumstances and details of the crime.at.
it is clear that the kentucky supreme court conclusion is not contrary to the actual holding of any of these cases.d.the court of appeals held,however,that the kentucky supreme court denial of this constitutional claim was an unreasonable application of those cases,at.in its view,reading carter,estelle,and mitchell together,the only reasonable conclusion is that a instruction was required at the penalty phase.ibid 
we need not decide here,and express no view on,whether the conclusion that a instruction was required would be correct in a case not reviewed through the lens of d.for we are satisfied that the issue was,at a minimum,not beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.harrington,supra,at slip,at.
we have,it is true,held that the privilege against applies to the penalty phase.see estelle,supra,at mitchell,supra,at.but it is not uncommon for a constitutional rule to apply somewhat differently at the penalty phase than it does at the guilt phase.see,bobby mitts,per curiam slip,at.we have never directly held that carter applies at a sentencing phase where the fifth amendment interests of the defendant are different.united states whitten,livingston,dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc.
indeed,mitchell itself leaves open the possibility that some inferences might permissibly be drawn from a defendant silence.in that case,the district judge had actually drawn from the defendant silence an adverse inference about the drug quantity attributable to the defendant.see,at.we held that this ran afoul of the defendant right to remain silent at sentencing.at,citing griffin california.but we framed our holding narrowly,in terms implying that it was limited to inferences pertaining to the facts of the crime we decline to adopt an exception for the sentencing phase of a case with regard to factual determinations respecting the circumstances and details of the crime.mitchell,at emphasis added.the government retains,we said,the burden of proving facts relevant to the crime and can not enlist the defendant in this process at the expense of the privilege.at emphasis added.and mitchell included an express reservation of direct relevance here whether silence bears upon the determination of a lack of remorse,or upon acceptance of responsibility for purposes of the downward adjustment provided in of the united states sentencing guidelines,is a separate question.it is not before us,and we express no view on it.ibid 
mitchell reservation is relevant here for two reasons.first,if mitchell suggests that some actual inferences might be permissible at the penalty phase,it certainly can not be read to require a blanket instruction at every trial.and it was a blanket instruction that was requested and denied in this case respondent requested instruction would have informed the jury that a defendant is not compelled to testify and the fact that the defendant did not testify should not prejudice him in any way.app.emphasis added.counsel for respondent conceded at oral argument that remorse was at issue during the trial,see tr.of oral arg.see also brief for respondent,yet the proposed instruction would have precluded the jury from considering respondent silence as indicative of his lack of remorse.indeed,the trial judge declined to give the instruction precisely because he was aware of no case law that precludes the jury from considering the defendant lack of expression of remorse in sentencing.app.this alone suffices to establish that the kentucky supreme court conclusion was not objectively unreasonable.andrade,at.
second,regardless of the scope of respondent proposed instruction,any inferences that could have been drawn from respondent silence would arguably fall within the class of inferences as to which mitchell leaves the door open.respondent pleaded guilty to all of the charges he faced,including the applicable aggravating circumstances.thus,kentucky could not have shifted to respondent its burden of proving facts relevant to the crime,at respondent own admissions had already established every relevant fact on which kentucky bore the burden of proof.there are reasonable arguments that the logic of mitchell does not apply to such cases.see,united states ronquillo,mitchell is inapplicable to the sentencing decision in this case because the facts of the offense were based entirely on ronquillo admissions,not on any adverse inference.ronquillo,unlike the defendant in mitchell,admitted all the predicate facts of his offenses 
the dissent insists that mitchell is irrelevant because it merely declined to create an exception to the normal rule,supposedly established by estelle,that a defendant is entitled to a requested instruction at sentencing.post,at opinion of breyer.that argument disregards perfectly reasonable interpretations of estelle and mitchell and hence contravenes d deferential standard of review.estelle did not involve an adverse inference based on the defendant silence or a corresponding jury instruction.see,at.thus,whatever estelle said about the fifth amendment,its the only aspect of the decision relevant here does not requir e the categorical rule the dissent ascribes to it.carey musladin.likewise,fairminded jurists could conclude that mitchell reservation regarding remorse and acceptance of responsibility would have served no meaningful purpose if estelle had created an rule against adverse inferences we are,after all,hardly in the habit of reserving separate question s,mitchell,supra,at,that have already been definitively answered.in these circumstances,where the precise contours of the right remain unclear,state courts enjoy broad discretion in their adjudication of a prisoner claims.lockyer,at quoting harmelin michigan,kennedy,concurring in part and in judgment.
in arguing for a contrary result,respondent leans heavily on the notion that a determination may be set aside if,under clearly established federal law,the state court was unreasonable in refusing to extend the governing legal principle to a context in which the principle should have controlled.brief for respondent quoting ramdass angelone,plurality opinion.the court of appeals and district court relied on the same proposition in sustaining respondent fifth amendment claim.see,at app.to pet.for cert,wl.
the concept originated in a fourth circuit opinion we discussed at length in williams,our first analysis of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa.see,at citing green french.we described the fourth circuit interpretation of d unreasonable application clause as generally correct,at,and approved its conclusion that a decision involves an unreasonable application of this court precedent if the state court identifies the correct governing legal rule but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular state prisoner case,at citing green,supra,at.but we took no position on the fourth circuit further conclusion that a state court commits aedpa error if it unreasonably refuse s to extend a legal principle to a new context where it should apply.at citing green,supra,at.we chose not to decide how such extension of legal principle cases should be treated under d because the fourth circuit proposed rule for resolving them presented several problems of precision.at.
two months later,a plurality paraphrased and applied the concept in ramdass.see,at.it did not,however,grant the habeas petitioner relief on that basis,finding that there was no unreasonable refusal to extend.moreover,justice,whose vote was necessary to form a majority,cited williams and made no mention of the concept in her separate opinion concurring in the judgment.see,at.ramdass therefore did not alter the interpretation of d set forth in williams.aside from one opinion criticizing the doctrine,see yarborough alvarado,we have not revisited the issue since williams and ramdass.during that same stretch,however,we have repeatedly restated our hold ing in williams,supra,at,that a decision is an unreasonable application of our clearly established precedent if it correctly identifies the governing legal rule but applies that rule unreasonably to the facts of a particular prisoner case,see,cullen pinholster,slip,at rompilla beard,yarborough,supra,at penry johnson.
thus,this court has never adopted the rule on which respondent relies.it has not been so much as endorsed in a majority opinion,let alone relied on as a basis for granting habeas relief.to the extent the rule differs from the one embraced in williams and reiterated many times since,we reject it.section d provides a remedy for instances in which a state court unreasonably applies this court precedent it does not require state courts to extend that precedent or license federal courts to treat the failure to do so as error.see scheidegger,corpus,relitigation,and the legislative power,colum.thus,if a habeas court must extend a rationale before it can apply to the facts at hand,then by definition the rationale was not clearly established at the time of the decision.yarborough,at.aedpa carefully constructed framework would be undermined if habeas courts introduced rules not clearly established under the guise of extensions to existing law.ibid.
this is not to say that d requires an identical factual pattern before a legal rule must be applied.panetti quarterman.to the contrary,state courts must reasonably apply the rules squarely established by this court holdings to the facts of each case.knowles mirzayance.t he difference between applying a rule and extending it is not always clear,but c ertain principles are fundamental enough that when new factual permutations arise,the necessity to apply the earlier rule will be beyond doubt.yarborough,supra,at.the critical point is that relief is available under d clause if,and only if,it is so obvious that a clearly established rule applies to a given set of facts that there could be no fairminded disagreement on the question,harrington,at slip,at.
perhaps the logical next step from carter,estelle,and mitchell would be to hold that the fifth amendment requires a instruction in a case like this one perhaps not.either way,we have not yet taken that step,and there are reasonable arguments on both sides which is all kentucky needs to prevail in this aedpa case.the appropriate time to consider the question as a matter of first impression would be on direct review,not in a habeas case governed by d.
because the kentucky supreme court rejection of respondent fifth amendment claim was not objectively unreasonable,the sixth circuit erred in granting the writ.we therefore need not reach its further holding that the trial court putative error was not harmless.the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.
breyer,dissenting 
randy white,warden,petitioner robert keith woodall 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit 
justice breyer,with whom justice ginsburg and justice sotomayor join,dissenting.
during the penalty phase of his capital murder trial,respondent robert woodall asked the court to instruct the jury not to draw any adverse inferences from his failure to testify.the court refused,and the kentucky supreme court agreed that no instruction was warranted.the question before us is whether the kentucky courts unreasonably applied clearly established supreme court law in concluding that the fifth amendment did not entitle woodall to a instruction.see d.in my view,the answer is yes.
this court decisions in carter kentucky,and estelle smith,clearly establish that a criminal defendant is entitled to a requested instruction in the penalty phase of a capital trial.first consider carter.the court held that a trial judge has the constitutional obligation,upon proper request,to give a requested instruction in order to minimize the danger that the jury will give evidentiary weight to a defendant failure to testify.at.this is because when the jury is left to roam at large with only its untutored instincts to guide it,it may draw from the defendant silence broad inferences of guilt.at.a trial court refusal to give a requested instruction thus exacts an impermissible toll on the full and free exercise of the fifth amendment privilege.at.
now consider estelle.the court held that so far as the protection of the fifth amendment privilege is concerned,it could discern no basis to distinguish between the guilt and penalty phases of a defendant capital murder trial.at.the state had introduced at the penalty phase the defendant compelled statements to a psychiatrist,in order to show the defendant future dangerousness.defending the admission of those statements,the state argued that the defendant was not entitled to the protection of the fifth amendment because his statements were used only to determine punishment after conviction,not to establish guilt.at.this court rejected the state argument on the ground that the fifth amendment applies equally to the penalty phase and the guilt phase of a capital trial,at.
what is unclear about the resulting law if the court holds in case a that the first amendment prohibits congress from discriminating based on viewpoint,and then holds in case b that the fourteenth amendment incorporates the first amendment as to the states,then it is clear that the first amendment prohibits the states from discriminating based on viewpoint.by the same logic,because the court held in carter that the fifth amendment requires a trial judge to give a requested instruction during the guilt phase of a trial,and held in estelle that there is no basis for distinguishing between the guilt and punishment phases of a capital trial for purposes of the fifth amendment,it is clear that the fifth amendment requires a judge to provide a requested instruction during the penalty phase of a capital trial.
the court avoids this logic by reading estelle too narrowly.first,it contends that estelle holding that the fifth amendment applies equally to the guilt and penalty phases was mere dictum.ante,at,and.but this rule was essential to the resolution of the case,so it is binding precedent,not dictum.
second,apparently in the alternative,the majority acknowledges that estelle held that the privilege against applies to the penalty phase,but it concludes that estelle said nothing about the content of the privilege in the penalty phase.ante,at emphasis added.this interpretation of estelle ignores its rationale.the reason that estelle concluded that the fifth amendment applies to the penalty phase of a capital trial is that the court saw no basis to distinguish between the guilt and penalty phases of a defendant capital murder trial so far as the protection of the fifth amendment privilege is concerned.at.and as there is no basis to distinguish between the two contexts for fifth amendment purposes,there is no basis for varying either the application or the content of the fifth amendment privilege in the two contexts.
the majority also reads our decision in mitchell united states,to change the legal landscape where it expressly declined to do so.in mitchell,the court considered whether to create an exception to the normal rule in a criminal case that no negative inference from the defendant failure to testify is permitted.at.we refused we decline to adopt an exception for the sentencing phase of a criminal case with regard to factual determinations r
