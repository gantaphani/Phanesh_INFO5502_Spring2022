opinion of the court 
federal judges reviewing habeas corpus matters often face a difficult assignment.frequently,the state court records presented are in disarray or incomplete,the defendant was unrepresented or inadequately represented in the state proceedings,and the deference to be accorded is unclear,as it may depend on whether the state court decision was based on a finding of fact or conclusion of law.in the appeal before us,the district court undertook a meticulous examination of the record and the applicable legal principles,but our decision hinges on the characterization of the state court on which the parties vigorously disagree.
richard washington was arrested on december,and thereafter charged in state court on numerous counts in connection with the kidnapping of asha woodall,his girlfriend,and the murder of anthony carney,who washington believed was having a relationship with woodall.washington sobina,d.on december,after the first trial ended in a mistrial,the second jury found washington guilty of criminal conspiracy,possession of an instrument of crime,and robbery of a motor vehicle.the jury also acquitted him of some charges,including first degree murder,and was unable to reach a verdict on the counts charging the lesser degrees of murder and kidnapping on february,washington was sentenced to five to ten years imprisonment on the three charges for which he was convicted.
on february,washington,acting pro se,filed a motion contesting his sentence without notifying his attorney that he had done so.on march,washington attorney presented a notice of appeal from the judgment of sentence,which was stamped by the clerk office as received accepted for review only mar criminal appeals unit first judicial district of app.at.there is no docket entry for a notice of appeal.on march,washington attorney was ordered by the trial judge to file of record,a concise statement of matters complained of on the appeal.at.the letter from the judge stated that u pon receipt of your reply to this order,i will write my opinion forthwith.at.
on april,the trial court denied washington motion.on april,the trial court issued an order setting forth a procedural history of washington filings,which included,inter alia,the following.on,defendant was sentenced on the partial verdict of.on,appeal to pennsylvania superior court accepted for review only.at.
washington filed a habeas corpus petition in the superior court of pennsylvania on november,which the court denied on january,citing to municipal publications court of common pleas,stating that the supreme court of pennsylvania has original jurisdiction to issue a writ on the lower court where no appeal is pending.washington,d at emphasis added.washington filed a federal habeas corpus petition on february,which was summarily dismissed for because of the pendency of the state habeas petition.washington filed another state habeas corpus petition in the pennsylvania supreme court on march,which was dismissed on june.on september,washington filed his second federal habeas corpus petition,which alleged that his sixth amendment right to a speedy trial and his due process right to a speedy appeal had been denied.it is this petition that is the basis of this appeal the district court appointed counsel for washington.
while the federal habeas petition was pending,washington,on august,again acting pro se,filed a review petition in state court,pursuant to the pennsylvania post conviction relief act pcra,alleging that his right to appeal had been denied.the pcra court dismissed washington pcra petition on june.in an opinion filed august,the pcra judge who was also the trial judge set forth the basis for the june,order.see app.the court reviewed the procedural history,noting that the commonwealth had not filed an appeal from the order dismissing the first degree murder charge,and stated that t he case was delayed multiple times because of scheduling issues and because an appeal was filed with respect to defendant robbery of motor vehicle conviction.the appeal was ultimately withdrawn.app.at.the pcra court then listed the procedural events from december,until february,ending with the hung jury and the case being continued for status listing on february.the court continued with its review of the proceedings,stating that on june,it allowed washington to proceed pro se with his pcra claims at his request.the court then stated o n june,this court dismissed d efendant pcra claims for relief as untimely.app.at.
in the next section of the opinion of the pcra court,under the heading legal issue,the court again discussed the prior proceedings.the court stated 
defendant was convicted of the charges relevant to his pcra petition on december,and sentenced on february.defendant motions were denied on april.defendant then had days in which to file an appeal.a.defendant failed to do so.therefore,the judgment in his case became final days after april.see commonwealth smith.b.
app.at emphasis added.the court continued 
defendant had one year from days after april,to file a pcra petition.b.defendant did not file his pcra petition until august,more than two years after the judgment in his case became final relative to the instant charges.therefore,in order for defendant pcra petition to be timely,defendant would have to allege one of the three timeliness exceptions in.b i iii 
the pcra court noted that washington did not allege any of the timeliness exceptions but stated that he raised by implication a claim of government interference that the trial court had effectively denied his right to appeal or bring a timely pcra petition by imposing sentence on him while other charges against him were still pending.the pcra court concluded that the claim was without merit.because pennsylvania had no rule on point,the court considered cases from other jurisdictions that permitted appeals on less than all counts of a criminal indictment even while other counts were still pending.it referred to,inter alia,united states abrams,cir noting majority approach permitting appeal from conviction and sentence on less than all counts of an indictment when other counts tried in same trial remained unresolved,and united states kaufmann,cir s everal circuits have entertained an appeal on one count of a criminal indictment while other counts of the indictment were unresolved.citing united states cicco,cir.
relying on these cases,the pcra court rejected washington argument that the trial court could not have sentenced him on some of the charges on which he was convicted while others were still pending.it stated that washington can not now claim that his failure to properly prosecute an appeal constitutes government interference based upon unlikely speculation that pennsylvania would adopt the limited minority approach of barring appeals until all charges in an indictment receive final judgment.app.at.the pcra court concluded that washington failed to bring his pcra petition within the statutory time frame and dismissed the petition as untimely.app.at.
meanwhile,the matter was proceeding in federal court.after the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation r r,recommending rejection of some of washington claims but acceptance of his claim that his speedy appeal right was violated,both the commonwealth and washington filed objections.undoubtedly the pcra court august,opinion left the district court in a difficult position as to whether washington had failed to file or had withdrawn his appeal.according to the district court listing of the sequential events,there was what is termed on the docket an evidentiary hearing on january,at which the court determined,after consultation with the parties,that another evidentiary hearing would be necessary.instead of waiting for the superior court decision on washington appeal of the denial of his pcra petition,as the commonwealth requested,see app,the district court proceeded to conduct an evidentiary hearing on may,at which only washington testified.
a review of the testimony at that hearing shows that it was focused on washington speedy trial claim,as the only references to the appeal were washington statements that he was trying to get to trial on the still pending charges so that he could pursue an appeal on the charges for which he was convicted.see app.at.at the conclusion of the hearing on may,the district court granted the parties permission to file two additional affidavits.pursuant to that order,washington filed the affidavit of his trial counsel,charles mirarchi,iii,who stated that o n march,i filed a notice of appeal based on judge poserina february.that notice has never been dismissed.i was told by the court that an appeal on a partial verdict could not be prosecuted.at.
thereafter,on september,again without waiting for the superior court decision,the district court issued its opinion on washington request for a writ of habeas corpus.see washington,d at.the court agreed with the conclusion of the magistrate judge that washington had exhausted his claim and that washington right to a speedy trial had not been violated.id.at.the court then turned to washington claim that his right to a speedy appeal had been violated.the district court rejected the government argument that washington had,in fact,never filed an effective notice of appeal and therefore no appeal was currently pending.id.at.the court noted that the government thereafter argued that the appeal was withdrawn and concluded that the government has apparently abandoned the argument in its objection that the appeal was not effectively filed,id.at,but proceeded to consider the argument in any event.the district court stated that t he state court record indicates that the court accepted washington notice of appeal,rejected the government contention that the state court could not possibly have accepted washington appeal because his motion was pending,and instead stated it is equally likely that the court did not consider washington pro se motion to be pending because washington did not have the authority to file pro se motions while represented by counsel.id.at.the district court then rejected the government contention that the speedy appeal claim was invalid because washington failed to properly file a notice of appeal.the court also rejected the government argument that the notice of appeal had been withdrawn because the district court found by clear and convincing evidence that the appeal was not withdrawn.id.at.the court then conditionally granted washington petition for writ of habeas corpus based on failure of his speedy appeal right unless the pennsylvania superior court decides washington direct appeal by march.id.at.that is the order the commonwealth appeals to this court 
significantly,however,after the district court issued its opinion,the pennsylvania superior court on december,decided the appeal pending before it from the pcra court order dated june,dismissing washington pcra petition as untimely filed.the superior court,although displaying some impatience with the pcra court in some respects nevertheless agreed with the pcra court that washington pcra petition was untimely filed.although it never mentioned the pcra court statement that the appeal was withdrawn,in its review of the tortured procedural history of this case it reiterated that pursuant to the pennsylvania pcra statute,any pcra petition must be filed within one year of the date the judgment becomes final.app.at.the superior court stated that washington judgment of sentence became final on may,when the time period allowed for filing a direct appeal expired,that a timely petition had to be filed by may,and that washington petition would appear to be untimely,as it was not filed until july.app.at.the court concluded that none of the statutory exceptions were applicable,and as washington fails to successfully invoke any of the time of filing exceptions contained in the act,the petition remains untimely filed.app.at.accordingly,the superior court affirmed the order of the pcra court dismissing washington pcra petition as untimely filed.
although washington filed his federal habeas petition under,and the district court exercised jurisdiction over his petition under a,he now claims that he should have filed his habeas petition under which would relieve him from the heightened standards prescribed by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa.we reject that claim for the reasons set forth in the margin we have jurisdiction over the district court final order pursuant to and.we have plenary review over the district court grant of habeas corpus and review its factual findings for clear error.rolan vaughn,cir.
section e of aedpa provides in a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court,a determination of a factual issue made by a state court shall be presumed to be correct.the applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.e.
the touchstone of aedpa is the requirement that federal habeas courts should accord deference to the factual determinations of the state courts.both the pcra court and the pennsylvania superior court found that washington failed to file his pcra petition alleging denial of his appeal rights in accordance with the time requirements of.ann.b.that statute requires a petitioner to file a pcra petition within one year of the date the judgment becomes final,unless one of three statutory exceptions applies the state courts found that none of the statutory exceptions applied,and the district court did not hold otherwise.
we turn from washington failure to file a timely pcra petition to the central question before us,whether washington filed a timely notice of appeal for his purported direct appeal.it is uncontested that washington attorney handed a notice of appeal to a member of the clerk office on march,but there is no reference to any notice of appeal on the state court docket.based on its holding that no appeal was pending,the pcra court dismissed washington pcra petition as untimely.the commonwealth argues that this determination must be given deference by the federal habeas court.
the district court declined to do so,and did not follow the commonwealth request to await the outcome of the pending appeal to the superior court of the pcra court decision.instead,the district court rejected the commonwealth request that it stay the habeas proceeding to allow the superior court to decide washington appeal of the pcra court decision b ecause washington appeal is still pending and therefore his judgment has never become final for purposes of a pcra petition.washington,d at.
this is troubling for several reasons.in the first place,the district court conclusion that the state court lacks authority to decide washington pcra petition,runs counter to its own discussion of the pcra court decision.if the district court was saying that the pcra court had no jurisdiction because washington direct appeal was still outstanding,there was no reason for the district court to have considered the pcra court opinion at all.yet it did so at some length.if the district court was saying that the superior court would have no jurisdiction over the appeal from the pcra court decision,the district court was overlooking the possibility that the superior court would have disagreed with the pcra court decision.we have made clear that in the event of a conflict between the fact findings of the state trial court and the state appellate court,deference should be given to the version reached by the higher court.dickerson vaughn,cir.
for purposes of comity,it would have been better practice for the district court to have stayed the proceedings to allow the pennsylvania superior court to decide washington appeal of the pcra decision.although doing so was not necessary under the exhaustion doctrine,a federal district court should give careful consideration to the appropriate demands of comity in effectuating its habeas corpus decree.gibbs frank,cir citation omitted.because important interests in comity and federalism require deference to factual determinations made by all state courts,rolan,at citation omitted,considerations of comity would have been best served if the distric
