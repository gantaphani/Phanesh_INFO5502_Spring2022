joe lee guy appeals the district court denial of his application and grant of the government motion for summary judgment.we granted a certificate of appealability on whether guy received ineffective assistance of counsel under strickland washington,d as a result of his legal team investigator alleged conflict of interest arising from his relationship with french howell,the murder victim mother.in other words,we must determine whether failure to investigate thoroughly guy mitigation evidence resulted from this alleged conflict.see wiggins smith,d.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the record is insufficient to make such a determination.thus we reverse and remand to the district court for an evidentiary hearing.
factual and procedural background 
in early,joe lee guy guy was approached by thomas howard howard and richard springer springer with a plan to rob the howell grocery store that was owned and operated by larry howell larry and his elderly mother,french howell french.the plan included murdering larry,french,and any other potential witnesses.guy agreed to assist in the robbery.on march,howard and springer entered the store wearing ski masks while guy kept watch outside the front door.as planned,after hearing gun shots,guy entered the store to help retrieve money out of the cash register,but when he attempted to do so,the cash register would not open.springer grabbed the register and carried it outside.it was found across the street from the store with approximately ten thousand dollars inside of it.french survived the shooting and called.when the police arrived,larry was lying on the once in the forehead and four times in the chest and back.larry died shortly after arriving at the hospital.although french survived she could not identify her assailants.
guy,howard,and springer were later apprehended and charged with the murder of larry in the course of a robbery.each defendant was tried separately with guy being first.richard wardroup wardroup was appointed to serve as guy trial counsel.he chose not to seek,but requested that frank sorelle sorelle,an investigator with no capital case experience,be appointed to assist him in preparing for trial.wardroup gave sorelle the responsibility of investigating the facts of the case,including interviewing potential mitigation witnesses.sorelle also drafted motions,communicated with opposing counsel,and communicated with the trial court on behalf of wardroup.at trial,the government produced an who testified that he saw guy standing outside of the store at the time of the robbery.another witness testified that she sold ski masks to guy,howard and springer two days before the robbery.the government also presented evidence establishing that guy fingerprints were on the cash register found across the street from the store.the jury found guy guilty of capital murder.
during the penalty phase of trial,wardroup presented four lay witnesses.none of these individuals knew guy well,nor were they close friends or relatives.these witnesses gave vague and confusing testimony that failed to present guy as a decent human being.nevertheless,some of guy relatives and close friends were available to testify on his behalf during the penalty phase of trial,including his mother and aunt,but were not asked to do so.in contrast,the state presented sixteen officials,including a judge,who testified without explanation that guy was bad despite that guy has no history of violent behavior.during the trial,sorelle developed a conflicting relationship with french,the victim mother,and he was ultimately named the sole beneficiary of her estate only six months after guy trial.french died seven months later in april.
in april,guy was convicted for the offense of murdering larry during the course of a robbery.even though guy was by far the least culpable of the three defendants,he was the only defendant sentenced to death.the court of criminal appeals affirmed guy conviction and sentence,and guy did not seek certiorari review.the trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing on guy state habeas petition,issuing findings of fact and conclusions of law including that t rial counsel for joe lee guy was not ineffective.the texas court of criminal appeals adopted the trial court findings and conclusions and denied guy petition for habeas relief on january.
on june,guy filed a federal habeas petition in the northern district of texas.although the texas state courts were not presented with the specific issues presented in guy federal habeas petition,the government expressly waived any defense based on the failure to exhaust state remedies.the district court granted guy motion for discovery,which included requests for the issuance of subpoenas for wardroup and sorelle to attend and testify at a hearing scheduled on guy habeas petition.on october,the government filed a motion for summary judgment.
the district court scheduled an evidentiary hearing for november.during the hearing,guy did not call wardroup or sorelle to testify,nor did he present any live testimony.instead,guy chose to rely on the documentary evidence attached to his habeas petition including,depositions,affidavits,and certain files and records submitted to the district court for in camera inspection.as part of its supporting evidence,the government attached counter affidavits and depositions to its motion for summary judgment.no live testimony was presented by the government.as a result,on november,the district court had before it,among other documents,four affidavits from sorelle containing conflicting testimony about whether his relationship with french prejudiced his work on guy defense,and two depositions from wardroup.the district court also had before it an affidavit from the hold out juror who explained that he may have voted against the death penalty had he heard more about guy background.guy also provided affidavits from members of his family,including his mother and aunt,explaining that they would have testified about guy background had the defense team asked.after hearing the attorney arguments and considering the paper record,the district court denied guy petition for habeas relief,granted the government motion for summary judgment,and later denied a certificate of appealability coa.on july,this court granted a coa on guy ineffective assistance of counsel claim 
discussion 
typically,when reviewing a denial of a petition for habeas corpus this court reviews the district court factual findings for clear error and its disposition of pure legal issues and mixed issues of law and fact de novo.haley cockrell,cir.when reviewing a motion for summary judgment,this court reviews a district court factual and legal conclusions de novo to determine whether there are genuine issues of material fact.see leasehold expense recovery,mothers work,cir see also.c.this case,however,comes to us in an atypical procedural posture.in the same opinion and order,the district court denied guy petition for habeas relief which ordinarily requires a clear error review of the factual determinations and simultaneously granted the government motion for summary judgment which ordinarily requires de novo review.
in the present case,the district court heard no live testimony,but rather heard arguments and reviewed affidavits,depositions,and other related documents.moreover,as guy ineffective assistance claim based on sorelle conflict was not before the state habeas court,and as the government waived its exhaustion of state remedies defense in this case,there is no state court record nor are there factual determinations subject to substantial deferential review consistent with d.given these circumstances,it appears that the district court reviewed summary judgment type evidence,and therefore,made a summary judgment determination.thus,we will review the district court factual and legal conclusions de novo,reviewing the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits to determine whether there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
