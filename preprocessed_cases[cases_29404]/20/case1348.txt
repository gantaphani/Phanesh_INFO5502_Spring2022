charles walton wright,sentenced to death for committing two murders,appeals from a district court judgment denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.the following issues have been certified for appellate review whether the trial court admission of a medical examiner testimony speculating about the sequence in which the two victims were killed denied wright a fundamentally fair trial whether trial counsel provided effective assistance at trial and sentencing whether the prosecution offered wright a life sentence in exchange for a guilty plea and,if so,did such an offer constitute relevant mitigating evidence and whether certain of the claims raised in wright amended habeas petition were procedurally defaulted.because each of these issues was correctly resolved in the warden favor,the district court properly denied wright habeas relief.
a tennessee jury convicted wright of two counts of premeditated murder in the first degree for the shooting deaths of douglas alexander and gerald mitchell.wright received a life sentence for the killing of mitchell,but was sentenced to death for alexander murder.in an opinion affirming wright sentence on direct appeal,the supreme court of tennessee described the facts as follows 
testimony in the case was both protracted and conflicting.appellant himself gave numerous conflicting and convoluted versions of the events which led to the homicides in the afternoon of july,in a public park in davidson county,tennessee.appellant and both victims were residents at that time of murfreesboro,in rutherford county,tennessee,although appellant had in the past resided in nashville.appellant and the victim mitchell were,by appellant own admission,involved in trafficking in illegal narcotics.alexander may also have been involved.their involvement was such that police officials in murfreesboro had prepared a search warrant to search the residence of appellant for possession and sale of marijuana,but the warrant was never actually issued or served because of the homicides.
it appears without question that all three men came to nashville in the afternoon of july,for the purpose of purchasing contraband narcotics with the intent to traffic therein.
at the trial,appellant admitted shooting and killing mitchell and leaving the bodies of both mitchell and alexander in the public park.it was his contention that mitchell had previously shot alexander.the jury obviously concluded otherwise.
the homicides occurred in the late afternoon,probably around several persons in the park heard three shots.when the bodies were found,alexander had been shot twice.one bullet penetrated his forearm,apparently a defensive wound,and then penetrated his face,entering at the corner of his mouth on the right side and being found lodged in the left cheek.this shot apparently did not cause death and would not necessarily have been fatal.the second shot was in the left rear portion of his skull.according to the only medical expert who testified,this shot would have produced unconsciousness instantly and death within a short time.
mitchell was shot once,below the left ear.the medical expert testified that this shot would have produced unconsciousness immediately and death within a few minutes.the body of mitchell was found face down on the top of a knoll in the park.the body of alexander was some to feet away,downhill,and near the top of a flight of steps leading to the knoll from a small parking area below.
a vehicle later identified as that belonging to alexander was observed being driven by a single occupant away from the park.the next day the car was found in murfreesboro,and appellant admitted that he drove the vehicle from the park in nashville to a park in murfreesboro where he abandoned it.appellant admitted borrowing a pistol from one jessie king in murfreesboro.ballistics showed that this was the weapon from which the fatal shots were fired.appellant admitted being in possession of the pistol after the homicide and returning it to king.it was his contention,however,that prior to the homicide he had let mitchell borrow the pistol.he said that mitchell shot alexander,and appellant then retrieved the pistol from mitchell and shot the latter.
appellant denied any involvement in the homicide for several days and gave highly misleading and false information to many witnesses who testified,as well as to investigating police officials.the numerous discrepancies in the various versions which he gave of the events of july were explored in depth at the trial,including introduction at the instance of his own counsel of a lengthy and admittedly false statement given to the police.
it is not necessary here to review the convoluted and often confusing testimony.essentially,appellant insisted that the three men had come to nashville to purchase drugs and to sell them later in murfreesboro.he admitted his own rather extensive involvement in illicit narcotics.appellant said,however,that mitchell knew the contact in nashville from whom the marijuana was to be purchased.he testified that he did not accompany alexander and mitchell in making the purchase,although both he and mitchell supplied substantial funds for the purchase.he remained where they let him out of the car.he said that when alexander and mitchell returned to pick him up in alexander automobile,they were quarreling.he testified that the drug transaction was only partly completed,and the parties were going to have to wait for about an hour to obtain the rest of the marijuana.appellant testified that he suggested that they go to the park,which is located not far from the residence of appellant mother,and that they proceed to bag such marijuana as had already been obtained.he said that mitchell and alexander went to the top of the knoll while he stayed in the car,that he heard two shots and then ran up the steps.there he found that alexander had been shot by mitchell.he took the pistol from mitchell,struck the latter with his fist,and then shot him behind the ear.
it is clear that the jurors were not bound to accept this testimony,which was given at trial but which was markedly different from the numerous previous accounts which had been given by appellant.there was abundant testimony from which the jury could have found,as it did,that appellant committed both murders.the jury acquitted appellant of counts of murder committed in the perpetration of robbery in connection with each homicide,but it found that each homicide was premeditated murder in the first degree.
in the numerous issues presented on appeal by counsel for appellant,the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the verdicts at the guilt hearing is not questioned and need not be further discussed in detail.
at the sentencing hearing the state announced that it would not seek the death penalty in the homicide of mitchell.it was the theory of the state that mitchell and appellant had had a quarrel over previous drug transactions.there was hearsay testimony,not objected to,that some children in the park had heard quarreling taking place just before the shots were fired in the present case.it was one theory of the state that appellant shot mitchell as a result of this quarrel and then shot alexander to eliminate him as a witness or to prevent appellant apprehension and arrest.the other theory of the state was that the two homicides were intimately connected and that,regardless of the order in which they occurred,the second was committed while appellant was in the course of committing,attempting to commit or escaping from the first homicide.
only two aggravating circumstances were relied upon by the state in its notice that the death penalty would be sought.at the sentencing hearing the trial judge submitted both circumstances to the jury,the two provisions being i,to the effect that the murder was committed for the purpose of avoiding,interfering with,or preventing a lawful arrest or prosecution of the accused or of another,and i,to the effect that the homicide was committed while the accused was engaged in committing,attempting to commit,or fleeing after committing another first degree murder.
the jury did not find the evidence sufficient to sustain the first of the foregoing statutory provisions but did find that the second was supported by the evidence.it found no mitigating circumstances sufficient to outweigh this aggravating circumstance and recommended the death penalty.the trial judge concurred in the conclusion of the jury.
state wright wright i.
after the supreme court of tennessee affirmed wright conviction and sentence on direct appeal,wright filed several petitions for relief in the tennessee state courts.in may of,wright,without the assistance of counsel,filed his first petition for relief.in september of that year,wright filed an amended petition the petition,this time with the assistance of counsel.the trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing,but denied the petition.the tennessee court of criminal appeals affirmed the trial court decision.wright.state wright ii,wl,at.the supreme court of tennessee denied wright application for permission to appeal in september of.in august of,while the petition was still pending,wright,acting pro se,filed a second petition for relief the petition.the trial court denied the motion as redundant and unnecessary,and wright did not appeal that decision.
in january of,wright,once again assisted by counsel,moved to vacate the order dismissing the petition and also filed a third petition for relief in the state trial court the petition.the trial court denied both the petition and the motion to vacate the order dismissing the petition.on appeal,the tennessee court of criminal appeals affirmed both aspects of the trial court decision.wright state wright iii,wl,at.the tennessee supreme court granted review to determine whether wright due process rights were violated when the lower courts applied the statute of limitations to a brady claim not relevant to the instant appeal,but held that the state interest in preserving final judgments outweighed wright interest in litigating the claim.wright state wright iv.
in october of,wright filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court.the district court appointed counsel,and wright filed an amended petition in june of.the state moved for summary judgment,which the district court denied in part and granted in part.the court addressed eleven claims from wright original petition for relief and concluded that each claim lacked merit.memorandum of february,at.the court determined that any error in the admission of testimony from medical examiner who speculated at the sentencing phase of the trial that mitchell was shot before harmless error that did not deprive wright of a fundamentally fair trial,memorandum of february,at.the court also determined that wright attorneys had not performed deficiently at the sentencing phase of the trial.memorandum of february,at.the court then held an evidentiary hearing on wright claim that he should have been allowed to present evidence of the plea negotiations at the sentencing phase of the trial the court then granted the state motion for summary judgment.the court determined that the state never offered wright a life sentence in exchange for a guilty plea,memorandum of february,at,and that wright claims that were not otherwise addressed had been procedurally defaulted.memorandum of february,at.wright obtained a certificate of appealability on the four above issues and filed this timely appeal.
the district court correctly determined that wright was not entitled to habeas relief.as the supreme court of tennessee determined,the admission of harlan testimony at the sentencing phase of the trial was harmless because,under the aggravating circumstance found by the jury,the sequence of the murders did not matter.with respect to wright ineffective assistance of counsel claim,the state appellate court decision that wright attorneys performance at the sentencing phase was not constitutionally deficient was neither contrary to clearly established federal law nor an unreasonable application of federal law.third,regardless of whether the state ever actually offered wright a life sentence in exchange for a guilty plea prior to trial,the evidence of plea negotiations was not relevant mitigation evidence.finally,the district court correctly determined that the state courts had applied a procedural time bar to the claims presented for the first time in wright and petitions for relief,and that therefore,wright has procedurally defaulted the claims brought only in those petitions.accordingly,wright is not entitled to habeas relief.
a.the admission of harlan testimony 
the supreme court of tennessee correctly determined that any error relating to the admission of harlan testimony as to the sequence of the murders was harmless because,under the aggravating circumstance ultimately accepted by the jury,the sequence of the murders did not matter.
during the sentencing phase of the trial,the trial court admitted,over wright objection,the testimony of medical examiner charles harlan,who testified at the guilt phase about his examination of the bodies at the scene of the crime.harlan testimony at the sentencing hearing concerned,among other things,his theory that mitchell had been shot first and alexander had been shot immediately thereafter.the supreme court of tennessee determined that the trial judge should not have allowed harlan to testify as to the sequence of the murders 
in our opinion,the trial judge erred in admitting harlan opinion as to the sequence of events.his testimony as to the nature and extent of the wounds and the effect of the gunshots upon the victims was obviously within the range of his expertise.his conclusion that alexander was shot later than mitchell was based on the assumption that alexander had fled downhill.this conclusion is nothing more than speculation.
wright i,at.the court held that the error was harmless,however,because the jury rejected the first aggravating circumstance offered by the to avoid arrest or therefore the jury did not accept harlan testimony that alexander was shot after mitchell to prevent wright arrest.id.the district court denied wright habeas relief for the same reason,stating that wright has not shown that the admission of harlan testimony resulted in fundamental unfairness given the jury rejection of his opinion.memorandum of february,at.
the admission of harlan testimony does not warrant habeas relief because it did not have a substantial and injurious effect on wright trial.before the state courts,wright framed his claims relating to harlan testimony as violations of state evidentiary law he never presented any federal claims relating to that testimony a federal court conducting collateral habeas review of a judgment involving constitutional error will grant habeas if the error had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict.brecht abrahamson,quoting kotteakos united states.the supreme court of tennessee correctly determined that any error in admitting harlan testimony was harmless because the jury did not accept harlan sequence of events.as the state court discussed,the jury did not find the evidence sufficient to sustain the aggravating circumstance then listed in ann.i,murder committed for the purpose of avoiding,interfering with,or preventing a lawful arrest or prosecution of the accused or of another.wright i,at.the jury therefore declined to accept the conclusions of harlan testimony that may have exceeded the scope of his wright shot alexander as alexander fled after seeing wright shoot mitchell.because the jury rejected the speculative portion of harlan testimony and the only conclusion permitted from all of the evidence presented at trial was that the two murders occurred in close succession,harlan testimony did not have a substantial or injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict.
that harlan testimony also implicated the aggravating factor which the jury did find does not require a different result.the jury recommended the death penalty on the basis of then ann.i,finding that the homicide was committed while the accused was engaged in committing,attempting to commit,or fleeing after committing another first degree murder.it is true that harlan did speculate that the murders were committed in close succession,and this was the only evidence presented as to the timing of the murders at the penalty phase of the trial.but that the two murders occurred in close succession was the only inference permitted from the evidence presented at the guilt phase of the trial.as the state court stated,under all of the proof,the two murders occurred practically simultaneously or,at most,within a short time of each other.even under wright own testimony as to the killing of mitchell,that homicide occurred within a few seconds after alexander had been shot.id.at.contrary to wright assertions,under the aggravating factor that the jury did find,the sequence of events was not murder could have occurred first and alexander murder would still have happened during the commission of mitchell murder.therefore,the supreme court of tennessee correctly determined that the admission of harlan testimony was harmless error.
wright argues that the state court harmless error analysis was not reasonable because it did not include consideration of the mitigation evidence,but such consideration is not required where the purported error had no effect on the aggravating circumstance that the jury in fact found.the jury weighed the mitigation evidence against the aggravating factor and determined that the death penalty was appropriate.wright relies on williams taylor,and clemons mississippi,for the proposition that a court conducting harmless error analysis must always consider mitigating evidence,but those cases are different.in williams,the supreme court held that it was unreasonable for the virginia supreme court to determine that a capital defendant was not prejudiced by counsel deficient performance without evidence that should have been discovered by counsel and mitigation evidence that was presented at trial against the aggravating factors.at.a of all the mitigating and aggravating factors was required to conclude that the erroneous omission of a mitigating factor was harmless.in contrast,no factor was erroneously omitted or erroneously included in this case.clemons involved appellate to cure a lower court error the court stressed the importance of weighing mitigating evidence against the remaining aggravating circumstances when the jury had found multiple aggravating factors and one of those aggravating factors was later invalidated.at.here,because we do not disturb the only aggravating circumstance upon which the jury relied,the court could make a harmlessness determination by focusing on the lack of any adverse effect from harlan testimony.
because the admission of harlan testimony did not have a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict,wright was not entitled to habeas relief on that basis.
ineffective assistance of counsel 
wright trial counsel did not render ineffective assistance at the penalty phase of the trial.wright asserts that his trial attorneys failed to investigate fully and present compelling mitigating evidence at the sentencing phase of the trial.however,the record shows that wright attorneys conducted a complete investigation into wright personal characteristics,including extensive discussions with his family members and a psychological evaluation.the record also indicates that the district court correctly determined that the decision not to call anchor,a psychologist who had examined wright prior to trial at the request of the defense attorneys,was a reasonable strategic decision.because the state court determination that the performance of wright trial counsel was not constitutionally deficient was not an unreasonable application of federal law or contrary to clearly established federal law,the district court correctly determined that wright is not entitled to habeas relief on this ground.
during the sentencing phase of the trial,wright defense team presented only three witnesses.although all three of wright attorneys were involved in all aspects of the trial,the most junior attorney,gary jones,led the mitigation investigation and sentencing phase of the trial.the first witness,reverend ingle,testified that he had met regularly with wright following his incarceration,that wright had undergone substantial changes since the murders,and that wright had expressed genuine remorse over the killings.hattie mcgee,wright ged instructor in the prison system,testified that wright was a conscientious student who arrived early to class,volunteered,was generally helpful to others,and exhibited a real desire to receive an education so he could get a job if he was eventually released from prison.finally,wright mother also testified that the family had been forced to move around before finally settling in a project,where all ten children,wright grandmother,wright mother,and her husband all lived in a apartment.wright mother also indicated that some of wright family members were in attendance,and stated that she loved wright and asked the jury to spare his life.
anchor,a clinical psychologist who had conducted a psychological evaluation of wright at the request of wright attorneys,did not testify at the sentencing hearing.after performing his examinations,anchor met with wright attorneys and prepared a testing report summarizing his findings.had anchor testified about the results of his examination of wright,anchor would have stated that wright had an iq of,which put him near the bottom ten percent of the population that wright was depressed and impulsive and that wright likely panicked during the murders and that wright behavior showed signs of a reactive personality,poor judgment,and a lack of control.after wright trial,anchor stated that his opinions of wright were consistent with wright version of events,which was that wright shot mitchell after seeing mitchell shoot alexander.
wright raised the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel in the petition for relief.after granting an evidentiary hearing,the trial court determined that wright attorneys had not been constitutionally deficient.the tennessee court of criminal appeals affirmed the trial court decision on appeal,determining that 
t he record reflects that the petitioner attorneys conducted substantial investigation and preparation for the sentencing phase of the trial.numerous persons were considered by the attorneys to be witnesses on behalf of the petitioner,although only three ultimately testified.the record supports the conclusion that the attorneys decisions about which witnesses were to testify were strategic decisions based upon the circumstances then existing.
wright ii,wl at.
the state courts correctly determined that wright trial counsel did not render ineffective assistance at the penalty phase of the trial.in order to establish the ineffective assistance of counsel,a petitioner must first show that his counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.second,the petitioner must establish prejudice by showing that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.awkal mitchell,wl,at cir.july,en banc quoting strickland washington.here,the state appellate court determined that wright attorneys performed a reasonable mitigation investigation and that the failure to call anchor was a reasonable strategic decision.wright ii,wl at.when a state court has adjudicated the merits of a habeas petitioner claim,a federal court may not reach a different result simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.rather,that application must also be unreasonable.williams,at,concurring.because the record amply supports the determination that wright trial counsel made strategic decisions about which witnesses to call at the penalty phase of the trial and that those decisions were supported by a reasonable investigation,wright was not entitled to habeas relief.
the decisions about which witnesses to call were supported by a reasonable mitigation investigation.before this court,wright focuses his arguments on the investigation conducted by wright trial counsel,which was led by the most junior attorney on the trial team,and argues that the mitigation investigation really consisted of obtaining wright prison file and talking to wright s mother and some of his brothers and sisters.appellant br.at.yet as the state appellate court determined,wright attorneys conducted substantial investigation and preparation for the sentencing phase of the trial.wright ii,wl at.jones,the public defender who led wright trial team during the sentencing phase of the trial,testified at the evidentiary hearing that he had anticipated the possibility of the state raising aggravating factors and seeking the death penalty prior to trial,and that he thought he discussed the issue with wright other two attorneys long in advance of the state giving notice that it was seeking the death penalty.jones enlisted the assistance of an investigator employed by the public defender office,bernie klose,and together they researched wright prior criminal records,had what jones called extensive communications with wright family members,and met with wright mother and several of his brothers and sisters at their home on one or more occasion to discuss wright childhood,upbringing,and other information relevant to wright and the case.jones also testified that his requests for funding for a criminologist and a juristic psychologist were denied,but that the judge granted the motion for a general psychological evaluation,which led to anchor involvement.wright attorneys also conducted an investigation into wright behavior in prison,as evidenced by the trial testimony of reverend ingle and hattie mcgee.as the state courts correctly determined,wright attorneys mitigation decisions were supported by a reasonable investigation.
wright trial attorneys presentation of witnesses during the sentencing phase of the trial also constituted reasonable professional assistance.the supreme court has defined the deference owed to strategic judgments in terms of the adequacy of the investigations supporting those judgments s trategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable.wiggins smith,quoting strickland,at.here,the choice not to call anchor was made after a complete investigation where anchor twice met with wright,performed several tests and evaluations,and then discussed those findings with wright attorneys.although wright contends that wright attorneys should have allowed more time for evaluations,the state courts determined after evaluating the testimony of two additional experts at the evidentiary hearing that additional testing would not have revealed any information beyond that provided by anchor.wright ii,wl at.as the state appellate court determined,the most reasonable explanation for not calling anchor was a determination that the potential harm from the testimony would have outweighed the benefits.id.at.anchor evaluation finding that wright exhibited impulsive behavior was arguably inconsistent with the version of events the jury wright committed both murders and then went to great lengths to avoid detection,including extensive lying to investigators.more importantly,the state court determined,interpreting its own evidentiary law,that anchor testimony may have opened the door to a statement wright had allegedly made that killing ni is like killing flies.reasonable strategic decisions made after thorough investigation do not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel.see wiggins,at.wright attorneys could not recall,years later at the evidentiary hearing,the exact reason they did not call anchor to testify,but that does not change the reasonableness of the decision.a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance that is,the defendant must overcome the presumption that,under the circumstances,the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.strickland,at internal quotation marks omitted.wright has not shown that the state court determination that wright attorneys did not perform deficiently at the sentencing phase of the trial was an unreasonable application of,or contrary to,clearly established federal law.
wright argues that the decision not to call anchor could not have been strategic because wright attorneys merely forgot to call anchor,or that the witness fell by the wayside during the cursory mitigation investigation,but there is no support in the record for this contention.the state appellate court specifically rejected the argument that the attorneys forgot to call anchor or that they made a purposeful decision not to call a valuable witness in order to preserve an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.wright ii,wl at.a federal court is to apply a presumption of correctness to state court findings of fact for habeas corpus purposes unless clear and convincing evidence is offered to rebut this presumption.james brigano,cir.by wright own admission,the record here shows that at the end of the guilt phase of the trial,wright attorneys expressed concern to the judge about being able to schedule anchor testimony,but they later informed the judge that scheduling anchor was no longer an issue.the only support offered by wright that his attorneys forgot to call anchor is arguments of counsel such evidence is plainly not sufficient to rebut the presumption of correctness accorded to a state court finding of fact.
as wright sees it,the mitigation investigation conducted by his attorneys constituted deficient performance because it failed to comply with the american bar association standards for mitigation investigations in capital cases,but the supreme court recently held that strict reliance on the aba standards in evaluating prevailing professional norms for trials that took place during the is not appropriate.bobby van hook,per curiam.moreover,the investigation here substantially complied with the requirements of the aba standards that wright identifies wright attorneys investigated his family background,including both his childhood and adult years they consulted with anchor as an expert witness for insight into wright mental and emotional state they presented testimony from wright teacher and his spiritual advisor as to wright conduct and they presented the testimony of wright mother about the adverse impact wright execution would have on the family.therefore,in this case,defense counsel decision not to seek more mitigating evidence from the defendant background than was already in hand fell well within the range of professional reasonable judgments.id.at.
wright also argues that the declaration of his sister,rose wright,shows the kind of valuable mitigation evidence that wright attorneys either failed to discover or ignored,but that argument fails for several reasons.first,wright claim that his trial attorneys failed to investigate and present evidence of his troubled family background is procedurally defaulted.in the ineffective assistance of counsel claim raised in wright petition for relief,wright did not argue that his attorneys failed to interview his family members and adequately investigate his troubled childhood.therefore,the trial court did not address that claim at the evidentiary hearing,and none of the state courts ever addressed that claim on the merits.the district court therefore addressed wright ineffective assistance of counsel claim only as raised in his petition.memorandum of,at.a district court has broad discretion to consider additional evidence presented to a federal court that does not fundamentally alter the legal claim already considered by the state courts,west bell,cir,but wright later claim that his attorneys failed to investigate his family background was fundamentally different from the claim addressed by the state courts.
second,nothing in the additional declarations presented by wright family members renders the state court determination unreasonable,or contrary to clearly established federal law.the decision not to call any family members other than wright mother was made after a reasonable investigation,including extensive contact with wright family members.critically,wright never alleges that his attorneys failed to speak to rose wright,and her declaration states only that she would have testified if asked.rose wright testimony would have painted a much more vivid picture of the tragic circumstances of wright family life however,wright mother testified as to wright impoverished upbringing,and the most vivid images from rose wright testimony,those of criminal neglect and sexual abuse,concern wright sisters,rather than wright himself.
the district court correctly determined that the state appellate court determination that wright attorneys provided reasonable assistance at the sentencing phase of the trial was not contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law.
admission of the state alleged offer of a life sentence in exchange for a guilty plea 
it was also reasonable for the state court to determine that wright was not permitted to introduce evidence of plea negotiations during the penalty phase of the trial.although the supreme court held in lockett ohio,that a capital defendant has a constitutional right to present mitigation evidence relating to any aspect of a defendant character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death,id.at plurality opinion,the state court determination that evidence of the plea negotiations did not constitute admissible evidence of mitigating circumstances was not an unreasonable application of federal law or contrary to clearly established federal law.this conclusion is directly supported by our recent decision in owens.guida,cir.owens held that a petitioner constitutional rights were not violated when the state courts refused to admit evidence of failed plea negotiations as mitigation evidence showing that the petitioner willingness to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence indicated acceptance of responsibility.because the state court decision was not contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,wright is not entitled to habeas relief.
wright alleges that,during trial,the state offered a life sentence in exchange for a guilty plea.at trial,wright attorneys argued that they were entitled to present evidence of the alleged offer as mitigation evidence during the sentencing trial,and they filed a motion for a new trial after the court refused to admit the evidence.the trial court held an evidentiary hearing on the motion for a new trial,but again determined that wright was properly denied the opportunity to present evidence of the plea negotiations.wright appealed the decision to the supreme court of tennessee,which held that evidence of the alleged agreement was irrelevant and inadmissible because the evidence did not constitute evidence of a mitigating circumstance.wright i,at.in its ruling,the district court found on the evidence that the state did not make the offer of a plea agreement.
however,because our decision in owens supports the determination that the supreme court of tennessee decision was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,we need not reach the factual issue of whether the state ever offered a plea agreement.in owens,this court held that the supreme court of tennessee did not unreasonably apply or violate clearly established federal law in holding that a petitioner was not entitled to present evidence that the state had offered,and the defendant had accepted,an offer of a life sentence in exchange for a guilty plea,the deal having later fallen through because the petitioner rejected the offer.at.we relied on the fact that while the supreme court decision in lockett required that a capital defendant be allowed to present any relevant mitigating evidence,relevant evidence means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.id.at quoting tennard dretke.here,the tennessee supreme court determined that the evidence was not relevant because it did not relate to wright character or the circumstances of the offense.footnote in lockett explicitly stated that lower courts could continue to exclude as irrelevant evidence not bearing on the defendant character,prior record,or the circumstances of the offense.id.because the alleged offer of a life sentence in exchange for a guilty plea did not bear on the defendant character,prior record,or the circumstances of the offense,wright was not constitutionally entitled to present evidence of the failed plea negotiations.
this decision is consistent with those of other courts that have addressed the relevance of plea negotiations to capital sentencing.although our opinion in owens did not address the specific rebuttal argument that wright has made before this wright should be allowed to present evidence of the alleged plea offer to rebut statements by the state at closing argument suggesting that wright might pose a danger to other inmates if he received a life sentence rather than the death court determination that plea negotiations are not relevant evidence of mitigating circumstances is still relevant here.in supporting our holding in owens,we noted that all of the other courts to address the question of whether the constitution required the admission of failed plea negotiations as relevant mitigation evidence had held that the constitution did not prevent the exclusion of such evidence.id.at.we reasoned that the common thread underlying those decisions was the consideration of the strong policies in favor of plea bargains,which the oklahoma court of criminal appeals had clearly expressed 
allowing a defendant to use plea negotiations in mitigation would clearly discourage plea negotiations in capital cases as prosecutors would correctly fear that during the second stage proceedings,they would be arguing against themselves.plea bargaining is to be encouraged,not discouraged,and therefore is improper evidence to present in mitigation.
ross state.the owens court stated this reasoning persuades us,and explains why every court to hear owens argument has rejected it.at.because the offer of a plea agreement is not relevant to the defendant characteristics or the circumstances of the crime,the state court decision was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.
wright contends that regardless of the policies in favor of plea bargaining and the potential influence admitting plea negotiations might have,the supreme court decision in lockett compels the admission of plea negotiations as rebuttal evidence.but nothing in the lockett opinion,which addressed an ohio death penalty statute that did not permit the sentencing judge to consider,as mitigating factors,the petitioner character,prior record,age,lack of specific intent to cause death,and her relatively minor part in the crime,addressed the relevance of plea agreements to a capital sentencing.at.the petitioner in lockett had rejected plea offers from the state,but the court did not address the admissibility of those offers in the opinion.id.at.the factors the opinion did address,the defendant character,prior record,age,lack of intent to cause death,and role in the crime,were all directly relevant to either the petitioner personal characteristics or her role in the crime.similarly,the court in eddings oklahoma,held that a state court refusal to admit evidence of a defendant personality disorder and his turbulent and abusive family history violated the principles of lockett.as the court explained in eddings,the rule in lockett followed from the earlier decisions of the court and from the court insistence that capital punishment be imposed fairly,and with reasonable consistency,or not at all.at.evidence of plea negotiations does not affect the sentencer ability to impose an individual sentence consistent with the characteristics of the defendant and the circumstances of the crime.lockett and eddings stand for the important
