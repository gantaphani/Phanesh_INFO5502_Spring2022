this habeas appeal arises out of the january murder for hire of virginia tucker.john nixon,was convicted of capital murder by a rankin county,mississippi,jury after a trial.in the penalty phase of the trial the jury returned a death penalty verdict,finding that the capital offense was committed for pecuniary gain,that the murder was especially heinous,atrocious and cruel,and that the defendant had previously been convicted of a felony involving the use or threat of violence to a person.the conviction was affirmed on direct appeal by the mississippi supreme court.nixon state,so d.certiorari was denied by the united states supreme court in.nixon mississippi,d.nixon exhausted his state remedies.nixon state,so d,cert.denied,nixon mississippi,d.nixon then filed a federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus.the district court,in a series of three decisions between and,denied habeas relief.the case first came to this court on appeal from the district court grant of a certificate of appealability coa on nixon claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and on nixon motion to this court for a coa on ten other grounds.in a previous,unpublished opinion,we denied coa on eight of the grounds requested by nixon but granted a coa on nixon batson powers claim and his claim regarding the introduction of a prior statutory rape conviction as an aggravator after reviewing the record and briefs on the additional issues,we now affirm.
background 
on january,nixon and two other individuals arrived at the home of thomas and virginia tucker.upon entering the house,nixon pulled out a caliber pistol and said,i brought all something.thomas tucker,who had married his wife six months earlier a scant three months after her divorce was finalized,immediately surmised that the men had been hired by his wife former husband,elster joseph ponthieux.tucker offered nixon money to spare their lives,but nixon replied,t hat not what i after.the deal already been made.nixon and one of his associates then shot at thomas tucker,who managed to escape despite being hit in the side.tucker made his way to his nearby place of work and asked a to check on his wife.meanwhile,nixon took the gun back from his associate,held the gun one inch behind virginia tucker ear and fired a shot into her head.nixon and his associates fled.tucker was soon discovered by tucker and was taken to the hospital,where she died the next day.nixon was arrested after being identified in a lineup by thomas tucker.
at trial,as noted above,nixon was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death.following completion of his direct appeal and state proceedings,nixon filed a federal habeas petition that was denied by the district court.his appeal to this court followed.
ii.discussion 
this opinion addresses two issues raised by nixon on which coa has been granted his ineffective assistance claim,and his claim regarding the introduction of a prior violent felony conviction before the jury as an aggravator.we first set forth the applicable standards of review and then turn to these two issues.
standard of review 
because nixon original federal habeas petition was filed in,before the effective date of the and effective death penalty act of aedpa,standards apply to the district court review of the petition as well as to appellate review.see lindh murphy,d see also slack mcdaniel,d noting that lindh requires a court of appeals to apply law in reviewing the trial court ruling,for cases commenced there.in evaluating the district court resolution on the merits of issues presented to it,we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.finley johnson,cir.we review its determination of a procedural bar de novo.johnson puckett,cir.
ineffective assistance of counsel claim 
nixon first contends he received ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of strickland washington,d,at both the and sentencing phases of his trial.
in nixon state application,the mississippi supreme court held his ineffective assistance claim procedurally barred based on.ann.see nixon,so d at.under mississippi law,as it existed at the time of nixon trial,a petitioner waives his ineffective assistance claim when he uses different counsel on direct appeal and fails to raise the ineffective assistance claim on direct review.evans state,so d,lockett state,so d see also sones hargett,cir.as nixon employed different counsel on direct appeal,his failure to raise this issue at that time constituted procedural default.a procedural default represents an adequate and independent state ground,which precludes reconsideration of the issue unless the petitioner can demonstrate cause and prejudice,or that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.coleman thompson,d.the district court initially agreed with the state habeas court procedural default determination.
in his brief in this court,nixon has not attempted to overcome the procedural bar by demonstrating cause and prejudice or that failure to consider his ineffective assistance claim will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice any such argument is now considered waived.fed.a a b foster townsley,cir issues inadequately briefed are deemed waived.the fact that the district court later held an evidentiary hearing,resolved the ineffective counsel claims against nixon,and granted a coa on this issue in no way resolves the procedural bar in nixon favor see soffar dretke,cir clarifying on rehearing that a court decision to grant coa on an issue neither precludes consideration of a procedural default nor resolves any questions concerning procedural default in the petitioner favor.we thus affirm the district court on the basis of nixon procedural default.see,foreman babcock wilcox,cir court of appeals can affirm the district court based on any ground raised in the district court and supported by the record.
nevertheless,the district court went on to assess the merits of and ultimately to reject nixon ineffective assistance claim.even if,like the district court,we considered nixon ineffective assistance claim on the merits,we would nonetheless affirm the district court.t he ultimate question of effective assistance of counsel is a mixed question of law and fact reviewed de novo by this court,see lockett,at,but we afford a presumption of correctness to all district court factual findings if they are supported by the record.id.at.
nixon asserts that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of strickland washington,at both the and sentencing phases of his trial.to prevail,he has the burden to demonstrate both deficient performance and prejudice.belyeu scott,cir.the deficient performance prong requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the sixth amendment.strickland,at.at.if this first hurdle is cleared,the defendant then has the burden to show that because of counsel deficient performance there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.at.at.a reasonable probability is one sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the proceeding.koch puckett,cir loyd smith,cir.
nixon alleges three grounds of ineffective assistance during the phase failure to adjust trial strategy based upon the state evidence that the crime was committed for pecuniary gain,including testimony by tommy tucker failure to protect nixon sixth amendment rights during voir dire by failing to object to the state use of peremptory challenges and failure to interview a prospective witness,wade carpenter,who testified that he sold nixon the murder weapon.
nixon specific allegations of deficient performance are unpersuasive.the theory of nixon trial counsel was that the state evidence was insufficient to convict their client of murder for hire.when virginia husband thomas tucker testified that nixon told them the deal already been made,nixon attorneys were surprised.they objected and argued to the trial court that the government improperly withheld this evidence.the trial court overruled the objection,leaving defense counsel to attack this corroborating testimony by accomplice.the jury made the ultimate credibility determination on this issue.that the jury disagreed with nixon counsel as to who was being truthful in no way demonstrates the inadequacy of counsel attempt to persuade them otherwise.
nixon other claims of ineffective assistance during the phase warrant less attention.the claim that counsel were deficient in failing to object to the prosecution alleged racial use of peremptory strikes during voir dire must fail because powers ohio,d,had not been decided at the time of nixon trial.even so,nixon raised and lost this claim on direct review,so even assuming deficient performance,nixon suffered no prejudice through counsel failure to object as to nixon claim regarding counsel failure to interview wade carpenter,we agree with the district court appraisal of the claim presentation of testimonial evidence is a matter of trial strategy,and,particularly on federal habeas review,claims concerning what a witness might have testified if called at trial are largely speculative.see mccoy cabana,cir murray maggio,cir buckelew united states,cir.in any event,we repeat the observation in our coa opinion that nixon identification as the culprit,which counsel might have undermined in questioning carpenter,was not a significant issue at trial.coa op.at.nixon failed to demonstrate deficient performance on his ineffective assistance claim regarding the phase.
additionally,nixon asserts four areas of deficient performance on the part of counsel during the sentencing phase failure to investigate and present mitigation evidence presenting an unprofessional and prejudicial closing argument failure to research the facts or law regarding an aggravating circumstance and failure to object to the state statements made during sentencing.
nixon now presents several incidents that could have supported mitigation in,he risked his own life to pull a woman from the burning wreckage of a plane crash he once rescued a drowning boy from a flooded irrigation ditch he volunteered to serve in both the army and navy and received honorable discharges from each service he left the army at his mother request because his father abandoned his mother and sisters he left school in seventh grade,but ultimately earned a ged in prison,and learned a trade,which he taught other prisoners he suffered child abuse and he struggled throughout life with alcohol abuse and a severe personality disorder.pet r merits br.at.nearly all of this mitigating evidence was discovered through the course of habeas litigation.
during trial and sentencing,nixon was of little or no help to his counsel in fact,counsel had to convince nixon sisters to testify on his behalf.this court has held that a defendant who does not provide any indication to his attorneys of the availability of mitigating evidence may not later assert an ineffective assistance claim.wiley puckett,cir however,that does not mean trial counsel did no independent investigation whatsoever.in fact,nixon told his lawyers that he did not want the mitigation evidence they did nixon had saved a woman from a plane on his behalf at the federal evidentiary hearing,the district court determined that nixon was not acting emotionally and irrationally to such a degree that his attorneys ethically had to disregard his objection to presenting this evidence.there is no basis to disregard this finding.see also amos scott,cir rejecting ineffective assistance claims when the defendant objected to his counsel desire to call certain witnesses on his behalf during sentencing.precedent also prohibits a defense strategy a defendant can not block his counsel from attempting one line of defense at trial,and then on appeal assert that counsel was ineffective for failing to introduce evidence supporting that defense.see roberts dretke,cir dowthitt johnson,cir.
the district court explored many of nixon mitigation claims at the evidentiary hearing.nixon claim that he was subject to child abuse was rejected by the district court,which instead found only that nixon received strict discipline.d at.similarly,nixon claim that his parents were alcoholics was not corroborated.nixon sister did testify that she became aware of her mother drinking problem in,when nixon was almost years old.this in no way supports nixon contention that he was raised by abusive,alcoholic parents.further,nixon sister could not vouch for his claim that he drank heavily as a child.finally,doyle smith,who testified about nixon adult alcoholism,was ultimately deemed of little value by the district court id,largely because smith could not testify whether alcoholism played any role in nixon committing the crime,and smith had a very different picture of nixon childhood than that offered by nixon own family members.the presumption of correctness shields these findings of fact beyond nixon criticisms.
nixon claim that his lawyers prepared no mitigation case is belied by trial counsel pretrial investigation and pretrial request for a psychological expert.during the punishment phase,however,nixon attorneys chose to plead for his life rather than offer flimsy mitigating evidence.as a strategic decision,this was not unreasonable.to fault nixon counsel for failing to call additional witnesses during sentencing would be engaging in of strategic decisions,which,as already discussed,we are loath to do.see mccoy cabana,supra martin mccotter,cir.further,this claim ignores the dearth of options trial counsel had at their disposal both of nixon sons were willing to testify against him at trial and maintained this preference on habeas.none of nixon children were willing to testify on his behalf either at trial or at the federal evidentiary hearing.one of the witnesses called at the federal evidentiary hearing,but not called at trial,was one of his sisters,mary walden.although she corroborated little of nixon alleged mitigating evidence,she had knowledge of a key fact that would have devastated her testimony at trial nixon raped his stepdaughter.given nixon lack of cooperation and a severe shortage of humanizing evidence,trial counsel were not ineffective for foregoing the attempt to offer mitigating evidence.
nixon amplifies his ineffective assistance claim concerning mitigation evidence by analogizing his case with lockett anderson.in lockett,this court granted habeas relief based in part on trial counsel failure to investigate and discover evidence of a major personality disorder and additional symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia,brain abnormality,and the defendant lengthy,documented history of seizures.at lockett counsel also represented nixon at trial.indeed,the trials occurred virtually,and counsel testified that his inability adequately to prepare lockett mitigation evidence was due in part to his simultaneous work on nixon case.id.at.that the consequence for lockett was ineffective counsel in the penalty phase does not,of course,mandate the same conclusion in nixon quite different situation.
at nixon evidentiary hearing,gerald admitted on that nixon purported personality disorder would probably not have caused him to commit the crime or prevented him from knowing the difference between right and wrong.by contrast,lockett experts specifically linked his temporal lobe epilepsy,which was evident in his confessions and through a long paper trail of prior medical problems,to lockett crime.two different experts stated explicitly that they did not believe lockett would have committed his crimes if he did not have severe mental problems.id.at.even assuming nixon personality disorder claim had been uncovered by counsel and believed by the jury,testimony does not rise to the level of the experts used in lockett.specifically,nixon own expert would not corroborate his claim that any purported mental or personality problem interfered with nixon willingness or ability to commit the crime.nixon attempt to hold his counsel liable because counsel fell short in lockett is unavailing 
nixon claim concerning his counsel closing argument at sentencing also fails.counsel simple,sincere request for sympathy and appeal to the jury sense of religious compassion was in keeping with counsel strategic decision to plead for their client life rather than attempt to the facts of the case they had just lost.as already mentioned,this strategy,while ultimately unsuccessful,was a reasonable choice given the facts of the case and the age of their client.similarly,when defense counsel mentioned other heinous,cruel atrocious crimes during closing argument,this rhetoric was in keeping with the strategic decision to plead for nixon life contrary to nixon claim that this argument all but invited a death sentence pet r merits br.at,defense counsel was merely acknowledging the jury verdict and asking for mercy.see stamps rees,cir see also florida nixon,d rejecting a claim of ineffective assistance where defense counsel strategically chose to concede guilt during trial and focus on begging for his client life.
we also reject nixon claim that trial counsel failed properly to research and dispute the admission of his prior rape conviction,which was used as an aggravator at sentencing.at the time of trial,controlling mississippi supreme court precedent appeared to preclude any objection on the basis now claimed.see phillips state,so d.further,the issue was raised,fully briefed,and determined in the state favor on direct review.see nixon,so d at.even assuming that counsel failure to research and investigate fully this aspect of the case constitutes deficient performance,nixon suffered no prejudice.he remains convicted of two other aggravating factors,each of which sufficiently compels a death sentence in mississippi law.further discussion of this issue will be subsumed in our analysis of the aggravating factor itself,infra.
nixon final ground for ineffective assistance,that his lawyers erroneously failed to object to the state closing argument at sentencing,also fails.in light of precedent,see darden wainwright,d,the district court concluded that there was no prosecutorial misconduct during the closing statement at sentencing.we agree.because an objection by nixon counsel would have been fruitless,there can be no claim of deficient performance under strickland.if anything,counsel decision not to object,and thereby highlight the prosecution arguments to the jury,was a prudent trial decision.
assuming trial counsel had obtained the mitigation evidence not presented by nixon until the district court evidentiary hearing,had excluded nixon texas rape conviction,and had objected to the prosecutor statement,the result of nixon sentencing hearing would have been the same.juxtaposing nixon scant potential mitigating evidence against the calculated,vicious nature of his crime,nixon did not demonstrate a reasonable probability that the outcome of the sentencing phase would have been different if not for trial counsel purported deficient performance.as an alternative to procedural bar,we affirm the district court rejection of nixon ineffective assistance claim.
prior violent felony claim 
nixon asserts that his prior texas conviction for rape should not have been introduced before the jury to satisfy the prior violent felony aggravating circumstance because he pled guilty to statutory rape not rape involving the use of force.see ann.b mississippi law allows as an aggravating circumstance a prior conviction for another capital offense or of a felony involving the use or threat of violence to the person.at trial,although he objected on other grounds,nixon counsel failed to object to introduction of this prior conviction as an invalid aggravating circumstance.the texas indictment to which nixon pled guilty accused him of ma king an assault and ravish ing and hav ing carnal knowledge of a woman under eighteen years of age.the mississippi supreme court upheld this conviction as a prior violent felony based on the texas court of criminal appeals decision in rodrigues state.nixon,so d at.the federal district court independently reviewed the claim and agreed with the mississippi court,reading rodrigues to stand for the proposition that because an indictment including the terms ravish and assault,could support a conviction for rape by force as well statutory rape,and because the terms were not necessary to a conviction for statutory rape,nixon guilty plea qualified the conviction as a prior violent felony.
rodrigues indicates that under texas law,
t he word ravish implies force and want of consent,and its use in the indictment in connection with the allegation of rape of a female between the ages of and years,as here,renders the indictment sufficient to support a conviction for rape by force as well as for statutory rape.
rodrigues,at.however,as nixon points out,the texas court went on to hold that t he word ravish is not,however,descriptive of the offense,and it is therefore not necessary that force be proven in order to sustain a conviction under such indictment.id.emphasis added.indeed,in rodrigues,the texas court rejected the state argument that such an indictment could only support a conviction for rape by force.id.as a result,the court held that the defendant should have been permitted to submit a jury instruction indicating that the previous unchaste behavior of the accuser would constitute a valid defense to the defense that was only available in statutory rape cases under texas law at the time.id.
finding this claim at least debatable among jurists of reason,we granted a coa on this issue whether a guilty plea to such an indictment can support a jury finding that nixon had committed a prior violent felony and whether such finding may support the imposition of the death penalty.
for the first time on appeal,the state concedes that nixon prior rape conviction should not have been submitted to the jury,but it asserts that this constituted only harmless error that standard,affirmed in brecht abrahamson,is whether the state court trial error,submission of an invalid aggravating circumstance for the jury to weigh,can be said to have had a substantial and injurious effect on the verdict reached by the jury,d quoting kotteakos united states.under brecht,a constitutional trial error is not so harmful as to entitle a defendant to habeas relief unless there is more than a mere reasonable possibility that it contributed to the verdict.it must have had substantial effect or influence in determining the verdict.billiot,at emphasis added.further,if,after evaluating the claim in light of the entire record,our minds are in virtual equipoise as to the harmlessness of the error,we must conclude that it was harmful.id.citing mcaninch,d.
in billiot,this court evaluated the submission of an unconstitutionally vague aggravating circumstance and determined that the error would be harmless a if the sentence would have been the same had the unconstitutional aggravator never been submitted to the jury,or b if the sentence would have been the same had the unconstitutionally vague aggravating circumstance been properly defined in the jury instructions.at.only the first condition is applicable here.thus,we review the record to determine whether there exists more than a mere reasonable possibility that the erroneous submission of the prior violent felony aggravator during the punishment phase of trial substantially affected or influenced nixon jury.
nixon relies on two arguments to support his contention that this error was not harmless.first,nixon contends that the erroneous introduction of the rape conviction as an aggravating circumstance can not be harmless because under mississippi weighing statute,the conviction fell on death side of the scale.second,nixon argues that the prosecutor repeatedly referred to the rape conviction in his closing argument.
bolstering nixon initial contention is the fact that joe ponthieux,who hired nixon to kill his,received a sentence of life imprisonment the ponthieux jury apparently considered the aggravating circumstances of murder for pecuniary gain and that the murder was especially heinous,atrocious,or cruel.nixon jury returned the same aggravators,in addition to the invalid prior violent felony aggravator.thus,nixon alleges that the invalid aggravator tipped the s
