william thomas bauberger was convicted of murder and assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury after he drove his car the wrong way down an exit ramp,killing one person and wounding another.bauberger unsuccessfully challenged his murder conviction in state court after learning that the jurors read dictionary definitions of several words in the judge instructions.
bauberger then sought federal habeas relief under,arguing that the jurors dictionary use violated his federal constitutional rights and prejudiced his verdict.the district court agreed and granted the writ.given that the dictionary definitions did not materially alter the instruction as a whole and that the government presented significant evidence of malice,any misconduct the jurors may have committed did not exert a substantial and injurious effect in determining the jury verdict.brecht abrahamson,quoting kotteakos united states,internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,the district court order granting bauberger the writ is reversed,and the case is remanded with directions to dismiss the petition.
on february,william bauberger attended a super bowl party at a friend house.over the course of the five or so hours he was there,he drank more than ten beers.after the game bauberger,despite his intoxicated condition,decided to drive to another friend house.he never made it.instead,he drove his a speed somewhere around to miles per wrong direction down an exit ramp off highway in,north carolina.disregarding do not enter and wrong way signs,as well as the honks and swerves of several cars traveling in the proper direction,bauberger finally crashed his car into that of william and carol foy.william sustained several broken bones,and carol died within minutes.
the government charged bauberger with murder and assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury.at trial the government introduced bauberger troubled driving record.he had two prior dwi convictions,as well as a reckless driving conviction and other driving offenses.he also had disregarded prior court orders not to drive and was driving on a revoked license the night of the collision.bauberger admitted that his content that night was and that he was aware of the dangers of driving while intoxicated.in light of this evidence,bauberger conceded guilt to the offense of involuntary manslaughter at trial but insisted that he lacked the malice necessary for a murder conviction under north carolina law.
the jury convicted bauberger of murder and assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury,and he was sentenced to to months in prison.shortly after the verdict came down,however,the parties and the court learned that the jury may have used a dictionary during its deliberations.bauberger filed a postconviction motion for appropriate relief mar,arguing that the dictionary was an impermissible extraneous influence on the jurors and that the dictionary definitions lowered the government burden of proof regarding malice.the mar court determined from the jurors affidavits that the jury foreperson left the courthouse during a break in deliberations,went to a public library,and brought back the edition of webster new collegiate dictionary.he read to the other jurors the dictionary definition of several terms in the judge malice instruction but not the definition of malice itself.
the mar court denied bauberger requested relief,reasoning that the jurors actions,though improper,were harmless.the north carolina court of appeals affirmed,reasoning that bauberger federal constitutional rights were not violated because the definitions concerned legal terminology,not evidence developed at trial.state bauberger.the north carolina supreme court affirmed by an equally divided vote,leaving bauberger convictions in place but stripping the lower court decision of precedential effect.see state bauberger.
bauberger filed for federal habeas relief under.the district court granted his petition,holding that the jurors dictionary use violated bauberger clearly established sixth amendment rights and that the error prejudiced him because the dictionary definitions of recklessly and wantonly may have lowered the government burden of proof regarding malice.
we review the district court decision to grant the writ de novo.bell ozmint,cir.
we shall assume without deciding that the north carolina court of appeals rejection of bauberger sixth amendment claims was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,satisfying the threshold demands for habeas relief under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa.d see also golphin branker,cir leaving unresolved whether the state court unreasonably applied federal law because any error did not have prejudicial impact under brecht.by doing so,we skirt the problems long associated with unnecessary constitutional decisionmaking we avoid wasting the parties and the courts limited resources on questions that have no effect on the outcome of the case,pearson callahan,and we minimize the threat to good adjudication that arises when courts enter into thorny constitutional areas with inadequate briefing or in dispositions,see id.at.

the supreme court recently addressed the relationship between the chapman direct review standard,aedpa deference requirement,and the brecht collateral review standard.in fry,the question before the court was whether habeas courts should apply the test asking whether a state court unreasonably applied chapman direct review standard,the brecht test asking whether a constitutional error had a substantial and injurious effect,or both.see fry,at.
the court made two critical determinations.first,it held that in proceedings a court must assess the prejudicial impact of constitutional error in a criminal trial under the brecht standard,whether or not the state appellate court recognized the error and reviewed it for harmlessness under chapman.fry,at emphasis added citations omitted.second,the court stated that it certainly makes no sense to require formal application of both tests and brecht when the latter obviously subsumes the former.id.at.that is to say,where an error is harmful under brecht,any state court decision declaring it harmless must have unreasonably applied chapman.as a result,any error satisfying brecht will also satisfy aedpa deference requirements.see ruelas wolfenbarger,cir.
thus the court took a somewhat convoluted debate over the appropriate standard in harmless error habeas cases and opted for simplicity itself.federal habeas courts must always review constitutional errors in state trials under brecht,but they need not debate whether a state court harmless error determination also unreasonably applied chapman,as most circuits since fry have explicitly or implicitly recognized.see welch workman,cir wesbrook thaler,cir ruelas wolfenbarger,cir moses payne,cir farley bissonnette,cir bond beard,cir.but see perkins herbert,cir leaving undecided whether both and brecht must be used johnson acevedo,cir requiring and brecht where a state court addressed harmlessness.
of course,most successful habeas petitioners must still go through aedpa mandate d analysis by demonstrating that the state court resolution of their constitutional claim was contrary to or unreasonably applied clearly established federal law and that the error was prejudicial under brecht.baum rushton,cir see also barbe mcbride,cir.but this process does not require us to address the first prong where the petitioner claims fail on the second,see golphin,at,and as explained above,fry absolves us of any need to consider both unreasonableness and brecht prejudice in the harmless error context.accordingly,we need only determine whether the jury dictionary use prejudiced bauberger under the brecht standard 
in analyzing whether the prejudice from the jury dictionary use meets the brecht standard,we begin by laying out the jury actions in greater detail.
the trial judge instructed the jurors on the meaning of malice,the only element of murder that bauberger disputed,as follows 
malice is a necessary element which distinguishes second degree murder from manslaughter.malice arises when an act which is inherently dangerous to human life is intentionally done so recklessly and wantonly as to manifest a mind utterly without regard for human life and social duty and deliberately bent on mischief.
shortly after beginning its deliberations,the jury requested a copy of the elements of murder and manslaughter.in response,the judge the instructions to the jurors and returned them to their deliberations.however,they soon sent another note to the judge asking for a copy of the instruction regarding malice and any other contested element,stating that m any of us are visual people.the judge informed them he would prepare a copy during their upcoming lunch recess and dismissed them for that recess.
as previously indicated,during lunch the jury foreperson retrieved a dictionary and read some of its definitions to the other jurors when deliberations resumed.though he did not read the definition for malice itself to the jury,he did read them the definitions for some of the words in the judge instruction,including recklessly and wantonly.the dictionary defined the former as lack of due caution and the latter as arrogant recklessness of justice or the feelings of others.two hours into their resumed deliberations the jury informed the judge that they had resolved one count but were split seven to five on the other.the judge instructed them to do their best to reconcile their differences without the surrender of conscientious convictions.within an hour of this instruction the jury stood at ten to two,and within two hours they had convicted bauberger of murder and assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury.
bauberger argues that the dictionary definitions of recklessly and wantonly lowered the government burden of proof on the issue of malice,an issue with which he contends the jury apparently struggled.as a result,bauberger claims that the erroneous use of those dictionaries meets the brecht standard one or more of the jurors may have applied an unacceptably low malice standard in convicting bauberger of murder,and therefore the dictionary use had a substantial and injurious effect upon his verdict.we disagree the dictionary definitions did not materially alter the meaning of the instruction as a whole,and the government introduced significant evidence of malice.
in assessing the harm from jurors use of a dictionary we look in part to the difference between the dictionary definition and the legal definition.see henderson kibbe,looking to the difference between the actual instruction given and the correct instruction to determine prejudice mcneill polk,cir king,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment examining difference between dictionary and legal definitions mcneill,at gregory,dissenting in part and concurring in part same.under north carolina law the distinction between recklessness indicative of murder and recklessness associated with manslaughter is one of degree rather than kind.state.rich,quoting united states fleming,cir.north carolina courts have indicated,however,that the difference in degree is large.see,state wilkerson.nonetheless,they have upheld murder convictions even where a portion of the malice instruction veered toward culpable negligence in defining recklessness,provided the instruction as a whole conveyed the difference.see rich,s.at upholding a murder conviction where a portion of the recklessness instruction suggested that recklessness of consequences sufficed.
if bauberger jury had only the dictionary lack of due caution definition to go on in determining the recklessness portion of the malice element,he would have more of a case.but as the supreme court has long emphasized in the analogous context of jury instructions,a single instruction to a jury may not be judged in artificial isolation,but must be viewed in the context of the overall charge.cupp naughten.viewed in this light,the instruction,even as possibly modified by the definitions the jurors consulted,fully conveyed the essence of north carolina law concerning malice.the modified version still referred to an intentionally done,inherently dangerous act.it still described the lack of due caution as of such a nature as to show a mind fully or totally without respect or consideration for human life or social duty.and it still spoke of an individual whose acts were so arrogant ly reckless of justice or the feelings of others as to indicate a mind deliberately bent on mischief.
this is not the language of mere culpable negligence.phrases like these impose a much higher standard than the thoughtless disregard of consequences and heedless indifference to the safety and rights of others culpable negligence requires.state mack,quoting state wade,internal quotation marks omitted.bauberger verdict was not substantially and injuriously affected by the dictionary definition of recklessly because the altered instruction as a whole remained materially equivalent to the one given by the judge.
so too with wantonly.under north carolina law,wantonness describes intentional wrongdoing,conduct undertaken in conscious and intentional disregard of and indifference to the rights and safety of others.state williams,see also state young.again,it would be one thing if the jurors had only considered arrogant recklessness of justice or the feelings of others in determining whether bauberger conduct was wanton.but the possibly modified instruction in its entirety still conveyed the knowing disregard of others safety central to wantonness under north carolina law.it spoke of intentionally done acts,ones performed with such arrogant recklessness toward others as to show a mind fully or totally without respect or consideration for human life and deliberately bent on mischief.emphases added.any modification of the instruction that came about by virtue of the dictionary definition of wantonly did not materially affect that instruction malice standard.
the other jury instructions also indicate that the jurors could not have read the isolated definitions so as to alter the malice instruction.t he challenged instruction is often but one of many such instructions henderson,at quoting cupp,at internal quotation marks omitted.here,those other instructions illustrate that the jurors were well aware of the difference between malice and culpable negligence.the jurors were instructed that if they acquitted bauberger of murder they must consider whether he was guilty of involuntary manslaughter,which requires a showing of culpable negligence.to find culpable negligence,the trial court instructed the jurors that they must find that bauberger drove while impaired,that he willful ly,wanton ly,or intentional ly violated the law,or that his inadvertent or unintentional violation of the law was accompanied by recklessness of probable consequences of a dangerous nature amounting altogether to a thoughtless disregard of consequences or a heedless indifference to the safety of others.the jurors also knew that bauberger had conceded guilt to involuntary manslaughter,including its lower culpable negligence standard,making malice the central disputed issue before them.
given these circumstances,it is unlikely the jurors seized on isolated dictionary definitions to transmute the malice they knew to be the disputed issue in the the culpable negligence standard,to which bauberger had already conceded.in other words,bauberger verdict was not substantially affected because the dictionary definitions,viewed both in light of the instruction as a whole and in light of the entire trial,did not materially alter the malice standard.
we also look to the strength of the evidence in assessing whether the dictionary use substantially and injuriously affected bauberger verdict.see mcneill,at king,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment id.at gregory,dissenting in part and concurring in part.this approach makes sense if the evidence presented was such that the issue of malice was not likely a close one,it is less likely that the error impacted the jury decision.
on this score,bauberger claim to prejudice is particularly weak.his is the paradigmatic case of murder via drunk driving.as detailed above,he had several prior drunk driving convictions,prior court orders not to drive,and a revoked license on the night in question.he stipulated to a high content and admitted knowledge of alcohol dangerous effects upon drivers.he also drove at a high speed,into oncoming traffic,and in disregard of several signs.north carolina courts have routinely accepted evidence less formidable than this in upholding murder convictions.see,rich,at finding sufficient evidence of malice where the defendant drove his vehicle at a high rate of speed while impaired,on the wrong side of the road,in a zone and in violation of rules state westbrook,finding sufficient evidence of malice where the defendant had a prior dwi conviction and sped through a traffic light on the wrong side of the road.while we are not analyzing bauberger conviction for the sufficiency of the evidence,such compelling evidence of malice makes it considerably less likely that the dictionary use affected the jury ultimate decision.
bauberger discounts the importance of this evidence by pointing to the struggles the jury apparently had in reaching its decision.he contends that the actual jury decisionmaking requests for printed instructions,its foreperson decision to retrieve the dictionary,and its initially divided what counts under brecht,not the actions of a hypothetical jury looking at the evidence.we agree in principle and have accordingly looked to the jury difficulty in reaching a decision in assessing prejudice in prior dictionary use cases.see mcneill,at king,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment id.at gregory,dissenting in part and concurring in part.
however,as applied here,this principle can not do the work bauberger sets out for it because the record of the jury deliberations can not bear this much weight.the jurors heard the definitions only an hour into their deliberations.and yet despite bauberger contentions that the definitions lowered the malice standard to a level to which bauberger had essentially conceded,the jury still needed an additional four hours before reaching a decision.this timeline tells us little about the issues around which the jurors struggles revolved.we are unwilling ultimately to put dispositive weight on a jury ambiguous actions.that would be altogether too speculative.where the modified instruction fully conveyed the gist of north carolina law and where the evidence presented was so strong,it takes clearer evidence of jury difficulty than this to satisfy brecht.
the principle that collateral review is different from direct review resounds throughout the supreme court habeas jurisprudence,brecht,at,and understandably so.casually upending state convictions in federal court threatens finality,comity,and federalism,fry,at,words which singly and together convey a sense of respect toward state judiciaries and the significant responsibilities assigned them.thus we have respected state judgments where an error impact,considered in the context of the trial as a whole,was not significant.see,golphin,at overwhelming evidence rendered any error from admitting a confession harmless under brecht wilson ozmint,cir sentencing record rendered any error from not admitting one mitigating statement harmless under brecht.
the error we assume arguendo occurred at bauberger trial does not justify the relief he now seeks.neither the court nor the government had any role in bringing about the erroneous dictionary use.the potentially modified instruction,taken as a whole,conveyed the essence of north carolina law regarding malice.and bauberger disturbing driving record,combined with his activities on the night of the accident,would more than permit a jury to find a mind utterly without regard for the and ultimately risks created by his conduct.given these circumstances,there was no substantial and injurious effect on his verdict from the jurors dictionary reading the district court order granting bauberger the writ is therefore reversed and the case remanded with directions to dismiss the petition.
reversed and remanded 
i respectfully dissent from the majority opinion.it is axiomatic that the constitution prohibits jurors from going outside of the record to independently determine the standards that are to be used when deciding an accused person guilt or innocence.this is based on many sound principles most importantly,the reality that such standards frequently differ from the governing rule and,thus,undermine the basic precept that all persons are guaranteed due process and equal protection under the law.such concerns are not to be taken lightly.were we to treat such violations cavalierly,it would open the floodgates to jurors ignoring the instructions of the court and,in essence,the responsibilities entrusted them by the constitution.
as the majority notes,the appropriate question when considering a defendant petition for writ of habeas corpus is whether the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.see d.clearly established federal law under d refers to the governing legal principle or principles set forth by the supreme court at the time the state court rendered its decision.bell cone,williams taylor.

as the fourth circuit has interpreted the relevant supreme court precedent,all influences,outside the record,on a juror decisions are not necessarily prohibited.the supreme court has clearly established that while external influences on a jury deliberations are prohibited,internal ones are permissible.robinson polk,cir.
under established supreme court case law,an influence is external if it is extraneous prejudicial information,information that was not admitted into evidence but nevertheless bears on a fact at issue in the case or is an outside influence upon the partiality of the jury,such as private communication,contact,or tampering with a juror.
id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.examples of internal influences include alcohol or drugs taken by a juror,turner,at,or bible readings which a juror relies upon for the purpose of examining his or her own conscience from within,robinson,at.
it is clear under the supreme court precedents that when the jury relies on a source outside of its own knowledge or beliefs,not presented at trial or by the trial judge as part of his or her instructions,to determine what relevant law to apply,the jury has been subject to an external influence in violation of the sixth amendment to the united states constitution.rogers united states,finding violation of the sixth amendment where the court,without consulting the defendant,provided further instruction to the jury which the jury then relied on in convicting the defendant.see also tanner united states,noting the distinction between external influences,such as a juror reading a newspaper or hearing prejudicial statements from others,and internal influences parker,at finding that a bailiff statement to jurors that the defendant was a wicked fellow and guilty constituted an outside influence that violated the defendant sixth amendment right to fair trial and confrontation because the evidence developed against a defendant shall come from the witness stand in a public courtroom where there is full judicial protection of the defendant right of confrontation,of,and of counsel turner louisiana,finding a violation of defendant sixth amendment rights where two deputies who testified against him were assigned to guard,and fraternized with,the jury remmer united states,stating that private communication,contact,or tampering with the jury is presumptively prejudicial mattox united states,stating that in capital cases the jury should pass upon the case free from external causes tending to disturb the exercise of deliberate and unbiased judgment.
unlike ingesting alcohol or drugs or reading a bible to settle one conscience,looking up legal terms to apply in the process is not merely an internal matter that merely affects how one feels or facilitates an examination of what one already thinks or believes.rather,in this case,the jury in considering the dictionary definitions was consulting an external because they found their internal knowledge to be insufficient.see robinson,at external influences impart pressure or knowledge on a juror apart from the juror himself,the reading of bible passages invites the listener to examine his or her own conscience from within.had the jury had the knowledge within itself,it would not have found it necessary to consult the dictionary in the first place.
likewise,unlike reading the bible or ingesting alcohol or drugs,consulting the dictionary to determine the applicable legal principle was not merely incidental to the issues before the jury,but was directly relevant as the jury looked up words it was instructed to apply.see id.at finding that juror reading of the bible did not require reversal of the conviction because the bible had no bearing on any fact relevant to sentencing,and was therefore not tantamount to evidence that was used against him at sentencing.any doubt concerning the correctness of this conclusion is all but vitiated in a situation such as this where the defendant has conceded all but one legal element and the jury acquired information about this one legal element at issue.
the cases the state provides,in response,are clearly distinguishable.in none of the cases did the jurors rely on an influence to resolve a legal question or factual dispute relevant to the case before it.wolfe johnson,cir finding no error where juror brought pictures of his son into jury room and another juror spoke with his wife robinson,at finding no clearly established law prohibiting a juror from relying on bible not to garner any external fact or legal principle merely to reflect on his own conscience lynch polk,app cir same.the state reliance on the aforementioned cases suffers from the flawed assumption that merely because the influence of some materials may not violate the sixth amendment,the consideration of any and all external material does not violate the sixth amendment.
beyond citing these cases,the state provides no explanation as to why it believes that a dictionary used to define the element at the center of trial constitutes a permissible internal influence as opposed to an impermissible external influence.rather,the state simply asserts that no case has specifically found that a jury use of a dictionary to define the specific legal terms at issue in this case violates the sixth amendment.accordingly,it concludes that the issue in this case is not clearly established.
this line of argument misconstrues the relevant legal principle.t he relevant supreme court precedent need not be directly on point,but must provide a governing legal principle and articulate specific considerations for lower courts to follow when applying the relevant precedent.quinn hayes,cir citing williams taylor,see panetti,that the standard is stated in general terms does not mean the application was reasonable.the statute does not require state and federal courts to wait for some nearly identical factual pattern before a legal rule must be applied.lockyer andrade,section d permits a federal court to grant habeas relief based on the application of a governing legal principle to a set of facts different from those of the case in which the principle was announced.
finally,this conclusion is buttressed by the decisions of other courts which similarly have found that the reliance of a jury on a dictionary in defining the applicable legal principles violates the sixth amendment.see united states duncan,cir mcneill polk,cir two of three judges on panel finding that juror relied on improper external influence by consulting dictionary for definition of mitigate king,concurring in judgment gregory,dissenting in judgment marino vasquez,cir u nauthorized reference to dictionary definitions constitutes reversible error which the state must prove harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.united states kupau,cir,cert.denied,same 
accordingly,while the majority assumes,without deciding that the jury conduct violated the sixth amendment,no such assumptions are necessary.under both the supreme court and this circuit jurisprudence,such conduct is unconstitutional.
b.the error had a substantial and injurious effect on the defendant.
upon assuming that the jurors conduct violated the sixth amendment,the majority erroneously rejects bauberger petition on the grounds that any such error was not prejudicial to him.
in mayhue francis hosp.of wichita,cir,the tenth circuit set out a five part test to use when determining whether a lower court error is prejudicial.the test assesses 
the importance of the word or phrase being defined to the resolution of the case the extent to which the dictionary definition differs from the jury instructions or from the proper legal definition the extent to which the jury discussed and emphasized the definition the strength of the evidence and whether the jury had difficulty reaching a verdict prior to introduction of the dictionary definition and any other factors that relate to a determination of prejudice.
id.at.the test was subsequently adopted by the majority of the judges of a panel of this
