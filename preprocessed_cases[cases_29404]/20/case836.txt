rule of the federal rules of appellate procedure conditions federal appellate jurisdiction on the filing of a timely notice of appeal.in this case,we hold that a document filed by a pro se litigant as an extension of time to request a certificate of appealability qualifies as the notice of appeal required by rule.
in,keith alan clark,after a jury trial in south carolina,was found guilty of kidnapping and assault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct.the trial court sentenced clark to concurrent sentences of thirty years.after a series of unsuccessful appeals and postconviction procedures in south carolina courts,clark filed a pro se petition for writ of habeas corpus in the district court for the district of south carolina pursuant to.clark alleged several constitutional violations stemming from his conviction,including,among others,that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the sixth amendment.
in response to clark petition,the state,representing warden larry cartledge,filed a motion for summary judgment,which was referred to a magistrate judge.on february,the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation,recommending that the state motion for summary judgment be granted.clark then timely filed objections to the report and recommendation.on december,the district court issued its judgment and order,overruling clark objections and adopting the magistrate judge report and recommendation.in that same order,the district court denied clark a certificate of appealability,finding that he failed to meet c standard for issuance of such a certificate.
on december,clark,still pro se,filed a motion for extension of time to request a certificate of appealability the question at heart in this case is whether this motion,filed within the thirty day requirement of federal rule of appellate procedure,is the functional equivalent of a formal notice of appeal demanded by rule.see becker montgomery,stating that a party seeking appellate review must comply with the linked jurisdictional provisions of rules and of the rules of appellate procedure.if we construe the motion for an extension of time as a notice of appeal,then all events that occurred in the district court after the notice of appeal was filed are of no moment,as a timely filed notice of appeal transfers jurisdiction of a case to the court of appeals and strips a district court of jurisdiction to rule on any matters involved in the appeal.doe public citizen,cir.
we review our own jurisdiction de novo and must raise the issue sua sponte.kporlor holder,cir.
federal rule of appellate procedure c dictates that a notice of appeal must specify the party or parties taking the appeal designate the judgment,order or part thereof being appealed and name the court to which the appeal is taken.fed.app.c.in addition,the notice of appeal must specifically indicate the litigant intent to seek appellate review to ensure that the filing provides sufficient notice to other parties and the courts.smith barry.
while the requirements of rule serve important purposes and are mandatory and jurisdictional in nature,torres oakland scavenger,functional rather than formalistic compliance is all that is required,smith,at.as another subsection of rule warns,an appeal must not be dismissed for informality of form or title,or for failure to name a party whose intent to appeal is otherwise clear from the notice.fed.app.c.and as the supreme court has instructed,imperfections in noticing an appeal should not be fatal where no genuine doubt exists about who is appealing,from what judgment,to which appellate court.becker,at.
courts thus will liberally construe the requirements of rule,smith,at,to permit notices of appeal technically at variance with the letter of a procedural rule but that amount to the functional equivalent of what the rule requires,torres,at.we,moreover,have held that the policy of construing notices of appeal liberally applies especially to pro se filings.united states garcia,cir.therefore,as long as the pro se party notice of appeal provided the notice required by rule,evinced an intent to appeal an order or judgment of the district court,and the appellee was not prejudiced or misled by the notice,then the notice technical deficiencies will not bar appellate jurisdiction.see jackson lightsey,cir.where a challenged notice of appeal has provided adequate notice and caused the complaining party no prejudice,there is no reason to allow a technical impediment to foreclose appellate review.quotation and citations omitted canady crestar mortg,cir.finding compliance with rule in light of adequate notice and lack of prejudice to the appellee smith,at notice afforded by a document determines the document sufficiency as a notice of appeal.
with these principles in mind,we turn to the facts of this case.clark filed a motion for extension of time to request for a certificate of appealability.clark,represented by counsel on appeal,contends that his motion served as the functional equivalent of a notice of appeal because it specified the party taking the appeal and the order being appealed.clark further argues that while his motion did not specify the court to which the appeal was being taken,we have allowed appeals where there is only one possible appellate forum,even when the party fails to add the words fourth circuit to their notice of appeal.jackson,at.we agree.
in that motion,clark identifies himself as the person who intends to appeal,as well as the order he intends to appeal the district court order denying his objections to the magistrate judge report and recommendation.moreover,clark intent to appeal to this court is obvious the term certificate of appealability necessarily refers to an appeal to the relevant court of appeals.wells ryker,cir.see also allowing review of a final order by the court of appeals for the circuit in which the proceeding is held only if a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability.
the state does not,and can not,seriously dispute that clark motion complied with rule.in fact,the state conceded during oral argument that clark motion satisfied the notice requirements of rule.rather,the state argues that clark motion did not convey any intention to appeal at all,and shows only that he may wish to seek appellate review at some point in the future in other words,the motion is speculative.state br.at.we disagree.
to be sure,a motion for an extension of time on its face might not conclusively show subjective certainty about the party desire to appeal.but this view loses sight of the fact that it is the notice afforded by a document,not the litigant motivation in filing it,that determines the document sufficiency as a notice of appeal.isert ford motor,cir.quoting smith,at.thus clark subjective intent if it was indeed to only seek appellate review in the future is irrelevant.the relevant inquiry is whether the notice of appeal specifically indicate s the litigant intent to seek appellate review.smith,at.
here,as already noted,clark motion complied with rule notice requirements.further,clark,in support of his motion for extension of time states i n order to properly file for a certificate of appealability,i request an additional fifteen days beyond the current due date.the reason for his request clark had limited access to the prison law library,which prevent ed him from conducting the necessary legal research to properly file.id.
there would be little reason for clark to request an extension of time to properly file a certificate of appealability if he did not intend to appeal.under these circumstances,we believe that there could be no genuine doubt that the motion for extension of time indicates clark intent to appeal the district court order overruling his objections to the magistrate judge report and recommendation,and that motion sufficed to put the state on notice of that intent and,to require more explicit language from a pro se litigant would turn smith instruction that we liberally construe rule requirements on its head.thus,we conclude that clark motion evinced a desire to appeal 
remarkably,the dissent contends that our holding today is unprecedented,stretch ing the functional equivalency test far beyond its defined bounds.dissenting op.at.but the dissent contention conveniently ignores precedent in other circuits.in truth,our conclusion today this untenable fabrication,as the dissent would have it,id.at flows naturally from our own precedent,see,garcia,at p leadings under rule are liberally construed,especially pro se pleadings,and is consistent with the holdings of other circuits,see,rountree balicki,cir.by indicating,in his motion for extension of time to file for a certificate of appealability,that he would file for a certificate of appealability,his pro se motion evidenced an intention to appeal,which means it constituted a notice of appeal.quotation marks and citation omitted wells,at t he motion for extension of time to request a certificate of appealability is an attenuated example of a functional equivalent to a notice of appeal,and probably lies at the outer limit of what motions may suffice under smith barry.but,we are confident that the appellant motion in this case served adequate notice under the rule.
interestingly,the state cited bailey cain,cir,for the proposition that a motion for an extension of time to file a certificate of appealability does not qualify as a notice of appeal.not only is the state reliance on that case misplaced,but the holding in bailey should assuage the state concern that our decision today will,in effect,eliminate,undermine,or abolish the federal rules of appellate procedure.in bailey,the fifth circuit assumed that a motion for an extension of time to file a certificate of appealability could provide adequate notice under rule.id.at.the court,however,concluded that bailey motion came up short o mitted from bailey motion that was present in wells is a specific reference to the judgment or order from which appeal was taken.id.because bailey motion did not satisfy two of the three notice requirements of rule,the court held that bailey motion to extend was not a functional equivalent of a notice of appeal.id.at.in other words,noncompliance with rule was fatal,see smith,at,to bailey appeal.
the result in bailey illustrates why the state doomsday scenario this court automatically treating every motion for extension of time as a notice of appeal will never occur.in order for us to find that a motion for an extension of time is the functional equivalent of a notice of appeal,the litigant motion must be timely under rule and must satisfy the notice requirements of rule.clark motion did just that.
for the foregoing reasons,we have jurisdiction to consider clark application for a certificate of appealability.

on december,the district court entered final judgment denying keith clark petition under for a writ of habeas corpus.clark filed his notice of appeal days later,on february,which was therefore untimely.see a requiring that notice of appeal be filed within days after the entry of judgment fed.app.a a same.because the requirement for timely filing a notice of appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional,bowles russell,we are required to dismiss clark appeal.
in an unprecedented opinion,the majority holds that a motion that clark filed on december,for an extension of time to request a certificate of appealability was the functional equivalent of a notice of appeal that satisfied the jurisdictional requirements of and federal rules of appellate procedure and.it reasons that because clark motion for an extension of time related to a future request to file a certificate of appealability and because a future request for a certificate of appealability would relate ultimately to a future notice of appeal,clark motion must be treated as a document giving sufficient notice of his appeal.the majority states that it believe s that there could be no genuine doubt that the motion for extension of time indicates clark intent to appeal.ante at.
the majority decision dramatically oversteps the bounds of liberally construing a document and,in sympathy for the pleading challenges facing pro se litigants,substantially and substantively rewrites it.under no fair construction of clark motion for an extension of time could a party or a court conclude that the document specifically indicate s clark intent to seek appellate review with the purpose that it provide sufficient notice to other parties and the courts.smith barry.as the smith court explained,the notice afforded by a document,not the litigant motivation in filing it,determines the document sufficiency as a notice of appeal.id.emphasis added.how can a simple request for an extension to file a certificate of appealability be fairly understood to give notice of appeal 
the majority decision will cause much mischief,some unintended but some quite foreseeable and damaging to the appellate process.hereafter,for example,a litigant who files a request for an extension of time to file an appeal will,in effect,have his motion automatically decided in his favor without having to show any excusable neglect or good cause,as required by c and federal rule of appellate procedure a a,because his motion will have to be taken as a notice of appeal.
because i would dismiss clark appeal as untimely,i respectfully dissent.
clark was convicted in the south carolina courts of kidnapping and assault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct.after having unsuccessfully sought direct and collateral review from the south carolina courts,he filed this pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to.
on december,the district court denied clark petition,granting summary judgment to larry cartledge,the warden at perry correctional institution,where clark was housed.it also denied clark a certificate of appealability.on december,clark filed a document that he called a motion for extension of time to request for a certificate of appealability.the document requested an additional fifteen days beyond the current due date in order to properly file for a certificate of appealability with respect to the district court december order denying his habeas petition.he gave as his reasons the late receipt of the district court december order,restrictions on his access to the prison law library,and institutional lockdowns to which he was subjected,and in support of his motion,he cited federal rule of civil procedure b,which addresses extending time.the district court denied clark motion by order dated december.clark nonetheless filed a request for a certificate of appealability with the district court,which the court also denied.
the record shows that clark himself clearly understood that his motion for a request for an extension of time to request a certificate of appealability was not to serve as a notice of appeal because he thereafter filed with the district court a document that he called a request for certificate of appealability and later a document that he called a notice of appeal.clark notice of appeal clearly manifested his intent,with that document,to appeal.as it states,the petitioner keith alan clark hereby appeal s his federal habeas corpus action that was decided by the honorable bruce howe hendricks,district judge.his notice of appeal,however,was filed with prison authorities on february,days after the district court order denying his petition for habeas corpus,and therefore was untimely.
under these facts,the majority concludes that clark request for an extension of time to file a certificate of appealability was the functional equivalent of a notice of appeal and therefore that his filing of the motion conferred jurisdiction on this court on december.
it is uncontroverted that clark filed his notice of appeal long after the time limit fixed by a and federal rule of appellate procedure a a,a deadline that the supreme court has repeatedly described as mandatory and jurisdictional.bowles,at see also ray haluch gravel cent.pension fund.the majority nonetheless concludes that we have jurisdiction to consider clark appeal by construing clark earlier motion for an extension of time to request a certificate of appealability as the functional equivalent of a notice of appeal.the majority holding stretch
