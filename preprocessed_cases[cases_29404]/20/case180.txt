petitioner stephen dagley was convicted in the essex county superior court in massachusetts of first degree murder and sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.after exhausting his state court appeals,petitioner filed a habeas petition challenging his detention.he asserted that a prosecutor prejudicial misstatement during closing arguments,and the court subsequent failure to directly cure the misstatement,resulted in a fundamentally unfair trial and the infringement of his right to due process under the fourteenth amendment.the district court denied relief and dagley appeals.we affirm.
we recite only those facts necessary to resolve dagley claim,as they were determined in the state proceedings.pursuant to e,we presume the correctness of these findings dagley does not dispute any of the state courts findings of fact.
the petitioner was indicted for murdering the victim in september.according to dagley neighbor downstairs,the killing followed an argument between dagley and the victim,his girlfriend,earlier in the evening in which she told the petitioner that he would have to move out of their apartment.the neighbor recalled dagley and the victim entering their apartment while still arguing.he heard more yelling and screaming from the apartment,then periodic banging sounds,like a hammer hitting the floor.the initial period of yelling and banging lasted approximately twenty to minutes,and the banging continued intermittently for another ten minutes thereafter.the banging was sufficiently powerful to cause ceiling tiles in the neighbor apartment to drop,and some plaster also loosened and fell.the neighbor contacted both the building owner and the police regarding the incident,and the police arrived within minutes to find the victim lying unconscious on the floor of her apartment with a large pool of blood around her head.having suffered numerous blows to her face,neck,and chest,causing multiple fractures,extensive bruising and swelling,hemorrhaging in the back of her head and back,and a lapse into a state of shock,she was pronounced dead,despite attempts by emergency medical personnel to revive her.
the police inspected the scene,finding bloody footprints later matched to the soles of the petitioner shoes in a path toward the window.the window screen appeared to have been kicked out,with the perpetrator having escaped onto the roof.the police obtained dagley name from the downstairs neighbor and alerted other officers that they were on the lookout for the petitioner.
very early the next morning,a beverly,massachusetts police officer spotted the petitioner at the home of his in beverly and contacted the salem police.when the salem police arrived at the scene,they asked if the petitioner would accompany them to the police station for questioning.he agreed.the petitioner was not arrested,nor restrained.on their way to the station,he complained to the police that he was in pain,stating that he had been jumped by people earlier in the night.
when they arrived at the station around,the police read dagley his miranda warnings.after reciting several different versions of the night events,the petitioner acknowledged that he had gone back to the victim apartment to try to make up with her,and had lost control.he claimed that after being punched and kicked by the victim,he punched her twice quickly,knocking her down,and then struck her a third time when she was on the floor.he described the victim as just groaning on the floor with her hands over her face.upon hearing the police arrive,he left through the window and over the roof on foot.
after confessing to the officers at the police station,the petitioner also acknowledged that,although he had been confronted by some people earlier in the day,he had not been attacked by them.the interview lasted approximately two hours.after its conclusion,dagley was given an opportunity to correct the notes taken during the interrogation.dagley was then formally arrested and booked.
at trial,dagley again admitted to having killed the victim,but sought to convince the jury that his use of force was an instinctual response to the victim unprovoked attack on him.he testified that after engaging in an argument with the victim about their living arrangement and her failure to attend her methadone clinic,he packed his belongings and prepared to move out of the apartment.after loading his car,he explained that he returned to the apartment to leave a note for the victim in hopes of mak ing up.having been drinking previously,dagley claimed to have passed out on the bed in the apartment.he testified that when he awoke the victim was on top of him,grabbing at him.instinctively,and still in a stupor,he said he started swinging at the victim.according to his testimony,the next thing he knew the victim was on the floor bleeding and unconscious.in response,he claims to have freaked out and escaped out the window because he heard yelling outside the building.
in his closing argument,dagley counsel asserted that because dagley acted instinctually in response to a reasonable provocation,he should only be found guilty of manslaughter,not murder.counsel repeatedly stated that the commonwealth was required to prove that the petitioner acted in cold blood in order to obtain a murder conviction.
the prosecutor urged the jury to reach a different conclusion.insisting that the evidence presented to them undermined dagley version of the events,the prosecutor stated the following near the end of the closing argument 
his the petitioner actions that night were not just what he wants you to believe,manslaughter,simply manslaughter,reckless conduct,or heat of passion,or response to some sort of provocation,reasonable response or reasonable provocation or even sudden combat.this was murder.
commonwealth dagley,emphasis added.after the prosecutor completed his argument,dagley counsel objected to the above portion,asserting that the use of the phrase reasonable response was legally inaccurate as manslaughter does not require the petitioner response to be reasonable.instead,defense counsel noted that manslaughter is emphatically an unreasonable or excessive response to a reasonable provocation.id.at.
in response,the judge noted that both counsel had inaccurately stated the law at points during the trial and that any confusion would be remedied in his instructions to the jury.in those instructions,the judge provided accurate legal distinctions between murder and manslaughter,including a definition of reasonable provocation,and noted that the commonwealth has the burden to prove the absence of mitigation beyond a reasonable doubt in order to convict the petitioner of murder.id.further,the judge repeatedly instructed the jury that they were required to apply the law as the judge gave it to them,and that they could only convict the petitioner of a crime if they found that the commonwealth had proven every element of that crime.the court provided written instructions to the jury,which at no point asked for clarification from the judge before returning a conviction for murder.
the sjc affirmed the conviction on appeal.dagley,at.dagley petition for certiorari to the united states supreme court was denied shortly thereafter in march.dagley subsequently filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in december,raising a single claim.he argued that the prosecutor inclusion of the phrase reasonable response in his closing argument,which represents a misstatement of the definition of manslaughter,and the court failure to specifically correct the error,deprived him of his right to due process under the fourteenth amendment.
in june,the district court of massachusetts denied dagley petition after briefing by the parties and a hearing.in a thorough and thoughtful opinion,the court found that the prosecutor legally incorrect use of the phrase reasonable response during closing argument in describing the elements of manslaughter,and the trial court failure to correct explicitly that error in its jury instructions,did not violate dagley due process rights by rendering the trial fundamentally unfair.the district court subsequently issued a certificate of appealability on dagley due process claim.
we review a district court denial of a petitioner habeas claim de novo.delaney bartee,cir.under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,we may issue the writ if the sjc adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d see teti bender,cir.to be contrary to clearly established supreme court law,a state court must appl y a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in the supreme court cases or confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of th e supreme court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from its precedent.williams taylor,d.alternatively,a state court decision runs afoul of the unreasonable application prong if the court either identifies the correct governing legal rule from th e supreme court cases but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular state prisoner case or unreasonably extends a legal principle from the supreme court precedent to a new context where it should not apply or unreasonably refuses to extend that principle to a new context where it should apply.id.at.the rule relied upon by the petitioner for relief must be clearly established law as determined by th e supreme court,which refers to holdings,not dicta.yarborough alvarado,d.
petitioner claim 
relying on the supreme court decision in donnelly dechristoforo,d,dagley asserts that the prosecutor closing argument,in which he stated that the petitioner wants you to believe his actions were some sort of reasonable response or reasonable provocation or even sudden combat,contributed to a violation of his due process rights under the fourteenth amendment.in donnelly,the court recognized that a prosecutor closing argument could be sufficiently prejudicial so as to constitute a deprivation of a petitioner constitutional rights.see id.applying that decision to this case,dagley argues that the prosecutor mention of a reasonable response requirement gravely misstated the definition of manslaughter,thereby misleading the jury into believing that such a response is a required element of manslaughter and creating a fundamentally unfair proceeding.
according to the petitioner,the harmful effect of the prosecutor misstatement is clear when one examines dagley trial tactics.at trial,dagley sole defense was a claim that because his actions were a response to a reasonable provocation by the victim,the government could not establish that dagley acted with malice,a necessary element of murder.see,commonwealth gladney,commonwealth boucher.instead,dagley argued,the government could only prove that he committed manslaughter.in massachusetts,if a person kills another in the heat of passion,which is occasioned by adequate and reasonable provocation,or in sudden combat,then even though that person had an intent to kill,the killing is designated manslaughter and not murder because of the mitigating circumstances.commonwealth whitman,quoting commonwealth acevedo.in cases w here the evidence raises the possibility that the petitioner may have acted on reasonable provocation,the commonwealth must prove,and the jury must find,beyond a reasonable doubt that the petitioner did not act on reasonable provocation.acevedo,at.thus,dagley asserts,the error went to the heart of his defense.
compounding the prosecutor error,according to dagley,was the trial judge inadequate response to the error.rather than specifically instructing the jury to disregard the prosecutor misstatement,the judge response was limited to stating the elements of murder and manslaughter in the course of giving its overall instructions to the jury.thus,dagley argues,the taint from the prosecutor misstatement had not been adequately cured,leaving a lasting impression in the jury mind that his response had to be reasonable in order to satisfy the requirements of manslaughter.he asserts that the combination of the error,which reached to the heart of his defense,and this failure by the trial judge to adequately address and cure such error,made the entire proceeding fundamentally unfair,thereby amounting to an infringement of his due process rights.
b.the sjc decision 
the sjc evaluated dagley prosecutorial error claim under the standard outlined in commonwealth kelly,which sets forth four factors for determining if a new trial is warranted,the court examined whether there was a timely objection,whether the inaccuracy went to a collateral issue or to the heart of the case,what steps the judge took to mitigate the prosecutor mistake,and whether it would possibly make a difference in the jury conclusion.see id.
the sjc found that the first two factors weighed in favor of dagley.the court acknowledged dagley contemporaneous objection to the prosecutor statement.it also agreed with dagley that the prosecutorial error went to the heart of dagley claim,as it addressed the elements required to establish the crime of manslaughter.however,the sjc concluded that the third and fourth kelly factors weighed heavily in favor of the government.on the third steps the judge took to mitigate the prosecutor sjc found that the judge properly instructed the jury on the distinction between murder and manslaughter,including the concept of reasonable provocation.although the trial court did not specifically address the prosecutor mistake by telling the jury to ignore the erroneous statement,the trial judge did assure the jury throughout the course of the trial that he would instruct them,both orally and in writing,on all of the applicable issues of law.according to the sjc,from the outset of the trial,the jury had been told that they should look solely to the judge for an explanation of the applicable legal principles,and to ignore any differing explanations suggested by either of the attorneys.based on its examination of the trial court conduct,the sjc concluded that the judge final instructions were adequate to cure any confusion caused by the prosecutor misstatement of the law,even though the instructions did not specifically refer to the misstatement.
on the fourth factor,the sjc was satisfied that the prosecutor statement would not have made any difference to the jury determination.reciting the context in which the prosecutor erred,the court suggested that it was nothing more than a slip of the tongue,meant only to summarize the petitioner contentions and not as an explicit legal definition of manslaughter.further,the sjc noted that the prosecutor argument was focused primarily on contesting the factual basis of the petitioner manslaughter defense that there was reasonable provocation for his actions.in sum,the sjc concluded that,viewed in the context of the proceedings as a whole,the prosecutor fleeting reference to the concept of a reasonable response to provocation would not have affected the jury understanding of the distinction between manslaughter and murder.finding that the third and fourth prongs heavily favored the government,the sjc concluded that there were no grounds in the record warranting relief.
clearly established supreme court precedent 
in assessing whether dagley has met the high burdens aedpa imposes on him,we a threshold determining whether there is clearly established supreme court law applicable to dagley constitutional claim.on this point,dagley has rightly pointed us to the court decision in donnelly dechristoforo.see,d.as noted above,donnelly stands for the principle that a prosecutor closing argument may be sufficiently prejudicial so as to constitute a deprivation of a petitioner due process rights.id.at.although the court in donnelly ultimately rejected the various arguments advanced by the petitioner,noting that the prosecutor erroneous remark was ambiguous and was followed by specific disapproving instructions,it acknowledged implicitly that a prosecutor remarks may make a petitioner trial so fundamentally unfair as to deny him due process.id.at.the court has applied the principle of donnelly in other cases,see,darden,at,and,as a circui
