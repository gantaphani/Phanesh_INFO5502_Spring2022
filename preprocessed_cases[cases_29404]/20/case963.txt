appellant darick demorris walker was convicted by a jury of capital murder and sentenced to death in a virginia state court.in his federal habeas petition,he challenges his death sentence on the grounds that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate evidence of the mitigating factor of mental incapacity due to organic brain dysfunction or mental retardation.we granted a certificate of appealability to review the district court dismissal of walker habeas petition.because we conclude,as did the district court,that the state court application of strickland washington,d,was not unreasonable,we affirm.
based on the jury verdict,the virginia supreme court found the following facts surrounding walker crimes.on november,walker kicked in stanley beale locked front door,and entered beale apartment yelling,w hat you keep coming up to my door,what you come looking for me for walker virginia.when beale told walker that he did not know who walker was or where he lived,walker began shooting at beale as the other residents of the apartment hid in another room.id.walker shot beale three times,killing him.id.
on june,walker kicked open the door to the residence of andrea noble and clarence threat.id.at.walker hit noble with the gun and shot threat in the leg.id.after walker and threat exchanged words,walker began to shoot threat again.id.walker shot threat a total of seven times.threat died as a result.id.
walker was indicted in virginia state court for capital murder,for four counts of the use of a firearm in the commission of a felony,and for two counts of burglary.after a jury trial,walker was convicted on all counts.
through the presentation of mitigating evidence at walker sentencing hearing,his trial counsel,rebecca norris,sought to establish that walker was not a future danger because he responded well when placed in structured environments.she also attempted to demonstrate that his family cared whether he lived or died.in support of her mitigation theory,norris entered walker school records into evidence.psychological reports included in the school records described walker as a slow learner or very slow learner,and suggested that he had a learning disability or attention deficit disorder.norris argued that the records revealed that,despite walker problems,his grades improved when he was placed in special education classes.norris also presented as witnesses walker jailers,who testified that he was a inmate.finally,norris presented walker family members,who testified about their affection for walker.
after a sentencing hearing,the jury recommended that walker receive the death penalty for capital murder,life imprisonment for each burglary,and eighteen years of imprisonment for the firearms offenses.the trial court sentenced walker in accordance with the jury recommendation,and walker sentence was upheld on direct appeal.walker virginia,cert.denied,d.
in his subsequent state proceedings,walker claimed that his sixth amendment right to counsel was violated by norris unreasonable failure to investigate adequately possible indications of organic brain deficiency or mental retardation referenced in a psychological examination.walker argued that norris failure to investigate resulted in her failure to discover and present evidence of walker severe mental impairment.in support of his claim,walker offered an affidavit from scott sautter which described walker brain dysfunction as chronic and concluded that his judgment and reasoning were in the first percentile.
walker claim thus relied principally on the psychological evaluation,which was included in his school records.this report described walker as making an error that is most commonly found in protocols of individuals who are mentally retarded or who have some type of organic deficiency,and as drawing a picture that indicate d either psychological regression with grossly impaired reality contact or organic involvement.the evaluation recommended that walker receive a complete psychological evaluation in one year to evaluate his intellectual development and to rule out organic or psychotic disturbances that might be interfering with his adjustment.
although she possessed this limited evidence of the mitigating factor of mental incapacity due either to mental retardation or to organic brain dysfunction,norris did not argue this mitigating factor to the jury.she concluded that the evidence in favor of organic brain deficiency was not likely to be persuasive,because there was only a single suggestion of such a problem in all of walker records,and neither her expert,nor the facts of the crime,nor the testimony of witnesses supported that walker suffered from such a problem.in addition,norris believed that arguing organic dysfunction would undermine the remainder of her mitigation strategy by supporting the government argument that walker would be a future danger in prison.likewise,norris did not present evidence that walker could possibly be mentally retarded because walker psychologist,randy thomas,informed norris that,based on his tests,walker had an of and was thus not mentally retarded.
norris did not present as mitigating evidence the testimony of thomas.norris later alleged,and the virginia supreme court found,that thomas told norris that he believed that walker was a sociopath.thomas did not consider the psychological evaluation in reaching this conclusion,because norris did not obtain the school records that included that report until three days before trial.by the time norris received these records,she had already determined that thomas belief that walker was a sociopath would render him ineffective as a witness in mitigation,and had thus removed him as an expert witness.on review,the state court concluded that the delay in norris receipt of the records stemmed from the recalcitrance of walker and his mother.
the supreme court of virginia rejected walker ineffective assistance claim on the merits,concluding that it fail ed to satisfy the performance prong of the test set out in strickland.the supreme court of virginia dismissed walker petition and the supreme court of the united states denied walker petition for writ of certiorari.walker true,d.
walker then filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal district court,alleging numerous grounds for relief,all of which the district court dismissed.we denied a certificate of appealability as to the claim relevant here,that trial counsel unreasonably failed to investigate mitigating evidence regarding his organic brain disorder or mental retardation.walker true,cir.the supreme court thereafter vacated our opinion and directed that walker case be reconsidered in light of wiggins smith,d.upon remand to the district court,the district court again dismissed walker habeas petition on the grounds that counsel failure to investigate was not unreasonable.walker appealed the district court dismissal of his petition,and we granted a certificate of appealability to review walker wiggins claim.
the virginia state court concluded that walker was not entitled to relief on his ineffective assistance claim because norris had extensively investigated possible mitigating evidence and presented a mitigation case to the jury based on tactical decisions that were the product of that extensive investigation.see also.because walker claim was adjudicated by the state court on the merits,he is entitled to a writ of habeas corpus only if he satisfies the conditions set forth in d as relevant here,section d permits the writ to be granted only if the state court adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.
a decision is an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent under section d if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the case before it.wiggins,at.because the state court correctly identified strickland as the governing law,we must determine whether its application of strickland was incorrect or erroneous,and if so,whether it was also objectively unreasonable.williams taylor,d.we review the district court conclusion that the state court application of strickland was reasonable de novo.hill ozmint,cir.
in order to establish a claim under strickland,walker must show both that his counsel was deficient and that the deficiency was prejudicial norris performance was deficient only if her performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness as determined by comparison to prevailing professional norms.strickland,at.in evaluating this prong,judicial scrutiny of counsel performance must be highly deferential.id.at.such deference applies equally to strickland claims that allege failure to investigate,such as walker 
s trategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable and strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation.in other words,counsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.in any ineffectiveness case,a particular decision not to investigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances,applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel judgments.
in wiggins,the supreme court,applying this passage from strickland,rejected the contention that,if counsel has made a tactical decision not to present a particular type of evidence in mitigation,a limited investigation into that mitigating evidence is per se reasonable.instead,the court reasoned,it must be determined whether the investigation supporting counsel decision not to introduce that mitigating evidence was itself reasonable.wiggins,at.emphasis in original.additionally,of course,strickland requires that the particular decision not to investigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances.at.see also wiggins,at.
walker alleges that norris performance was unreasonable because she failed to further investigate the possibility of organic brain deficiency,after the psychological report suggested at least the possibility of such we disagree.
norris performed a thorough investigation,including into mental incapacity,prior to deciding not to conduct further investigation into the possibility of organic deficiency.norris thus possessed considerable information against which to evaluate the indications of possible organic deficiency referenced in the psychological report.
norris had investigated the particular mitigating factor of mental incapacity in some detail.she had reviewed walker school records,which included several psychological reports,investigated the circumstances of the crimes,interviewed walker family and walker himself,and consulted a mental health expert,who evaluated walker mental capacity.norris had asked walker and his mother to fill out a questionnaire which was returned largely incomplete.she had requested from walker a list of mitigation witnesses which he did not provide.though they did not exist,norris had looked for social services records.she had interviewed walker girlfriends,wife,mother,brother,cousins,uncle,church group leader,and former lawyers and jailers.norris had considered interviewing walker and friends,but walker wife had told norris that her parents would not help and that walker friends were all thugs and would not come near a courthouse.norris also had obtained church records and visited the houses in which walker had grown up.finally,she had consulted a mental health expert,who had interviewed walker and performed psychological testing.
at oral argument,walker own counsel even conceded that norris had investigated many potential pieces of an investigation into mental incapacity.
paralleling her extensive investigation into possible mental incapacity,norris had undertaken a much broader mitigation investigation as well.this investigation had led norris to conclude that the fact that walker performed well in structured environments represented the most effective mitigation possible.that walker performed well in such environments,norris had determined,was apparent from walker school records.it was a fact that norris had confirmed through interviews with walker jailers.
in light of the information known to norris through this extensive investigation into mitigation,norris decision not to pursue further the possibility of organic brain deficiency was eminently reasonable.
in the first place,the report did not even conclude that walker had an organic brain deficiency.instead,it only raised the possibility of such and suggested that the possibility be rule d out.in the face of this tentative observation of possibility,norris had amassed enormous amounts of information confirming,if not that walker was not mentally impaired,certainly that he was not impaired to a degree that would be reasonably considered mitigating.
the particular manner in which walker committed his crimes did not support a persuasive argument of mental impairment at the time of commission.of all the witnesses that norris consulted,none suggested that walker had at any time before the murders seemed to be uncontrollable.thomas independent evaluation of walker,which concluded that walker had an of,contradicted the suggestion that he was mentally retarded.the remainder of the school records,including three psychological reports,notably failed to suggest any possibility of mental retardation or organic brain dysfunction,instead labeling walker only a slow learner.norris own interactions with walker did not suggest to her that he was mentally retarded.finally,the testimony of walker family,norris had concluded,would not have supported an argument that walker was somehow brain damaged.
walker appears to contend that his organic brain deficiency would have been mitigating precisely because it impairs his social skills and judgment,causes abnormal thinking and reasoning,results in an inability to experience emotions like a normal adult,and limits his capacity to perform everyday tasks.see br.of appellant at.norris,however,had conducted a thorough investigation,through which she learned of walker ability to adapt to different environments,his interactions with others,his conduct surrounding the murders,and his mental capacities as evaluated by thomas,and discovered no evidence of any such impairments,or at least none to an extent that would have reasonably be seen as mitigating in other words,even if walker did have an organic brain deficiency,norris was already in possession of substantial evidence that tended to confirm that that deficiency did not manifest itself in such a way as to permit a persuasive case in mitigation,if a case at all.against the backdrop of this information learned by norris through her extensive efforts to develop a case in mitigation,her decision not to reopen her investigation based on the tentative observation in the school report that organic deficiency should be ruled out,was both reasonable and fully consistent with wiggins.
it is not even clear that exceptionally zealous counsel would have pursued the suggestion of an organic deficiency in walker psychological report,in light of the information known to norris through her investigation.but,in any event,the supreme court has repeatedly emphasized that strickland does not require counsel to investigate every conceivable line of mitigating evidence no matter how unlikely the effort would be to assist the defendant at sentencing.wiggins,at.a petitioner can always highlight some possible further investigative action counsel could have taken but the reasonableness of an investigation,or a decision by counsel that forecloses the need for an investigation,must be considered in light of the scarcity of counsel time and resources in preparing for a sentencing hearing and the reality that counsel must concentrate his efforts on the strongest arguments in favor of mitigation.byram ozmint,cir.norris had examined a great deal of evidence in mitigation,and believed that an argument that walker was unable to control his behavior would tend to support the government argument that he constituted a future danger,rather than support the arguments in mitigation that she had decided upon.norris decided to allocate her resources to building this mitigation case,focused upon walker family and walker responsiveness to structure,in light of her judgment that it was highly unlikely that a persuasive case for mental incapacity existed.this decision was made after extensive investigation into mitigation generally and the mitigating factor of mental incapacity specifically,and grounded in the realization that the only evidence that any mental incapacity might even exist was weak when weighed against the substantial evidence that such incapacity either did not exist at all or did not exist to such an extent that an effective case in mitigation could be built thereupon.it was a decision well within the bounds of reasonableness.
our conclusion that norris performance was reasonable is confirmed by the considerable differences between her performance and that of wiggins counsel.wiggins counsel had consulted only three sources to prepare a mitigation case,none of which revealed detailed information about wiggins life history.wiggins,at.first,counsel had arranged for a psychologist to conduct tests on wiggins,but the psychologist reported no evidence about wiggins life history.id.second,counsel reviewed a presentence investigation psi report,which included a summary of wiggins personal history,noting that he had spent much of his life in foster care and that he described his background as disgusting.id.finally,counsel reviewed the records of the baltimore city department of social services documenting wiggins time in foster homes,including his physical and sexual abuse.id.
the court concluded that this investigation was insufficient to support counsel decision not to introduce evidence of wiggins life history,as it gave counsel only rudimentary knowledge of wiggins history from a narrow set of sources.id.at.norris,in contrast,consulted multiple sources to acquire a knowledge of walker and the crimes he committed.
the supreme court also held that wiggins was entitled to relief because counsel limited investigation uncovered evidence that wiggins suffered a troubled childhood,and any reasonably competent attorney would have realized that pursuing these leads was necessary to making an informed choice among possible defenses.id.at.norris had no such evidence before her of possible mitigating factors that she had not considered instead,the evidence she failed to further investigate concerned a mitigating factor,mental incapacity,that she had already extensively investigated and found to be either not present or not useful in mitigation.
we have recognized previously that wiggins does not require that the court grant the writ in cases in which,in contrast to wiggins,counsel has undertaken extensive investigation.see,wilson ozmint,cir distinguishing wiggins on the grounds that wilson counsel performed a thorough investigation,even if counsel did not hire a social service worker to conduct an extended family history investigation tucker ozmint,cir.as our review of norris investigation makes clear,this is such a case.
finally,it is notable that,in contrast to wiggins,there is no indication that norris failure to investigate brain dysfunction any further was anything other than a reasoned strategic decision.wiggins,at.unlike the failure of wiggins counsel to pursue a coherent strategy that explained their investigation into mitigating evidence,norris approach at the sentencing hearing,where she introduced the school records and presented testimony to support the fact that walker performance improved when he was placed in classes for learning disabled students,was fully consistent with her avowed strategy of focusing on walker responsiveness to structure.
norris thus performed an investigation into mental incapacity that was reasonable under all the circumstances,and substantially distinguishable from that in wiggins.this is not to say that norris investigation definitively disproved the existence of an organic brain deficiency certainly it did not.it is only to say that no more than this investigation was required in order for norris performance to be reasonable under these circumstances,the state court decision that she was not ineffective was not an unreasonable application of strickland.
walker argues that if we do not grant the writ of habeas corpus,we must at least grant him an evidentiary hearing.the district court denied walker motion for an evidentiary hearing,and we review this denial for abuse of discretion,hill ozmint,cir.
a petitioner will not,absent the fulfilment of certain statutory requirements,receive an evidentiary hearing in federal district court if the petitioner failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in state court.fullwood lee,cir quoting e.neither party suggests that the bar of section e is implicated by this case.although section e thus does not bar an evidentiary hearing,walker is still not entitled to such a hearing unless he alleges additional facts that,if true,would entitle him to relief.id.quoting mccarver lee,cir.walker must also satisfy one of the six factors the court identified in townsend sain,d see fullwood,at.
here,walker is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing because he has not alleged any facts which,if true,would entitle him to relief.although he generally alleges that norris investigation was not reasonable and that her attempts to gather information were limited and inept,walker does not dispute,and certainly offers no evidence to contradict,norris representations as to the specific steps she took to investigate possible mitigating defenses instead,his most relevant factual contentions allege only that norris failed to take numerous further investigatory steps that she does not allege she took that she,not he,was to blame for the delay in the receipt of the school records and that thomas would have come to a different conclusion regarding walker mental capacity had he been presented with the school records.because we have concluded that the investigation into mental incapacity recounted by norris and not disputed by walker was reasonable,these facts,even if true,would not change our application of strickland.the district court thus did not abuse its discretion in denying walker an evidentiary hearing.
conclusion 
for the reasons stated,the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
with new information can come new duties to investigate.the issue here is not whether walker counsel conducted an appropriate initial investigation.rather,it is whether,once this investigation uncovered some evidence of organic brain dysfunction,walker attorney pursued this lead as would a reasonably competent and diligent attorney.she did not,so i respectfully dissent.
one passage of the majority opinion succinctly captures the five fundamental flaws in the purported reasoning of norris,walker lead counsel.it states that she 
concluded that the evidence in favor of organic brain deficiency was not likely to be persuasive,because there was only a single suggestion of such a problem in all of walker records,and neither her expert,nor the facts of the crime,nor the testimony of witnesses supported that walker suffered from such a problem.in addition,norris believed that arguing organic dysfunction would undermine the remainder of her mitigation strategy by supporting the government argument that walker would be a future danger in prison.
ante at citations omitted,numbers added.close analysis of these five claims which are simply unquestioned restatements of norris version of things reveals why walker counsel conduct was both deficient and prejudicial under strickland and wiggins.
first,walker counsel could not have reasonably concluded that an organic brain dysfunction argument was not likely to be persuasive unless she had first fully investigated and diligently developed that evidence.see wiggins smith,d rejecting counsel attempt to justify their limited investigation as reflecting a tactical judgment n
