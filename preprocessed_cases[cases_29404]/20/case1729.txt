thomas sawyer sawyer,a michigan prisoner,was convicted in two separate trials of first and criminal sexual conduct,kidnaping,and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.the district courts denied his petitions for a writ of habeas corpus and his requests for an evidentiary hearing.we now affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
on march,lucas james lundberg was kidnaped at gunpoint near his home in ingham county,michigan,and forced to engage in oral sex by a stranger who subsequently released him.on may,sandra miller miller was kidnaped at gunpoint near her home in hillsdale county,michigan,and forced to engage in oral sex by a stranger who subsequently released her.during the second incident,the stranger made miller take off her clothes and underwear,which he returned before releasing her.police investigation resulted in sawyer arrest for both assaults.
on june,after a hillsdale county jury had convicted sawyer of first and criminal sexual conduct,kidnaping,and three counts of possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony,sawyer was sentenced to two concurrent terms of years imprisonment for the criminal sexual conduct and kidnaping charges,a concurrent term of years for the criminal sexual conduct charge,and a consecutive term of two years for the charges.the michigan court of appeals affirmed sawyer conviction and sentence on january,and the michigan supreme court denied leave to appeal.
on november,after an ingham county jury had convicted sawyer of kidnaping,criminal sexual conduct,and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony,sawyer was sentenced to concurrent terms of life imprisonment for the kidnaping charge and years imprisonment for the criminal sexual conduct charge,plus a consecutive term of two years for the charge.the michigan court of appeals affirmed sawyer conviction and sentence on february,and the michigan supreme court denied leave to appeal.
on august,sawyer filed,pro se,a petition for a writ of habeas corpus for his conviction and sentence in the hillsdale county case,raising six claims.the matter was referred to a magistrate judge,who recommended that the district court dismiss sawyer petition.on july,the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation and summarily dismissed the case.on july,sawyer filed a rule motion to alter or amend the judgment,which was denied on august.on september,sawyer filed a notice of appeal.sawyer then applied for a certificate of appealability coa,which the district court granted with respect to the one issue of whether t he lack of a full and fair adjudication,in relation to factual issues concerning the semen stain,in the state court precludes application of the standards of deference arising under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act.joint appendix i at.on april,we construed sawyer notice of appeal as an application for a coa,which we denied with respect to all of the issues that the district court had not certified.on august,we denied sawyer petition for rehearing of the april order.
on february,sawyer filed,pro se,a petition for a writ of habeas corpus for his conviction and sentence in the ingham county case,raising nine claims.the matter was referred to a magistrate judge,who recommended that the district court deny sawyer petition.on january,the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation and dismissed the case,granting a coa only with respect to sawyer claim under brady maryland,d.on january,sawyer filed a timely notice of appeal.
ii.analysis 
in a habeas corpus proceeding,we review a district court legal conclusions de novo and factual findings for clear error.lott coyle,cir,cert.denied,d.because sawyer filed his habeas petitions after the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa became effective,these cases are governed by aedpa.under those provisions,we may not grant a writ of habeas corpus for any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court unless the adjudication 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.in addition,the findings of fact made by a state court are presumed to be correct and can be contravened only if the habeas petitioner can show by clear and convincing evidence that the state court factual findings were erroneous.e.
aedpa provides the following standard for determining whether a petitioner is entitled to an evidentiary hearing 
e if the applicant has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in state court proceedings,the court shall not hold an evidentiary hearing on the claim unless the applicant shows that 
a the claim relies on 
i a new rule of constitutional law,made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the supreme court,that was previously unavailable or 
ii a factual predicate that could not have been previously discovered through the exercise of due diligence and 
b the facts underlying the claim would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that but for constitutional error,no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.
sawyer hofbauer 
sawyer claims to habeas relief rest chiefly on the existence of a semen stain found on miller underwear that contained saliva.sawyer maintains that this evidence is relevant because miller performed fellatio on the perpetrator after which he handled her panties while the victim was blindfolded.i at.the state of michigan contends that the particular facts of the case render this evidence irrelevant,inasmuch as miller testified that she was forced to swallow sawyer discharge and that her underwear w as lying on the other side of the car from where the assault occurred.respondent br.i at.
at trial,kyle ann hoskins,a laboratory scientist for the michigan state police,stated during nontestimonial colloquy that she had discovered traces of semen on miller underwear,but that detective sergeant clifton edwards edwards,the lead investigator in the case,had instructed her that additional analysis of the stain would not be necessary.according to the prosecutor,edwards indicated that the semen had been deposited by a boyfriend.the fact that the police had in fact tested the semen stain against sawyer blood type and obtained a negative result was discovered only after defense counsel made a freedom of information act foia request in,two years after the trial.sawyer then raised the brady claim in his direct appeal,which the state courts rejected.
evidentiary hearing 
sawyer argues that the district court should have held an evidentiary hearing on the negative result of the semen stain because the state courts failed to accord him a full and fair hearing on the issue.we have previously recognized the discretion and inherent authority that a district court always has in habeas cases to order evidentiary hearings to settle disputed issues of material fact.abdur rahman bell,cert.denied,d.in enacting aedpa,congress placed restrictions on this discretion to hold an evidentiary hearing.a petitioner who fail s to develop the factual basis of a claim in state court proceedings is not entitled to a federal evidentiary hearing unless he meets certain stringent requirements.e.in michael williams taylor,d,the supreme court interpreted the opening clause of e as follows a failure to develop the factual basis of a claim is not established unless there is lack of diligence,or some greater fault,attributable to the prisoner or the prisoner counsel.id.at.the williams court then explained that a finding of diligence would depend upon whether the prisoner made a reasonable attempt,in light of the information available at the time,to investigate and pursue claims in state court.id.at.
sawyer alleges that he first learned about the existence of the semen stain on miller underwear from a police report that was delivered to defense counsel one or two days before trial.petitioner br.i at.when this issue was brought before the trial court,the prosecutor indicated that the police had instructed its laboratory scientist not to test the sample because it had been deposited by miller boyfriend.see supra.defense counsel sought forensic testing of the semen stain during and after trial.in november,while this case was before the michigan court of appeals on direct appeal,defense counsel learned about the negative test result pursuant to a foia request.defense counsel then filed a motion for consideration of the recently discovered brady violation as an issue on appeal.i at.when the state courts rejected this argument sawyer filed the instant habeas petition in the district court.we therefore conclude that aedpa standard for an evidentiary hearing does not apply because sawyer was diligent in pursuing his brady claim in the michigan courts.
the question before us,then,is whether the district court abused its discretion in denying sawyer an evidentiary hearing in federal court.we have indicated that a habeas petitioner is generally entitled to such a hearing if he alleges sufficient grounds for release,relevant facts are in dispute,and the state courts did not hold a full and fair evidentiary hearing.stanford parker,cir quoting wilson kemna,cir,petition for cert.filed.
sawyer petitions this court for habeas relief on the basis of an alleged violation of brady,which requires the prosecution to provide evidence that is both favorable to the defendant and material to his guilt or innocence.brady,at.favorable evidence is material if there is a reasonable probability that,had the evidence been disclosed to the defense,the result of the proceeding would have been different.kyles whitley,d quoting united states bagley,d.the relevant question is whether sawyer in the absence of material evidence received a fair trial,understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.id.at.
the undisclosed negative result of the test on the semen stain is exculpatory if sawyer can establish that the perpetrator of the crime for which he was convicted was the source of the semen on miller underwear.the michigan court of appeals doubted whether sawyer could make such a showing 
the facts of the crime in this case were unlikely to have resulted in a semen deposit on complainant underwear.defendant exculpatory theory about the evidence is highly speculative and reversal is not required on this basis.moreover,defendant speculative theory would have required complainant to testify concerning consensual sexual activity with her boyfriend in direct violation of the rape shield statute.
people sawyer,per curiam citations omitted.however,miller testified to wearing clean clothing on the day of the attack and then giving those clothes to state troopers after the attack.she also testified that the perpetrator had handed her clothing and underwear back to her after making her take them off.therefore,the existence of a semen stain on miller underwear from a source other than sawyer would have been favorable to him.although the allegation at trial was that the sole act of sexual penetration was one of fellatio,the perpetrator could have wiped or cleaned himself with miller underwear before handing it back to miller.
the negative test result,which was thus exculpatory,was also material to sawyer guilt or innocence.as the state of michigan itself acknowledges,the evidence against sawyer can not fairly be described as overwhelming.respondent br.i at.because juries may convict a defendant only if the prosecution proves guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,it is reasonably probable that the disclosure of a semen stain on miller underwear from a source other than sawyer would have changed the result of sawyer trial 
having determined that sawyer has alleged sufficient grounds for release,we next consider whether relevant facts are in dispute.the fact that sawyer was not the source of the semen stain on miller underwear is beyond dispute.other facts,such as the identity of the person who deposited the semen,are in dispute.however,they are not relevant to the disposition of this case.a prosecutor violates due process when he suppresses evidence that is favorable to an accused and material either to guilt or to punishment.brady,at.it is simply irrelevant whether that or other evidence is unfavorable to someone other than the defendant.the alleged brady violation in this case involves the suppression of the negative test result,which is clearly established by the record before us and which an evidentiary hearing would only confirm.therefore,instead of remanding this case to the district court,we will examine the merits of sawyer brady claim.
brady claim 
sawyer argues that we should not defer to the state court denial of this claim because he was not afforded a full and fair hearing on the issue of the semen stain.we have not yet addressed the question whether a full and fair hearing is a prerequisite to the application of aedpa more deferential standards.however,because sawyer brady claim has merit even under aedpa standards,we leave for another day the question of aedpa applicability in the absence of a full and fair hearing in the state courts.
under clearly established supreme court precedent,a defendant is entitled to evidence that is both favorable to him and material to his guilt or innocence.brady,at.in this case,the prosecution failed to provide the negative test result of the semen stain on miller underwear.we have previously discussed why this evidence was favorable and material.the state court discussion of sawyer brady claim,however,focused on the fact that the trial court refused to order dna testing of a semen stain on miller underpants it did not address the fact that the police had tested the semen stain against sawyer blood type,obtained a negative result,and then suppressed this evidence.sawyer,at.yet it was the suppression of the negative test result that gave rise to sawyer brady claim,because the mere existence of the semen stain was disclosed to defense counsel before trial.we conclude that the michigan courts inapposite,its complete failure even to identify the evidence that was an unreasonable application of brady and therefore reverse the district court denial of habeas relief on this claim.
sawyer stovall 
in this case,sawyer seeks habeas relief from his ingham county conviction on the basis of the brady violation in the hillsdale county case,asserting that the two cases are connected.in dismissing sawyer brady claim,which it deemed rambling and confused,the michigan court of appeals observed that the issue deal t with evidence in other cases not relevant here.people sawyer.although this conclusion appears rather summary to us,we affirm the district court dismissal of the brady claim in this case,having determined that sawyer is not entitled to habeas relief whether we review de novo or under aedpa.there is no reasonable probability that the disclosure of the negative test result in the hillsdale county case would have changed the result of sawyer trial in ingham county.as the district court noted,the evidence may exculpate sawyer in this case only if sawyer can make the tricky argument that the perpetrator in the hillsdale county case,who allegedly deposited the semen on miller underwear,was also the perpetrator in the ingham county case.joint appendix ii at.we conclude that this sort of logical leap is not one that a jury would have made to find sawyer not guilty,especially given the fact that the victim in this case identified sawyer at trial.although sawyer casts aspersions on the michigan state police suppression of a negative test result in the hillsdale county case,the nondisclosure did not constitute a violation of sawyer constitutional rights in this case.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we reverse the district court denial of sawyer petition for a writ of habeas corpus in hofbauer and remand for the district court to grant the writ within ninety days,unless the state of michigan retries sawyer for the hillsdale county offense.we
