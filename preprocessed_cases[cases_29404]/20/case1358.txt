a jury convicted scott wynne of murdering his neighbor,philip timmerman,and the trial court sentenced him to life in prison.unable to obtain relief from the state courts,wynne petitioned the federal district court for a writ of habeas corpus.the district court granted the writ,holding that the state courts denied wynne his constitutional right to present a complete defense when it refused under state evidentiary rules to admit propensity evidence designed to show that someone,the prosecution key the murder.we reverse.
on may,timmerman was shot to death while working on his farm.no eyewitnesses to the shooting emerged,but several pieces of physical evidence linked wynne to the crime.ballistics evidence identified wynne caliber pistol as the murder weapon.wynne fingerprint appeared on the weapon ammunition magazine.and footprints at the crime scene matched boots found in wynne house.wynne also had a motive.three days after the shooting,wynne friend mark peckham contacted the police,telling them that he had heard wynne say he wanted to kill timmerman on several occasions,apparently because he thought timmerman lease on the wynne family farm would terminate upon timmerman death.wynne was so frustrated about his land dispute with timmerman,peckham said,that he spoke with peckham ten to thirty times about murdering timmerman,sometimes in conversations that turned into detailed descriptions of how he would carry out the crime.
in october,wynne stood trial for timmerman murder.as part of his defense,wynne alleged that peckham had killed timmerman.the trial court allowed wynne to introduce the following evidence to support this theory peckham wanted to frame him to retaliate for various wrongs,including wynne purported firing of peckham five months before the murder peckham acknowledged he had fired some of wynne guns in the past and knew where wynne kept most of his guns,including the caliber murder weapon peckham told an investigator he was really pissed at wynne because wynne had everything given to him and never returned anything to his family,app x at and peckham insurance agent testified that peckham had told him at least three or four times in the week after wynne arrest that peckham was going to put wynne away,id.at.
the trial court,however,drew the line at evidence directed only to peckham bad character.the court excluded testimony by peckham former girlfriend that,eight years before the murder when she was in middle school,he had threatened to cut off the fingers of a classmate who touched her breasts.it excluded her testimony that,several years earlier,peckham had abused her and threatened to kill her and that peckham trailer mysteriously burned down within hours of their.it excluded testimony that,after a failed suicide attempt five years earlier,peckham declined psychologically,becoming passive aggressive and intent on exacting revenge in secretive ways.id.at.and it excluded evidence of peckham alleged admission to a several months before the murder that he had done something so bad in his past that if the police ever found out about it he would go to prison for life.id.at.
the trial court also excluded evidence about peckham apparent interest in women underwear.at some point during the trial,wynne investigator discovered a blue bag in wynne house,which contained a boot with tread that matched the footprints found at the crime scene.the defense did not mention until several days after delivering the bag to the court that it found a black camisole near the bag.with this evidence,the defense sought to link peckham to the bag via his apparent underwear fascination,but the court would not allow it.
a jury convicted wynne of murder,and the trial court sentenced him to life in prison.see people wynne,wl,at.after failing to obtain relief in the state courts,wynne filed a petition for a writ of federal habeas corpus in june,arguing that the trial court violated his constitutional right to present a complete defense by excluding the peckham evidence.in september,the district court granted the writ.see.after the state filed a notice of appeal,both parties alerted the district court that it had premised part of its ruling on several factual inaccuracies in wynne pleadings,which the michigan attorney general office had failed to notice.at wynne request,we remanded the case to the district court to take a second look at the case,including the new light cast on it by the revised characterizations of the evidence.in january,the district court issued a supplemental opinion,which also granted the writ but revised its reasons for doing so.see.
although wynne filed his habeas petition after the and effective death penalty act of went into effect,see lindh murphy,we give fresh review to his federal claim because the state courts addressed only his state law grounds for relief,see wynne,wl,at,which means they did not adjudicate the federal claim on the merits,d see maples stegall,f d,cir where,as here,the state court did not assess the merits of a claim properly raised in a habeas petition,the deference due under aedpa does not apply.the state does not argue that wynne has failed to exhaust his federal claim in the state courts or that a procedural bar otherwise applies to this claim.
the constitution guarantees a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense,crane kentucky,quotation marks omitted,but not an unlimited right to ride roughshod over reasonable evidentiary restrictions,rockwell yukins,cir en banc.a defendant must comply with established rules of procedure and evidence designed to assure both fairness and reliability in the ascertainment of guilt and innocence.chambers mississippi.the right to present a complete the culpability defense raised does not mean that a defendant may introduce whatever evidence he wishes,only that any evidentiary restrictions can not be arbitrary or disproportionate to the purposes they are designed to serve.united states scheffer,quotation marks omitted.
the question here,then,is not whether the michigan courts properly construed one of the state evidentiary rules,namely evidence rule b s prohibition against introducing character evidence to show that an individual acted consistently with the evidence.it is whether the state courts construction of their evidentiary matter for them,not for us,to the sixth amendment right to present a complete defense.
unfortunately for wynne,we already have resolved the point.in united states lucas,cir,the defendant tried to introduce propensity previous conviction for cocaine prove that a third party,not the defendant,committed a drug crime.id.at.relying on federal rule b,which likewise bars evidence about a person character in order to show action in conformity therewith,the district court excluded the evidence.in affirming,we first explained that federal rule b applies to all propensity evidence,whether used to show that the defendant or another individual acted in conformity with their prior misconduct.id.at.we then rejected lucas constitutional argument.the sixth amendment right to present a complete defense,we explained,does not imply a right to offer evidence that is otherwise inadmissible under the standard rules of evidence.id.and t he exclusion of the third party prior conviction,we explained,did not violate lucas constitutional right to present a defense,because lucas was able to explore her theory that another individual was in fact the culprit through other evidence.id.at.
what was true in lucas is true today.just as federal rule b permissibly limited lucas right to introduce propensity evidence directed toward a third party,so the same kind of state law evidentiary essentially the same rule,see.evid.b permissibly limited wynne right to introduce propensity evidence about peckham.and just as this rule did not bar lucas from introducing other evidence to support this defense,so the same was true for wynne,who introduced considerable evidence in support of the defense.the court,for example,allowed wynne to introduce the following peckham wanted to frame wynne to retaliate for various wrongs,including wynne purported firing of peckham five months before the murder
