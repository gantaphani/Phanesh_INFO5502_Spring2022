david allen gardner appeals the district court denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to.he was convicted of capital murder in the course of a kidnaping and was sentenced to death.after exhausting his remedies at the state level,gardner applied for a writ of habeas corpus which the district court denied.we granted a certificate of appealability coa limited to determining whether the state psychiatrists warnings to gardner were sufficient to ensure that his consent to be examined was informed,thereby negating any potential violation of his fifth amendment right against compulsory that might otherwise have resulted from the punishment phase timely the assertedly prejudicial testimony of the psychiatrist who conducted that exam.as we conclude that this constitutional right was violated by the admission of the testimony of the psychiatrist who examined gardner on behalf of the state of texas and that gardner suffered prejudice from that violation,we reverse the decision of the district court,grant gardner petition for a writ of habeas corpus,and remand for entry of an appropriate judgment vacating his sentence and allowing the state a reasonable time within which to conduct a new,constitutionally valid sentencing proceeding or,alternatively,to resentence gardner to life imprisonment in conformity with texas law.
facts and proceedings 
the facts of gardner crime of conviction are set forth in the opinion of the texas court of criminal appeals cca disposing of gardner direct appeal gardner stopped and picked up a pair of old runaway hitchhikers,turned down a gravel road,and pulled off beside a bridge.after he told the teenagers to get out of the car,the three walked down an embankment where gardner stabbed the male numerous times and left him for dead,then took the female to a nearby lake where he stabbed her numerous times,hit her in the head with a rock,and abandoned her as well.the male lived but the female died.
the state procedural history of gardner case is highly significant to our consideration today,so we review it in detail.during the sentencing phase of gardner murder trial,the state introduced only two evidentiary matters evidence that,some years prior to committing the instant crime,gardner had fled the state of kentucky after being released on bond while awaiting trial on two charges of theft and testimony of clay griffith,who had,pursuant to a court order,conducted a psychiatric evaluation of gardner.after telling the jury that he had testified in p robably three thousand criminal trials griffith stated with one hundred percent certainty that,in his professional opinion,gardner would commit violent acts in the future,he was super dangerous,and he would kill again given any chance at all.griffith testimony also included his professional opinion that gardner would continue to be violent even if placed in incarceration and this would not prevent his violence and his brutality.and,added griffith,gardner showed absolutely no remorse through the interview and his tearful confession of the murder was not credible because gardner could turn tears on and off at will.
after his objection to the admission of griffith testimony was overruled and the psychiatrist was allowed to testify,defense counsel griffith extensively and also presented three favorable character witnesses on gardner behalf.two of gardner former testified that he was a good employee and that they had never seen him exhibit any improper or violent conduct.the chief jailer of the parker county sheriff office,where gardner was held while awaiting trial,testified that gardner was a model prisoner who had never caused any problems.
the record shows that,even though gardner was already represented by defense counsel,his attorney was not present either when gardner consented to the psychiatric examination or at any time during the course of the examination itself.in fact,it is clear from the record that defense counsel had no knowledge that his client was to be examined and that the state made little or no effort to inform counsel in advance 
during his testimony at the punishment phase of gardner trial,griffith stated that he informed 
the defendant what he was coming for,for a psychiatric examination that this was ordered by judge hopkins.we informed him that a report would have to be sent to the court stating our findings so far as whether he was competent to stand trial,whether he,in our opinion,was sane or insane at the time of the alleged offense that in the state of texas,there is no confidentiality so that anything that he might say could be used against him,or could be used for him at some later date in the courtroom emphasis added.
counsel for gardner timely objected to the admission of griffith testimony at the punishment phase.in gardner direct appeal,counsel contested the admission of griffith testimony on the grounds that he had unlawfully induced gardner consent by telling him that the examination could be used against him or could be used for him at some later date in the courtroom.unpersuaded,the cca affirmed gardner conviction and death sentence.
gardner petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in state court.he reiterated his objection to the admission of griffith testimony,this time emphasizing that the warnings given prior to the examination were constitutionally deficient under estelle smith because he was not adequately informed that the results of the exam could be used against him during the punishment phase of the trial to secure the death penalty the state trial court,after entering its findings of fact and conclusions of law,recommended that habeas relief be denied.the cca denied relief,stating that gardner had already raised his estelle smith claim on direct appeal.
gardner filed a second state habeas petition,stressing that he had not raised his estelle smith claim on direct appeal and that the earlier decision of the cca was therefore erroneous.as a result,the cca ordered a state trial court to conduct an evidentiary hearing to clarify the content of the warnings given to gardner by griffith prior to the psychiatric examination.at the hearing held in,fifteen years after griffith psychiatric examination of gardner,james grigson who had aided griffith in conducting the examination of gardner,testified to what he grigson had told gardner before the examination 
prior to the beginning of the examination i introduced myself,my name,explained that i was a medical doctor,a psychiatrist.introduced griffith.also explained that he was a medical doctor,also a psychiatrist.i did read him the court order signed by judge hopkins.and then i explained to him that it was not confidential because we would be sending back a report discussing it.i explained to him that the motion had been filed by the district attorney to have the examination.and the purpose was to examine him in three areas,competency,sanity,and dangerousness.and i explained to him at that time that competency did mean whether or not he had sufficient present mental ability to consult with his attorney with a reasonable degree of rational understanding,and whether he had a factual as well as a rational understanding regarding the proceedings against him.he told me he understood that.and then i explained sanity or insanity was defined as whether or not he was suffering from a severe mental disease or defect that prevented him from knowing the difference between right and wrong.and he understood that.i told him dangerousness meant whether or not he represented a continuing threat to society emphasis added.
in denying gardner habeas petition for a second time,the cca ruled that his estelle smith claim was procedurally barred and,in the alternative,that it was without merit gardner filed a motion for rehearing,pointing out that the cca had again incorrectly recounted the procedural history to come up with the conclusion of procedural bar.in apparent recognition of its mistake,the cca granted gardner motion and issued a new opinion which corrected the factual errors of the previous opinion the court did not,however,formally withdraw its earlier opinion,instead leaving it on the books.
the cca new opinion reaffirmed its prior ruling that gardner estelle smith claim was procedurally barred,but the court failed to address the merits of his constitutional claim at all.inasmuch as all parties to the case agree that the procedural bar rule used by the cca was novel and thus inapplicable on federal habeas review,and the perfunctory discussion of the merits of gardner estelle smith complaint was never withdrawn,the cca scant reasoning and ruling on the merits is what is before us today.
having exhausted the remedies available at the state level,gardner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court,which was denied.he appealed that decision to this court,and we granted gardner application for a coa on his fifth amendment estelle smith claim.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
as gardner filed his federal petition for habeas review in,well after the effective date of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,we review his petition under the standards specified in that act the aedpa forbids us to issue a writ of habeas corpus with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the state court adjudication of that claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.a decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than the court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.a decision is an unreasonable application of federal law if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.factual findings of the state court are presumed to be correct,so we defer to them unless they were based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
b.the estelle smith claim 
gardner claims that his fifth amendment right against,as interpreted by the supreme court in estelle smith,was violated by the introduction of griffith testimony at the punishment phase of his trial.in smith,the supreme court held that a capital defendant right against compelled precludes the state from subjecting him to a psychiatric examination concerning future dangerousness without first informing the defendant that he has a right to remain silent and that anything he says can be used against him at the sentencing proceeding.the warnings required under miranda arizona including that the defendant has a right to remain silent and that anything said can and will be used against the individual in court are not sufficient to satisfy the more stringent requirements set forth in estelle to apprise a capital defendant fully of his fifth amendment rights before subjecting him to a psychiatric examination,the defendant must be told that it will be used to gather evidence necessary to decide whether,if convicted,he should be sentenced to death.we conclude that the warnings provided by griffith and grigson,whether viewed separately or in combination,were insufficient fully to apprise gardner of his constitutional rights moreover,we conclude that the cca decision that held those warnings to be sufficient was an unreasonable application of existing federal law.
the cca made a factual determination that griffith had made the warning in that he testified to during gardner trial,and that grigson had made his warning in that he testified at the evidentiary hearing to having made.although,given the vast number of trials at which grigson testified,we find remarkable his ability to remember his specific warning to gardner some fifteen years after the fact,we are constrained by the aedpa to conclude that the cca factual findings that the doctors said what they said they said are not unreasonable and thus must be accorded the specified deference.
on the strength of these factual findings,the cca made two rulings on the merits of gardner smith claim.in the first,the cca held that griffith warnings to gardner that statements he would make in the course of the examination could be used against him at some later date in the courtroom sufficiently informed gardner that his statements could be used against him at the punishment stage of his capital murder trial since that went on in the courtroom and that a warning that a statement may be used against a defendant conveys that the statement could be used at the punishment stage of a capital murder trial.the cca second ruling added that grigson warnings,in combination with those given by griffith,were clearly sufficient under estelle smith at the evidentiary hearing,grigson testified that in he had informed gardner that he was being examined for dangerousness which,grigson explained to gardner,meant whether or not he represented a continuing threat to society.the cca concluded that,in conjunction with griffith statement,this more than complies with estelle smith.
as noted,the aedpa mandates that habeas petitions be granted only if the state court adjudication of the claim either resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.being disjunctive,each of these two prongs is to be accorded independent meaning,so habeas relief can be granted if the prisoner prevails on either prong although we can not say that the decision of the cca was contrary to the law as established in estelle smith because the cca clearly did apply the correct legal rule to the pertinent facts,the cca application of that rule obviously produced an incorrect result.thus our relevant inquiry is whether the cca application of clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states produced a result that is not merely wrong but is so wrong that it is unreasonable.we conclude that it did.
the supreme court,in the recent case of williams taylor clarified the standard of review of habeas petitions under the aedpa.in her majority opinion,justice does not purport to define the term reasonable but does offer useful guidance.her opinion first makes clear that the standard is an objective one,specifically rejecting our previously employed,subjective all reasonable jurists standard she then describes a relatively broad range along the reasonableness continuum at any point on which a state court decision might be held to be an unreasonable application of federal law to be unreasonable,the state decision must be more than merely incorrect but can be something less than the stringent all reasonable jurists standard under which the mere fact that reasonable jurists may disagree about the result requires the state court decision to be upheld 
although we have addressed williams unreasonable application rule on several occasions,we have done little to clarify the supreme court standard in that case other circuits have addressed the issue too and in several instances have offered helpful clarifications of the williams standard.for instance,the tenth circuit,after noting the importance of the objective nature of the standard,held that the fact that one court or even a few courts have applied the precedent in the same manner to close facts does not make the state court decision reasonable.
the ninth circuit in van tran lindsey held that the williams unreasonable application standard generally allows for reversals only where the court of appeals is left with a definite and firm conviction that an error has been committed.as the van tran court went on to explain,
we must reverse a state court decision as involving an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law when our independent review of the legal question does not merely allow us ultimately to conclude that the petitioner has the better of two reasonable legal arguments,but rather leaves us with a firm conviction that one answer,the one rejected by the state court,was correct and the other,the application of the federal law that the court adopted,was erroneous 
we also note another insightful observation made in van tran the ninth circuit emphasized that in williams the supreme court 
rejected the interpretation,adopted in various forms by the fourth,fifth,seventh,and eleventh circuits,that defines reasonableness on the basis of whether reasonable jurists could disagree about the result reached by the state court.instead,the court adopted an objectively unreasonable standard,employing language used in decisions by the third and eight circuits.
this is doubly significant when viewed in the context of the third and eighth circuits adoption of the same test as williams because both circuits found the reasonable jurists standard to be too deferential to state courts,clearly implying that the supreme court preferred a more stringent habeas review of state court decisions.
although williams teaches that state court decisions should not be reversed merely because they are,just because we would have reached a different opinion makes equally clear that neither should such decisions be upheld when we conclude that the state court has not just misapplied the law to the facts but has done so in an objectively unreasonable manner.stated another way,even though the aedpa requires the federal courts to show more deference to state court decisions than they would in a de novo review,this can not be interpreted to mean that an objectively unreasonable application of federal law should be allowed to stand.even though we can not reverse a decision merely because we would reach a different outcome,we must reverse when we conclude that the state court decision applies the correct legal rule to a given set of facts in a manner that is so patently incorrect as to be unreasonable.
that is clearly the case here.the cca first held that griffith warning to gardner that his statements during the examination could be used against him at some later date in the courtroom sufficiently informed gardner that his statements could be used against him at the punishment stage of his capital murder trial since that went on in the courtroom.this well in advance of trial,to a layman with no legal training,out of the presence of his can not be stretched to the point of having apprise d gardner of his rights and allowed him knowingly to decide to waive them.not,at least,when the rights in question are those recognized in estelle smith as clearly requiring warnings to the defendant that the adverse use in question means use at the punishment stage to accomplish the state goal of obtaining the death penalty.
many events take place in a courtroom during the protracted course of a criminal arraignment,various evidentiary hearings,the phase of the and in addition to the sentencing phase of the trial.such a vague reference in the courtroom can not possibly suffice to fulfill estelle smith strict requirement that the defendant be informed that his words and the results of the psychiatric examination can and will be used against him at the sentencing phase to secure the death penalty.in like manner,the general phrase may be used against him in no way narrows or identifies the point in the criminal proceeding at which gardner statements and the results of the examination could and would be used against him or for what specific purpose.
we repeat for emphasis that griffith vague and ambiguous words could reasonably be interpreted by an uninitiated layman to mean that the results of the examination could be used a by the court no mention of the prosecution b to determine mental competency to stand trial and the defendant own statements no mention of the test results or the examining psychiatrist opinions could be used against him in court the cca then supplemented its holding with an alternative conclusion when taken together,the warnings given by griffith and grigson gave gardner adequate notice of his rights under estelle smith.although grigson his reference to determining gardner dangerousness,as explained to mean whether gardner represented a continuing threat to society might be viewed by some as slightly more informative than those given by griffith,it is patently unreasonable to say that they meet the standards of estelle smith.as grigson testified,his warnings were gleaned from the language of opinions authored by a texas state court judge and this court.an experienced defense counsel or even,perhaps,a career criminal in jailhouse legalese,might recognize this language as a reference,however oblique,to the arcane terms of art in the texas special issue of future dangerousness which in turn signal reference to the penalty phase of a capital trial.to most laymen,however,particularly unsophisticated and undereducated members of society with no legal training or experience and unaccompanied by counsel,this language can not reasonably be read to satisfy even minimally the strictures of estelle smith.indeed,if layman such as gardner could be expected to grasp the hidden significance of such legal buzz words and thus be deemed to have been adequately informed of their constitutional rights in such settings,then prophylactic warnings such as that mandated by estelle smith would be wholly unnecessary.we can only speculate that the cca extensive treatment of procedural bar,coupled with the relatively short shrift that it gave the estelle smith issue,might account for that court otherwise inexplicable conclusion that the warnings given by griffith and grigson,long before the commencement of even the phase of gardner trial,were sufficient under estelle smith even though neither doctor mentioned or even hinted at the possibility of the introduction of the results of the examination at the punishment phase of the trial to secure a sentence of death.those elements are so clearly required by the supreme court in estelle smith and its progeny that they are indispensable elements to a conclusion of informed consent,itself an indispensable requisite for the waiver of such a basic constitutional right.
the state nevertheless contends that,even if the warnings given by griffith and grigson were inadequate to meet the estelle smith standard,gardner was not prejudiced by the admission of griffith testimony at sentencing.we are well aware that we can not grant habeas relief to a petitioner unless he can show that he suffered actual prejudice from the trial error at issue actual prejudice results when the error had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict.texas argues that gardner was not prejudiced by the introduction of griffith testimony because griffith was thoroughly at the sentencing phase of the trial,and the evidence demonstrated that gardner crime was such a heinous and brutal one that the jury undoubtedly would have sentenced him to death,even if they had not been exposed to the testimony of griffith.we disagree entirely.
griffith testimony was the centerpiece of the evidence presented by the state during the punishment phase of gardner trial.after being introduced to the jury as a medical expert with extensive experience in evaluating the future dangerousness of criminal defendants,griffith testified,with one hundred percent certainty,that gardner would commit violent acts in the future that he was super dangerous,and would kill again given any chance at all and that he would be a danger to others even if incarcerated.would not might,not likely would,but absolutely would.griffith further testified that gardner exhibited no remorse for his crimes and that any behavior to the contrary should not to be believed.
those words,spoken by a highly credentialed and experienced expert bearing the imprimatur of the state,constitute as great if not greater prejudice to gardner than that suffered by the criminal defendants in satterwhite texas and vanderbilt collins both cases in which estelle smith violations were found to have actually prejudiced the habeas petitioner.in
