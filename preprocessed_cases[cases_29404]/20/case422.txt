petitioner valentin sorto,convicted of murder and related offenses in new york state court,petitions for a federal writ of habeas corpus on the ground that the state courts unreasonably misapplied batson kentucky,d,and its progeny.during jury selection,sorto twice asserted that the prosecution was discriminating against minority jurors in its exercise of peremptory strikes both challenges were denied for failure to establish a prima facie case of discrimination.resolution of the batson issue in this case requires more information about the possible jurors than the record discloses.only limited portions of jury selection were recorded this court has not been presented with a full transcript of the voir dire,or with data describing the composition of the potential juror pool.because sorto bears the burden of demonstrating an unreasonable application of federal law,the insufficiency of the record defeats his petition,and we therefore affirm.
background 
valentin sorto was arrested for the april,murder of jose alvarez and the severe beating of lazaro cruz.according to the prosecution,sorto and another man retaliated for an attack on their fellow gang member by stabbing alvarez in the neck and chest,leaving him to bleed to death in a stairwell and sorto punched cruz and slashed his hands with a broken glass bottle.sorto and his accomplice were indicted for murder in the second degree,assault in the second degree,and criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree.the accomplice pled guilty sorto went to trial and was convicted.
at sorto trial,jury selection proceeded according to the jury box system,in which groups of fourteen prospective jurors are randomly called from the venire,interviewed,and then challenged by the attorneys.following decision on the challenges for cause,the lawyers are afforded the opportunity to exercise one or more of their twenty peremptory challenges.a new set of potential jurors is then invited into the jury box,and the process repeated until a jury is empaneled.see generally people webb,misc d.
in the first round of jury selection,the prosecution challenged potential juror vidal martinez for cause,citing martinez expressed sympathy for gang members,and his concession that he would have trouble deferring to the interpreter in the translations from spanish.sorto contested the challenge for cause,but allowed that the prosecution would be free to us e one of his peremptories to strike martinez.the trial judge agreed and rejected the challenge for cause.five more jurors were dismissed for cause,all upon objection by the prosecutor.
next,the prosecution exercised peremptory strikes against three jurors i martinez ii carlos rivera,who is of salvadoran descent and iii and john harper,an african american.defendant then raised the first of his two batson objections.defendant argued that martinez was a peace officer who likely would be welcomed by the prosecution but for a discriminatory motive that rivera had filled out an unobjectionable jury questionnaire and that there was no basis for striking him other than his nationality,which was the same as the defendant and that the use of three prosecutorial strikes against three minority potential jurors established under the circumstances a pattern of discrimination 
the prosecution disputed the existence of a prima facie case of discrimination,and accordingly offered no further explanation for its strikes.however,the prosecution withdrew its objection to martinez,thereby empaneling one of the two challenged latino jurors defendant casts the prosecution as a telling implicit admission the court construed it as a token of the good faith.
the state court denied the batson challenge for lack of a prima facie case,but agreed to remain seized of the issue,especially as related to the strike of rivera the court will keep it in mind as we proceed.so certainly we should keep both the questionnaire and the card of rivera.trial tr.at.
only two jurors were successfully empaneled after round one a second set of potential jurors were called to the jury box for voir dire.on this second round,the prosecution challenged hazel mays an african american for cause on the ground that mays had hesitated before agreeing to be fair and impartial,and because she supposedly admitted that she identifie d with the defendant because he is a member of a minority group.when the challenge for cause was denied,the prosecution exercised a peremptory challenge to excuse her.after the peremptory strike of mays,the defendant interposed a second batson challenge,claiming discrimination in regards to the prosecution elimination of mays.emphasis added.the record does not clearly show what evidence was submitted to support the prima facie case at this juncture.defendant did not reprise the eliminations of harper and rivera as evidence to support a prima facie case on this later motion,but the judge may have made that assumption,because he asked,with regard to this second batson challenge,whether defendant placed hispanic and black in the same group.
in response to the second batson challenge,the prosecution spontaneously explained its strike of juror african american dismissed in round though harper was not mentioned as the subject or basis of the second motion.the prosecutor defended that strike on the ground of harper sympathy for his imprisoned nephew,and harper prior hostile with the police.the prosecution did not attempt to explain its strike of rivera,nor was that strike ever mentioned by either party during round two.
next,the prosecution explained that it challenged mays because of her announced with the defendant.in any event,the prosecution asserted that no explanation was needed because no prima facie case had been stated.
the state court dismissed the second batson challenge on the grounds that the defendant had reached the threshold with respect to the particular juror,and in the alternative in case another court were to find differently,that the prosecution had successfully offered,explanations for the dismissals of jurors harper and mays.
sorto state appeal argued inter alia that the trial court erroneously ruled that a prima facie case had not been established after the first round objections,erroneously ruled that a prima facie case had not been established after the second round objection,and erroneously found the prosecution proffered explanations for the harper and mays strikes were.the appellate division treated defendant batson contentions as either unpreserved for appellate review or without merit.people sorto.as to the existence of a batson prima facie case,the parties agree that because the government offered no procedural default argument,the appellate division affirmance constitutes a ruling on the merits for purposes of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa.the new york court of appeals denied leave to appeal.
sorto next petitioned for federal habeas relief,challenging inter alia the batson rulings.the district court denied the petition,but granted a certificate of appealability as to the batson claims.
discussion 
because the appellate division rendered a decision on the merits,our review of the prima facie rulings is governed by aedpa.torres berbary,cir.under aedpa,a petition for a writ of habeas corpus claiming a state court error of law shall not be granted unless the adjudication of the claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.see also williams taylor,d.a n unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court precedent occurs when a state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.torres,at internal citations omitted.while t he precise method for distinguishing objectively unreasonable decisions from merely erroneous ones is somewhat unclear,it is in this circuit that the objectively unreasonable standard of d means that petitioner must identify some increment of incorrectness beyond error in order to obtain habeas relief.id.internal citations omitted.this court reviews a district court denial of petition for a writ of habeas corpus de novo.harris kuhlmann,cir.
the supreme court decision in batson kentucky,d,and its progeny limit the traditionally unfettered prerogative of exercising peremptory strikes by forbidding certain discrimination in jury selection.the supreme court has generally granted individual courts the leeway to adopt their own procedures to test for discriminatory strikes.see howard senkowski,cir t he decisions recognize the role that remains for lower courts to work out the mechanics for implementing these requirements.that leeway is granted within a procedural framework 
the batson court establish ed a framework for the evidentiary inquiry into whether a peremptory challenge is first,the moving,the party challenging the other party attempted peremptory make a prima facie case that the nonmoving party peremptory is based on race.second,the nonmoving party must assert a reason for the peremptory challenge.the nonmoving party burden at step two is very low a lthough a reason must be given,it need not be persuasive or even plausible.finally,the court must determine whether the moving party carried the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the peremptory challenge at issue was based on race.

the first step of the batson analysis,requiring the showing of a prima facie case,is not meant to be onerous.johnson california,d.however,this stage of the analysis still requires consideration of all relevant circumstances.batson,at.as batson explained 
a pattern of strikes against black jurors included in the particular venire might give rise to an inference of discrimination.similarly,the prosecutor questions and statements during voir dire examination and in exercising his challenges may support or refute an inference of discriminatory purpose.these examples are merely illustrative 
id.the prima facie inquiry is a hurdle that preserves the traditional confidentiality of a lawyer reason for peremptory strikes unless good reason is adduced to invade it while litigants must now explain their motivations for certain strikes,courts must still be mindful of each side historical prerogative to make a peremptory strike or challenge without a reason stated if a prima facie case of discrimination has not been established.dretke,d internal citation omitted.
to establish a prima facie case,a defendant must show facts and circumstances that raise an inference that the prosecutor used the peremptory challenge to exclude potential jurors from the petit jury on account of their race.overton newton,cir.the discharge of this burden may entail a review of prosecutorial strikes over the span of the selection process thus this court has held,on habeas review,that a state court does not act unreasonably where it denies a batson challenge early in the jury selection process.id.at.
where a litigant points to a pattern of strikes as evidence of discrimination,statistical disparities are to be examined as part of the batson prima facie inquiry.united states alvarado,cir.the need to examine statistical disparities may commend a approach.as we held in overton where the batson challenge was brought after seven of ten potential african american jurors were dismissed through peremptory challenges,an early batson challenge limits the state court ability to properly assess a prima facie case 
the trial judge never confront s,and the trial record does not reveal,what the statistics would show at the conclusion of jury selection.if those statistics sufficiently establish the inference that challenges a re based on race,the court could then implement the batson process to ensure that impermissible challenges are not allowed.if,on the other hand,the statistics at the conclusion fail to support a sufficient inference,there would be no need to engage in the process.
overton,at emphasis added.overton concluded that the state trial judge acted reasonably in refus ing to implement batson process for testing each questioned challenge midway in the process.id.at emphasis added.
sorto raised his first batson challenge after only three peremptory strikes.the state court acted reasonably in denying this challenge as premature,while remaining open to reevaluating these strikes as part of a later challenge.accordingly,the district court did not err in denying the habeas petition challenging the denial of the first round batson challenge 
the existence of a prima facie batson case is a mixed question of law and fact.overton,at.on habeas review,then,we will disturb the state court ruling only if it was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law.id.at quoting d.sorto raises no argument that the state court identified the wrong legal standard he therefore must show an unreasonable application.
a state court decision fails the unreasonable application prong of aedpa analysis,if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.id.quoting williams taylor,d.to challenge the application of law to fact,a petitioner must demonstrate the existence of a particular set of facts to which a legal rule was applied we can not say whether a properly identified rule of law was wrongly applied unless we know the set of facts to which the rule was applied.see generally escalera coombe,cir mixed questions of law and fact create subsidiary questions of historical fact.facts on which a petitioner hopes to rely must be established by at least a preponderance of the evidence in the habeas court.galarza keane,cir.
when,as here,a batson prima facie case depends on a pattern of strikes,a petitioner can not establish that the state court unreasonably concluded that the pattern was not sufficiently suspicious unless the petitioner can adduce a record of the baseline factual circumstances attending the batson challenge.a sufficient record would likely include evidence such as the composition of the venire the adversary use of peremptory challenges,the race of the potential jurors stricken,and a clear indication as to which strikes were challenged when and on what ground,and which strikes were cited to the trial court as evidence of a discriminatory intent.that information may be common knowledge in the courtroom based on the shared perceptions of the lawyers and the trial judge but an appellate court does not have the benefit of what can be observed by those in the trial courtroom.therefore,to the appreciable extent that information regarding the jury and the voir dire process bears upon establishing a prima facie case,a sufficient appellate record may depend on a recitation of relevant information on the record in the trial court.
for example,in united states alvarado we stated 
t he prosecution challenge rate against minorities was percent three of six in the selection of the jury of,and percent four of seven in the selection of the jury of plus alternates.whether this rate creates a statistical disparity would require knowing the minority percentage of the venire for example,if the minority percentage of the venire was,it could be expected that a prosecutor,acting without discriminatory intent,would use percent of his challenges against minorities.
cir emphasis added.the analysis is thus driven by information regarding the prosecution strikes so that the federal court can usefully consider a prosecutorial strike pattern in the essential contexts.
the alvarado court met this need by taking judicial notice of the counties that compose the eastern district of new york and the minority percentage of the populations of those counties,and then accepting that percentage as a surrogate for the minority population of the venire.id.at.on direct appeal from a conviction in district court,a panel may,in a suitable case,supplement the record in such a manner though that is a thin basis for assigning discriminatory motive to an officer of the court.but it is one thing to say that a panel may exercise that discretion on direct appeal in a suitable case,and quite another to hold on collateral review that it is contrary to or an unreasonable application of batson for a state court to fail to take judicial notice of such surrogate facts and data,particularly where no such request appears to have been made,and where,for all we know,surrogate data in lieu of record facts may not have been at hand in the state court.in any event,we would in this case decline to exercise our discretion to take judicial notice of the counties from which sorto venire was drawn in order to determine the minority percentages of those counties,or to assume that those percentages would reflect the ethnic or racial makeup of the venire in sorto trial.
the record before us contains insufficient data as to the prosecution strike pattern to support a finding that the state court unreasonably applied batson.for example,between the strikes of rivera and mays,the prosecution exercised peremptory challenges against potential jurors mink and burdonis.petitioner brief states that mink was not a minority however,we have no particulars about burdonis or about the prospective and empaneled jurors who were not challenged by the prosecution.moreover,sorto lacks any resource in the record to resolve in his favor conflicting reports as to the composition of the venire.at oral argument,petitioner the strikes of rivera and martinez removed all the hispanic potential jurors from the venire.but petitioner brief acknowledges at least one additional hispanic potential juror on the venire potential juror zate.appellant br.at.beyond this,we have no information as to how many hispanic and minority potential jurors remained on the venire after all of the challenged strikes.absent this information,we can not say that the state court acted unreasonably the venire may have overwhelmingly consisted of minority jurors,rendering any individual peremptory strike of a minority juror less suspicious 
the dissent illustrates what happens when insufficient care is taken to build a record of batson discrimination the case is made to depend on a labored piecing together of transcript fragments in an effort to intuit the race and ethnicity of jurors and to reconstruct and imagine what might have happened.
a record in the state trial court is needed also to fix the scope of a given batson challenge and the evidence adduced to support the motion.sorto argues that the state court failure to require a reason for the challenge to rivera was an unreasonable disregard of its duty under batson.petitioner br.at.but the record is far too sketchy to support a conclusion that the state court acted unreasonably in refusing to demand an explanation for the rivera strike.in reviewing the batson challenge,we are unable to identify precisely which strikes were challenged,and on what basis any challenge was made.
seemingly,the round two challenge was limited to the strike of mays sorto described the second round challenge as regard ing the prosecution elimination of mays.trial tr.at emphasis added.petitioner argues that a question posed by the trial judge whether the second round challenge grouped together strikes to african americans and hispanics indicated that the trial court understood that the scope of the renewed batson challenge included all four challenged minority jurors.appellant br.at.this may or may not have been the trial court thinking.but habeas may not be granted based on speculation as to the trial court thought process the record limits the set of challenges under review.petitioner explicitly limited the challenge to the strike of mays the record therefore does not command the conclusion that the strikes to rivera and harper were even in play in the second round and consequently we can not rule that the state court acted unreasonably in refusing to demand an explanation for the strike to rivera.while unrecorded impressions may have given the trial judge certain clues as to the intended scope and basis of the batson challenge,we need a clear record.
the inadequacy of the record is one reason that the trial court rejection of sorto second batson challenge was not unreasonable another independent reason is the preliminary stage at which the challenge was lodged.as discussed above,sorto raised his first challenge after only three peremptory strikes,and accordingly the state court denial of that challenge was reasonable.the same logic applies to sorto second challenge,which came only after the prosecutor sixth peremptory challenge,four fewer than the number in overton,at.between sorto first and second batson challenge,the prosecutor struck potential jurors mink and burdonis neither of them,on the record before us,appears to have been black or hispanic.it was the prosecutor sixth peremptory strike of mays that precipitated sorto second batson challenge,at which point the prosecutor had used four of six peremptory strikes to remove black or hispanic potential jurors.we can not say that this stage of the voir dire was materially less preliminary than the stage at which sorto made his first challenge.accordingly,it was reasonable for the state court to conclude that a problematic pattern of strikes had not yet developed.sorto did not renew his objection in later rounds of voir dire,and so we can not say whether such a pattern ever developed.see id.at.
it is here that the dissent parts ways.despite its agreement that the state court acted reasonably in denying the first batson challenge as premature,the dissent concludes,leaning heavily on green travis,cir,that the state court unreasonably applied batson when it denied sorto second challenge.dissent op.at.between the first premature challenge and the second challenge,the government i withdrew its strike against a hispanic juror martinez,ii struck a juror who was neither african american nor hispanic mink,iii struck a juror who was african american mays,and iv struck a juror who was neither african american nor hispanic burdonis.these intervening events furnish no appreciable support for a finding of discrimination beyond the showing that we all agree was insufficient and premature.
in any event,the dissent reliance on green is misplaced.in green,the appellate division had not address ed whether the pattern of the prosecution peremptory strikes established a prima facie case of discrimination.at.so there was no state court determination on that issue to which the green court could give aedpa deference it is one thing to conclude that a pattern of strikes is prima facie evidence of discrimination it is a very different thing to hold that the contrary conclusion would be an unreasonable application of batson.
accordingly,we hold that the record is insufficient to disturb the state court ruling on the existence of a prima facie case in support of the batson challenge to the mays strike.we similarly refuse to disturb the second round treatment of the rivera strike,as the record does not even clearly indicate that that strike was at issue 
we have considered petitioner remaining arguments and find each of them to be without merit.for the foregoing reasons,the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
i respectfully dissent,because i disagree with the majority that r esolution of the batson issue in this case requires more information about the possible jurors than the record discloses.majority op.at.because the majority overlooks the fact that the record discloses a great deal about the possible jurors in this case,it imposes a substantial and unnecessary evidentiary burden on sorto.
before i turn to the majority long disquisition on the amount of evidence required to judge a batson claim,i highlight two statements made by the prosecutor during jury selection 
if defense counsel accepts our withdrawal of the martinez peremptory challenge,we would have accepted fifty percent of hispanic potential jurors that are before us.
defense counsel has made no threshold offer of any pattern of discriminating on the people part because we peremptorily challenged the only two african american potential jurors we had.
