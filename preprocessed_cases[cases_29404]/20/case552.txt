hom sui ching moves for an order authorizing the district court to consider a second or successive motion.the united states district court for the eastern district of new york dearie,transferred petitioner august,motion for relief pursuant to to this court after determining,first,that it was in reality a motion for relief under,and,second,that it constituted a second or successive motion within the meaning of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa.the district court erred in characterizing petitioner petition as a second or successive motion,however,because ching august petition was filed before adjudication of his previous motion was complete.we hold that a habeas petition submitted during the pendency of an initial motion should be construed as a motion to amend the initial motion.we therefore dismiss ching motion as unnecessary and transfer ching motion to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
after pleading guilty in to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of,hom sui ching was sentenced to months of imprisonment.on direct appeal,this court affirmed the sentence and conviction.see united states woo,cir table.
in march,ching filed a motion attacking his conviction on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel during sentencing and the improper calculation of his relevant conduct for sentencing purposes.ching claimed that by challenging the report without his consent,his counsel caused ching to violate his plea agreement,which subjected him to a more severe sentence.on may,relying on peterson demskie,cir,the district court denied the motion as untimely.on appeal,we vacated and remanded,finding ching motion timely in light of our decision in mickens united states,cir holding that a prisoner whose conviction became final prior to the enactment of the aedpa had one year from the effective date of the statute to file a motion.
on august,before this court had rendered its decision with respect to his motion,ching filed a habeas petition under in the district court.in this petition,ching challenged the federal court jurisdiction over his criminal case and the validity and constitutionality of the statute under which he was charged.specifically,ching contended that title of the united states code had not been enacted into law at the time he was charged with violating it did not confer jurisdictional or statutory power and was an unconstitutional use of the commerce clause.ching also sought to raise these arguments in the context of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.
upon remand by this court of ching initial motion,the district court issued an order simultaneously disposing of ching motion and petition.the district court dismissed ching motion on the merits and denied him a certificate of appealability coa.the district court determined that ching petition should be treated as a successive motion and transferred it to this court for certification pursuant to the procedure set out by this court in liriano united states,cir.the district court held that the second petition,filed after the limitations period,is not procedurally valid as of right simply because his initial petition is again pending before this c ourt.
on december,ching filed a motion in this court seeking leave to file a second or successive motion.in his motion,ching reiterated the claims asserted in his petition and stated that they were based on newly discovered evidence.
discussion 
it is that a district court may convert a petition to a motion in appropriate circumstances.jiminian nash,cir adams united states,cir noting that a motion may be construed as a motion upon providing the movant with notice of the recharacterization in the instant case,the district court correctly determined that,because ching challenges the constitutionality of the imposition of his sentence rather than the execution of his sentence,his petition should be construed as a motion for relief under.thus,in the district court view,ching had filed two motions for in march of and another in august of.
if the newly recharacterized motion is second or successive within the meaning of the aedpa,ching must receive authorization from this court before he may file his petition.id.b a see also jiminian,at.we may not grant that authorization unless ching makes a prima facie showing that the new claims presented in his second or successive motion are based on a new rule of constitutional law or newly discovered evidence.see.before applying the aedpa gatekeeping provision,however,this court must first determine whether ching august motion was in fact second or successive within the meaning of the statute,or if instead,the district court should have construed it as a motion to amend his original motion.
the aedpa does not define what constitutes a second or successive motion.nonetheless,it is clear that for a petition to be second or successive within the meaning of the statute,it must at a minimum be filed subsequent to the conclusion of a proceeding that counts as the first.a petition that has reached final decision counts for this purpose.littlejohn artuz,cir emphasis added see also id.b efore a motion or petition can be regarded as successive,there must be some prior adjudication on the merits or a dismissal with prejudice.jiminian,at holding that the aedpa gatekeeping provisions are triggered only if the prisoner has had a prior motion dismissed on the merits.
applying this principle,we determined in littlejohn that a motion to amend a petition brought while an initial petition was still pending before the district court could not be construed as second or successive.we therefore held that fed civ,rather than the more stringent standards of the aedpa,governs such motions to amend.at see also fama comm r of corr,cir the holding in littlejohn was based on our understanding that the aedpa ensures every prisoner one full opportunity to seek collateral review.part of that of every civil an entitlement to add or drop issues while the litigation proceeds.at quoting johnson,at.the general concern that civil plaintiffs have an opportunity for a full adjudication of their claims is particularly heightened in the aedpa context,where the gatekeeping provisions of the statute stringently limit a petitioner ability to raise further issues in a subsequent action.adams,at discussing how aedpa provisions may result in a disastrous deprivation of a future opportunity to have a grievance adjudicated if a court converts a motion into motion.
these same considerations lead us to conclude that,in general,when a motion is filed before adjudication of an initial motion is complete,the district court should construe the second motion as a motion to amend the pending motion.adams,at describing this circuit practice of converting motions of prisoners who unsuccessfully seek relief under one provision of law into motions made under,where doing so relax es formalities that might needlessly frustrate pro se petitioners and is harmless.yet this raises the question of whether ching petition,even construed as a motion to amend his original motion,must be considered second or successive because it was brought after the district court had denied his original motion and after there had been an appeal from that denial.
at the time ching petition was filed and reviewed by the district court,this court had yet to rule on ching appeal from the denial of his first motion.moreover,after we vacated the denial of ching initial motion,the district court proceeded to consider the merits of the claims ching raised in his initial motion.this,then,is not the paradigmatic case of a second or successive motion,where the prisoner files a motion,loses on the merits,exhausts appellate remedies,and then files another motion.johnson united states,cir emphasis added.
in the aedpa context,adjudication of an initial habeas petition is not necessarily complete,such that a subsequent filing constitutes a second or successive motion,simply because the district court rendered a judgment that is final within the meaning of.for example,in stewart,d,the court considered
