the petitioner,thomas cress,is a michigan state prisoner serving a life sentence for felony murder.he appeals from the district court order dismissing his second habeas petition,filed pursuant to.the petitioner contends that his due process rights were violated when physical evidence related to his case was destroyed after his appeals were completed,the state court rejected as incredible the recantation evidence that he proffered,and the state court did not grant him relief based on evidence indicating his innocence.the district court denied relief on the merits.because the record establishes that the petitioner claims are not cognizable on habeas review,we conclude that the district court should have dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction,and we therefore affirm the order of dismissal,but for a different reason from that given by the district court.
factual and procedural background 
in,a battle creek jury found petitioner cress guilty of murdering patricia rosansky and convicted him of felony murder,resulting in the imposition of a life sentence.there were no eyewitnesses to the crime,and hair and semen samples recovered by investigators failed to connect cress to the murder.the main evidence introduced by the prosecution at trial consisted of the testimony of several witnesses who said that cress had told them that he committed the murder.cress appealed his conviction unsuccessfully and then sought relief in state court,again without success.in,he filed a habeas petition in federal district court that was dismissed on the merits.see cress grayson.on appeal,we affirmed the district court order of dismissal.see cress grayson,wl cir.
in,cress brought a motion for a new trial in state court,claiming that he was entitled to relief because key prosecution witnesses had recanted their testimony and another person had recently confessed to committing the murder.the state court initially granted cress motion for a retrial,but reversed itself after reopening the matter and taking more evidence.the michigan court of appeals then reversed this denial of a new trial.people cress.finally,the michigan supreme court reversed the court of appeals,after remanding for a hearing on the issue of whether the prosecution had destroyed evidence in bad faith.people cress.on remand,the state trial court found as a matter of fact that no bad faith was involved in the conduct at issue.
having exhausted his state remedies,cress filed this second habeas petition,which was referred to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendation.the magistrate judge subsequently recommended that the petition be summarily dismissed because it was untimely and because it failed to state claims cognizable on habeas.the district court ostensibly dismissed the petition on the merits,concluding that none of the claims established a federal constitutional violation.
the district court denied cress request for a certificate of appealability,but we granted the request with respect to cress claims that the state courts improperly analyzed his claim that the prosecution destroyed potentially exculpatory evidence the state courts improperly ignored his recantation evidence and his continued incarceration in light of compelling evidence of his actual innocence and another guilt violates due process and constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.the certificate also directed the parties to brief a fourth issue whether,because cress filed an earlier unsuccessful habeas corpus petition,the district court should have transferred this petition to this court for consideration as a motion for an order authorizing the district court to consider a second or successive habeas application pursuant to in re sims,cir,and if so,what effect the district court failure to transfer the petition has on the procedural posture of this case.
destruction of evidence 
the record reflects that in,after completion of cress trial,direct appeals,and the first round of state and federal challenges,certain physical evidence relating to his case was routinely particular,a sanitary napkin with sperm contained thereon and hairs with at least one intact root,both of which were seized as evidence from the person of the deceased or in close proximity thereto.the destruction of this evidence was part of a statewide effort to increase storage space,pursuant to a request from the state police department that all local offices review cases in which they had evidence in storage at the state police facility,in order to determine whether that evidence could be discarded.the effort was initiated when letters with the relevant case numbers but not names were sent from the state police headquarters to individual posts.the request forms sent to battle creek police,including one referencing cress case number,were reviewed and then signed by the post commander and forwarded to the prosecutor office.prosecutor jon sahli testified that when he received these forms,he had the appeals secretary check the status of the relevant cases and,if the appeal was over,authorize the destruction.sahli asserted that someone had written closed,no appeal on the form pertaining to cress case,that he accordingly believed the case was completed,and that he signed the authorization in may.the evidence related to cress case was discarded in the fall of,along with evidence from other mostly murder cases,under the oversight of the state police department storage supervisor.
cress now suggests that the destruction of evidence related to his case was motivated by the pro se motion for transcripts that he submitted to the prosecutor office on may.a note found on this motion drafted by prosecutor sahli secretary indicated that sahli had said that someone from his office should attend the hearing regarding cress motion.sahli later testified that he did not recall being apprised of cress motion for trial transcripts,but that if he was,then he would have ordered that the assistant prosecutor handle the motion.
recantation evidence 
the sole recantation evidence in the record consists of the transcript of an interview of prosecution witness candy cross by a battle creek detective named dennis mullen and mullen testimony about this interview at a state court hearing.the record does not contain any sworn testimony from cross.in the interview,she said that she knew nothing about rosansky murder before cress was arrested and that she had always believed that he was innocent.cross also repeatedly insisted that she did not testify against cress at trial.however,mullen confronted cross with trial transcripts showing that she had,in fact,testified at trial to the effect that cress had told her on three separate occasions that he had killed a girl named patty and had put her in a ditch and that he had also driven cross to the location where he purported to have left her body.when mullen continued to press her,cross maintained that she had no recollection whatsoever of testifying against cress,but she did say that if she had so testified,i was mistaken because i would not purposely tell a lie in court.cross also suggested that perhaps she got confused and testified against cress inadvertently,noting that lawyers twist things when questioning witnesses.though cross never affirmatively stated in the interview that she had given false testimony against cress,she did state that if she had testified against him she was willing to take it back.
during this interview cross also suggested that two other prosecution witnesses,her sister,cindy leslie,and her,walter moore,may have testified falsely.at cress trial,leslie testified that cress had confessed to her that he had murdered rosansky and that he had taken leslie to an area where he said that he had left rosansky dead body.leslie additionally stated that cress told her that he had hit rosansky in the head and that leslie returned to the area identified by cress with her sister and two other prosecution witnesses,who had then indicated to her that cress had told them the same thing and taken them to the same place.leslie also testified at trial that she contacted the police to report cress shortly after this incident and that,although she was not expecting a reward at the time of this report,she later received a reward from a crime tip hotline.there is no indication in the record,other than uncorroborated hearsay testimony,that leslie trial testimony was untruthful or that she ever wavered from it.
similarly,there is no evidence in the record that moore himself ever recanted his testimony he committed suicide while in prison shortly after cress trial.at trial,moore had testified that cress had asked him several different times whether he had ever had sex with a dead woman.he also said that on a separate occasion cress offered to show him where patty rosansky was found and then took him to a particular area.moore further testified that after these incidents he had a specific conversation about rosansky with cress while he was staying with him.he stated that after the two had smoked a joint of marijuana,cress brought up the subject said,i killed patty rosansky.and he went into detail,saying that he had raped her when she refused to have sex with him,that he hit her with a tire iron because she was screaming,that he had meant only to knock her out because he was so scared,but that he had actually killed her instead.according to moore,cress confessed to him that he still had her body for about three or four days after she was dead,and he tried to have sex with her three times after that,after she was dead before h e took her out to fort custer.
at trial,moore had also acknowledged that he was wanted by police at the time cress made the alleged statements to him and that after he had himself been arrested and confessed to his own charges,he had requested to speak to the officer working on rosansky case because he believed he knew who killed her.moore asserted that he had not been offered anything of value in exchange for his initial statement,but he testified that after he told the detective about what cress had said,he entered into an agreement under which he would plead guilty to seven charges,another charge would be reduced,and a remaining charge would be dropped for his testifying in the cress case.he added that he had not been told how he should testify.
finally,we note that when cross later testified at a state hearing,she refused to recant her trial testimony.she said that her statements in her interview with mullen were made because he intimidated her and threatened her.
c.other evidence of actual innocence 
in his habeas petition,cress also contended that michael ronning confession to the rosansky murder proves cress innocence and entitles him to relief.while serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole for a murder in arkansas,ronning confessed to the murder of rosansky pursuant to an elaborate agreement arising from the efforts of detective mullen.mullen apparently contacted ronning in arkansas and indicated to him his belief that somebody had been convicted of a crime that he thought ronning was guilty of.ronning acknowledged that when mullen first contacted him,he protested that he had never killed anyone.however,he changed his story after mullen offered that he could come to michigan to serve out the remainder of his sentence if he was willing to cooperate.many of ronning family members resided in michigan,and ronning indicated that attaining proximity to his well as his dissatisfaction with the arkansas prison motivated his subsequent confession to the rosansky murder.apparently a serial killer,ronning also thought that he might be able to avoid a death sentence for any of the other murders he had committed by work ing it out through michigan first because michigan is a penalty state.indeed,ronning explained that the agreement that he ultimately struck required any other states to return him to michigan,provided that he was convicted of homicide in michigan.
four witnesses testified that ronning had at some point indicated to them that he was confessing in order to be transferred to a michigan facility.most notably,melissa meyer,ronning,testified at the petitioner hearing that ronning had sent her letters while he was still in arkansas that said he was working on something that could enable him to spend his s entence in a prison in michigan.according to meyer,when she later visited ronning he conveyed to her that implicating himself in michigan murders was his way of being able to spend his s entence here in michigan but that,despite his confessions,he also insisted that he was not actually involved in the michigan murders.she said that ronning had confided in her that he had obtained all of the available transcripts for the michigan murders from the secretary of a former attorney whom he had befriended,and that he had read all of the transcripts and documents involved in all the murders,and had memorized everything in detail to answer any questions that could have been asked.
ronning refused to divulge specific information about crimes he had purportedly committed in michigan before he reached an agreement with the prosecutor and the police force in michigan.the agreement eventually reached was ratified by the governors of michigan and arkansas and permitted ronning to serve the remainder of his sentence in michigan,subject to his undergoing a polygraph examination as to the truthfulness of the numbers that were involved in his confessions.as a result,when ronning took the polygraph test,he was asked only whether he had committed three murders in michigan no specific reference was made to the rosansky murder.the polygraph examiner was of the opinion that ronning answers about the number of murders that he had committed in michigan was truthful.after the polygraph,ronning provided what purported to be a full confession,parts of which corresponded to evidence in the record of cress trial.other statements that ronning made,however,conflicted with the evidence,and he was unable to identify the location where he purportedly murdered rosansky and disposed of her body.indeed,the videotape of his unsuccessful efforts to locate or even describe the crime scene correctly was,in the assessment of the state court judge,p erhaps the most compelling evidence which cause d this court to conclude that ronning is a false confessor.
in,cress also underwent a polygraph examination,in which he denied participation in the killing of patty patricia rosansky or in put ting patty patricia rosansky body in that wooded ravine in or near fort custer.he also denied telling anyone that he had killed rosansky.the polygraph examiner was of the opinion that cress was qualifiedly telling the truth in his responses to the few questions that he was asked,reporting as follows 
there are two reasons for the qualification of this opinion.first,in matters such as this one it is common to have significantly greater amounts of detailed information about the offense under investigation than was available here.such detailed data ordinarily provides a firmer basis for the formulation of relevant test questions and for the development of specific testing procedures which contribute to the interpretation of polygraphic data.second,based upon discussions with cress during his polygraph examination,it was my impression that he has a somewhat limited capacity for understanding the necessity for specific instructions that were given during the testing.although it is my opinion that neither of these concerns was likely to have influenced significantly the outcome of cress examination,additional polygraph testing may be useful if there is an interest in clarifying their role.
there is no indication in the record that cress submitted to any further polygraph testing.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review a district court legal conclusions in a habeas proceeding de novo,and its factual findings for clear error.hill hofbauer,cir citing vincent seabold,cir.when a petitioner in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court seeks habeas review of any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court,a habeas writ may issue only if the state court adjudication
