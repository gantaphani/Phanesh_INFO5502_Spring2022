following a jury trial in the massachusetts superior court,petitioner troy brown was convicted of armed assault with intent to rob a person sixty years of age or older.rejecting brown contention that the trial court unconstitutionally restricted his of two investigating police officers in contravention of the sixth and fourteenth amendments of the united states constitution,the massachusetts appeals court affirmed brown conviction in an unpublished memorandum of decision.see commonwealth brown,unpublished table decision,wl.both the massachusetts supreme judicial court and the united states supreme court denied discretionary review.see commonwealth brown,brown massachusetts.brown then petitioned in federal district court for a writ of habeas corpus,contending that the appeals court analysis of his confrontation claim was either contrary to the supreme court holding in delaware van arsdall,or was an unreasonable application of both van arsdall and established principles of due process.the district court disagreed and denied the petition.after careful consideration,we affirm.
we recite the relevant facts as set forth by the appeals court,supplemented where necessary by our review of the record 
on august,daniel lynch was assaulted by three young men during a late night walk through the corky row neighborhood of fall river,massachusetts.lynch,who was years old and in poor health,was initially confronted during his walk by brown and a second man,tyrone smith.lynch and smith engaged in a brief verbal altercation.smith then struck lynch on the side of the head,knocking him against a fence and then onto the street.lynch testified that,at this point,he witnessed brown standing approximately three to five feet away from him,holding a small bicycle over his head.when brown asked lynch whether he had any money,lynch replied that he did not.lynch attempted to leave the area,but brown followed close behind.lynch also noticed a third man approaching from behind brown.smith suddenly reappeared and struck lynch again.lynch then felt a second blow to the top of his head that knocked him out briefly.when lynch regained consciousness,brown was going through his pockets.the assailants left after finding nothing.
lynch was interviewed later that morning by police officer david gouveia.at that time,lynch described the man who had held the bicycle and had gone through his pockets as being five feet six inches in height,pounds,with long sideburns,a slight moustache,and a short stringy beard.officer gouveia showed lynch a book of photographs,which included one of smith but not one of brown.lynch was unable to identify anyone in the photographs at that time.approximately two weeks later,officer gouveia showed lynch a second photo array,this time containing only seven photographs.from this array,lynch identified smith as the man who had punched him and brown as the man who had held the bicycle.
brown was arrested on september,and indicted on september at the time of his arrest,brown was attempting to crawl under a bed in his apartment.brown later told police that he had been too drunk to remember anything on the night in question,but denied being involved in the assault.
prior to his trial,brown unsuccessfully moved in limine to introduce into evidence a hearsay statement that smith had made to police following his arrest.smith apparently admitted to encountering lynch on the night in question.he informed police,however,that he had been with a man named cagney bettencourt,not brown,at the time of the incident and that neither he nor bettencourt had assaulted lynch brown wished to use smith statement to impeach the credibility of lynch identification of brown from the photo array,to demonstrate the likelihood that bettencourt was the true culprit,and to cast doubt on the thoroughness of the police investigation.although the trial judge denied brown motion,he ruled that defense counsel could inquire whether the police had interviewed smith and what action,if any,they took as a result of that interview.
lynch testified for the commonwealth at the trial he again identified brown as the man who had held the bicycle.he further testified that he was sure of his identification.brown trial counsel lynch regarding his ability to make an accurate identification.the commonwealth also called as witnesses both officer gouveia and the officer to whom smith had made his statement,officer james smith.brown counsel officer gouveia regarding the discrepancy between lynch initial physical description of his assailant and brown physical characteristics during this,brown counsel also elicited from officer gouveia that bettencourt name had surfaced during the investigation,and he introduced a photograph of bettencourt in evidence.
notwithstanding his prior ruling,however,the trial judge sustained hearsay objections to defense counsel repeated inquiry into whether officer gouveia investigation of bettencourt began after police interviewed smith and whether officer gouveia considered bettencourt to be a suspect during his investigation the trial judge sustained similar objections to defense counsel inquiry into whether officer smith had interviewed smith or had occasion to show him any photographs.
although brown presented alibi witnesses to bolster his misidentification defense,and although his trial counsel argued to the jury that bettencourt better fit the physical description of lynch assailant,brown chose not to call smith as a witness in his defense.as noted by the appeals court,t rial counsel chose not to call smith as a witness because he was not sure that smith would affirm his earlier statement to police.brown,wl,at.
brown appealed his conviction,asserting,among other things,that the trial judge limitation on his of the two officers denied him the right to confront the witnesses against him in violation of article xii of the massachusetts declaration of rights and the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution.the appeals court denied relief.in so doing,that court employed a balancing test established by the massachusetts supreme judicial court in commonwealth kirouac,and reaffirmed in commonwealth miles.according to the kirouac court 
in deciding whether a defendant constitutional right to and thus confront a witness against him has been denied because of an unreasonable limitation of,a court must weigh the materiality of the witness direct testimony and the degree of the restriction on.the determination can only be made on a basis.
kirouac,at.
applying the kirouac test to brown case,the appeals court first noted that testimony from officers smith and gouveia regarding their investigation of bettencourt was marginally relevant to the commonwealth case,which was based almost entirely on lynch identification of the defendant.brown,wl,at.the court then explained that the defendant had been permitted ample opportunity to generate reasonable doubt about the accuracy of lynch identification through unfettered of lynch,extensive of officer gouveia,and defense counsel forceful closing argument.the court concluded that brown had not been prejudiced by the limitations on and thus that his right to confrontation had not been violated.
brown filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court in april,arguing that the kirouac test is contrary to the clearly established rule enunciated by the supreme court in delaware van arsdall,and that,alternatively,the appeals court unreasonably applied the supreme court relevant sixth and fourteenth amendment jurisprudence in concluding that the restrictions on did not deny him the right to confront the witnesses against him and to thereby present a complete defense.he also contended that the appeals court decision contained an unreasonable factual finding.after first rejecting the government procedural arguments concerning exhaustion and judicial estoppel,the district court denied brown petition on the merits the court agreed with brown that van arsdall is a source of clearly established federal law relevant to the petition,but concluded that the appeals court decision was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of van arsdall.
we review the district court denial of habeas relief de novo and may affirm on any ground made manifest by the record.pike guarino,cir.pursuant to the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,a federal court may not grant habeas relief with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court unless the state court decision either was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.the instant petition implicates only the first ground for relief that the appeals court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,federal law 
a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court if it contradicts the governing law set forth in the supreme court cases or confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of the supreme court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from its precedent.john russo,cir internal quotation marks omitted alterations omitted.the statutory phrase contrary to suggests that the state court decision must be substantially different from the relevant precedent of the supreme court.williams taylor,emphasis added.by contrast,a state court adjudication involves an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.id.at.unreasonableness is an objective that requires some increment of incorrectness beyond error that,though not necessarily great,must be great enough to make the decision unreasonable in the independent and objective judgment of the federal court.mccambridge hall,cir en banc.for either analysis,clearly established federal law refers to the governing legal principle or principles set forth by the supreme court at the time the state court renders its decision.lockyer andrade.a legal principle is clearly established only when it is embodied in a holding of the supreme court.thaler haynes,per curiam.
on this appeal,the petitioner reasserts his contention that the trial court violated his rights under the sixth and fourteenth amendments of the united states constitution to confront prosecution witnesses and to thereby present a complete defense.he claims that he is entitled to habeas relief on two alternate grounds.the petitioner central contention is that the kirouac balancing test applied by the appeals court is contrary to the supreme court van arsdall decision because the kirouac test requires a reviewing court to weigh the materiality of a witness direct testimony as a factor in determining whether the confrontation clause was violated,rather than as a factor in determining whether any such violation was harmless according to the petitioner,van arsdall stands for the proposition that a restriction on violates the confrontation clause whenever the proposed would have left the jury with a significantly different impression of the issue for which the evidence was offered.therefore,he argues,the only factor relevant to finding a constitutional violation is the effect that the excluded testimony would have had on the jury.the petitioner also notes that the van arsdall court explicitly included the importance of the witness testimony in the prosecution case among the numerous factors that may be relevant to a reviewing court harmless error analysis,which he suggests creates a necessary implication that witness materiality is an issue on which the government bears the sole burden of proof.see van arsdall,at.
alternatively,the petitioner contends that the appeals court decision was objectively unreasonable.he cites a litany of supreme court cases holding that,under the sixth and fourteenth amendments,restrictions on a defendant right to elicit relevant defense evidence may not be imposed arbitrarily or mechanistically,and must not be disproportionate to the purposes that the restrictions are designed to serve.see,michigan lucas,chambers mississippi.the petitioner contends that the restriction in his case was arbitrary and disproportionate to its purpose because the precluded testimony,describing smith custodial statement to the officers and aspects of the subsequent police investigation of bettencourt,either was not hearsay or was hearsay that bore particular indicia of reliability.he also faults the appeals court analysis for failing to address his argument that the excluded evidence was necessary to clarify for the jury the relevance of the remaining misidentification evidence.he believes that,absent testimony about smith statement and the subsequent police investigation,jurors were left with the mistaken impression that bettencourt was suspected by police of being the third assailant who was never identified,rather than an alternative suspect to brown 
clearly established federal law 
we begin by determining whether the petitioner constitutional challenge in state court was governed by any clearly established federal law.a threshold determination that no holding of the supreme court required application to the factual context presented by the petitioner claim is dispositive in the habeas analysis.see generally carey musladin,accord house hatch,cir musladin has now dispelled the uncertainty the absence of clearly established federal law is dispositive under d.state courts are entitled to resolve an open question in supreme court jurisprudence without triggering federal court review under aedpa.see musladin,at renico lett,aedpa prevents federal using federal habeas corpus review as a vehicle to the reasonable decisions of state courts.if supreme court cases give no clear answer to the question presented,a state court resolution of a constitutional question may not serve as a basis for habeas relief.wright van patten,per curiam.
the supreme court has recently emphasized that whether federal law is clearly established for the purpose of the habeas statute is not simply a function of the clarity of the particular legal principle relied upon by a petitioner,but also of the clarity of that principle application to the facts of the petitioner case it has cautioned that reviewing courts must be careful not to improperly turn the court holdings into blanket rule s.see thaler.at.rather,we must look for supreme court precedent that either squarely addresses the issue in the case or that articulates legal principles that clearly extend to the new factual context.see van patten,at.compare panetti quarterman,extending precedent establishing the basic requirements of due process to new factual context,with musladin,at denying habeas petition where no holding of the supreme court required the application of precedent to distinguishable facts.
the inapplicability of van arsdall as a source of clearly established federal law.
petitioner reliance on van arsdall as the primary legal authority governing his confrontation claim is misplaced.van arsdall involved a constitutional challenge to restrictions imposed on a defendant impeachment,on,of a prosecution witness for bias.there,the supreme court announced that a criminal defendant states a violation of the confrontation clause by showing that he was prohibited from engaging in otherwise appropriate designed to show a prototypical form of bias on the part of the witness,and thereby to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.van arsdall,at alteration in original quoting davis alaska.
before turning to the facts of the case before it,the van arsdall court emphasized that trial judges retain wide latitude insofar as the confrontation clause is concerned to impose reasonable limits on.id.at.it explained that such reasonable limits may be justified by concerns about,among other things,harassment,prejudice,confusion of the issues,the witness safety,or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.id.it also reiterated its previous admonition that the confrontation clause guarantees an opportunity for effective,not that is effective in whatever way,and to whatever extent,the defense might wish.id.quoting delaware fensterer,per curiam.the van arsdall court nevertheless concluded that,b y cutting off all questioning about an event that the state conceded had taken place and that a jury might reasonably have found furnished the witness a motive for favoring the prosecution in his testimony,the court ruling violated van arsdall rights secured by the confrontation clause.id.emphasis added.
the supreme court application of van arsdall has always involved evaluation of restrictions on intended to impeach the credibility of the witness being examined.nonetheless,the petitioner invites us to hold that van arsdall clearly extends to a restriction on his of two prosecution witnesses officer gouveia and officer smith for the purpose of impeaching a third lynch.we decline the invitation.
van arsdall application of its own rule was both narrow and.that narrow application and the decision considerations provide little guidance on how the rule ought to apply in a case as different as the one at bar.indeed,the blanket rule suggested by the petitioner,under which the confrontation clause is violated by any restriction on excluding evidence that would have left the jury with a significantly different impression of the issue for which the evidence was offered,reflects the consequences of unmooring the rule articulated in that decision from its direct impeachment context.
moreover,applying van arsdall to the facts of the instant petition is in tension with both the internal logic of the van arsdall decision and existing case law.a central premise of the van arsdall decision was that the focus of the inquiry in determining whether the confrontation right has been violated must be on the particular witness,not on the outcome of the entire trial,because the focus of the confrontation clause is on individual witnesses.id.at.yet the primary evidentiary function of the testimony sought by the petitioner would have been to impeach the identification made by lynch,a witness other than the one being examined.in contrast to van arsdall explicit approach,the petitioner implores us to hold that van arsdall clearly established that the significance to his defense of that missed extrinsic impeachment opportunity is the single relevant factor in finding a confrontation clause violation.however,we have previously explained that the supreme court confrontation clause jurisprudence left a defendant right to introduce extrinsic impeachment evidence as an open constitutional question see,united states,f d,cir although the ability to pursue an impeaching line of inquiry with the introduction of extrinsic evidence supporting that inquiry might be viewed as part and parcel of the right to,this circuit has yet to decide whether the confrontation clause provides defendants a right to impeach witnesses through extrinsic evidence.
since the rule of van arsdall was articulated in a case,and applied to circumstances,much different from the circumstances in which the petitioner now seeks to employ it,we can not conclude that van arsdall squarely established a specific legal rule applicable to the petitioner case.see knowles mirzayance.van arsdall does provide a clearly established federal rule for a class of cases,but it is not the class within which the petitioner case falls.therefore,the kirouac test is not contrary to the rule van arsdall adopted nor was van arsdall unreasonably applied in this case.
clearly established law on the right to present a defense 
as noted,the petitioner does not rely exclusively on van arsdall in pursuing habeas relief.he also argues that the restrictions on his of officer gouveia and officer smith impaired his right,protected by clearly established law under the sixth and fourteenth amendments,to present a complete defense.he suggests that testimony from the officers describing both smith statement and the subsequent police investigation of bettencourt was needed not only to impeach lynch and identifications of the petitioner,but also to demonstrate to the jury the likelihood that bettencourt was the true culprit and to invite reasonable doubt based on inadequacies in the police investigation.he therefore challenges the objective reasonableness of the appeals court conclusion that he was not prejudiced by the restrictions on.
it is well established that a state broad latitude to define rules for the exclusion of evidence and to apply those rules to criminal defendants has constitutional limits.see clark arizona.evidentiary restrictions that hinder a defendant ability to present defense evidence can,in some circumstances,be severe enough to violate due process.see chambers,at.whether rooted directly in the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,or in the compulsory process or confrontation clauses of the sixth amendment,the constitution guarantees criminal defendants a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.crane kentucky,quoting california trombetta,internal citations omitted.
the supreme court has described this right as a fundamental element of due process of law,washington texas,which is abridged by evidence rules that infring e upon a weighty interest of the accused and are arbitrary or disproportionate to the purposes they are designed to serve.holmes south carolina,quoting united states scheffer,alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.even a generally defensible rule of evidence may be applied so as to produce an unconstitutional infringement.white coplan,f d,cir.
it is also clear that a defendant right to elicit exculpatory defense evidence through falls within the ambit of this longstanding right.see,chambers,at holding that a defendant was denied a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense where he was allowed neither to an alternative suspect in the case nor to call witnesses for the purpose of impeaching that suspect testimony,at evaluating a defendant right to present extrinsic impeachment evidence as a due process claim where the defendant failure to address adverse precedent had waived his argument under the confrontation clause.
despite the generality of these principles,aedpa does not require state and federal courts to wait for some nearly identical factual pattern before a legal rule must be applied.panetti,at quoting musladin,at kennedy,concurring in judgment.nevertheless,in order to be entitled to relief,the petitioner must meet his burden of demonstrating that the appeals court decision reflects an unreasonable application of the clearly established arbitrary and disproportionate standard to the facts of his case.
b.the appeals court application of federal law 
deference under d 
in evaluating a state court application of federal law,our inquiry is not how well reasoned the state court decision is,but whether the outcome is reasonable.hurtado tucker,cir.in this regard,the most important point is that an unreasonable application of federal law is different from an incorrect application of federal law.williams,at.moreover,the supreme court has explained that evaluating whether a rule application was unreasonable requires considering the rule specificity.the more general the rule,the more leeway courts have in reaching outcomes in determinations.yarborough alvarado.
our own decisions involving a defendant constitutional right to present a defense demonstrate the generality of the right and the substantial element of judgment required of trial courts in excluding defense evidence.see,dolinger hall,cir affirming denial of habeas petition where the exclusion of evidence still afforded the defendant an adequate opportunity to challenge the witness bias in other ways united states cunan,cir finding no constitutional violation in the exclusion of hearsay evidence where sufficient evidence of the defense theory remained united states holden,cir the key issue is whether the jury had enough information to assess the defe
