appellant john gorczyk,commissioner of the vermont department of corrections,appeals from a june,judgment of the united states district court for the district of vermont garvan murtha,chief judge granting habeas corpus to appellee kenneth fuller on the basis that fuller confrontation clause rights were violated when the vermont trial court precluded him from introducing certain evidence and testimony during his trial for sexual assault.because we agree with appellant that the vermont supreme court did not unreasonably apply clearly established supreme court law,we reverse the grant of habeas and dismiss the petition.
background 
on february,appellee kenneth fuller was convicted,following a jury trial,of aggravated sexual assault of his in violation of.stat.ann.tit,a.fuller was sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of twenty to forty years,which he is now serving.see state fuller.at the time of the sexual assault,appellee was married to donna fuller,who had a son,from a previous relationship.at trial,testified that one evening,while fuller was still at work and he was home alone with fuller,fuller forced to drink beer and later followed him into his bedroom.testified that while the two were talking about sex,fuller pulled down his own pants and began to masturbate.when attempted to leave the room,fuller grabbed him,pulled down pants,and placed his mouth on penis for several seconds.when fled into another room,fuller followed him,threw him onto a couch,and again placed his mouth on the boy penis.see id.at.later reported the incident to his mother,who relayed the allegations to her sister.fuller sister reported the allegations to the vermont department of social and rehabilitation services srs.
on several occasions before charges were filed,both fuller and denied that the incident had taken place.the following inconsistencies in their stories came out at trial.when confronted initially by the srs,both and donna fuller denied that had been sexually assaulted.see id.when police investigators tried to interview at his school,he initially denied that any sexual abuse had occurred.in a police interview at around the same time,fuller denied both that fuller had sexually abused and that she had told her sister about the incident.several months later,however,when fuller was arrested after a domestic dispute with fuller,she and reported the incident to the police.while fuller was in pretrial detention,fuller spoke with fuller defense counsel and again denied that the abuse had occurred.
at trial,testified about the incident and was unequivocal in his accusation.fuller testified that fuller confessed to her that he had indeed performed the acts had alleged.on direct examination,she testified as follows 
i confronted him with what i knew.
q.what was his reaction what did he say to you 
a.he denied it for a couple of minutes and then he admitted it was true and he was relieved that everybody knew and he wanted forgiveness from and 
later,when being examined about her inconsistent statements to the police,fuller again stated that fuller had confessed to her 
and did you tell the police as well,in that statement that you confronted ken and that he admitted it 
and that he had said he was sorry 
and that the reason he did it was so would be scared some day if a girl did it to him 
and that he promised that he never do it again 
fuller testified at trial that he was innocent and relied in part on the inconsistencies noted above.he asserted that and fuller had concocted the charges against him as a result of the domestic dispute,and that resented fuller intrusion into relationship with his mother.fuller,at.in support of his defense theory,fuller sought to introduce,and cross fuller on,two sets of statements by fuller to impeach both her and credibility.the trial court rejected the proffer,and fuller contends in this habeas appeal,as he did on direct appeal,that this exclusion violated his rights under the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment.this evidence included statements fuller had made in letters she sent to fuller while he was in pretrial detention for the domestic assault charge,in which she made reference to her lying and statements she had made to a third party,ken harris,whom she had dated while fuller was in detention,suggesting that she did not believe the incident had taken place.
fuller wrote the following in her letters 
now with this court thing i really scared.i do know how i going to get through the next days or weeks,i am intimidated by the prosecutor to the extent when i think about it my ears start ringing and i feel like i having a panic attack,i can just imagine how you feel.it your life on the line.i put you there and now i have to try to get you out,what a mess.i wish we could either turn back the clock or zoom it ahead and have this over.
id.at alteration in original.the second statement was as follows 
i do know why i feeling sorry for myself.i guess it because of this great big huge mess that bigger than the world and i scared because i do understand the law and i afraid of what the prosecutor and the judge will do to me for lying.
id.alteration in original.
the defendant offered the letters to impeach fuller credibility and to show that she had felt intimidated by the prosecutor.see id.
the vermont trial court excluded the statements in the letters on the basis that their content was inadmissible hearsay.the court also reasoned that their potential prejudicial effect to the defendant outweighed their probative value,because if the letters were admitted,the prosecution would be permitted to introduce evidence regarding the defendant aggravated domestic assault charge to explain how fuller knew the prosecutor.finally,the trial court found that the statements were superfluous because there was ample other evidence with which to impeach fuller credibility,including her prior inconsistent statements to the police.
during of fuller,fuller attorney received a note from a man,ken harris,stating,your client has not done anything to.fuller therefore sought to have ken harris testify.fuller proffer with respect to this testimony was that fuller confided to harris that she did not believe the sexual assault had taken place.fuller sought to introduce harris testimony for three purposes to impeach fuller credibility with respect to statements she made to the police,to reopen the issue of the admissibility of her letters to the defendant,and to impeach credibility indirectly,by demonstrating that fuller did not believe that the sexual incident had taken place.the vermont trial court determined ken harris testimony to be inadmissible,finding it cumulative for the purpose of impeaching fuller credibility and irrelevant for the purpose of impeaching credibility.the court noted that fuller had no personal knowledge of the could only testify as to what had reported and that she had reported it to the police.with respect to the statements impact on credibility in particular,the court concluded that to admit testimony as to fuller beliefs about whether the incident had taken place inappropriately invaded the province of the jury to determine that fact and to weigh credibility of witnesses,such as.the court explained 
well,with respect to harris statement that donna fuller told him that she was sure it happened,that not admissible testimony if it came from donna fuller.it not admissible as to whether she believed it or did not believe allegations against the defendant.and then to have it come in through another person,is number one,hearsay with no exceptions that i been informed of and number two,inadmissible for the very reason that her opinion as her beliefs are not relevant and it invading the jury province as to their ultimate decision as to whether or not these allegations are true or not.
and in there you clearly said that the defense wished to use these statements to impeach credibility by donna fuller beliefs as to what happened,which is not admissible evidence either 
vermont supreme court proceedings 
on direct appeal to the vermont supreme court,fuller contended that his confrontation clause rights had been violated when the trial court excluded the statements in fuller letters and ken harris testimony.see state fuller.the vermont supreme court affirmed fuller conviction over a dissent.
with respect to fuller statements to ken harris,the vermont supreme court held that the trial court did not err in ruling harris testimony inadmissible for the purpose of impeaching donna fuller credibility,because the testimony had little relevance to her truthfulness and other testimony had already fulfilled this function,including her own testimony that on earlier occasions she had denied the incident had taken place.id.at.with respect to the two letters,the vermont supreme court agreed with fuller that the trial court erred in finding the statements inadmissible for the purpose of impeaching her credibility and found that their exclusion violated his rights under the confrontation clause.id.at.nonetheless,the vermont supreme court held this error to be harmless under the standard set forth in chapman california,d,and applied to confrontation clause violations in delaware van arsdall,d.recognizing the limited probative value of these letters,coupled with fuller concession in his own testimony that he did not think fuller invented the allegations against concession in direct opposition to defendant theory of the case that fuller had fabricated the sexual assault the vermont supreme court found the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and thus affirmed fuller conviction.fuller,at i t is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant would have been found guilty even if the proffered evidence had been admitted.
district court proceedings 
fuller subsequently filed this petition for habeas corpus in the district court,again asserting that the exclusion of fuller statements violated his confrontation clause rights.the district court agreed with the vermont supreme court that fuller confrontation clause rights were violated with respect to the exclusion of fuller letters,because he was prohibited from engaging in otherwise permissible impeachment for bias.the district court,however,disagreed with the vermont supreme court conclusion that the error was harmless under chapman and van arsdall.given the importance of fuller testimony,and the suggestion in one of the letters that she had lied,the district court concluded that the trial court exclusion of on these statements can not be considered harmless error.
the district court noted that the trial court refusal to allow fuller to present harris testimony reinforces this conclusion.the court reasoned that harris testimony could have affected how the jury assessed fuller testimony because it contradicted her trial testimony and was therefore relevant to her credibility.the district court granted a conditional writ of habeas corpus,requiring fuller release unless the state retried him within days.appellant john gorczyk,commissioner of the vermont department of corrections,acting on behalf of the state of vermont,appeals from the district court judgment granting habeas corpus.the deadline has been stayed pending the resolution of this appeal.
discussion 
we review de novo a district court judgment granting a writ of habeas corpus.see sacco cooksey,cir per curiam.
appellant contends primarily that the vermont supreme court did not unreasonably apply clearly established federal law on the confrontation clause under delaware van arsdall.see d.appellant further contends that even if the vermont court judgment constituted an unreasonable application of federal law,the error did not result in actual prejudice and was thus harmless under brecht abrahamson,d.appellee fuller responds that the vermont court applied the chapman standard unreasonably in finding any error harmless,because,had impeachment of fuller through the letters and her statements to harris been permitted,a reasonable jury might have received a significantly different impression of the witness credibility.van arsdall,at.he reasons that the defendant own confession to fuller is probably the most probative and damaging evidence that can be admitted against him,arizona fulminante,d white,concurring,and that a limitation on on this point could not be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in the circumstances.we agree with appellant that the vermont supreme court did not unreasonably apply clearly established federal law and therefore reverse the grant of habeas corpus and dismiss the petition.
in,congress curtailed the federal courts power to grant habeas corpus to state prisoners when it passed the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,stat.in pertinent part,d,as amended,reads 
d an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states 
under the unreasonable application clause,a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from this court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.williams taylor,d.because the vermont supreme court properly identified the standard set forth in delaware van arsdall,d,as the appropriate governing legal principle,the unreasonable application clause is relevant here.
a federal court may not grant habeas simply because,in its independent judgment,the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.williams,at.an unreasonable application must be objectively unreasonable.id.at.for an application to be objectively unreasonable,s ome increment of incorrectness beyond error is required t he increment need not be great otherwise,habeas relief would be limited to state court decisions so far off the mark as to suggest judicial incompetence.francis stone,cir internal quotation marks omitted.while the district court properly noted that it could grant the writ only on a finding that the state court applied the appropriate legal principle unreasonably,we agree with appellant that the district court simply disagreed with the vermont supreme court application and did not adequately identify why it found the decision affirming fuller conviction to be objectively unreasonable.
clearly established law 
fuller contends that the vermont supreme court unreasonably applied clearly established federal law on the confrontation clause in affirming his conviction.he argues that the trial court improperly restricted his ability to fuller about the letters she sent to fuller,and to call harris to testify about fuller statements to him.
the supreme court has explained that 
t he confrontation clause of the sixth amendment guarantees the right of an accused in a criminal prosecution to be confronted with the witnesses against him t he main and essential purpose of confrontation is to secure for the opponent the opportunity of.of particular relevance here,w e have recognized that the exposure of a witness motivation in testifying is a proper and important function of the right of.
