petitioner traci miskel appeals the district court denial of her petition for a writ of habeas corpus under the and effective death penalty act aedpa.petitioner,who was convicted of driving while having a breath alcohol concentration of percent or more,in violation of ohio code a challenges the trial court decisions to prohibit cross examination and the presentation of expert testimony on whether the type of breath testing machine used to test petitioner is generally reliable.specifically,she asserts that the trial court rulings on these issues violated her sixth amendment rights to confrontation and compulsory process and her fourteenth amendment rights to present a complete defense and to have the state prove each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt for the following reasons,we affirm the district court denial of the writ.
background 
on september,the state of ohio charged petitioner traci miskel with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence omvi,in violation of ohio code a,operating a motor vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol omvi per se,in violation of a,and speeding,in violation of ohio code c.a jury in franklin county municipal court convicted petitioner of omvi per se and speeding but acquitted her of omvi.the sole elements of omvi per se are operating a vehicle while having a concentration of grams or more by weight of alcohol per liters of breath.ohio code a.a traditional omvi charge,by contrast,requires the prosecution to prove that the defendant was in fact under the influence while driving the defendant breath alcohol concentration bac is not an element of omvi,but it creates a rebuttable presumption that he was under the influence.a state vega,ohio.
during the trial,at which respondent the honorable dwayne maynard presided,petitioner sought to cross examine the police officers who performed her breath test,officers robert wetzel and robert mckelvey,on whether the device they used to measure petitioner bac,the bac verifier,is accepted by the scientific community as generally reliable.petitioner also proffered the expert testimony of henry shamansky,who would testify that the bac verifier has come under criticism within the scientific community.specifically,petitioner sought to show that the bac verifier is susceptible to interference from radio waves and that its conversion ratio from breath alcohol content to blood alcohol content has come into question among scientists.
judge maynard denied both requests on the grounds that the general reliability of the bac verifier was not a relevant issue in the trial.judge maynard based this ruling on the ohio supreme court decision in state vega,ohio,in which the court held that the accused may not make a general attack upon the reliability and validity of the breath testing instrument.id.at.the vega holding,however,expressly permitted cross examination and direct evidence as to whether the defendant was in fact under the influence of alcohol whether the specific breath testing instrument used on the defendant was reliable and whether the officer who operated the instrument was qualified to perform the test.id.at.in vega,the court rejected the defendant claim that the sixth and fourteenth amendments guaranteed him the right to challenge a breath testing machine general reliability.id.at.consistent with vega,the trial court in this case permitted petitioner to thoroughly cross examine officers wetzel and mckelvey as to their qualifications and as to whether they conducted the various performance checks on the machine mandated by the state health department,which is charged with selecting breath testing machines and assuring their reliability.see ohio admin.code et.
on appeal to the ohio court of appeals for the tenth district,petitioner asserted that judge maynard decision to preclude a foray into the general reliability of the bac verifier was a violation of her sixth amendment rights to confrontation and compulsory process and her fourteenth amendment rights to present a complete defense and to be convicted only upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt.the appeals court acknowledged that vega involved a traditional omvi the defendant bac is critical evidence,but not an element of the concluded that the case was nevertheless controlling in petitioner omvi per se trial and affirmed her conviction.state miskel,wl,at ohio,unpublished opinion.only a few years before petitioner appeal,the appeals court had applied vega to an omvi per se case.see city of columbus duling,wl ohio,unpublished opinion,appeal denied,ohio.in petitioner case,the appeals court reasoned that it was constrained to do so again.miskel,supra.
the supreme court of ohio dismissed petitioner appeal as not involving any substantial constitutional question and,on february,she filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to in the southern district of ohio.it is the district court denial of the writ that petitioner now appeals.as a result of a stay of execution of her sentence during the appeals and habeas process,petitioner has not served any of the sentence,to wit,days in the franklin county jail,days suspended for year of probation,and days in an alcohol rehabilitation program.at.nevertheless,petitioner is in custody within the meaning of and therefore has standing to bring this habeas action.see mcveigh smith,cir holding that a habeas petitioner whose sentence of probation was stayed was nonetheless in custody for purposes of the federal habeas corpus statute citing hensley municipal court,d.finally,we note that petitioner did not object to the magistrate judge recommendation that the only proper respondent is judge maynard nor does she challenge this recommendation on appeal 
on appeal to this court,petitioner presents the same arguments she has advanced the state courts adherence to vega denied her the right to meaningfully cross examine key state witnesses to compel witnesses to testify in her favor to present a meaningful defense and to be presumed innocent until the prosecution proves each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.brief of appellant at.we address petitioner arguments in turn.
ii.standard of review 
in a habeas corpus proceeding,this court reviews the district court legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error,vincent seabold,cir.we may only overturn the district court and grant a writ of habeas corpus if the state court decision resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court.d.
as a threshold matter,a legal doctrine is not clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court unless it is based on holdings,as opposed to the dicta,of the court decisions as of the time of the relevant decision.williams taylor,d see also lockyer andrade,d.a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if it arrives at a legal holding that contradicts a supreme court precedent or involves facts that are materially indistinguishable from a supreme court case but nonetheless arrives at a substantially different result.taylor,at.an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law occurs if the state court identifies the correct governing legal rules from the supreme court cases but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular prisoner case or if the state court extends a court precedent to a context where it should not apply,or fails to extend it to a context where it should apply.id.at.
iii.discussion 
initially,we note that the standard of review established by aedpa is determinative in this case.as debatable as vega may be we conclude that its application in petitioner case was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.
confrontation clause 
the first issue we address is whether the trial court decision to prohibit cross examination on the issue of the bac verifier general reliability was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.
petitioner asserts that the trial court violated her right to be confronted with the witnesses against her,const.amend.vi,by precluding cross examination of officers wetzel and mckelvey on the issue of whether the bac verifier is generally reliable.brief of appellant at.the trial court did permit petitioner to cross examine the officers on whether they properly administered the breath test,whether they complied with the ohio health department mandatory guidelines for operating the test,and whether the specific machine used to test petitioner was functioning properly and reliably.in upholding the trial court limitation of cross examination to only these issues,the appeals court reasoned that vega stands for the proposition that the general reliability of the bac verifier machine is irrelevant.miskel,wl,at citing vega,at there is no indication that the appeals court or the trial court interpreted vega as precluding a challenge to the accuracy and reliability of the specific machine used to test petitioner.furthermore,we note that there is no indication that the trial court in fact precluded petitioner from making such a challenge.indeed,petitioner counsel officers wetzel and mckelvey regarding the accuracy and reliability of the machine they used to test her breath.see,at,trial transcript.
in reviewing the ohio courts decisions in this case,we note that the supreme court has not confronted a challenge to limits on cross examination imposed pursuant to an omvi statute or an omvi per se statute.still,there is important supreme court precedent relevant to petitioner confrontation clause claim.an essential component of the confrontation clause is the accused right to the state witnesses.davis alaska,d.however,the sixth amendment guarantees an opportunity for effective cross examination,not cross examination that is effective in whatever way,and to whatever extent,the defense might wish.delaware fensterer,d per curiam.as we have recognized,a trial court has discretion to limit the scope of this includes discretion to impose limits based on concerns about harassment,prejudice,confusion of the issues or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.boggs collins,cir,cert.denied,d citing delaware van arsdall,d.
in addition,it is the state prerogative to define what evidence is relevant to the case in the first place.see jackson virginia,d recognizing the power of the states to define criminal offenses see also montana egelhoff,d ginsburg,concurring states enjoy wide latitude in defining the elements of criminal offenses.citations omitted indeed,this court must defer to a state court interpretation of its own rules of evidence and procedure when assessing a habeas petition.allen morris,cir,cert.denied,d citation omitted see also duffel dutton,cir.the ohio legislature has committed the determination of whether certain breath testing machines are generally reliable to the state director of health.ohio code d.on this basis,the trial court determined that the issue of a breath testing machine general reliability is irrelevant the only relevant issues,given the conclusion that the machine in general is reliable,are whether the specific machine used to test petitioner functioned properly and reliably during the particular test in question and whether the officers who operated the machine did so in accordance with the health department regulations.see miskel,wl,at see also ohio admin code et establishing guidelines by which officers are to conduct breath tests.the trial court permitted cross examination on all of these issues.
in sum,petitioner had a full and fair opportunity to challenge the credibility and reliability of the state witnesses by inquiring as to their qualifications and knowledge about the specific machine competence during the test performed on petitioner.consequently,the limits on cross examination imposed by the trial court did not disable petitioner from attacking the accuracy and reliability of the specific bac verifier used to measure her bac.because petitioner had an opportunity for effective cross examination,fensterer,at,we hold that the trial court ruling was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.
compulsory process and the right to present a defense 
the next issue we consider is whether the trial court refusal to admit expert testimony on the issue of the bac verifier general reliability was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.
under aedpa,if there is no clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court that supports a habeas petitioner legal argument,the argument must fail.see d taylor,at.petitioner argument that she has a constitutional right to present the expert testimony of shamansky as to the general reliability of bac verifiers suffers from this deficiency.petitioner points to two provisions of the constitution as independent sources of this purported sixth amendment compulsory process clause and the fourteenth amendment due process clause,specifically,the right to present a complete defense.see brief of appellant at.
as authority for her claim,petitioner relies solely on california trombetta,d.brief of appellant at.in trombetta,the supreme court rejected the defendants claim that the state police failure to preserve their breath samples denied them the ability to impeach the results of the breath testing machine used to determine their bac.trombetta,at.the court styled trombetta as an case in the vein of such cases as brady maryland,d establishing a criminal defendant constitutional privilege to obtain evidence in possession of the prosecutor that is material to the defendant guilt and united states agurs,d imposing on prosecutors the constitutional duty to disclose exculpatory evidence to the defendant.trombetta,at.nevertheless,petitioner maintains that trombetta squarely resolves the issue presented here in her favor.for this conclusion,petitioner points to a footnote in the court opinion in which the court observes 
the materiality of breath samples is directly related to the reliability of the intoxilyzer a breath testing machine itself.the degree to which preserved samples are material depends on how reliable the intoxilyzer is.this correlation suggests that a more direct constitutional attack might be made on the sufficiency of the evidence underlying the state case.after all,if the intoxilyzer were truly prone to erroneous readings,then intoxilyzer results without more might be insufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
id.at.citing jackson virginia,d.petitioner asserts that by this language,the court presumes that a defendant ha s a constitutional right to attack the reliability of the breath testing machine.brief of appellant at.
there are two serious flaws with petitioner reading of trombetta.first,assuming petitioner is correct to read such significance into a footnote of a supreme court opinion,the court subsequent description of what the purported constitutional right entails undermines her argument.to impeach the machine credibility,the court observed in trombetta,the defendants could have inspected the machine and its calibration results.at.to challenge the machine measurements during the test in question,the defendants identified only two sources capable of interfering with test results radio waves and chemicals that appear in the blood of those who are dieting.id.for defendants whose test results might have been affected by either of these factors,the court continued,it remains possible to introduce at trial evidence demonstrating that the defendant was dieting at the time of the test or that the test was conducted near a source of radio waves.id.emphasis added.finally,to expose operator error,the defendant retains the right to the officer who administered the test,and to attempt to raise doubts in the mind of the factfinder whether the test was properly administered.id.emphasis added.
thus to the extent the trombetta court contemplated a constitutional right to challenge a breath test reliability,the right it constructed is plainly targeted at the specific testing machine in question indeed,the court makes no mention of attacking the general reliabili
