factual background 
in april,satterfield,a repairman,was called to the house of william bryant to repair a television set.after receiving partial payment,satterfield attempted but failed to fix bryant television set,returning several times without success.eventually,bryant demanded a refund of his fee,threatening satterfield with a baseball bat.satterfield returned the fee and left.
on april,at about in the morning,bryant was shot to death outside his home.immediately after the shooting,the police spoke with two eyewitnesses,eric and grady freeman.eric freeman described the shooter as a white male,about tall,driving a blue station wagon.grady freeman described the shooter as a guy,about tall,driving a dark station wagon,but did not specify his hair color or ethnicity.satterfield is a.at that time,the police obtained a warrant to search satterfield home,but were unable to obtain sufficient evidence to make an arrest.
in,satterfield made the acquaintance of patricia edwards and her husband,wayne.edwards testified at trial that on may,during a conversation after playing tennis,satterfield confessed that he murdered bryant,that he had done so because bryant threatened him,and that he had disposed of his caliber gun after the murder.that day,edwards contacted his attorney,who contacted the police on his behalf to report satterfield admission.satterfield contended at trial that edwards fabricated his confession to punish satterfield for his alleged romantic advances towards edwards wife.
satterfield defense consisted of impeaching edwards testimony as biased and arguing that a different shooter committed the crime.defense counsel entered the warrant describing eric freeman police report into the record,but neither eric nor grady freeman testified to their recollection of the crime.defense counsel declined to call these witnesses out of concern that the perhaps helpful effect of the witnesses police statements would be undermined.counsel belief was based,at least in part,on the fact that eric freeman had identified the shooter as a white male while his brother grady had identified the shooter as a guy,which to counsel meant a.
on june,satterfield was convicted on both counts and sentenced to life in prison.
ii.procedural history 
the superior court affirmed judgment against satterfield on july.the pennsylvania supreme court denied allocatur on january.on april,satterfield,acting pro se,filed a petition with the pennsylvania supreme court,entitled petition for writ of habeas corpus ad bench matter king bench petition,which was denied on june.on october,the pennsylvania supreme court denied satterfield motion to reconsider dismissal of his king bench petition on january,satterfield filed a petition for relief pursuant to the pennsylvania post conviction relief act pcra.the pcra court denied satterfield pcra petition on september,which the superior court affirmed august.the pennsylvania supreme court denied allocatur on april.
on january,satterfield filed the pro se petition for writ of habeas corpus that is before us.magistrate judge scuderi initially dismissed the petition as,but,on september,judge dubois remanded for additional consideration of statutory tolling.judge dubois ruled that satterfield king bench petition was properly filed for purposes of tolling the statute of limitations in federal habeas cases under aedpa,d.satterfield i,d at.
on may,magistrate judge scuderi issued a supplemental report and recommendation supplemental report recommending that satterfield claims be denied on their merits.when satterfield filed no objections,on july,judge dubois issued an order adopting the report.see satterfield johnson,d,hereinafter satterfield ii.
on july,satterfield filed objections to the supplemental report,requesting the opportunity to file out of time,which judge dubois eventually granted on june,judge dubois vacated the report and order issued july,holding that satterfield defense counsel had been ineffective for failing to interview and call eric and grady freeman,and vacated satterfield sentence.satterfield remaining claims of actual innocence and absence of notice of charges against him were denied.the mandate was stayed for days to permit pennsylvania to retry satterfield.id.at.
both satterfield and the commonwealth filed timely notices of appeal from the court order.
iii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction to review the district court grant of a writ of habeas corpus under a.we exercise plenary review over issues related to statutes of limitations.merritt blaine,cir.where the district court relies entirely on the state court record and does not hold an evidentiary hearing,our review of the district court decision is also plenary.lewis johnson,cir.
iv.discussion 
a.the commonwealth did not waive the right to assert that satterfield federal habeas petition is 
satterfield argues that the commonwealth has failed to appeal the portion of the district court order holding that satterfield federal habeas petition was not under aedpa,and that therefore the commonwealth has waived any right to assert that his federal habeas petition is under federal rules of appellate procedure c b and a a.appellee br.the commonwealth notice of appeal does not mention any appeal from the portion of the june,order adopting magistrate judge scuderi supplemental report which held,pursuant to the district court remand order of september,that satterfield king bench petition was properly filed and therefore tolled under aedpa statutory tolling provisions.see d.
had the commonwealth filed a notice of appeal from the entire order granting collateral relief,the appeal of that final judgment would have draw n into question all prior orders and rulings.mci telecommunications teleconcepts,cir quoting drinkwater union carbide,cir.the commonwealth notice only identified the portion of the district court order dealing with ineffective assistance of counsel.thus,the question is not whether an appeal from a final order implicates all prior orders,but whether an appeal from a portion of a final order determining the merits of a federal habeas petition implies an appeal from another portion of that same final order dealing with under aedpa 
we interpret the notice requirements of rules and liberally,exercising appellate jurisdiction over orders not specified in a notice of appeal if there is a connection between the specified and unspecified orders the intention to appeal the unspecified order is apparent and the opposing party is not prejudiced and has a full opportunity to brief the issues.polonski trump taj mahal,cir.
the district court order adopting the magistrate judge supplemental report regarding statutory tolling was related to the claim for ineffective assistance of counsel because the ineffective assistance of counsel claim could not be reached without disposing of the issue of timeliness.see id.treating notice of appeal specifying summary judgment order as including appeal of separate order granting attorney fees drinkwater,at notice of appeal designating portions of a summary judgment order on sex discrimination claim treated as related to prior order dismissing retaliation count of same complaint.
the commonwealth intention to appeal the issue of timeliness was clearly manifest from its first brief.the commonwealth brief,filed february,devotes thirteen pages to arguing the district court ruling on statutory tolling.appellants br.there is no evidence that the commonwealth failure to include its objection to statutory tolling prejudiced satterfield.he had ample time to prepare a response on the issue of statutory tolling,although he declined to address statutory tolling and argued only the question of equitable tolling in his brief.appellee br.united states bendolph,at holding that notice for habeas corpus petitioner to prepare brief on issue of timeliness raised sua sponte is sufficient to avoid prejudice.
satterfield is not entitled to statutory tolling 
aedpa imposes a statute of limitations on all federal habeas claims,subject to tolling for the time a properly filed application for state or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending d.the statute of limitations on satterfield federal habeas petition began to run on aedpa effective date,april.burns morton,cir.satterfield filed his king bench petition prior to aedpa effective date,on april.assuming for the moment that this petition tolled aedpa statute of limitations,satterfield time began to run when the pennsylvania supreme court denied reconsideration of its order dismissing the king bench petition on october.the statute of limitations then ran until january,when satterfield filed a petition for relief pursuant to the pcra,which is conceded to have tolled aedpa limitation until the petition was finally denied on april.the statute of limitations ran from that date until january,when satterfield filed his pro se petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal court.if the king bench petition tolled aedpa statute of limitations,satterfield timely filed his federal habeas petition.the timeliness of satterfield federal habeas petition therefore hinges on whether his king bench petition was properly filed with the commonwealth.
the meaning of conditions to filing 
in artuz bennett,d,the supreme court held that a petition is properly filed when its delivery and acceptance are in compliance with the applicable laws and rules governing filings.id.at.a properly filed petition must be in the proper form,and be timely delivered to the proper court or office.id.the key distinction developed in artuz is between condition s to filing,which go to the application for review,and condition s to obtaining relief,which go to the individual legal claims contained within the application for review.see id.at.failure to satisfy the former prevents a petition from being properly filed,which in turn prevents application of aedpa tolling provision.failure to satisfy the latter does not prevent statutory tolling.artuz,at.the statute refers only to properly filed applications.
untimely filing,absence of jurisdiction,failure to pay fees,and failure to obtain a requisite certificate of appealability are all examples of flaws going to the application for relief itself.see pace diguglielmo,d discussing untimely filing and absence of jurisdiction artuz at.discussing filing fees and certificates of appealability.these requirements prevent tolling because they go to the very initiation of a petition and a court ability to consider that petition pace.at.by contrast,a procedural bar on the relitigation of an issue raised on appeal or a bar on claims that could have been raised on direct appeal are examples of mandatory procedural requirements that go to conditions of relief,not conditions of filing.artuz,at.
the mere fact that a court reviewed an application before dismissing it does not necessarily mean that an application was properly filed.for example,the court in pace made clear that a petition ruled untimely by a state court can not be properly filed even if some judicial review is necessary to determine if the filing condition,or an exception to it,is met.id.at finding timeliness,like jurisdictional matters and fee payments to be conditions to filing even though they often necessitate judicial scrutiny.if a state court determines that a petition is untimely,that would be the end of the matter,regardless of whether it also addressed the merits of the claim,or whether its timeliness ruling was entangled with the merits.carey saffold,d see also pace.at consideration by judge of whether petitioner may proceed in forma pauperis does not prevent claim from being dismissed as not properly filed for failure to pay filing fees.
satterfield king bench petition did not meet certain conditions to filing under pennsylvania law 
satterfield appears to concede,while arguing for the application of equitable estoppel,that he mistakenly asserted his rights in the wrong forum with respect to his king bench petition.appellee br.the district court likewise found that it was abundantly clear that the only means of collaterally attacking a conviction is via a pcra petition.satterfield i,d at.we agree that satterfield king bench petition was denied for failure to satisfy conditions of filing and therefore was improperly filed under pennsylvania law.
if considered strictly as a petition for habeas corpus,satterfield king bench petition was improperly filed under pennsylvania law.the procedures for filing a petition for relief in pennsylvania are defined by the pcra.commonwealth fahy,t he pcra subsumes the writ of habeas corpus with respect to remedies offered under the pcra.it required satterfield to file three verified copies of the application for relief with the court in which he was convicted.b.satterfield failed to comply because he filed his king bench petition with the pennsylvania supreme court.the court in pace implied that such failures to comply with the pcra requirements would prevent statutory tolling.at the pcra timeliness requirement is every bit as much a condition to filing as the requirement that three copies of a pcra petition be filed with the clerk of the court in which the defendant was convicted.
the king bench petition,if construed as an application for extraordinary relief,also failed to meet certain conditions of filing.extraordinary relief may be granted in any matter pending before any court.ann.because satterfield had already been convicted and his direct appeals exhausted,there was no pending matter over which the pennsylvania supreme court could exercise jurisdiction.see in re assignment of judge bernard avellino.the pennsylvania supreme court lack of jurisdiction goes to the initiation of a petition and its ability to provide relief,and therefore was dismissed for failure to meet a condition of filing.see pace.at finding jurisdictional matters are conditions to filing.
finally,the fact that the pennsylvania supreme court is vested with the authority to disregard these procedural shortcomings pursuant to its king bench powers does not convert satterfield improperly filed petition for relief into a properly filed petition for purposes of aedpa.merely because the pennsylvania supreme court is vested with the authority to exercise its king bench powers as it sees fit does not mean that prisoners are therefore granted the power to delay indeterminately aedpa statute of limitations by filing king bench petitions 
the seventh circuit addressed a similar situation in brooks walls,cir.in that case,illinois law provided that a trial judge could examine whether untimely filing was the result of the petitioner culpable negligence before dismissing.petitioner brooks contended that any review of her claim for culpable negligence constituted a consideration of the merits,and therefore her petition was necessarily properly filed.the court refused to accept this argument,noting that i f this is so,then almost every collateral attack in illinois is properly filed for purposes of d.id.at.this was so despite the fact that the trial judge could cast a sidelong glance at the merits of a petition before deciding whether to dismiss.id.analogizing to the doctrine of independent and adequate state grounds and plain error review,the court concluded that a state does not abandon the benefits of the independent and adequate state grounds doctrine by allowing by accepting untimel
