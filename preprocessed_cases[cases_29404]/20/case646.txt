opinion of the court 
in,a state court jury convicted joseph kindler of killing a witness against him and recommended a sentence of death.following his trial,but before the death sentence had been formally imposed,kindler filed several motions.before those motions could be heard,kindler escaped from custody,was captured,escaped again,and was finally arrested and returned to philadelphia in.kindler efforts to reinstate his motions upon his return were unsuccessful,and his judgment of conviction was thereafter affirmed,based on pennsylvania fugitive forfeiture doctrine.commonwealth kindler,kindler i commonwealth kindler,kindler ii.on review of his petition for habeas relief,we agreed with the district court that the state forfeiture rule did not provide an adequate basis to bar federal habeas review.kindler horn,d,kindler iii kindler horn,cir kindler iv.after granting certiorari,the supreme court vacated our decision and remanded the case,concluding that a state procedural rule is not automatically inadequate and unenforceable just because the state rule is discretionary rather than mandatory.beard kindler,kindler v.kindler now argues on remand that pennsylvania did not apply a discretionary rule,but,instead,applied a mandatory rule that represented a break from past decisions.we agree and,for the following reasons,we will affirm in part and reverse in part the district court order.
kindler case is.in he burglarized a store in pennsylvania with scott shaw and david bernstein and was captured by the police.he escaped.meanwhile,bernstein fingered kindler as the mastermind of the burglary and offered to testify against both kindler and shaw.kindler was then arrested and released on bail.while out on bail he devised and carried out a plan to prevent bernstein from testifying.working with shaw girlfriend,michelle raifer,kindler lured bernstein from his apartment,brutally struck him over the head twenty times with a baseball bat,jabbed him five times in the ribs with an electric prod,dragged bernstein immobilized body into raifer car,and drove to the banks of the delaware river,where kindler wrapped a cinder block around bernstein neck and threw him into the water.
a jury found kindler guilty of murder and recommended a death sentence.afterwards,kindler filed motions in which he argued,among other things,that the instructions given to the jury created a reasonable likelihood that,when deciding on whether to recommend the death penalty,the jury believed it could only consider mitigating circumstances if those circumstances were unanimously agreed upon and that the prosecutor had engaged in misconduct by improperly vouching for the evidence against him.while those motions were pending,on september,kindler organized an effort to saw through the external bars of his prison,escaped,and fled to canada.approximately seven months later,he was arrested,once again,for burglary.once again,he was imprisoned.and,once again,he escaped,this time through an organized effort in which kindler fellow inmates hoisted him up to the roof through a skylight,where he rappelled down the side of the prison using a rope made of bed sheets.a fugitive for two more years,kindler was finally identified by canadian viewers of the television program america most wanted and arrested in september.he contested extradition and was not returned to pennsylvania until september.
kindler returned to find that,at the request of the commonwealth,the trial judge had dismissed his motions on account of his escape.kindler filed a motion to reinstate those motions.in an oral ruling,the court of common pleas denied the motion,finding that the defendant did voluntarily remove himself from the detention center by escaping and loses all rights and privileges for motions.in october,kindler death sentence was formally imposed.on appeal,the pennsylvania supreme court affirmed the trial judge decision to deny his motion to reinstate his motions,first explaining that the general rule in pennsylvania at the time was that fugitives have no right to any appellate review and then crafting a new rule barring appellate review if the defendant flight has a connection to the court ability to rule on the defendant case and the sanction of dismissing the defendant appeal is reasonable under the circumstances.kindler i,at.
kindler then filed for relief under pennsylvania post conviction relief act the pcra.et west,arguing,among other things,that counsel was constitutionally ineffective at the death penalty phase of his trial.the pcra court denied his petition and the pennsylvania supreme court affirmed,each concluding that kindler had no right to pcra review because the pennsylvania supreme court had previously ruled that kindler forfeited his right to an appeal by escaping.kindler ii,at.
kindler then turned to the federal courts for habeas relief.the district court concluded that the state fugitive forfeiture rule used to dismiss kindler motions was inadequate to bar federal review because it was not clearly established that pennsylvania courts were required to dismiss a fugitive appeals in situations where the fugitive had fled and been captured before the appellate process was ever initiated.after finding constitutional errors in the penalty phase of his trial,the district court issued an order granting in part and denying in part kindler petition for writ of habeas corpus.kindler iii,d at.on appeal,we agreed that the rule is inadequate and,upon reviewing the merits,affirmed the district court order granting habeas relief on kindler claim that the jury instructions violated the supreme court decision in mills.maryland,and reversed the district court order denying habeas relief on kindler claims that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective and that he was the victim of prosecutorial misconduct.kindler iv,at.
the supreme court then granted certiorari to decide whether a state procedural rule is automatically inadequate under the doctrine and therefore unenforceable on federal habeas review because the state rule is discretionary rather than mandatory.kindler v.at.during the oral argument in the supreme court,the parties agreed that the answer to this question was no.transcript of oral argument at,kindler v.the supreme court thus held that a discretionary rule can serve as an adequate ground to bar federal habeas review.kindler v.at.the court vacated our judgment and remanded for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.with the supreme court holding in mind,we are once again asked by the parties to determine whether pennsylvania fugitive forfeiture rule,as applied to kindler case,is inadequate,and therefore unenforceable on federal habeas review.
in its ruling,the supreme court stated that the test for determining whether a rule is adequate is whether that rule is firmly established and regularly followed.walker martin,quoting kindler v,s.at.adequacy in this case is determined according to the law in effect when kindler escaped from prison on september.see doctor walters,cir citing reynolds ellingsworth,cir.
the purpose of the adequacy doctrine is twofold to ensure that state courts do not set traps for unwary litigants bringing disfavored claims,and to ensure that habeas petitioners have fair notice of what they must do to avoid default.campbell burris,cir.in applying these principles,this court seeks to determine whether the state rule itself provides guidance regarding how the rule should be applied or whether such standards have developed in practice.id.citing doctor,at.a state procedural rule consistently applied in the majority of cases,but occasionally overlooked in others,may nevertheless be adequate.doctor,at citing dugger adams.thus,as we explained in the course of enforcing a state equivalent of the federal plain error rule in campbell,
t he issue is not whether the state procedural default rule leaves room for the exercise of some judicial discretion almost all do.rather,the issue is whether,at the relevant point in time,the judicial discretion contemplated by the state rule is being exercised in a manner that lets people know when they are at risk of default and treats people in the same manner.
the trial court ruled that the fugitive forfeiture rule was mandatory,that it was required to dismiss kindler motions.order granting commonwealth motion to dismiss kindler motions by reason of his escape from lawful custody and current status as a fugitive from justice.oral ruling that the defendant did voluntarily remove himself from the detention center by escaping and loses all rights and privileges for motions emphasis added opinion noting that the original trial court judge was applying pennsylvania superior court precedent stating that he was without discretion in denying defendant motions as long as he remained a fugitive outside the court jurisdiction emphasis added.but the same court also believed that it had the discretion to reinstate those motions upon kindler return to custody.opinion describing the standard for review of the denial of a motion to reinstate motions as whether the trial court abused its discretion.
thus,the fugitive forfeiture rule,as articulated by the trial court judges in kindler case,mandated that his motions be dismissed,but gave them discretion to reinstate those motions if kindler asked them to upon his recapture.this curious mix of obligation and discretion created the confusion that has plagued this case a state that was compounded when the pennsylvania supreme court subsequently set forth the entirely new rule that appellate court review of motions dismissed on account of a defendant status as a fugitive is limited to whether the sanction of dismissal is reasonable under the circumstances.kindler i,at.
we have previously concluded that there was no firmly established fugitive forfeiture rule mandating the dismissal of an appeal first filed upon a fugitive return to custody.see doctor,at.in that case,defendant gary lee doctor escaped during the lunch recess of his bench trial for the crime of aggravated assault.upon his recapture five years later,doctor filed an appeal to the pennsylvania superior court.that court dismissed the appeal,explaining that by choosing to flee,doctor forever forfeited his right to appeal.id.at.we understood this language to indicate that the superior court believed it had no discretion to consider doctor appeal.
then we surveyed the relevant pennsylvania supreme court decisions to determine whether this was a new rule.in commonwealth galloway,the supreme court of pennsylvania addressed a situation in which the defendant had escaped twice once during the pendency of motions in the trial court and again during the pendency of an appeal to the supreme court of pennsylvania.following his initial escape,the trial court dismissed his motions pursuant to the fugitive forfeiture doctrine.after his return to custody and sentencing,the defendant appealed.when the defendant escaped again,the commonwealth moved to dismiss the appeal.the defendant returned to custody,however,before the pennsylvania supreme court acted on the commonwealth motion.the court denied the motion,explaining 
the rationale behind dismissal of an appeal while a convicted defendant is a fugitive from justice rests upon the inherent discretion of any court to refuse to hear the claim of a litigant who,by escaping,has placed himself beyond the jurisdiction and control of the court,and,hence,might not be responsive to the judgment of the court.
since galloway is no longer a fugitive from justice and is now subject to the jurisdiction of this court,he will be responsive to any judgment this court renders.therefore,this court has no basis upon which to grant a motion to dismiss the appeal at this juncture.
id.at citations omitted.
while the galloway court did not fault the trial court for dismissing the motions,the absence of rulings on them did not preclude judicial review.it ruled 
in order to give the trial court the first opportunity to rectify any errors that may have occurred in the trial process,and to aid in clarifying and framing the issues on appeal,we remand the record to the trial court for disposition of the motions on the merits.see commonwealth grillo.upon remand the trial court is directed to consider the issues raised in the motions filed january.
after galloway,pennsylvania intermediate courts consistently recognized their discretion to hear a properly filed appeal as long as the criminal defendant had returned to the jurisdiction before the appeal was dismissed.doctor,at.thus,in doctor we concluded that the rule at the time of doctor escape was as follows if the defendant is returned to custody while his appeal is pending,an appellate court has the discretion to hear the appeal,but if the defendant is returned to custody after the appeal is dismissed an appellate court lacks the discretion to reinstate and hear the appeal.id.because doctor case presented a new situation he escaped before the appellate process had even begun we concluded that it was not firmly established that pennsylvania courts lacked the discretion to hear an appeal first filed after custody had been restored.id.at.
both kindler and doctor were subjected to a mandatory rule that stymied their appeals.when the question of adequacy was presented to us previously,we were thus confronted with the whether the differences between kindler case and doctor were legally relevant.we concluded that they were not.the procedural default rule applied in kindler case was not only not firmly established in but was directly inconsistent with pennsylvania law at that time as reflected in galloway.it follows that the rule did not treat kindler in the same manner as similarly situated individuals would have been treated in pennsylvania in.accordingly,we held that pennsylvania fugitive forfeiture rule did not preclude us from reaching the merits of this habeas proceeding now,on remand,we must determine whether the supreme court opinion compels a different result.
the supreme court review of our prior decision resulted in what it described as a narrow holding in response to a narrow question of federal habeas law.kindler v.at.it held that a discretionary rule can be adequate to bar federal habeas review and then expressly left it to us to decide,on remand,whether the pennsylvania courts applied a new rule mandating dismissal,which constituted a break from past discretionary practice.id.we so decide.here,just as in doctor,a mandatory rule was not firmly established and was thus inadequate to bar federal review.our holding in both cases was in no way dependent on a conclusion that discretionary rules are automatically inadequate.to the contrary,we held in our prior decision that the rigid,mandatory,rule requiring dismissal of motions was inadequate because it was novel.kindler iv,at.because the supreme court opinion leaves our prior holding undisturbed,we reaffirm our prior decision.
the commonwealth protests.it points out that after confirming that the general rule was mandatory,the pennsylvania supreme court distinguished kindler case,applied a new,discretionary,rule and then used that rule as the basis for refusing to hear the merits of kindler appeal.however,we must look at the law as it was understood at the time of kindler escape.see doctor,at citing reynolds ellingsworth,cir citing spencer kemp,cir en banc and lumpkin ricketts,cir.the pennsylvania supreme court was applying a new rule in kindler case.this rule obviously did not exist in and was thus not firmly established.
moreover,the rule applied to bar kindler appeal was hardly discretionary in the usual sense of the term.the pennsylvania supreme court concluded that its review of the trial court decision to dismiss the motions was limited to determining whether the flight has a connection with the court ability to dispose of the defendant case and whether the sanction imposed in response to the flight is reasonable under the circumstances.kindler i,at.this amounts to a mandatory rule with narrow conditions.worse,in kindler case the new rule announced by the pennsylvania supreme court sharply and suddenly skewed the rules in the commonwealth favor because the trial court judges applied a mandatory rule to dismiss kindler motions,even though one of those judges thought the better prac
