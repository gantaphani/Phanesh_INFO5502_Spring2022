this is a death penalty case from cameron county,texas.texas appeals from a federal grant of habeas relief on jose rivera atkins claim,arguing that the district court erred in not dismissing his habeas petition as untimely and in finding that rivera is mentally retarded.we affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand for further proceedings.
the dates and sequence of events are important in this appeal.in may,rivera was convicted and sentenced to death for murdering luis daniel blanco.the texas court of criminal appeals cca affirmed his conviction and sentence.his first state habeas petition was denied by the cca on december,the federal district court denied his first federal habeas petition on october.this court denied a certificate of appealability on november.rivera execution date was set for august.
on june,rivera filed a state habeas petition raising an claim for the first time.that was the last day to bring an atkins claim under aedpa statute of limitations period the cca dismissed rivera habeas petition on july.rivera submitted a suggestion for rehearing to the cca on august,which the cca rejected on august.rivera filed,and the state courts rejected,a final state habeas petition on wednesday,august.
rivera also sought relief in federal court on his atkins claim.on tuesday,august,he filed a motion for authorization to file a successive petition in this court,as required by b a.rivera submitted a proposed successive application for habeas corpus to be attached to the motion for authorization.this court denied his first motion on august as failing to make a prima facie showing of mental retardation this court could not consider all of the evidence of mental retardation rivera presented because he had not presented that evidence to the state courts.rivera then filed another habeas petition with the state court on august,presenting the evidence of mental retardation that this court refused to consider.
the state courts rejected his petition the same day,and rivera filed a second motion for authorization to file a successive petition with this court.now able to consider all of rivera evidence,this court concluded that rivera had made a prima facie showing of mental retardation,authorized the successive petition on that issue only,and stayed his execution.rivera filed his habeas petition with the district court on monday,august.
after rivera filed his habeas petition in the federal district court,the state moved to dismiss the petition as being untimely.the state argued that rivera should have filed the writ in federal court at the absolute latest on thursday,august.the state also argued in its motion that rivera was not entitled to any equitable tolling of the statute of limitations.
the district court summarily denied the state motion to dismiss the petition during a status conference in september,stating denied.you will preserve your exception.we will revisit those matters.at the end of the conference,the state sought to clarify the nature of judge vela denial of its motion to dismiss.the following exchange occurred 
texas your honor,do i understand that the court has denied the motion to dismiss filed by the state in its entirety 
court if the state wants to,they can favor me with briefs and the like.i will revisit it.but for right now it stands denied.
texas that was just what i was going to ask,if you would reconsider 
following the status conference,the parties briefed the mental retardation issue,and judge vela held an evidentiary hearing in january.judge vela died,however,before rendering a decision.the case was transferred to judge hanen,who held a second evidentiary hearing in january.another round of briefing followed,and judge hanen issued a memorandum opinion and order on march,finding rivera mentally retarded,granting habeas relief,and permanently enjoining him from being executed.however,judge hanen did not revisit judge vela timeliness ruling.
the state first argues that rivera petition is under aedpa.
while rivera state habeas petitions were pending,aedpa statute of limitations was tolled thus,the statute of limitations on rivera atkins claim was tolled through wednesday,august,the day on which state proceedings ended however,because rivera did not file his state atkins claims until the last day under aedpa,none of the statute of limitations period remained.although this court authorized rivera to file a successive petition raising his atkins claim on wednesday,august,he waited over the weekend to file the application with the district on monday,august.therefore,his application was untimely 
nevertheless,as we have explained,a court can allow an untimely petition to proceed under the doctrine of equitable tolling in extraordinary circumstances.we and the district courts,guided by precedent,must examine each case on its facts to determine whether it presents sufficiently rare and exceptional circumstances to justify equitable tolling.the doctrine of equitable tolling preserves a plaintiff claims when strict application of the statute of limitations would be inequitable.
both the state and rivera would have us decide in the first instance whether equitable tolling is available in this case rivera advances three grounds in support of applying the doctrine that texas former rule delayed by five months the time he could file in state court that he had no right to counsel,lacked the financial resources to hire counsel,lacked the resources to develop adequately his atkins claim,and lacked the mental capacity to represent himself pro se and that a proved eighth amendment claim requires that aedpa statute of limitations give way or that it justifies equitable tolling.we,however,decline the parties invitation to decide now whether equitable tolling applies.
the record before the court is not sufficiently developed for us to engage in the determination of whether equitable tolling is appropriate.judge vela denied the state motion to dismiss summarily.despite his explicit invitation to the state to brief and raise again the timeliness issue,the state did not do so before either him or judge hanen.rather,the state switched litigation strategies and focused on the merits of rivera atkins claim.the consequence of the state choice is that a factual record upon which this court could base an equitable tolling decision was not developed before either judge.considering that we affirm the finding that rivera is mentally retarded,as discussed below,it would be imprudent for us to proceed in the first instance on the question of equitable tolling,decidedly so given rivera second bundle of arguments in favor of equitable is,the relationship between his retardation and his ability to pursue habeas relief.
the state baldly asserts that rivera has never been without counsel since the supreme court decided atkins,and thus we need not concern ourselves with the hypothetical problem of a mentally retarded person trying to represent himself pro se.the record,however,is not so certain.it does not clearly reflect whether rivera had counsel through the entire relevant time period whether there were gaps in his representation if there were gaps,why he was without counsel and the effects of any gaps in representation on rivera ability to complete his atkins petition.because of that uncertainty,lewis,where the court declined to apply equitable tolling,is distinguishable lewis obtained his pro bono counsel on or soon after the day he received notice of his previous counsel withdrawal,which was march,leaving lewis with over three months to file his state application.
nor can we discern why it took over five months for rivera to file his atkins claim in the state courts.perhaps the state is correct in its answer,but it assumes attorney error or lack of assumption not tested in a hearing.nor does the record sufficiently develop what particular obstacles rivera encountered in assembling his atkins claim.for example,it is unclear to what extent he was able to access medical records in the state control,or exactly how his indigence impacted his ability to develop his claim.
all that is clear is that what occurred during the nearly six months between the end of the first federal habeas proceedings and the filing of rivera state petition raising his atkins claim is unclear.until the underpinnings of what happened and why are made clear,we can not rule on equitable tolling.our examples of uncertainties that remain are meant to be illustrative but not exhaustive of what the parties should explore before the district court.accordingly,we vacate judge vela order denying the state motion and remand to the district court with instruction to hold an evidentiary hearing,make specific findings,and rule on the issue of equitable tolling.
although the statute of limitations remains potentially dispositive and we ordinarily would not decide the merits under these circumstances,there are compelling reasons for us to address the merits of rivera claim now.first,the merits are squarely before us we have a developed record,an opinion by the district court,and the parties have fully briefed and argued the merits.judicial economy favors addressing the merits now.second,the issue of rivera retardation is potentially determinative just as the statute of limitations is.we think it unfair to have the district court and the parties grapple with the difficult question of equitable tolling under the looming possibility that it is all for nought as we might later reverse the finding that rivera is retarded.
third,and perhaps most important,the merits blend inseparably into the question of equitable tolling here.the bases for equitable tolling that prompt us to particular the relationship between rivera retardation and his ability to pursue habeas made the more compelling precisely because rivera has been adjudicated to be retarded.that is,answering whether rivera is retarded is logically not a core element determining whether equitable tolling is available.with this entanglement,leaving rivera retardation as an unaffirmed hypothetical risks obscuring the issue of equitable tolling on remand,and has the possibility of detrimentally compromising the record needed to review the district court decision on remand should the case come back to this court.
finally,because of the case procedural posture,we can not avoid deciding whether the district court erred by not giving aedpa deference to the cca decisions.this inquiry takes us far down the road of examining the merits of rivera claim because,as the district court observed,the evidence before it was quite similar to the evidence before the cca.
before considering the district court findings,we address the state argument that judge hanen was not empowered to apply a de novo standard to rivera atkins claim,and was instead required to give aedpa deference to the cca decisions.
the cca denied both of rivera atkins petitions as abuses of the writ,concluding that neither the first nor the second supplemented made a prima facie showing of retardation.in granting rivera motion to file a successive petition after the cca denied his second petition,this court explained that characterizing the failure to meet the threshold requirement as an abuse of the writ does not foot the ruling on an independent state ground.this is a determination on the merits.the state argues that,because the cca decision was on the merits,aedpa deference standards apply.the district court opinion does not address this issue.
rivera contends that morris controls whether deference is due however,this is not so.morris held that where new evidence merely supplements an atkins claim that was presented to the state courts,aedpa exhaustion requirement is satisfied.we also noted that,i n cases where the legal question is whether the new evidence a petitioner puts forth for the first time on federal habeas on a particular claim already asserted on state habeas is exhausted under b,subparts d and e of concerning factual development are not implicated.this,however,does not mean deference is not due the state is correct to argue that our review of the court of criminal appeals judgment must be conducted under aedpa deferential standard.
under aedpa,if a state court has adjudicated a habeas petitioner claims on the merits,he may receive relief in the federal courts only where the state court decision resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.we apply the same standards as the district court in reviewing a decision of the state court 
a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law announced in supreme court cases,or the state court decides a case differently than the supreme court did on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.a state court decision constitutes an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if the court identifies the correct governing legal principle from supreme court precedent,but applies that principle to the case in an objectively unreasonable manner.if the state court decision runs afoul of these limits,then federal court review is unencumbered by the deference aedpa normally requires.we conclude that the cca dismissal of rivera second supplemented petition as failing to make a prima facie showing was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.
rivera second petition contained a report by richard garnett.garnett analyzed the evidence of rivera retardation,which included various tdcj medical records records from treatment at a mhmr facility for alcohol and drug abuse records from the windham school district brownsville public school records affidavits of teachers at rivera school affidavits of family members of rivera letters written by rivera to family members and reports from medical,psychological,and educational sources.garnett concluded that this evidence suggest s that rivera is mentally retarded and there is no information which could rule out the diagnosis.
garnett explained that rivera had never taken a valid,full length iq test,and that the two tests he had taken to date were not valid indicators of intellectual functioning.based on a review of rivera school records and achievement testing,garnett stated that as an adult,rivera was performing academically at the level of a year old.garnett specifically noted that rivera needed to take a full length,reliable iq test.
garnett report also indicated that the evidence suggested that rivera had deficits in adaptive functioning in multiple areas,including functional academic skills,work,self direction,communication,health,and self care.the evidence further indicated onset prior to age.
the report was directly responsive to the gaps that the cca identified in denying rivera first atkins habeas petition.as to intellectual functioning,the report went beyond mere recitation of grades to describe rivera sustained pattern of academic difficulties,and it analyzed rivera performance on various achievement tests while in school.the report explained why the iq tests rivera had taken to date could not be relied on,and also detailed deficits in adaptive functioning beyond rivera work problems 
the evidence and garnett report raised serious questions about rivera possible retardation.faced only with the threshold question of whether to allow rivera claim to proceed,it was unreasonable on the record before the cca to reject rivera atkins claim as failing to even establish a prima facie when viewed through the prism of atkins command that the constitution places a substantive restriction on the state power to take the life of a mentally retarded offender.
the district court ruling that rivera had exhausted his atkins claim before the state the state understandably does not the conclusion that the cca decision was unreasonable.we explained in morris that the presentation of evidence in the federal courts that places a petitioner claims in a significantly different legal posture must first be presented to the state courts.here,the district court held that although it had evidence before it that was not presented to the state court,there was no exhaustion problem 
t he quality of the evidence presented in support of rivera habeas petition is strikingly similar both in terms of the type and the amount of factual presentations made in state court,and in terms of the qualitative improvement in the evidence made in the federal atkins presentation due to the additional evidence obtained after the state habeas proceedings had concluded.
in short,the district court was considering a body of evidence that did not fundamentally alter rivera retardation claim.from the strikingly similar evidence,the district court found that rivera was retarded.that this body of evidence can support a finding of retardation,which we affirm below,points strongly to the conclusion that the cca decision that rivera had not made a prima facie showing was unreasonable.
the unreasonableness of the cca decision is further compounded by its procedural effect the finding that rivera had not made a prima facie showing deprived rivera of the opportunity to develop fully the substance of his claim before the state courts.atkins,like ford wainwright left to the state s the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction upon their execution of sentences.ford is instructive because of the similarity of the competency and mental retardation issues both decisions affirmatively limit the class of persons who are death penalty eligible.while atkins itself did not specifically impose the sort of procedural requirements that ford mandates,neither did atkins purport to sweep away the protections of due process.
under ford,o nce a prisoner seeking a stay of execution has made a substantial threshold showing of insanity,the protection afforded by procedural due process includes a fair hearing in accord with fundamental fairness.as justice powell explained,due process does not require a full trial on the merits,but a process that affords the prisoner an opportunity to be heard.
for our purposes,we are concerned with the supreme court application of ford in panetti quarterman.in panetti,the prisoner had made a substantial showing of incompetency,but according to the prisoner,the state failed to provide him with procedures in conformity with ford to develop his claim.this failure,the prisoner argued,rendered the state decision denying his incompetency claim an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.the supreme court agreed 
the state court failure to provide the procedures mandated by ford constituted an unreasonable application of clearly established law as determined by this court.it is uncontested that petitioner made a substantial showing of incompetency.this showing entitled him to,among other things,an adequate means by which to submit expert psychiatric evidence in response to the evidence that had been solicited by the state court.and it is clear from the record that the state court reached its competency determination after failing to provide petitioner with this process as a result of this error,our review of petitioner underlying incompetency claim is unencumbered by the deference aedpa normally requires 
even though atkins did not specifically mandate any set of procedures,it was decided against the backdrop of the supreme court and lower court due process jurisprudence.the lesson we draw from panetti is that,where a petitioner has made a prima facie showing of retardation as rivera did,the state court failure to provide him with the opportunity to develop his claim deprives the state court decision of the deference normally due 
the court decision in ake is relevant to the extent that texas abuse of the writ doctrine is potentially a procedural bar to our review the substantive issue in ake was whether the constitution requires a state to provide assistance to an indigent defendant when there is a serious question about the defendant sanity at the time of the offense.however,the court faced a threshold issue of whether an adequate and independent state state waiver it of jurisdiction.the court held that it did have jurisdiction as the application of the state procedural rule turned on an antecedent determination of federal law before applying the waiver doctrine to a constitutional question,the state court must rule,either explicitly or implicitly,on the merits of the constitutional question.the necessity of examining the merits of the federal law issue to decide the applicability of the state procedural rule meant that the prong of the court holding is not independent of federal law.
the application of texas abuse of the writ doctrine to atkins claims is entangled in federal law in much the same way as oklahoma waiver doctrine was in ake in the atkins context,texas courts have imported an antecedent showing of sufficient specific facts to merit further review,rendering dismissal of such claims as abuses of the writ a decision on the merits.that is,to decide whether an atkins claim is an abuse of the writ,the cca examines the substance of the claim to see if it establishes a prima facie case of retardation,and only upon deciding that question can the state court decide whether remand is appropriate thus,a decision that an atkins petition does not make a prima facie is,therefore,an abuse of the not an independent state law ground.
this does not mean that states may not use procedural devices and and adequate state law ferret out frivolous or meritless claims,thereby preventing federal review nor does it mean that states must give hearings to persons with such claims as ford makes clear.but it does mean that,where the threshold a state sets turns on a merits determination of federal law or fails to make clear that it is procedural in nature,that decision is reviewable although texas abuse of the writ doctrine is superficially procedural in that it has a procedural effect,determining which claims are remanded to the state trial courts for further development,it steps beyond a procedural determination to examine the merits of an atkins claim.for an atkins claim,the merits determination is at a minimum interwoven with the constitutional prohibition against executing the mentally retarded 
this case stands in contrast to moreno dretke the cca concluded that moreno failed to make a prima facie showing of retardation,dismissing his petition as an abuse of writ.this court affirmed the district court holding that the cca decision was entitled to aedpa deference.moreno attempted to show subaverage intellectual functioning by submitting an iq test taken in on which he scored a the test administrator,however,qualified his test score,concluding that the results probably reflect the lowest level of his abilities.the test administrator commented that moreno may not have given his best effort and may have exaggerated any possible deficits.the administrator went on to comment that moreno speech was free of articulation errors,he expressed himself appropriately and coherently,and his cognitive processing speed was unremarkable.moreno attempted to demonstrate deficits in adaptive functioning through a history of substance abuse and his attendance in special education classes.however,the only evidentiary support for that claim was the psychologist report reciting moreno educational background.he could not identify any specific special education classes or provide documentation of those classes.in contrast,there was substantial evidence that moreno did not suffer from deficits in adaptive functioning.
the evidence rivera presented to make his prima facie showing of retardation was much stronger than moreno.as summarized in garnett report,rivera presented school records documenting a long,sustained pattern of academic difficulties.and,again,rivera achievement scores demonstrated that as an adult,rivera was performing academically at the level of a year old.garnett also concluded that the available evidence indicated deficits in adaptive functioning other than academic achievement,such as in work,health,and self care.garnett analysis of rivera evidence and his conclusion that it suggest s that rivera is me
