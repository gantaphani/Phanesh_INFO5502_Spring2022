on november,dunlap babysat then jamie afterwards,jamie told her mother that dunlap had touched her private parts.jamie thought her mother did not believe her,and a few days later she told her father.he reported the incident to the police,who obtained a warrant for dunlap arrest.but dunlap had left wisconsin.he was not arrested until years later when he was found in california.
when dunlap trial finally began,jamie was years old.she testified that when she was,she was left in dunlap care at the home of her mother friends,susan smith and gary cox,with whom dunlap had been staying.jamie testified that when she was in bed,dunlap entered the room and got in the bed beside her.she said he put his hands inside her underwear and fondled her buttocks and vagina.
revealed several inconsistencies in jamie testimony.when she was interviewed in she said that cox son shawn was also in the house at the time of the incident,but at trial she said she was alone with dunlap.in she did not say that dunlap penetrated her vagina with his finger,but at the preliminary hearing,years later,she said he had.also in jamie had not mentioned that dunlap had threatened her.at trial,she said he threatened to kill her parents if she told anyone what happened.
in an effort to rehabilitate jamie,the state called theresa hanson,a child protective services investigator for walworth county,wisconsin.hanson had interviewed jamie and prepared a report in.she testified about typical reporting behaviors of child sexual assault victims.she said that children often do not grasp the concepts of in and out in regard to something being put into their genitalia.she said are often confused about the details of an incident.they also have trouble with the concepts before and after.she also said that fear,guilt,and embarrassment could have explained the inconsistencies in jamie testimony and her delay in reporting certain aspects of the assault.in addition,hanson testified that during the interview,jamie fidgeted,kicked the table,put her hands in her mouth,and was generally reticent about discussing the incident.this behavior,hanson said,is consistent with that of a sexual assault victim.
during,hepp counsel attempted to question hanson about jamie detailed and unexplained sexual knowledge.counsel made an offer of proof,pointing out that hanson report included a statement from smith.in that statement,smith,who was deceased when the case was tried,had revealed concern about jamie,who,in smith view,was involved in a great deal of seductive behavior,including touching men in the genital area,humping the family dog,and frequent masturbation.smith noted that these behaviors occurred before the alleged assault by dunlap.
the state objected to this evidence,saying it was barred both by the rule against hearsay and the state rape shield law.the court agreed and excluded the evidence.dunlap was convicted of sexual assault of a child in violation of.stat.on direct appeal,he challenged the exclusion of the evidence.the wisconsin court of appeals reversed dunlap conviction.state dunlap.but the supreme court reinstated it.state dunlap.after exhausting his state remedies,dunlap filed a federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus,which the district court denied.this appeal followed.
a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in state custody can be granted only if the state court proceeding resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law as determined by the united states supreme court.d.a decision is contrary to established federal law as determined by the supreme court if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law,or if the state court confronts facts that are materially indistinguishable from a relevant supreme court precedent and arrives at a result opposite to that reached by the supreme court.williams taylor,d.a state court decision is an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent when the court correctly identifies the governing legal rule but applies it unreasonably to the facts of a particular prisoner case williams,at.dunlap petition falls under the unreasonable application prong of d.in order for us to grant relief under this provision,the decision of the wisconsin supreme court must be simply erroneous and incorrect.williams,at.on appeal from the district court denial of a writ of habeas corpus,we review findings of fact for clear error and legal conclusions de novo.rittenhouse battles,cir.
the sixth amendment to the united states constitution guarantees the right of an accused in a criminal prosecution to be confronted by the witnesses against him.the purpose of the confrontation clause is to secure for the opponent the opportunity of.davis alaska,d.nevertheless,trial judges retain wide latitude insofar as the confrontation clause is concerned to impose reasonable limits on based on concerns about,among other things,harassment,prejudice,confusion of the issues,the witness safety,or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.delaware van arsdall,d.
in this case,the parties agree that the governing supreme court precedent is found in chambers mississippi,d,and davis alaska,d while the wisconsin supreme court did not specifically mention these cases in its dunlap decision,the case the court relied on,state pulizzano,rests on chambers and davis and recognizes clearly that consistent with chambers and davis in some cases a defendant confrontation and compulsory process rights might require that evidence of a complainant prior sexual conduct be admitted,notwithstanding the fact that the evidence would otherwise be excluded by the rape shield law.pulizzano,at.the wisconsin supreme court was looking at the right question.the issue before us is whether it was unreasonable in light of chambers and davis to conclude that dunlap rights were not violated.
both chambers and davis are decisions.chambers was accused of murder arising out of an incident in woodville,mississippi.one saturday evening in,two woodville forman and aaron sonny a local bar and pool hall to execute a warrant for the arrest of a man named jackson.jackson resisted and a hostile crowd of some people gathered.when the officers attempted to handcuff jackson,a number of men intervened and wrestled him free.forman radioed for help and liberty took a,shotgun from the officers squad car.ultimately,five or six pistol shots were fired,and liberty was hit several times in the back.before he died,liberty fired his gun into an alley in the direction from which the shots toward him were fired.as the crowd in the alley scattered,liberty deliberately fired a second shot,which hit chambers.officer forman could not see which of the men shot liberty.another officer testified that he saw chambers do the deed.yet another officer said he could not see whether chambers had a gun,but he saw chambers break his arm down shortly before shots rang out.liberty was taken to a hospital,where he was dead on arrival.
another man named gable mcdonald may have been in the crowd that evening.sometime after the shooting,he gave a sworn confession to chambers attorneys saying that he was the one who shot officer liberty.he also said that he had previously told a friend that he did the shooting.a month later,at chambers preliminary hearing,mcdonald repudiated his confession and said he was not even present at the shooting but was down the street drinking beer with a friend.
when chambers went to trial,one of his defenses was that mcdonald,not he,was the shooter.he called mcdonald as a witness in an attempt to place his confession before the jury.this effort was thwarted by a mississippi rule of evidence,which held that a party may not impeach his own
