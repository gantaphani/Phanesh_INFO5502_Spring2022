petitioner walkins contreras,a new york state state prisoner convicted of,inter alia,rape in the first degree,unlawful imprisonment in the first degree,and burglary in the first degree,appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york,jed rakoff,judge,dismissing his petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to u.the petition alleged principally that the trial court denied contreras his due process right to be present during critical stages of his trial when it held a closed hearing in his absence to consider the disclosability and admissibility of a note written by the complaining witness and found at the crime scene,and his sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel when it barred his trial attorney from disclosing to him the note and the substance of the hearing until after the trial ended.the district court,applying the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,dismissed the petition on the ground that the new york court of appeals rejection of these claims was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of precedents of the united states supreme court.on appeal,contreras contends principally that the new york court of appeals decision was an unreasonable application of the supreme court decisions in a geders united states,d limitations on communications between the accused and his attorney,and perry leeke,d same,and b kentucky stincer,d the accused right to be present at critical stages of trial,united states gagnon,d same,and snyder massachusetts.same.we affirm.
background 
contreras convictions resulted from his violent conduct on february,against his estranged wife in her apartment,where they previously lived together.contreras apparent motive was his anger that his wife referred to herein as had filed for divorce and begun a romantic relationship with another man.there is no dispute as to what evidence was given and what proceedings were held at contreras trial.
at trial,testified that on the morning of february,contreras arrived at her apartment,confronted her as she was about to leave with her year old son james,and forced them back into the apartment.contreras brandished a knife,claimed he had a gun,and told that he had come to kill her.once inside,contreras and struggled in the living room,causing her to drop her purse,scattering its contents.one of the items that fell out was a cellular telephone when contreras allowed to clean up the mess,she was able to conceal the phone and hide it in the bathroom.contreras ordered james to his bedroom and to hers.contreras followed and forced her,at knifepoint,to have sex.
contreras then left the bedroom but returned in time to interrupt attempt to use her bedroom phone to call.contreras proceeded to,inter alia,choke with a cord,question her about her new boyfriend,question james about the boyfriend,force y.to have sex again,and force her to write farewell letters to her mother and james.eventually,was able to flee to the bathroom with james and lock the door she used the cell phone to call.the police arrived to find in the bathroom and contreras hiding in a closet.
contreras principal strategy at trial was to attack credibility,arguing that had consented to sex and then fabricated accusations against him after she changed her mind.defense counsel also argued that contreras was not guilty of burglary because he had a right to be in the marital home.
a.the note found in the apartment 
the police collected various items of possible evidence from apartment,including a notepad containing a note in handwriting the note.the trial court would later describe the note for the record as follows 
the pad seems to have four bullet points on it.the first one says,i want you to open yourself more to me.the second one acknowledge me in bed.when you are sleeping,parenthesis even though you are getting better,end parenthesis.third one is take me and fuck the shit out of me.and the fourth one is get tested for.
trial transcript tr.at.
following proceedings that are the subject of this habeas petition,the note was excluded from evidence at contreras trial.the nature of the note was not disclosed to defense counsel until after the trial had begun and was not disclosed to contreras until well after the trial had ended.
b.the proceedings with respect to the note 
on the morning of jury selection,the state applied in open court for a protective order ruling that some person al papers of the complainant by which it meant the note were inadmissible in evidence and need not be disclosed to the defense.tr.contreras trial attorney,barry apfelbaum,asked for an opportunity to see the note and oppose the state motion.see id.at.the court read the note and decided to hold an in camera hearing,with a sealed record,to consider the state application the admissibility hearing.at the commencement of the admissibility hearing,which was initially ex parte,the court stated that it would consider whether the note should be disclosed to the defense either under new york law as a witness prior statement relating to the subject matter of the witness testimony,see people rosario,rosario,or under the federal constitution as material evidence favorable to the defendant,see brady maryland,d.see tr.
the state represented that the note was a personal letter that wrote to her boyfriend at the time of the incident.id.at.it argued that because the note was very much a private person al letter relating to something sic totally different than the defendant id.at,and because t he defendant has not made any allegations of knowledge of the note id.at,i t does have anything to do with the instant case id.at.thus,the state contended that the note was inadmissible at trial pursuant to new york rape shield law,which excludes certain evidence of a victim sexual conduct in sex offense cases,criminal procedure law mckinney see tr,and that the note should not be disclosed to the defense because its disclosure would both embarrass the victim and permit contreras to fabricate further the defense of consent id.at.
after hearing this ex parte presentation,the court informed both sides that it would reserve decision on the state application until it could hear testimony from the next morning,in camera.see tr.although apfelbaum objected to the delay,the court stated that it wanted to corroborate that the people have not been lied to by id.at.
on the following day,the court began by questioning under oath in a closed hearing attended by the state,but from which contreras and his counsel were excluded.testified that she had written the note for her self at least a month before february,and that the note was about a new romantic partner,not contreras.tr.she testified that the notepad had been in her purse when,during her february struggle with contreras,the purse contents scattered onto the floor.see id.she stated that she did not know whether contreras had seen the note.see id.
the court called contreras attorney into the hearing room before making its ruling and stated that,
i n the interest of disclosure and in the interest of moving this trial along,i am going to disclose to apfelbaum the contents of the term sic but i am going to place him under the order of court not to disclose that to his client or to any other person without prior order of the court.
tr.emphases added.the court then ruled that 
this was a pad that was kept by in her pocketbook and related to notes that she apparently makes before writing longer letters or collecting her thoughts with respect to her boyfriend,who is not the defendant.
because it does not relate to this event and is in the nature of those things covered by the rape shield law,i am excluding it.
id.at emphasis added.
apfelbaum objected to the ruling,arguing first that the note could be relevant to refute the burglary charge by indicating that contreras had entered the apartment lawfully,see penal law mckinney to be guilty of burglary,the defendant must have,inter alia,knowingly enter ed or remain ed unlawfully in a dwelling with intent to commit a crime therein.see tr.counsel theorized that after contreras arrived in the apartment to make a peaceful visit,he might have learned something from the note about new relationship that set off his temper,leading him to commit the violent acts with which he had been charged see id.at counsel argued that the issue is what the effect of reading this may have had on the defendant while he was in the apartment id.at.the court responded,a ssuming he read it and when counsel acknowledged that there was no evidence that contreras had read the note,the court said,well,the answer is you ca give it to him so he will create the evidence.id.the court indicated,however,that contreras could seek reconsideration of the court ruling if the defense produced evidence consistent with counsel theory if in fact it turns out that absent your showing it to him he voluntarily says that among the things that got me totally annoyed was that i picked this up and i read it,i picked up something and read it,well,that another story.id.at.
apfelbaum also objected that the nondisclosure order interfered with his duties to his client,especially if he would need to decide whether to have contreras testify without his having disclosed to contreras the contents of the note and thus without knowing what contreras testimony would be.see tr.apfelbaum argued that he should at least be allowed to question,and the court agreed.see id.at.was recalled to the hearing room and reminded that she was still under oath see id.at,and she was then questioned by apfelbaum.
apfelbaum w e have been talking about what looks like a note pad with some notes on it on the top page.can i,i guess we have already established that this is your writing on the pad 
the witness yes.
the court she has said she has written it,she has answered she was sic written it,she has stated that it was written substantially before the date in question.that it was something that she was jotting down her notes with respect to a new relationship and that it was in her purse at the time of the incident.
and that she believes it fell out of her purse at the time everything fell out of the purse during the incident.
apfelbaum so,let me,is that basically true what the judge just said 
the witness yes.
apfelbaum proceeded to ask a number of questions about the note,the answers to which were generally consistent with earlier testimony.he was also allowed,over the state objection,to ask about the events of february.testified,inter alia,that w hen contreras pushed us back inside the apartment my bag fell on the floor tr.that contreras did not mention the pad or the contents of the pad id.at that contreras had her new boyfriend telephone numbers with him in his wallet and said something to her indicating that he was upset about her new relationship id.at that at some points during the incident and contreras were in separate rooms see id.and that never saw contreras reading the note see id.at.in addition,stated that the last item in the note,get tested for,was unfinished and had been intended to say get tested for hiv see id.at.she testified that the note concerned 
a new person that i was,you know,beginning to know when contreras could tell you that he was hiv tested also.
apfelbaum so,this was something you intended to communicate to another person 
the witness yes 
id.the court adhered to its rulings that the note was inadmissible and was not to be disclosed to contreras.
contreras was found guilty of most of the charges against him,including one count each of rape,burglary,attempted assault,and endangering the welfare of a child,and two counts of unlawful imprisonment.he was sentenced to years imprisonment.
contreras challenges to his conviction 
after contreras was sentenced,his appellate counsel received permission from the trial court to discuss the note and the substance of the admissibility hearing with contreras.contreras appealed his conviction,challenging the trial court rulings relating to the note.the appellate division disagreed with the trial court ruling that the note was inadmissible under new york rape shield law but affirmed contreras conviction on the ground that the note was irrelevant and hence need not have been disclosed to contreras.see people contreras,dep t contreras i.the court found that a ll of contreras theories of relevance are based on,speculative scenarios with no evidentiary support.id.
contreras was granted leave to appeal to the new york court of appeals,which affirmed in an opinion that rejected his arguments under state and federal law.see people contreras,contreras ii.the court of appeals stated that 
i t is important to understand at the outset the purpose of the proceedings about which defendant complains.it was to determine whether the notes were either rosario material,prior statements of the complainant relating to the subject of her testimony or brady material,evidence favorable to defendant.nothing in the record suggests that they were either.there is no reason to doubt that they were exactly what the complainant said they written at a different time on another subject.there is no evidence that defendant ever saw them,much less that they motivated his conduct.
id.at,at,emphasis added.the court held that i n light of the notes apparent irrelevance to the case,defendant did not have a right to any hearing on the rosario or brady issue.id.emphasis in original.
the court found that the trial court choice of procedures,allow ing defense counsel to know the contents of the document,to argue for the right to use it at trial and to question the complainant about it,so long as defendant himself was not told what the document said,was reasonable in light of the note irrelevance,its significant tendency to embarrass the complainant,and its potentially inflammatory nature.id.at,at.although acknowledging that ex parte proceedings are undesirable,and they should be rare,the court stated that where the issue to be decided is whether a document should or should not be disclosed to the defense,the initial consideration of the question must be ex parte,almost by its nature id.
the contreras ii court concluded that although a defendant is entitled to be personally present at all critical stages of his trial if his presence would contribute to the fairness of the procedure,that rule is inapplicable here,where the hearing was not only noncritical,but,as a matter of law,unnecessary,at.further,while stating that communication between attorney and client should generally be unrestricted,the court noted that there are occasions where restrictions may legitimately be applied,and it rejected contreras claim on the ground that disclosure by lawyer to client of an embarrassing and inflammatory document having nothing to do with the case is not a constitutionally protected communication,at emphasis added.
contreras then brought the present habeas corpus proceeding,pursuing his claims of denial of his rights to be present at the admissibility hearing and to effective assistance of counsel.a magistrate judge recommended that the habeas petition be denied on the ground that the new york court of appeals had not unreasonably applied either the supreme court rulings in geders and perry as to the permissibility of limiting communications between a defendant and his attorney during a criminal trial,or the supreme court rulings in stincer and snyder with respect to a defendant right to be present at critical stages of his criminal proceeding.see contreras artus,civ,wl,at,contreras iii.
the magistrate judge also observed that,despite the availability of remedies under new york law,see.proc.law,contreras has never indicated to the state courts that he,in fact,saw the note on the date of his arrest,much less that it led him to engage in any of the conduct giving rise to his conviction.contreras iii,wl,at.the district judge,adopting the magistrate judge reasoning in full,dismissed the petition and denied contreras request for a certificate of appealability.
contreras then moved for a certificate of appealability from this court coa motion,
seek ing permission from this court to raise both issues that h e raised in the district court the new york court of appeals unreasonably applied united states supreme court precedent by affirming the ban on communication between defense counsel and petitioner regarding the subject of a potentially relevant and mitigating note found in the complainant apartment after the crimes were allegedly committed there and petitioner was denied his right to be present,in violation of due process and confrontation,when he was excluded during an in camera examination of the complainant regarding the note in question,during which the complainant previewed substantive testimony about the incident.
coa motion at,emphasis added.the motion also argued that the unreasonableness of the state courts factual determination that the note was irrelevant was an independent basis for granting the writ.see d.coa motion at.we granted the certificate of appealability.
ii.discussion 
under aedpa,a federal court may not grant a state prisoner petition for habeas relief with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d emphases added.this is a difficult to meet and highly deferential standard for evaluating rulings,which demands that decisions be given the benefit of the doubt cullen pinholster,d quoting harrington richter,d other internal quotation marks omitted see,felkner jackson,d where,on a batson challenge,the trial court credited the prosecutor explanations,and the california court of appeal carefully reviewed the record at some length in upholding the trial court findings,t he state appellate court decision was plainly not unreasonable yarborough alvarado,d state court determination that a claim lacks merit precludes federal habeas relief so long as fairminded jurists could disagree on the correctness of the state court decision.in reviewing a district court decision on a state prisoner habeas petition,we review the district court legal rulings de novo,but we can not grant habeas relief where a petitioner claim pursuant to applicable federal law,or the constitution,has been adjudicated on its merits in state court proceedings in a manner that is not manifestly contrary to common sense.anderson miller,cir.
on this appeal,contreras principally contends that the district court erred in rejecting his arguments that the new york court of appeals unreasonably applied supreme court precedent as established in geders,d,and perry,d,with regard to sixth amendment constraints on prohibitions against communications between an accused and his attorney,and as established in stincer,d,gagnon,d,and snyder,with regard to an accused due process right to be present at critical stages of the proceedings.
contreras also contends,as an independent basis for granting the writ,that the state courts factual determination that the note was irrelevant was unreasonable.contreras brief on appeal at see also id.at the new york court of appeals finding of fact that the note was irrelevant is not merely unreasonable,but indefensible id.at,new york court of appeals rejections of contreras and claims were based on an unreasonable determination of the facts.given the significant deference owed to decisions under aedpa,we hold that contreras has not sustained his burden and that his petition must be denied.
a.the claimed unreasonable determination of the facts 
preliminarily,we note that the state argues that contreras present contention that he was entitled to have the writ granted on the ground that the state courts decisions as to relevance were based on an unreasonable determination of facts,see d,is not properly before us because it was not a contention presented to the district court.this argument has considerable merit although contreras cited d to the district court see petitioner memorandum of law in support of petition for a writ of habeas corpus at and took exception to the findings of the state courts for instance by maintaining that there was no indication either way whether contreras saw the note id.at we do not see that he presented an argument that any decision amounted to an unreasonable determination of the facts relating to the relevance of the note.rather,he argued that the new york court of appeals misapplied supreme court precedent e ven assuming arguendo that the note was not relevant id.at,and he asserted that the state emphasis on relevance is entirely misplaced petitioner reply memorandum of law in support of petition for a writ of habeas corpus at see also id.at the state court errors must be reviewed independently of the ultimate determination of relevancy.
in general,a federal appellate court does not consider an issue not passed upon below.baker dorfman,cir quoting singleton wulff,d.however,that rule is not jurisdictional but prudential,and we retain discretion to consider such an issue where consideration of the issue is necessary to avoid manifest injustice or where the issue is purely legal and there is no need for additional.baker dorfman,at internal quotation marks omitted see id.at choos ing to reach the merits of a pure question of law.in the present case,although contreras did not argue to the district court that his habeas petition should be granted on the ground that the state courts decisions as to relevance rested on an unreasonable determination of the facts,he did explicitly so argue in his coa motion to this court see coa motion at.as our order simply said the motion is granted,contreras artus,cir.july,contreras argument is technically within the scope of this appeal.in any event,the argument presents us with pure questions of law,which we address.
first,to the extent that contreras views relevance as a fact contreras brief on appeal at referring to the new york court of appeals finding of fact that the note was irrelevant see,id.at referring to the state courts factual determination that the note was irrelevant,his view is analytically flawed.evidence is relevant if it has any tendency in reason to prove the existence of any material fact,it makes determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.people giles,internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added see.evidence is relevant if it has any tendency to make a fact that is of consequence in determining the action more or less probable than it would be without the evidence.but relevance itself is not a fact 
relevancy is not an inherent characteristic of any item of evidence but exists only as a relation between an item of evidence and a matter properly provable in the case.does the item of evidence tend to prove the matter sought to be proved whether the relationship exists depends upon principles evolved by experience or science,applied logically to the situation at hand.
advisory committee note emphases added.
assessment of relevance thus involves an exercise of judgment,call ing for an answer to the question whether an item of evidence,when tested by the processes of legal reasoning,possesses sufficient probative value to justify receiving it in evidence.id.a trial court determination of whether such evidence is to be excluded on the ground of lack of relevance is therefore reviewed under the standard,rather than the standard of review for factual findings.see,united states gupta,cir the assessment of the relevance of evidence for the purpose of its admission or exclusion is committed to the sound discretion of the district court.contreras i,at,at the trial court properly exercised its discretion in precluding the use of the note on the ground of relevance.
second,to the extent that contreras instead argues that the state courts judgment as to relevance was based on unreasonable findings of historical fact,his arguments ignore experience,logic,principles of testimonial competency,and the trial court record.to begin with,we note that contreras does not argue that the note actually had relevance.his application to this court referred to the note as potentially relevant coa motion at emphasis added,and being of potential importance to the defense id.at,emphasis in original.contreras argument that he was not required to make any showing of actual relevance because he was excluded from the admissibility hearing and not allowed to be informed of the note or the substance of the hearing see contreras brief on appeal at simply disregards the deference to which state court decisions are entitled under aedpa.
contreras suggests two bases on which the note could have been deemed relevant if only he had been allowed to attend the admissibility hearing.he argues that the note could have been relevant even if he had not seen the note because its contents would have increas ed the likelihood that the sexual intercourse that day was consensual if the note described relationship with petitioner,rather than another man contreras brief on appeal at see id.at,if the note related to petitioner,rather than a new boyfriend and he argues that,other than,contreras was the only individual in a position to shed light on th at issue id.but the author of the note was only she was competent to say what was in her mind when she wrote the note and to whom she was referring.contreras has provided no foundation for his assertion that he was in a position to shed light on whether the note was about him,given the fundamental general rule of evidence that a witness must confine his testimony to matters within his personal knowledge,people mingey,see.a witness may testify to a matter only if evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter.rios selsky,dep t affirming denial of request to call certain witnesses since those witnesses had no personal knowledge of the incident and t heir testimony,therefore,would have been irrelevant.
contreras also suggests,as to the note potential relevance,that he could have testified that the note,with its lurid description of a sexual relationship,triggered his anger,increasing the possibility that the motive for the sexual assault arose after a lawful entry making petitioner not guilty of burglary had petitioner been advised of the note contents.contreras brief on appeal at emphasis added.but this suggestion has no basis in logic.to provide a foundation for such testimony by contreras as to his motivation,he would have had to know of the note prior to the assaults,not learn of its contents for the first time at trial.and it defies logic and experience to speculate that his attorney would not have asked him at the outset what happened,or that contreras,if he knew of and was motivated by the note,would not have so informed his attorney.
if contreras knew of the note prior to his violent conduct and became so inflamed by its contents that he was motivated to commit assault and rape,he was free to so testify even if he had no knowledge of the substance of the admissibility hearing.further,the ban on counsel making disclosures to contreras was plainly subject to reconsideration the order itself barred a disclosure without prior order of the court tr,and the trial court at the hearing clearly indicated to contreras attorney that if,without disclosure by counsel of the note or the substance of the hearing,contreras informed his attorney that he knew of the note,contreras could seek reconsideration of the court nondisclosure order and exclusion of the note from evidence see id.at.contreras apparently did not so inform his trial counsel,for no such motion for reconsideration was made.and indeed,as the district court here noted,contreras has never contended that he saw the note on february,even in posttrial proceedings that were available after his appellate counsel revealed the contents of the note to him.
given this record,we can not conclude that the new york court of appeals affirmance of the exclusion of the note for lack of relevance was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts.the court found that t here is no reason to doubt that the notes were exactly what the complainant said they were notes written at a different time on another subject,and that t here wa s no evidence that defendant ever saw them,much less that they motivated his conduct.contreras ii,at,at.although contreras argues that the state courts and the district court could not properly reach these conclusions because he was excluded from the admissibility hearing,he has provided no basis for impeaching the state courts factual findings.his contention that the state courts determinations as to relevance were based on unreasonable factual findings is meritless.
aedpa standards on application of supreme court precedents 
the aedpa requirement that a habeas petitioner show that the state court has contravened or unreasonably applied clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,d,means that the petitioner must show that the state decisions were contrary to or an unreasonable application of supreme court holdings,as opposed to dicta.williams taylor,d.to meet this standard,a state prisoner must show that the state court ruling on the claim being presented in federal court was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.harrington richter.at.
in determining whether a state court application of supreme court precedent was unreasonable,a habeas court must be guided by the level of specificity of the relevant precedent holding,because the range of reasonable judgment can depend in part on the nature of the relevant rule.yarborough alvarado,at.
if a legal rule is specific,the range may be narrow.applications of the rule may be plainly correct or incorrect.other rules are more general,and their meaning must emerge in application over the course of time.applying a general standard to a specific case can demand a substantial element of judgment.as a result,evaluating whether a rule application was unreasonable requires considering the rule specificity.
id.the more general the rule,the more leeway courts have in reaching outcomes in determinations.id.
in light of these principles,we conclude that contreras has not met his burden.
communications between defendant and counsel 
the sixth amendment right of an accused to effective assistance of counsel includes broad,but not unlimited,protection for consultation between the accused and his attorney.in geders,the supreme court considered an order,issued at the end of a trial day when the defendant was in the process of testifying,that prohibited the defendant from having any communications with his attorney during the overnight recess.see at.the supreme court held that this order,given its length and breadth,impermissibly interfered with the defendant right to effective assistance of counsel.stressing the normal occurrence of consultations between criminal defendants and their attorneys during overnight recesses to exchange information and adjust trial strategies,see id.at,the court held that the 
conflict between the defendant right to consult with his attorney during a long overnight recess in the trial,and the prosecutor desire to the defendant without the intervention of counsel,with the risk of improper coaching,must,under the sixth amendment,be resolved in favor of the right to the assistance and guidance of counsel,
id.at.the geders court holding was expressly limited to the facts of that case 
the challenged order prevented petitioner from consulting his attorney during a hour overnight recess,when an accused would normally confer with counsel.we need not reach,and we do not deal with,limitations imposed in other circumstances.we hold that an order preventing petitioner from consulting his counsel about anything during a hour overnight recess between his impinged upon his right to the assistance of counsel guaranteed by the sixth amendment.
id.emphases added.
in perry,the court considered an order barring any communication between a testifying defendant and his attorney during a minute recess the court ruled that that order did not vio
