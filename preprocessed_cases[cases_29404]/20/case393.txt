raheem dunlap,proceeding pro se,filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus,contending that unconstitutionally suggestive pretrial identification procedures were used to obtain his conviction in new york state supreme court.he appeals from the denial of his petition by the united states district court for the southern district of new york robinson.
in ruling on the petition,the district court concluded that the identification procedures at issue were unduly suggestive and that no independent source existed for the trial identifications by two witnesses who previously were shown photo arrays by the police.the district court concluded that the state court erred in failing to suppress the identification testimony but held that the failure to do so was harmless error because additional evidence was sufficient to support the conviction.
we conclude that the district court erred in failing to accord the deference required by d to the state court evaluation of the pretrial identification procedures.because we conclude that the state court resolution of this issue was not reached in contravention of,or pursuant to an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,we affirm the judgment but on an alternate ground from that on which the district court relied.
background 
on august,in mount vernon,new york,a masked passenger in a taxicab driven by rafael bridge attempted to rob bridge at gunpoint and repeatedly assaulted him.both bridge and joan grant,the only other passenger in the cab,had noticed the perpetrator on that clear and sunny day,when the perpetrator,then unmasked,was standing on a corner nearby.bridge had seen the man walk up to the cab,lean his face down to the open front window to ask for a ride,and walk around the front of the cab to enter the taxi from the rear driver side.bridge had another opportunity to observe the perpetrator,still unmasked,when the perpetrator paid his fare and received his change from bridge.grant had observed the unmasked man seating himself next to her in the back of the cab,in the course of exchanging hellos,and again when the man pulled out a mask and gun.the assault the masked man committed caused bridge to lose consciousness,after which the cab collided with a light pole.locksey manning,who was standing outside his home at the time of the collision,saw an unmasked man climb out of the cab through the broken windshield and leave the scene.
both bridge and grant were injured in the collision and hospitalized for treatment.police visited them in the hospital on the day of the collision and asked each of them,independently,for a description of the perpetrator and to attempt to identify the assailant from an array of six photographs that included a photograph of raheem dunlap.bridge described the perpetrator to the police as a man who was approximately five feet,nine inches tall and had a slim build.bridge also described the perpetrator clothing.bridge selected a photograph of a man who was not dunlap but indicated that he was not certain of his identification.he also informed the police that he could not see the photographs clearly because his vision was blurred as a result of the injuries he had sustained.bridge,who was hospitalized for three days,suffered an orbital fracture near his right eye,which was swollen shut at the time he viewed the photo array.
on that same day,grant,who was bleeding,crying,and hysterical when being questioned by police in the hospital,did not provide a description but identified a photograph of dunlap from a photo array that was a duplicate of that shown to bridge.she,too,indicated that she was not certain,and she asked to see another photograph.
on august,after bridge was released from the hospital and four days after bridge had viewed the first photo array,police showed bridge a second photo array that included a different photograph of dunlap than the one included in the first array.the new photograph appeared in a different position in the array than the one occupied by dunlap photograph in the first array.other than raheem dunlap,none of the other persons portrayed,including the person that bridge had originally identified tentatively as the perpetrator,was portrayed in the second photo array.this time,bridge identified dunlap photograph as that of the perpetrator.
after her release from the hospital,grant provided police a description of the assailant,stating that he was a young man with a light complexion.on september,thirteen days after grant viewed the first photo array,police presented grant with a second photo array that included a photograph of dunlap that was not the same photograph used in the first array grant had seen,and that was placed in a different position than dunlap photograph had occupied in the first array.from the second array,grant identified dunlap,who was the only person who also had been pictured in the first array.
on october,dunlap was charged with assault in the first degree two counts,attempted robbery in the second degree two counts,criminal use of a firearm in the first degree,assault in the second degree two counts,and reckless endangerment in the first degree.pretrial hearings on dunlap motion to suppress identification testimony were held before the trial court on may and.the trial court denied the motion to suppress,holding that the pretrial identification procedures were not in any degree whatsoever suggestive and did not deny defendant any due process of law.people dunlap,slip op.at.may.the trial court found that the photographs used in each of the photo arrays were of young,black males with comparatively light skin complexion,id.at,and that t he photo participants were sufficiently similar in appearance to the defendant so that no characteristic would have influenced the viewer to choose the defendant.id.at.
at trial,bridge and grant identified dunlap as the perpetrator.locksey manning,when called as a defense witness,testified that he could not identify dunlap as the person whom he had observed emerge from the cab and leave the scene.however,one day after witnessing the collision,manning,upon being shown a array and being asked for his best guess as to the identity of the man whom he had seen climb out of the cab,had selected a photo of dunlap.his signature beneath this photo array was entered into evidence on.the trial concluded on may,and a jury found dunlap guilty on all counts.
on appeal,the conviction was affirmed by the appellate division,second department,which held that t wo separate showings of a suspect picture in successive photographic arrays are not per se impermissibly suggestive.people dunlap.the appellate division concluded that the potential for irreparable misidentification such as where a witness repeatedly views the same photograph of a defendant until a positive identification results did not exist,and that,u nder the totality of the circumstances surrounding the pretrial identification,the photographic arrays were not unduly suggestive.id.at.the new york court of appeals denied petitioner application for leave to appeal.people dunlap.
on july,dunlap filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus,contending that the identification procedures were unduly suggestive and violated due process.upon referral of the petition,magistrate judge george yanthis issued a report and recommendation concluding that the petition should be denied.the report and recommendation rejected the state court conclusion that the pretrial identification procedures were not unduly suggestive,but it concluded,notwithstanding the deficiencies it found to exist in the identification procedures,that bridge identification was independently reliable.grant identification of dunlap was found not to be independently reliable,but the report and recommendation concluded that the error was harmless due to the strength of the other evidence against dunlap.
both sides filed objections to judge yanthis report and recommendation.the district court adopted the report and recommendation in large part but concluded that bridge identification was not independently reliable.dunlap burge,civ,slip op.at.the court found the errors in admitting bridge an
