john laxton was involuntarily committed to a secure mental health facility after a jury found that he was a sexually violent person as defined in the wisconsin sexually violent person commitment statute.stat.laxton appealed to the wisconsin court of appeals and the wisconsin supreme court,both of which affirmed his commitment.he then petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the eastern district of wisconsin,arguing that the commitment violated his substantive due process rights.the district court denied the writ,and laxton appeals.we conclude that the wisconsin supreme court adjudication of laxton due process claim was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law and therefore affirm the district court denial of the writ.
background 
on october,laxton was arrested while peeping into the window of a room occupied by two young girls.laxton had a long history of sexual misconduct.at the time,petitioner was on parole after serving part of an sentence for abducting and sexually assaulting two girls.as a result of the incident,laxton parole was revoked,and he was convicted of disorderly conduct.shortly before his release from prison,on september,the state filed a petition seeking to commit laxton as a sexually violent person under.stat.the statute defines a sexually violent person as 
a person who has been convicted of a sexually violent offense,has been adjudicated delinquent for a sexually violent offense,or has been found not guilty of or not responsible for a sexually violent offense by reason of insanity or mental disease,defect,or illness,and who is dangerous because he or she suffers from a mental disorder that makes it substantially probable that the person will engage in acts of sexual violence.
wisconsin affords persons who are the subject of a commitment petition the right to a trial as well as all constitutional rights available to a defendant in a criminal proceeding.see.stat.at petitioner commitment trial,the state presented evidence of laxton long history of sexual misconduct.this evidence showed that laxton began window peeping and exposing himself at the age of twelve.in,he was convicted of exposing his penis to a girl whom he stopped to ask for directions.in,he was convicted of sexually assaulting two girls whom he encountered delivering newspapers in separate incidents on the same morning.he approached the first girl and grabbed her in the crotch area and demanded oral sex before the girl managed to escape.thirty minutes later,he encountered and attacked another girl.he dragged the girl behind bushes where he forcibly performed oral sex on her and placed his penis in her mouth until he ejaculated.
while serving his sentences for these offenses,laxton was terminated from two sexual offender treatment programs for failing to make progress.less than five months after his release on parole,petitioner was arrested for the incident that triggered the state commitment petition.ironically,at the time of the october,incident,laxton was undergoing sexual offender treatment and was reportedly doing well.laxton parole agent testified that,according to petitioner,window peeping was a red flag for him,meaning it could lead to a new,more serious,offense.petitioner also admitted at trial that he had committed several other acts of window peeping the same week before being caught.
several experts testified at the trial.timothy mcguire,a staff psychologist for the wisconsin department of corrections,testified for the state and diagnosed laxton with pedophilia,voyeurism,and paraphilia.he explained that pedophilia is characterized by recurrent,intense sexually arousing fantasies,sexual urges,or behaviors involving sexual activities with prepubescent children.voyeurism,mcguire explained,is essentially window peeping for sexual gratification.paraphilia,according to mcguire,refers to a variety of sexually deviant behaviors in laxton case,it primarily referred to his exhibitionism,or instances in which laxton exposed himself for sexual arousal.mcguire testified that these conditions predisposed laxton to engage in acts of sexual violence and that his repeated sexual offenses clearly show an inability to refrain from acting on the sexual urges when they do occur.tr.vol.at.
the state also called psychologist sheila fields,who diagnosed laxton with paraphilia and exhibitionism,and also noted his cannabis abuse.she explained how laxton behavior progressed from voyeurism to exhibitionism to forcing sexual activity 
with the voyeurism he feels a strong urge.he ca stop the urge to want to look in people windows,to watch people who do not know they being watched.he then becomes sexually excited,and he moves on to exposing his penis,his genitals.once sexually excited,at least three times in his life that we know of,he moved on to having sexual activity with someone who did not want to.that i believe is not necessarily something that he wanted to do.
tr.vol.at.fields concluded that laxton is predisposed to sexually violent behavior and has difficulty controlling his sexual urges.
psychologist michael kotkin testified as an expert for the defense.kotkin diagnosed laxton with exhibitionism and voyeurism,and again noted his marijuana abuse.he did not,however,find sufficient evidence to support a diagnosis of either paraphilia or pedophilia.although he opined that laxton did not show a pattern of violent sexual behavior,kotkin acknowledged that laxton two sexual assaults in could be a compelling predictor of future violent sexual offenses.
finally,laxton testified on his own behalf.he did not dispute the details of his prior sex offenses but testified that he would not commit another violent sexual act in the future.
tracking the language of the statute,the court instructed the jury that the state had to prove three elements beyond a reasonable doubt before it could find laxton a sexually violent person.first,the state was required to establish that laxton had been convicted of a sexually violent offense.this element was not disputed.second,the state had to prove that laxton has a mental disorder,defined as a congenital or acquired condition affecting the emotional or volitional capacity that predisposes the person to engage in acts of sexual violence.tr.vol.at.the court further explained 
acts of sexual violence means acts which constitute sexually violent offenses.acts of window peeping or exposure of the penis,absent any other behavior toward another person,do not alone constitute sexually violent offenses under chapter.
not all persons who commit sexually violent crimes can be diagnosed as suffering from mental disorders,nor are all persons with a mental disorder predisposed to commit sexually violent offenses.
id.at.third,the state was obligated to prove that laxton is dangerous to others because he has a mental disorder which creates a substantial probability that he will engage in acts of sexual violence.id.the court further explained that substantial probability means much more likely than not.id.neither party objected to these jury instructions.after four days of trial,the jury returned a verdict finding that laxton was a sexually violent person.
laxton appealed from the judgment and order of commitment,arguing that the jury instruction defining sexually violent offenses was inappropriate.the wisconsin court of appeals summarily affirmed the commitment,noting that laxton had not preserved his objection to the jury instruction at trial.petitioner then sought review in the wisconsin supreme court,arguing that his commitment violated the substantive due process guarantees in the united states and wisconsin constitutions because the statute did not require the jury to determine specifically that he had a mental disorder that involves serious difficulty in controlling his behavior.in re commitment of laxton.
the wisconsin supreme court granted laxton petition for review,instructing both parties to address whether laxton due process rights were violated because there was no jury determination regarding his level of volitional control.id.at.following briefing and argument,the wisconsin
