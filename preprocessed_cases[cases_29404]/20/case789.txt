opinion of the court 
charles brown appeals from the order of the district court dismissing his petition for a writ of habeas corpus as under the applicable statute of limitation.the appeal requires us to consider under what circumstances an attorney withdrawal of representation after failing to file a federal habeas petition warrants equitable tolling of the statutory limitation period.at issue is whether brown is entitled to statutory or equitable tolling of the limitation period for the following three time periods april,to july,august,to may,and may,to january.his petition would be timely,only if the limitation period were tolled for all three periods.we conclude that brown is not entitled to equitable tolling for the period from april,to july,the period of his attorney putative abandonment of his claim.without that period of tolling,his petition would be untimely even if the entire period from august,to january,were tolled.accordingly,we will affirm.
a jury in the court of common pleas of philadelphia county,pennsylvania,convicted brown of murder,robbery,criminal conspiracy,and possession of an instrument of crime.the trial court sentenced him to a term of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole and concurrent lesser terms of imprisonment.the pennsylvania superior court affirmed.see commonwealth brown.in january,the pennsylvania supreme court denied brown petition for allowance of appeal.see commonwealth brown,alloc.dkt.he did not petition the united states supreme court for a writ of certiorari.he subsequently filed a pro se petition for relief under the post conviction hearing act.et.see commonwealth brown,table affirming dismissal of petition but vacating sentence imposed for the possession of an instrument of crime commonwealth brown,table denying petition for allowance of appeal.
on december,brown filed a second pro se petition for state post conviction relief,this one under the newly enacted post conviction relief act pcra.et he privately retained attorney daniel silverman to represent him.the pcra court denied this second petition on march,and informed brown of his right to file an appeal to the pennsylvania superior court within days.brown asked silverman to file an appeal.by letter dated april,silverman advised him to not pursue an appeal in state court and to pursue federal habeas relief instead.no notice of appeal was filed.
on july,silverman informed brown that he was withdrawing his representation.on august,brown submitted to the trial court a pro se notice of appeal nunc pro tunc,asserting that silverman had failed to timely inform him that he silverman would not file an appeal from the denial of the second pcra petition.the trial court received the notice of appeal nunc pro tunc but mishandled and apparently lost it at all events the notice was never docketed or filed on may,after a number of inquiries from brown,the trial court pcra unit issued a memorandum informing brown that it had no record of his notice of appeal nunc pro tunc and advising him that,if he wished to continue with his request for permission to appeal nunc pro tunc,he should file a pro se pcra petition.
on may,brown filed a pro se pcra petition his third requesting permission to file an appeal nunc pro tunc from the denial of the second pcra petition the pcra court dismissed the petition as untimely filed.the pennsylvania superior court affirmed.see commonwealth brown,table.on january,the pennsylvania supreme court denied brown petition for allowance of appeal.see commonwealth brown,table.he did not petition the united states supreme court for a writ of certiorari.
on march,brown filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.the magistrate judge to whom the petition was referred determined that it was untimely filed and that equitable tolling of the limitation period was not warranted.the district court adopted the magistrate judge findings,dismissed the petition as,and declined to issue a certificate of appealability.brown timely appealed.on march,a motions panel of this court issued a certificate of appealability on the following issues 
whether brown notice of appeal nunc pro tunc,submitted but never ruled on because it was lost as a result of mishandling by the trial court,may be considered properly filed for purposes of d,see swartz meyers,cir,and,if the notice may be considered properly filed,when it ceased to be pending and

the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to and.our review of a decision dismissing a habeas petition as is plenary.see johnson hendricks,cir.
section d of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa provides,in relevant part 
a period of limitation shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court.the limitation period shall run from the latest of 
a the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review 
the time during which a properly filed application for state or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation under this subsection.
brown conviction became final before the aedpa came into effect on april.his period for filing a habeas petition thus began running on that date.see burns morton,cir.it is not disputed that the limitation period ran without interruption from april,to,but not including,december,when the second pcra petition was filed,a period of eight months.it is also not disputed that the second pcra petition was pending and tolled the limitation period pursuant to d from december,to april,the last day for timely filing an appeal from the denial of the petition.thus,on april,brown had four months left in which to file a habeas petition.he did not file his petition until march.
brown makes several contentions for statutory tolling pursuant to d and equitable tolling of the limitation period.his contentions essentially concern three time periods april,the day the second pcra petition ceased to be pending to july,the day silverman withdrew representation august,the day the notice of appeal nunc pro tunc was submitted to the trial court to may,the day the trial court informed brown it had no record of the notice of appeal nunc pro tunc and may,the day after the trial court informed brown it had no record of the notice of appeal nunc pro tunc to january,the day the pennsylvania supreme court denied brown petition for allowance of appeal from the denial of the third pcra petition.if the limitation period were tolled for those three periods,his habeas petition would be timely.we turn first to brown contention that the limitation period should be equitably tolled from april,to july.he asserts that he is entitled to equitable tolling for that period because attorney silverman ineffectively failed to file an appeal from the denial of the second pcra petition and then later abandoned him without filing a federal habeas petition.
after the second pcra petition was denied,brown asked silverman to file an appeal.silverman responded by letter dated april.he wrote 
it is my strong recommendation that you not pursue an appeal before the pennsylvania superior court.i believe that paying me money to pursue that appeal would be a sic inefficient use of your resources.with the record before it as it now stands,the superior court would almost certainly affirm judge sabo decision.it is my recommendation that you pursue your remedies in federal district court via a writ for petition of habeas corpus sic consequently,i will not file a notice of appeal to the superior court,although you are certainly permitted to do so.
at emphases removed.according to brown,he received this letter on april.it appears that he then
