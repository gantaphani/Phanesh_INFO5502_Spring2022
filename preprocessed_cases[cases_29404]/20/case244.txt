this convoluted habeas case presents a tangled scenario that gives rise to difficult questions of justiciability and constitutional law.the case has taken innumerable twists and turns.it began when the petitioner pleaded guilty to a charged crime,started serving a sentence,and then was charged with a second,more serious potentially incompatible with the first.he responded by moving to vacate his original conviction.the state court granted his motion.
on reflection,the petitioner moved to reinstate that conviction and attempted instead to raise a double jeopardy defense to the second charge.the state courts trial and appellate rebuffed these initiatives,and the petitioner repaired to the federal courts.the district court denied the petitioner application for a writ of habeas corpus,ruling that the vacation of the first conviction thwarted any claim of double jeopardy.
if that were not complicated enough,the petitioner then struck out in a new direction.during the pendency of the federal habeas proceeding,he pleaded guilty to the second charge in exchange for a reduced sentence.after learning what had transpired,the district court rescinded its earlier ruling and dismissed the habeas petition as moot.
the petitioner assails both of the district court orders.we agree with the petitioner that,in the peculiar circumstances of this case,his guilty plea to the second charge did not render the habeas proceeding moot.nevertheless,we affirm the denial of habeas relief.adhering to the strictures of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,stat,we conclude that the state courts neither acted contrary to,nor unreasonably applied,supreme court precedent when they refused to honor the petitioner claim of double jeopardy.
background 
during the afternoon of march,an armed intruder entered a doctor office in jamaica plain and departed with,among other things,a checkbook.later that day,police in cambridge arrested arthur jackson while he was attempting to cash one of the purloined checks.the locales are significant because prosecutorial responsibility in massachusetts operates on a basis.see.laws ch.jamaica plain where the robbery took place is in suffolk county but cambridge where the attempted occurred is in middlesex county.
when the middlesex county district attorney charged the petitioner with receiving stolen property the purloined checks,he entered a guilty plea to that charge in cambridge district court.the court imposed a sentence one year to serve and the balance suspended.the petitioner began serving his sentence on april.
one day later,the suffolk county district attorney swore out a criminal complaint charging the petitioner with armed robbery in connection with the march heist.the petitioner first learned of this charge five months into his incarcerative term when an outstanding arrest warrant which had never been served rendered him ineligible to participate in a program.fearing that his guilty plea to receiving stolen property would be used against him at a trial for armed robbery,the petitioner filed a pro se motion on november.the motion sought to withdraw the earlier plea,annul the petitioner conviction,and set the stage for a new trial on the original charge the gist of the petitioner argument was that the presiding judge in the cambridge district court had conducted an insufficient colloquy and,therefore,had erred in accepting his guilty plea.see,commonwealth lopez,discussing the constitutional requirements for acceptance of a guilty plea see also.c establishing certain procedural prerequisites for same.
on december,the petitioner was summonsed to the west roxbury district court for arraignment on the suffolk county complaint.one week later,a suffolk county grand jury indicted him for armed robbery.the new indictment included an allegation that the petitioner was a habitual offender.if proven,this allegation would require a sentence of life imprisonment.see.laws ch,id.ch.
on december,the petitioner completed serving the incarcerative portion of his sentence for receiving stolen property.his freedom was.when he appeared the next week at suffolk superior court for a pretrial hearing on the armed robbery charge,he was detained.his detention lasted from that date january,until his eventual release,under circumstances that we shortly shall explain,on july.
on january,the petitioner appeared pro se in the cambridge district court for a hearing on his previously filed motion to vacate his conviction for receiving stolen property at the request of court personnel,an itinerant attorney consulted with the petitioner and informed the presiding judge that the petitioner really need ed to be represented by counsel in this case.the lawyer urged the court to withhold any action until the petitioner counsel in the armed robbery case could appear.speaking for himself,the petitioner pressed for vacation of the receiving stolen property conviction,emphasizing that he had not been given proper warnings in advance of his guilty plea.the court announced its intention to listen to a tape recording of the plea proceeding and continued the hearing until january so the petitioner attorney could attend.
for reasons that remain obscure,neither the petitioner nor his counsel in the armed robbery case appeared at the january hearing.the court,however,had reviewed the tape of the plea proceeding and found the colloquy inadequate.stating that i am the one who erred,and i am correcting the error now,the presiding judge vacated the petitioner conviction for receiving stolen property.the district attorney office eventually declined to reprosecute the receiving stolen property charge.
the armed robbery case remained velivolant and,after several months had passed,the petitioner began to have second thoughts about his strategy.on november,he filed a counseled motion in the cambridge district court requesting the reinstatement of his prior conviction.at around the same time,he filed a counseled motion in the suffolk superior court seeking dismissal of the armed robbery charge on double jeopardy grounds.both motions were denied.the petitioner then appealed the double jeopardy ruling to the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc.a single justice of the sjc,acting pursuant to.laws ch,ruled that the petitioner interlocutory appeal was immediately reviewable but nonetheless rejected the appeal on the merits.on october,the full court affirmed that decision.see jackson commonwealth.
while still awaiting trial in the armed robbery case,the petitioner filed a federal habeas petition.the federal district court held a hearing on march,and took the matter under advisement.on july,the petitioner and suffolk county prosecutors reached an accord anent the armed robbery charge in exchange for the petitioner guilty plea,the commonwealth agreed to abandon the habitual offender allegation and recommend a sentence.the suffolk superior court accepted the plea,imposed the agreed sentence,and released the petitioner on a term of supervised probation.the federal district court later stated that it was not notified of these developments when they occurred 
on july,the federal district court,still unaware of the recent plea,denied the petition for habeas relief on the merits.see jackson coalter,wl,at.july.approximately two weeks later,the commonwealth moved to reconsider the order.in that motion,the attorney general informed the court of the plea bargain in the armed robbery case and argued that the consummation of that bargain rendered the habeas petition moot.the district court agreed in successive orders,it first vacated its earlier merits decision and then dismissed the habeas petition as moot.
the petitioner seasonably appealed both the order of dismissal on the merits and the subsequent order declaring the controversy moot.the appeal is properly before us,as the district court has granted a broadly worded certificate of appealability.see c.
ii.analysis 
to prevail in this appeal,the petitioner must overcome two adverse rulings.common sense suggests that we address these rulings in reverse chronological order.
we afford plenary review to the district court determination that the petitioner guilty plea to the armed robbery charge rendered his habeas petition moot.see simpson matesanz,cir see also scarpa dubois,cir.initially,however,we deal with a pair of preliminary matters.
first,we note that even though the guilty plea to the armed robbery charge ended the petitioner incarceration,he remains under supervised probation.thus,he is still sufficiently in custody to pursue federal habeas relief.see lefkowitz fair,cir collecting cases see generally jones cunningham,d holding that the in custody requirement for habeas relief necessitates only restraints on a man liberty,restraints not shared by the public generally.
second,the petitioner filed his habeas application under.the district court perspicaciously observed that the petitioner was still awaiting trial on the armed robbery charge when he sought habeas relief that his status was,therefore,that of a pretrial detainee and that this circumstance called into question the appropriateness of the jurisdictional allegation.see jackson coalter,wl,at see also a indicating that section relief is available only to a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court.the district court nonetheless proceeded to adjudicate the matter on the basis that,under c,a writ of habeas corpus is potentially available to any state prisoner in custody in violation of the constitution or laws of the united states.this problem does not concern us inasmuch as the petitioner has now pleaded guilty to the armed robbery charge,and his guilty plea subjected him to a state court judgment.
against this backdrop,we turn to the question of mootness.a habeas petition is moot if it fails to present a live case or controversy.see spencer kemna,d see generally lewis cont l bank,d explaining that the requirement subsists through all stages of federal judicial proceedings.the question before us is whether the petitioner guilty plea foreclosed his habeas claims and,thus,rendered his petition moot.
in arguing the affirmative of the proposition,the commonwealth chiefly relies upon the supreme court decision in united states broce,d.in broce,the defendants were charged with rigging two separate sets of bids for state highway contracts.id.at.they eventually pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy.id.at.after another court,trying a different group of defendants,had ruled that the rigged bids were part and parcel of a single conspiracy,the broce defendants mounted a collateral attack on their second conviction.id.at.the supreme court concluded that a plea of guilty and the ensuing conviction comprehend all of the factual and legal elements necessary to sustain a binding,final judgment of guilt and a lawful sentence.id.at.consequently,the defendants guilty pleas foreclosed any opportunity to revisit the factual predicate upon which their convictions rested.see id.at.when respondents pleaded guilty to two charges of conspiracy on the explicit premise of two agreements which started at different times and embraced separate objectives,they conceded guilt to two separate offenses.
the commonwealth says that broce stands for the rule that a defendant guilty plea pretermits any subsequent collateral attack aimed at negating the resulting conviction.that formulation,however,reaches beyond the holding in broce,which contemplated exception s to the rule barring collateral attack on a guilty plea.id.at.the exceptions include guilty pleas such as that discussed in menna new york,d per curiam,that is,pleas entered in response to charges which the state may not constitutionally prosecute.id.at.
menna is of considerable interest here.in that case,the defendant,having been granted immunity,refused to testify and was sentenced for contempt of court.id.at.after his release,the state indicted him for once again refusing to answer the same questions.id.he pleaded guilty to this criminal charge but then appealed his conviction on double jeopardy grounds.id.at.the state courts ruled that his guilty plea waived his right to assert a double jeopardy claim.id.at.the supreme court reversed,holding that a guilty plea does not forgive the unconstitutionality of an indictment.id.
the menna court emphasized that a guilty plea acts primarily to remove the issue of factual guilt from a case.id.at.in most instances,factual guilt is the only pertinent question and a guilty plea,therefore,simply renders irrelevant those constitutional violations not logically inconsistent with the valid establishment of factual guilt.id.a guilty plea,however,does not bar a defendant from contending that the state may not convict him no matter how validly his factual guilt is established.id.
the commonwealth suggests that broce trumps menna.we reject this suggestion.the guilty pleas in broce admitted factual elements that were logically inconsistent with the defendants subsequent allegations of a constitutional breach.see broce,at.in contrast,the defendant in menna disputed the very legitimacy of a second indictment his guilty plea admitted no factual predicate that sufficed to make irrelevant his double jeopardy claim.see menna,at.the decision in broce did not overrule menna,see broce,at.menna new york has no application to the case at bar,and the decision in menna remains good law.therefore,we must adhere to it.see united parcel,cir our marching orders are clear follow supreme court decisions until the supreme court overrules them.quoting united airlines,mesa airlines,cir.
the distinction between broce and menna is critically important in the case at hand.here,as in menna,the petitioner challenge implicates the legitimacy ab initio of the second indictment.he contends,in effect,that even assuming his factual guilt,the commonwealth could not constitutionally prosecute him on the armed robbery charge.menna teaches that w here the state is precluded by the united states constitution from haling a defendant into court on a charge,federal law requires that a conviction on that charge be set aside even if the conviction was entered pursuant to a counseled plea of guilty.menna,at.the petitioner thesis is that the commonwealth was so precluded here,and,thus,acted unconstitutionally when it brought the second indictment.this validity of which we shall test in the next section of this a live controversy.see id.at.noting that a plea of guilty to a charge does not waive a claim on its charge is one which the state may not constitutionally prosecute.consequently,the habeas case is not moot.see spencer,at.holding that a habeas petitioner satisfies the case or controversy requirement so long as he suffers from or is threatened by a concrete injury that is traceable to allegedly improper state action and redressable by the invalidation of that action.
b.the merits.
we divide our discussion of the merits into three segments corresponding to the petitioner three principal claims.
the double jeopardy claim.we review the sjc denial of the petitioner double jeopardy claim under the constraints of the aedpa.consequently,we may grant relief thereunder only if the state court adjudication either resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,d,or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding,id.d.
the relevant provision for purposes of this appeal is section d.in williams taylor,d,the supreme court fleshed out a petitioner obligations under that section and outlined the narrow circumstances in which federal habeas courts are permitted to disturb state convictions.the court interpreted contrary to to mean diametrically different or mutually opposed.id.at.therefore,a state court decision is contrary to established supreme court precedent if the state court manages to arrive at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or decides a case differently than the supreme court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.id.at.
as to the other facet of section d,the court said that an unreasonable application of supreme court case law occurs if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from th e court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.id.this type of scenario may emerge when a state court either unreasonably extends a legal principle to a new context where it should not apply or unreasonably refuses to extend that principle to a new context where it should apply.id.at.the court emphasized,however,that not every incorrect application of federal law amounts to an unreasonable application of federal law.id.at.the difference is one of degree.see mccambridge hall,cir en banc requiring an increment of incorrectness in the state court ruling that is great enough to make the decision unreasonable in the independent and objective judgment of the federal court.it follows,then,that a habeas petitioner must do more than merely identify an incorrect result.
we assess the petitioner challenge to the sjc double jeopardy ruling under this restrictive framework.the double jeopardy clause provides that no person shall be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.const.amend.v,cl.this proviso affords protection in three different types of situations 
it protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal.it protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction.and it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.
united states,cir quoting carolina pearce,d accord united states morris,cir united states stoller,cir.
building on the second of these three safeguards,the petitioner constructs the following hypothesis he pleaded guilty to receiving stolen property and that plea ripened into a conviction from and after the date of that conviction,double jeopardy protections precluded the commonwealth from indicting him for a mutually exclusive crime for that would constitute the same offense and the crimes of receiving stolen property and armed robbery,when involving the same objects,are mutually exclusive.hence,the double jeopardy clause forbade the commonwealth from initiating the armed robbery prosecution.
the first element on which the petitioner hypothesis rests is unassailable at least in these circumstances,a guilty plea is itself a conviction.see kercheval united states.the sjc assumed,without deciding,the validity of the third element.see jackson,at suggesting that massachusetts case law would deem the crimes of receiving stolen property and armed robbery of the same property to constitute a single offense since this is largely a question of massachusetts law,we too will assume arguendo that a defendant can not lawfully be convicted of both crimes.thus,our inquiry focuses on the second element of the petitioner hypothesis.
central to our analysis is a recognition that the petitioner and the sjc have configured the double jeopardy issue differently.the petitioner does not look beyond the fact of the original conviction for receiving stolen property,treating the vacation of that conviction as irrelevant to the double jeopardy analysis.in his view,the commonwealth was constitutionally barred from soliciting the armed robbery indictment after it obtained the original conviction for receiving stolen property it secured the armed robbery indictment while that conviction was still on the books and so,because the indictment was unconstitutional when contrived,the commonwealth should not have been permitted to pursue it.
the sjc used a lens.it examined the constitutionality of the second indictment in light of both the prior conviction and the subsequent vacation of that conviction.gauging the constitutionality of the armed robbery indictment from that perspective,there wa s no longer a final adjudication of guilt or innocence on the receiving stolen property charge.jackson,at.far from deeming the petitioner voluntary withdrawal of his guilty plea as irrelevant,the sjc thought it was c ritical to the disposition of his double jeopardy argument.id.in short,the petitioner and the sjc were arguing past each other,advocating parallel but materially different analyses.
given the unique facts of this case,that discrepancy is problematic for the petitioner.on habeas review,the aedpa requires us to focus our attention on the state court analysis.the petitioner obligation is not simply to offer a plausible argument for the unconstitutionality of his conviction,but,rather,to identify how the state court analytical path strayed beyond permissible bounds.see d.
in this instance,the sjc relied primarily on the decision in united states scott,d.there,the defendant sought and won dismissal of criminal charges.id.at.after the government had appealed,he attempted to invoke double jeopardy protections to forestall a subsequent trial.id.the supreme court rejected this tactic,holding that the government could appeal the dismissal without triggering double jeopardy concerns.id.at.the court pointed out that the defendant had opted to move for dismissal in the first place and stated that the double jeopardy clause does not relieve a defendant from the consequences of his voluntary choice.id.at.
the petitioner insists that scott is inapposite.he posits that its holding would apply only if he had moved to withdraw his guilty plea for receiving stolen property and then relied upon the double jeopardy clause in an effort to preclude the commonwealth from retrying him on that same charge.the petitioner sees this case as falling instead within a different precedential orbit.
one of the cases comprising that orbit is blackledge perry,d.there,while a convicted defendant appeal was pending,the government indicted him for a more serious yet mutually exclusive crime.id.at.even though the defendant pleaded guilty to this second charge,the supreme court later approved habeas relief because it found the second prosecution to be a vindictive response to the defendant exercise of his right to appeal,so that t he very initiation of the proceedings operated to deny the petitioner due process of law.id.at.the petitioner second supporting authority is menna.as noted above,menna prohibits a state from haling a defendant into court on a charge when double jeopardy applies.menna,at.the petitioner likens the armed robbery indictment to a constructive haling that the constitution prohibited the commonwealth from pursuing.
to be sure,all three of these cases offer plausible analogies to the case that confronts us.the fact remains,however,that none of them is sufficiently on point to dictate the result.scott differs materially from the instant case because there,unlike here,the defendant motion to vacate the original conviction was granted before the state sought a second allegedly incompatible indictment see scott,at.blackledge is distinguishable because there,unlike here,the state decision to pursue a second indictment had the effect of punishing the defendant for exercising his right to appeal.see blackledge,at.menna is distinguishable because there,unlike here,the second conviction occurred at a time when the first conviction remained intact.see menna,at.since there is no clearly established supreme court precedent directly on point,the sjc rejection of the petitioner double jeopardy claim does not transgress the contrary to prong of d.see williams,at.see also ouber guarino,cir where a relevant but not factually congruent precedent exists,the state court need only apply a test consistent with the one announced by the supreme court in order to avoid the toils of section d contrary to clause.
given the idiosyncratic nature of this case and the dearth of pertinent authority,we likewise conclude that the sjc reliance on scott,rather than blackledge or menna,is not an unreasonable application of supreme court case law.reasonableness depends on context.for the purposes of determining the reasonableness of a state court decision under section d,we have declared that if it is a close question whether the state decision is in error,then the state decision can not be an unreasonable application.mccambridge,at.this principle carries the day here.there is support in the supreme court case l
