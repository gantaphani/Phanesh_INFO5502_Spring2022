a michigan jury convicted petitioner bruce guilmette of home invasion.in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus,guilmette alleges that his trial attorneys provided constitutionally ineffective assistance.the district court found that this claim was not procedurally defaulted and that petitioner counsel were ineffective,and the district court therefore granted petitioner a conditional writ.because our precedents dictate that petitioner procedurally defaulted his ineffective assistance of counsel claim,and because petitioner has not established cause and prejudice for that default,habeas relief was not warranted in this case.
at approximately noon on january,joan mccormick was alone in her home in howell,michigan.a man walked past her window,approached her front door,and then repeatedly rang the doorbell.mccormick did not answer the door.the man went out past a van he had parked in mccormick driveway,and she lost sight of him for a few minutes.he then returned to the front door,and,after again repeatedly ringing the doorbell,began banging on the door.after what mccormick described as a lot of such banging,she saw her doorknob move,and then the locked door came crashing open.mccormick screamed and attempted to run away from the door.she tripped and fell,and when she then glanced back at the door,the man had disappeared from the doorway.from her window,mccormick saw the man circle the van from the passenger side to the driver side,enter the van,and drive away.mccormick identified the van as a gray chevy astro with a red pinstripe.
just after she fell,mccormick called and described both the man and his vehicle to the operator.trooper jennifer coulter responded to the call,and when she arrived at mccormick residence,coulter noticed footprints in the snow leading up to the front door.after interviewing mccormick,coulter photographed the best footprint she could find.later that day,mccormick independently photographed a footprint in the snow on the threshold of her doorway.mccormick identified the petitioner,bruce guilmette,out of two photographic lineups during the next few weeks.
guilmette was charged with home invasion.at the preliminary hearing on february,mccormick stated that guilmette resembled the man she had seen at her door but said that guilmette brother,who was present at the hearing,bore a similar resemblance.she also described the man at her door as having hair that protruded from underneath his hat,probably by one or two inches.
at guilmette trial for home invasion,mccormick testified to the events of january and stated that the man at her door look ed a lot like guilmette.she also testified that the man she identified in the the man at her house.a police officer testified that mccormick had identified a picture of guilmette vehicle,a gray astro with a red pinstripe,as the vehicle in which the man had driven away.the prosecution additionally introduced into evidence both trooper coulter photograph of the footprint leading up to the house and mccormick photograph of the footprint on the threshold of her home.
the defense maintained that guilmette had been mistakenly identified,relying primarily on three arguments.first,the defense presented evidence that the door on guilmette van was inoperable,such that guilmette could not have entered the van in the way that mccormick described.second,the defense offered testimony and photographic evidence that,at least as of christmas,guilmette had short hair.they argued that this contradicted mccormick testimony from the preliminary hearing that the man at her door had longer hair.finally,the defense offered a receipt from a methadone clinic that indicated that guilmette was at that clinic,which was approximately fifty miles from mccormick home,at on the day of the alleged home invasion.
in rebuttal,the state presented evidence that guilmette had previously pled guilty to a home invasion and larceny with a similar modus operandi and in connection with which guilmette had been driving a similarly described van.the court instructed the jury to consider this testimony only for identification or as evidence of a scheme and pattern.the prosecution also elicited testimony that the clock in the computer that generated the methadone clinic receipts was often inaccurate and that nineteen days after the incident,the clock was running eighteen minutes slow.the prosecution finally offered testimony of a detective who had driven from mccormick home to the methadone clinic in minutes,driving eighty to miles per hour on the freeway and despite a six minute delay for road construction.
the jury convicted guilmette of home invasion,and guilmette was unsuccessful in his direct appeal.on state collateral review,guilmette argued for the first time that his trial counsel were ineffective for failing to discover that the photographs of the two footprints admitted at trial apparently did not match.he argued that this constitutionally ineffective representation was prejudicial because the footprint from the door threshold was the only proof of entry,a required element of home invasion.see.comp.laws a.the state trial court on collateral review denied this claim on the merits,finding that focusing on than on whether there was a matter of trial strategy.both the michigan court of appeals and the michigan supreme court denied leave to appeal,issuing identical orders citing guilmette failure to meet the burden of establishing entitlement to relief under.d.
guilmette then filed a habeas petition seeking relief for the same alleged violation.the district court granted a conditional habeas writ,finding that guilmette trial counsel were constitutionally ineffective because they failed to investigate the differences between the two photographs.the warden now appeals,arguing that this ineffective assistance claim was procedurally defaulted and that guilmette has failed to establish cause and prejudice for that default.
guilmette ineffective assistance of counsel claim is procedurally defaulted because,although the state trial court on collateral review addressed the merits of guilmette claim,both the state appellate and supreme courts denied the claim pursuant to.d.when a habeas petitioner fails to obtain consideration of a claim by a state court due to a state procedural rule that prevents the state courts from reaching the merits of the petitioner claim,that claim is procedurally defaulted and may not be considered by the federal court on habeas review.willis smith,cir internal quotation marks omitted.guilmette did not raise his ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim on direct appeal,as required by.d.our decision in munson kapture,cir,requires the conclusion that the michigan courts enforced rule d in this case and thus that guilmette claim is procedurally defaulted.in munson,as in the present case,the petitioner did not raise certain claims on direct appeal.at.in both cases,the petitioner then raised the claims in a state trial court on collateral review,and the state trial court denied the claims on the merits id.at.then in both cases,the state appellate and state supreme courts each denied leave to appeal in brief orders,stating that the petitioner had failed to meet the burden of establishing entitlement to relief under mcr d.id.in munson,we held that rule d constituted an adequate and independent state ground and thus held the claims to be procedurally barred.id.at.no relevant fact distinguishes munson from the present case,and thus guilmette claim is similarly procedurally defaulted.
this result is consistent with abela martin,cir.in that case,both the michigan trial court and the michigan court of appeals denied the petitioner collateral claims on the merits before the michigan supreme court denied review pursuant to.d.id.at.in part because the lower state courts had repeatedly ruled on the merits,we concluded in abela that the invocation of.d by only the michigan supreme court did not sufficiently indicate that the court was invoking a procedural bar,and thus that the claim was not procedurally defaulted.id.at.in the present case,however,both the state appellate and state supreme court denied leave to appeal pursuant to rule d this case is thus squarely controlled by our decision in munson 
this conclusion is supported by five of this court other cases,three of which abela,and all of which hold that habeas claims were procedurally defaulted in situations materially indistinguishable from the present case.see alexander smith,app x cir spencer booker,app x cir mccray metrish,app x cir burroughs makowski,cir luberda trippett,cir.in each,the state trial court on collateral review denied the petitioner claims on the merits,and then both the state appellate and state supreme courts denied the claims pursuant to.d.see alexander,app x at spencer,app x at mccray,app x at burroughs,at luberda,at.we held that the petitioner claims were procedurally defaulted in each case.alexander,app x at spencer,app x at mccray,app x at burroughs,at luberda,at.the binding nature of these closer than abela to the instant case,and contained in published opinions issued both before abela burroughs and luberda and after abela munson is inescapable 
because guilmette ineffective assistance of counsel claim is procedurally defaulted,he must show cause and prejudice to excuse that default.munson,at.he can not do so because his trial counsel were not constitutionally ineffective and because any error by those counsel did not prejudice him.see strickland washington.guilmette argues correctly that ineffective assistance of appellate counsel can constitute cause to overcome a procedural default.howard bouchard,cir.where ineffective assistance of appellate counsel is presented as a possible cause to excuse the default of a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel,a court in some circumstances must examine the merits of the petitioner claim.ivory jackson,cir.guilmette argues that his trial counsel were ineffective for failing to notice that the two footprint photographs introduced by the prosecution at taken by trooper coulter and the other taken by mccormick on the threshold of her did not match.he argues that had his counsel noticed this discrepancy,they could have argued that the footprint on the threshold was not guilmette,and thus that the state had failed to establish entry.see.comp.laws a.
this argument fails because it relies upon the improbable suggestion that guilmette could have broken open mccormick door without satisfying the element of entry,which is defined in michigan as any part of defendant body being introduced within the house.see people gilman.app.guilmette counsel had a promising defense based upon the victim questionable identification,guilmette plausible alibi,and the inconsistency between the victim description of guilmette actions and the testimony regarding guilmette inoperable door.by contrast,a defense on the element of entry required the jury to believe that guilmette could break open a locked door without having any part of his body enter into the house.guilmette trial counsel were not required to to investigate facts relevant implausible argument,in order to be effective.s trategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation.strickland,at.because the mistaken identity defense was strong,and because a reasonable attorney could have concluded that an entry defense was futile,a choice to conduct only a limited investigation does not rebut the strong presumption that counsel rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.id.at see also bobby van hook.the implausibility of this argument also precludes a finding of prejudice,for there is not a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different if counsel had presented this argument to the jury.see strickland,at.
this is all the more true because,if guilmette counsel had contested entry,it might have either removed the focus from or undermined the credibility of the defense misidentification argument.see united states ryan,d.indeed,statements by guilmette trial counsel during closing argument support the conclusion that a focused identification defense was chosen in part to support the credibility of the defense.in that closing,guilmette counsel relied specifically on the consistency of the defense case as a reason for the jury to find it credible.attorney gatesman argued,at no time has anyone on the defense stood up,tried to persuade,presented to you,presented a question to a witness,that would try to persuade you that what mccormick said up there happened around january,did happen.defense counsel also argued that the prosecution inconsistent alternative arguments undermined the credibility of the case against guilmette.in rebutting the defense alibi evidence,the prosecution suggested both that someone might have impersonated guilmette at the methadone clinic to generate the receipt and that,even if the receipt was genuine,guilmette could have traveled from the crime scene to the methadone clinic in the time between the crime and the issuance of the receipt.in response to these alternative arguments,the defense counsel stated,and i think the prosecution thinks he was at the methadone clinic.and i tell you why i think they think that.because,they investigated and they presented their positions on what we presented.in other words,the fact that the prosecution presented detailed evidence and arguments regarding the time line undermines the credibility of their argument that someone else might have been impersonating guilmette at the clinic.together,these arguments suggested that the jury ought to find the defense more credible because defense counsel,unlike the prosecutor,had refrained from making inconsistent alternative arguments.counsel limited investigation of the evidence related to entry must be directly assessed for reasonableness in light of this strategy,applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel judgments.strickland,at.applying that deference,it can not be said that counsel choices constituted errors so serious that counsel were not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the sixth amendment.id.at.
this conclusion does not conflate the element of entry with the element of breaking.it is possible to satisfy the element of breaking without satisfying the element of entry in other factual situations,as when someone uses a crowbar to break into a dwelling.people rodgers,wl,at,relying upon eyewitness testimony to establish entry where circumstantial evidence indicated that the defendants used a crowbar to break into a garage.but this does not apply to the present case,where there is no suggestion that the perpetrator used any implement.a defendant would have to be,to break down a door manually without any part of that defendant body being introduced within the house.see gilman,at.to recognize this is not to conflate breaking with entering generally,but rather is only to notice that breaking may not be possible without entering under certain facts.
for these reasons,guilmette has not shown that his trial counsel were ineffective,and he can not establish that he was prejudiced by the alleged ineffectiveness.his appellate counsel was therefore also not ineffective,for appellate counsel can not be ineffective for a failure to raise an issue that lacks merit.willis,at quoting greer mitchell,cir.guilmette has therefore failed to establish cause and prejudice for his procedural default of his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel,and thus he is barred from raising that issue on habeas review.
we therefore reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the majority has found that guilmette procedurally defaulted by not bringing his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel immediately and that,even if he had,he can not succeed on the merits of his claim.i disagree with both conclusions and,therefore,respectfully dissent.as to the alleged procedural default,neither the final state court ruling on the merits of this case nor the courts that heard the case on appeal mentioned a procedural bar.thus,under this court holdings in abela martin,cir,and ivory jackson,cir,cert.denied,guilmette claims for ineffective assistance of counsel are not procedurally defaulted.as to the ineffective assistance claim,under the strickland analysis,guilmette attorney failure to conduct an adequate investigation constituted ineffective assistance of counsel at trial.he neither the state experts nor conducted a reasonable investigation into a single photograph of a footprint,taken by a witness after the state trooper had left the scene,that constituted the only evidence of entry into the house,a necessary element of the charge of home invasion.
guilmette is not procedurally barred from bringing his habeas claim 
guilmette first raised his ineffective assistance claim during state collateral proceedings.the majority contends that,because the claims raised by guilmette in his habeas petition were raised for the first time in his state motion for relief from not on direct review of his claims is barred by procedural default.see supra at.to be sure i t is that when a state prisoner has defaulted his federal claims in state court pursuant to an independent and adequate state procedural rule,federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the petitioner can show cause for the default and prejudice because of it,or a fundamental miscarriage of justice.abela,at citing coleman thompson.yet,a state procedural rule is an independent ground for precluding federal habeas review only if the state court actually relied on the rule to bar the claim at issue.id.as we have held,a state procedural rule is an independent and adequate state ground only if the state court rendering judgment in the case clearly and expressly stated that its judgment rested on a procedural bar.id.citing simpson sparkman,cir.this makes default is a draconian result,so it should apply only when the state court reasoning is clear and unequivocal.
the michigan court of appeals and the michigan supreme court denied leave to appeal on the ground that guilmette failed to meet the burden of establishing entitlement to relief under michigan court rule d.the majority errs in construing the michigan supreme court the citation to d an invocation of the procedural default provision set forth in d.d broadly pertains to motions for relief from judgment and states that courts many not grant relief if the motion suffers from either procedural or substantive defects.
as noted above,our task is to determine whether the state court clearly and expressly stated that its judgment rested on a procedural bar.sparkman,at.here,as with abela,the michigan supreme court only referenced d,generally,as the basis for denying guilmette leave to appeal the judgment of the michigan court of appeals.although d,and list specific procedural grounds for denying a defendant relief from judgment,these procedural grounds are not the exclusive grounds for which a court may deny relief pursuant to d.a court may deny relief from judgment under d for the substantive,reason that the defendant simply failed to meet his burden of establishing entitlement to the relief requested.as such,the michigan courts bare citation to d in orders denying guilmette leave to appeal does not demonstrate that the courts denied him leave to appeal on the basis of a procedural default,much less on the procedural ground described in d,which the warden urges on this court.
the majority attempts to distinguish abela from the case at hand by noting that,here,both the michigan court of appeals and the michigan supreme court invoked d in their denial of review,while in abela,the court of appeals had made a determination on the merits.however,this is a distinction without a difference.as we noted in ivory jackson,cir,the abela court itself distinguished two prior sixth circuit decisions holding that a denial of relief based on d provides an adequate and independent state procedural sanction sufficient to preclude habeas review on this same basis.id.at citing simpson jones,cir,and burroughs makowski,cir.however,the abela court distinguished simpson and makowski on the ground that,in those cases,the last reasoned state court opinion that referenced anything other than d had without question denied relief on procedural grounds.id.at.thus,one could assume in simpson and makowski that the affirmance under d was an affirmance of the lower court procedural findings.in abela,however,as in this case,the lower state courts had made no procedural holdings in the last reasoned opinion,so it would be difficult to read the simple affirmance as being based on procedural grounds.
the majority relies heavily on munson kapture,cir,because in that case,as in this case,both the michigan court of appeals and the michigan supreme court invoked.d in denying review.however,munson must be distinguished for the same reason that we distinguished simpson and makowski.in munson,the last reasoned opinion was at the state trial court proceedings.the court denied munson claims,inter alia,because he fail ed to show just cause why prosecutor misconduct was not raised in earlier appeals.munson,at.thus,the last reasoned decision in munson was based,at least in part,on procedural grounds,so,as in simpson and makowski,we could assume that the d affirmance was based on the procedural grounds cited by the trial court 
the last reasoned opinion issued in both abela and in guilmette case,by contrast,explicitly adjudicated the case on the merits without any reference to procedural issues.thus,as with abela,the michigan supreme court summary order can not possibly be interpreted solely to rely on a procedural bar,as opposed to the reason that guilmette simply failed to meet his burden of establishing entitlement to the relief requested.indeed,given the line of prior merits determinations in guilmette case,it is much more reasonable to presume that the michigan supreme court reference to d signaled its agreement with the lower courts merits determinations than it is to presume that the reference signaled,for the first time in this case,the invocation of a procedural bar 
guilmette successfully showed ineffective assistance of counsel at trial.
the majority also errs in its finding that guilmette could not show ineffective assistance of counsel.guilmette trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance in two related ways first,by failing to conduct a reasonable investigation into the facts,specifically by not investigating the discrepancies between the photograph of the suspect footprint taken by the police and the photograph of the threshold footprint taken by the homeowner after the police investigation,and,second,by failing to contest the prosecution proofs on a necessary element of the offense of home invasion 
as the majority noted,the test set forth in strickland washington,governs our analysis.it is that c ounsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.strickland,at.the duty to investigate derives from counsel basic function,which is to make the adversarial testing process work in the particular case.kimmelman morrison,quoting strickland,at.the relevant question is not whether counsel choices were strategic,but whether they were reasonable.roe.a purportedly strategic decision is not objectively reasonable when the attorney has failed to investigate his options and make a reasonable choice between them.combs coyle,cir citing horton zant,cir.
courts have not hesitated to find constitutionally ineffective assistance when counsel fails to conduct a reasonable investigation into one or more aspects of the case and when that failure prejudices his or her client guilmette trial counsel failure to conduct a reasonable investigation into the facts surrounding the photographs of the footprints that the state introduced into evidence similarly violated his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.guilmette has thus successfully satisfied both the deficiency and prejudice prongs of strickland.
with regard to the deficiency prong,the facts demonstrate that counsel did not investigate the facts surrounding
