opinion of the court 
martin roman was convicted of indecent assault and corruption of a minor,both crimes involving his daughter,and is currently a prisoner of the pennsylvania department of corrections.as part of his sentence,the state of pennsylvania recommended that roman participate in a sex offender treatment program.in order to do so,he is required to admit that he committed the sex crime for which he was convicted.roman has refused to participate in the program because,he contends,any such admission would constitute compelled in violation of the fifth amendment and would have compromised his appeal of his sex offense conviction.based on his refusal to participate,roman repeatedly has been denied parole.the primary issue before us is whether the state decision to deny roman parole,unless he admits his guilt and participates in the sex offender treatment program,violates his fifth amendment right against self incrimination.we hold that it does not.
in a jury found roman guilty of two counts of murder.he received an aggregate sentence of years.roman was released on parole in,shortly after his minimum release date.eight years later,while still on parole for the homicide conviction,roman was accused of inappropriately touching his daughter.he was charged with endangering the welfare of a child,corruption of a minor,unlawful restraint,simple assault,recklessly endangering another person,false imprisonment,and indecent assault.
ultimately,roman was convicted of indecent assault and corruption of a minor in,and was sentenced to serve months in a state correctional facility,to be followed by two years probation.the sentencing report recommended that he serve his sentence at a facility offering treatment for sexual offenders and abusers.
following roman conviction,the pennsylvania board of probation and parole the board met and determined that roman conduct violated the terms of his parole from his homicide conviction.the board ordered him to serve backtime and the remainder of his sentence for murder,pending parole,prior to beginning his sentence for his conviction.the board decision stated that,w hile confined,roman must comply with the institution prescriptive program requirements and have no misconducts.roman must participate in sex offender treatment.app.pennsylvania sex offender treatment program requires that an inmate admit guilt for the offending conduct in order to participate.roman says that he refused to participate because admitting his guilt could have jeopardized his appeal of his conviction for indecent assault and corruption of minors.
the board first denied roman parole in august,following a hearing.in its decision,the board considered roman version of the nature and circumstances surrounding his homicide offense his prior history of parole failure,and his unacceptable compliance with the sex offender treatment program prescribed to him in his sentencing.the board stated that in roman next review it would consider whether roman had participated completed a treatment program for sex offenders and whether prison officials still recommended him for parole.app.
the board denied roman parole a second time in august,citing the same factors it relied on in its decision.it again listed roman failure to complete the prison sex offenders program as one of the bases for its decision,and again stated that it would consider whether he had completed the program as part of its next review of his eligibility for parole.
roman sought review of these parole denials in the commonwealth court of pennsylvania,requesting a writ of mandamus directing the board to correct its misapplication of the law.app.the court dismissed his petition,finding that the board had acted within the scope of its discretion.roman pennsylvania board of probation and parole.the pennsylvania supreme court affirmed that decision the following year.roman.bd.of probation parole.roman did not assert a fifth amendment claim during either of those proceedings.
in november,roman filed a pro se petition for habeas corpus in the eastern district of pennsylvania,arguing that the board violate d the constitutional protections of the ex post facto clause when it ordered roman to participate in a sex offender program before considering his parole application of the conviction in violation of the fifth and fourteenth amendments.at the time he filed his petition,roman appeal of his conviction for indecent assault and corruption of minors was still pending in state court 
roman petition was assigned to a magistrate judge,who issued a report and recommendation stating that roman had failed to exhaust his claims in state court,as required under federal habeas law.in the alternative,he found that roman petition failed on the merits.the magistrate judge interpreted roman claim as an ex post facto challenge and determined that,because roman could not demonstrate that a change in the law governing pennsylvania parole decisions had affected his sentence,his claim failed.
in response,roman filed an objection to the magistrate judge report and recommendation,more fully articulating that the conditions on his parole were problematic because,in order to participate in a sex offender program,which requires admission of the crime as a stepping stone for admission into the program,roman would be require d to waive his fifth amendment rights against self incrimination.app.roman objected that he could not waive those rights because he had yet to exhaust his challenges to his state court conviction.notwithstanding roman objections,the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation and denied roman habeas claim.
in may,this court issued a certificate of appealability pursuant to c on two issues whether roman ha d exhausted his claim that the denial of parole based on his failure to complete the sex offender treatment program violates his fifth amendment right against with respect to a conviction that is not final and if so,whether the denial of parole violated roman right against self incrimination with respect to the conviction that was not final.

exhaustion requirement 
a federal court may not review a petition for writ of habeas corpus unless it appears that the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the state,or shows that doing so would be futile because state procedures are unavailable or ineffective.defoy mccullough,cir quoting b internal quotation marks omitted.in order to satisfy the futility exception to the exhaustion requirement,a petitioner must show that the state remedy is so clearly foreclosed by state law that we can conclude with certainty that state courts afford no recourse for the claim.lines larkins,cir.where,however,a petitioner has failed to raise his claims in state court and we find that some state process is available to address those claims,notions of federalism and comity require that we dismiss the habeas petition.defoy,at.
alternatively,we may bypass the exhaustion issue altogether should we decide that the petitioner habeas claim fails on the merits.b an application for a writ of habeas corpus may be denied on the merits,notwithstanding the failure of the applicant to exhaust the remedies available in the courts of the state.taylor horn,cir.
roman now argues that the exhaustion requirement is no bar to his claim because,as this circuit recognized in defoy,pennsylvania law affords no remedy for claims challenging the constitutionality of a denial of parole.thus,he argues,any attempt to raise his argument in state court would have been futile in response,the state argues that defoy no longer controls because commonwealth courts since that decision have adjudicated mandamus actions involving parole denials by the board and have considered constitutional claims other than ex post facto claims.
because we will deny roman claims on the merits,we need not address the issue of exhaustion in this case.however,we pause to note that,to the extent there has been any shift in pennsylvania law,we can not comfortably say that it is clear enough to alter our decision in defoy 
fifth amendment claim 
the fifth amendment,as incorporated and made applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment,provides that no person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.const.amend.though a prisoner already may have been convicted and imprisoned for an offense,the fifth amendment still applies to ensure that the individual not be compelled to bear witness against himself or to divulge information that might incriminate him in future criminal proceedings.minnesota murphy.an individual trying to make out a fifth amendment claim must demonstrate two key elements compulsion and use.id.
roman argues that the board decisions requiring that he participate in the sex offender rehabilitation program violated his right against under the fifth amendment,since the board effectively compelled him to choose between admitting his guilt for a sexual offense a requirement for admission to the program and relinquishing his opportunity for parole.roman further argues that,at the time he filed this petition,his conviction for the sex offense was not yet final and thus any admission he made could be used against him in that appeal or in any future proceedings.the state responds that roman has not demonstrated a fifth amendment violation because the consequences of his refusal to participate in the program are not severe enough to constitute compulsion under the fifth amendment.further,it argues that roman is unable to show that his statements were or would have been used against him in a criminal proceeding,had he decided to participate in the program.
the record before us is not clear as to the extent to which roman refusal to participate in the program was the sole or primary cause of the board repeated refusal to grant him parole.in each board letter,it is listed as one among several reasons for denying him parole,including his history of previous failures under supervised release.however,even assuming arguendo that the board refusal was the sole driver of its decisions to refuse roman parole,we hold that the actions of the board do not amount to compulsion within the meaning of the fifth amendment.
though the privilege against does not terminate at the jailhouse door,it is well established that a broad range of choices that might infringe constitutional rights in a free society fall within the expected conditions of confinement of those who have suffered a lawful conviction.mckune lile,plurality opinion kennedy.thus,in circumstances such as these,where a prisoner liberties are already curtailed as a necessary and essential element of his incarceration,that prisoner faces unique challenges in demonstrating that a particular penalty or punishment inflicts a constitutional injury upon him.in the context of the fifth amendment,specifically,compulsion is the linchpin of any such claim.
where,as here,a prisoner argues that the consequences of his refusal to participate in a prison program that requires him to admit guilt violate the fifth amendment,we must ask whether the state program,and the consequences for in it,combine to create a compulsion that encumbers that prisoner right against.id.at.though drawing the distinction between a lawful condition of confinement and a condition that impermissibly encumbers a prisoner rights can be challenging,it is a distinction that rests on the difference between merely pressuring or encouraging an inmate to incriminate himself,and compelling him to do so through the threat of consequences so grave as to leave him no choice at all.see id.at,concurring.
the supreme court outlined the contours of this analysis in mckune lile.in that case lile,a convicted sex offender,brought a fifth amendment challenge to kansas compulsory sex offender program,which required him to admit guilt for his crime of incarceration as well as any previous sex crimes.id.at.under the kansas program,any such admissions were not privileged and could be used in future criminal proceedings.id.at.lile,who was convicted of rape but had maintained all along that the encounter was consensual,refused to admit guilt and faced losing substantial prison privileges as a result.in particular,prison officials threatened to restrict his visitation rights,earnings,prison job opportunities,and ability to send money to his family.lile was also told he would be moved to a prison,which necessarily entailed less comfortable living conditions and housed more dangerous inmates,in order to make room for prisoners who were willing to participate in the program.id.at.
in a fractured opinion,a plurality of the court agreed that lile though faced with a difficult choice between asserting his right to remain silent and receiving the benefits and comforts of the prison conditions then afforded to him had failed to demonstrate that the reduction in his prison privileges rose to the level of compulsion proscribed under the fifth amendment.id.at.the plurality opinion,authored by justice kennedy,distinguished the punishment meted against lile from the penalty cases in which the court had previously held that consequences involving the loss of employment or professional reputation were sufficient to constitute compulsion under the fifth amendment.those cases,the plurality wrote,involved free citizens,not already subject to the limitations of prison life,and were thus not easily extended to the prison context.id.at citing garity new jersey,spevak.klein.instead,the plurality applied a very stringent test that required that the inmate demonstrate the imposition of atypical and significant hardships on inmates in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.id.at adopting the test for due process claims established in sandin conner.in effect,the plurality test limited compulsion to instances not served by a legitimate penal interest,where the punishment actually lengthened a prisoner sentence or altogether denied him eligibility for credits or parole.id.justice stevens,joined by justices souter,ginsburg and breyer,dissented,urging that the court adopt a much broader test which recognized that the threat of revoking privileges was sufficient to trigger the fifth amendment,absent some grant of immunity assuring that the statements could not be used against the prisoner.mckune,at,stevens,dissenting.
justice,whose opinion controls concurred on narrow grounds,agreeing with the plurality judgment that lile fifth amendment claim failed but agreeing with the dissent that the fifth amendment compulsion standard is broader than the atypical and significant hardship standard the court had adopted for evaluating due process claims in prisons.id.at,concurring.
justice did not,herself,state a particular test for determining what degree of penalty amounts to compulsion in the prison context.she noted,however,that a proper inquiry should recognize that it is generally acceptable to impose the risk of punishment,however great,so long as the actual imposition of such punishment is accomplished through a fair criminal process and so long as it stops short of punishments such as longer incarceration or execution penalties that would surely implicate a liberty interest.id.at,citing mcgautha california.importantly,under justice analysis,the fifth amendment does not prohibit all penalties levied in response to a person refusal to incriminate himself or herself not all pressure necessarily compels incriminating statements.id.at see also ohio woodward,noting in the context of voluntary clemency hearings that it has never been suggested that such pressures constitute compulsion for fifth amendment purposes mcgautha,at noting that a criminal defendant is of
