the texas court of criminal appeals set out the facts of the crime 
katherine jiminez testified at trial and described appellant actions in detail.she indicated that she first met appellant in.the two became friends,spent time together socially,and dated for a short time.they parted ways soon thereafter,but remained in friendly contact.katherine then married anthony jiminez in april of,and on june,she gave birth to a son,anthony.katherine and her husband eventually separated,and in late,she a relationship with appellant,who then lived in new york.in january of,katherine moved into an apartment of her own in georgetown.in march,appellant visited her from new york.after another visit in july of,appellant decided to return to texas.katherine and appellant agreed that they would live together until appellant got on his feet.in late august,he began living with katherine and anthony in katherine apartment.
less than a month later,on sunday,september,katherine,appellant,and anthony returned to katherine apartment after having lunch at appellant brother house.katherine and appellant were both supposed to go to work that evening.katherine planned to drop anthony off at her mother house,where he would remain until katherine could pick him up the next morning.appellant wanted katherine to join him in a nap that afternoon,but she refused,because she needed to finish chores around the apartment and because she did not want to take a nap while anthony was awake.meanwhile,anthony was in the living room watching television.appellant,angry that katherine would not take a nap with him,knocked a plate of food from her hand.the two then retreated to the bedroom where they began arguing.at that point,katherine told appellant,i do even want to talk to you anymore.i do want to look at you.i do want you to be around me i do want you here.just get your things and leave.appellant said,you want me to leave and katherine said,yeah,i want you to leave.
a brief cooling off period ensued,and the two began talking again.during this time,katherine sister elizabeth called,but appellant said katherine was busy and hung up the telephone.katherine told appellant to get his stuff and leave.katherine then repeated that she wanted him to leave.appellant left the room,and when he came back asked again,you want me to leave and she said that she did.angered,appellant said,fuck it.fuck it,and attacked katherine with a knife.he stabbed her repeatedly and slashed her throat.then,apparently,the knife broke.katherine struggled and attempted to placate appellant by telling him that she loved him.eventually,appellant began crying,afraid that he would go to jail.katherine said that she would contrive a false story about her injuries if appellant would simply leave.
katherine tried unsuccessfully to telephone the police and to escape,but appellant caught her and dragged her to the kitchen.he stabbed her again repeatedly,and she feigned death.appellant left the kitchen,and katherine heard anthony scream,i do want to die.do kill me.i do want to die.stabbed in the chest,anthony died within moments.
later,katherine heard her sister and her nephew outside the apartment.afraid appellant would finally kill her if she screamed for help,however,she remained silent.appellant stayed active throughout the night.he came to the kitchen where katherine lay and showed her that he had slashed his wrists,stating,look,i going to die with you.later,he telephoned his father.several hours later,believing that her death was imminent,katherine dragged her body toward her son,wanting to die by his side.
meanwhile,katherine family became worried that they had not heard from her,that she had not arrived for work,and that she had not left anthony with her mother at the regularly scheduled time.elizabeth ojeda,one of katherine sisters,testified that,after she called katherine apartment,left messages on her answering machine,visited the apartment,and received no response to her knock,ojeda telephoned the apartment manager and georgetown police.early monday morning,two officers visited the apartment on a welfare concern call.corporal gregory brunson testified that he noticed both katherine and appellant vehicles in the parking lot of the apartment complex.he also confirmed information about who was paying utilities at apartment,katherine apartment.corporal brunson and officer vasquez approached the apartment door and knocked,but received no response and heard no noise inside the apartment.corporal brunson did not see any lights and could not see inside the apartment windows when looking from the north side of the building.officer vasquez telephoned the apartment but received no answer.upon a request from the officers,the apartment manager arrived with a key but was unable to enter the apartment because of an interior deadbolt.at this point,seeing no other means of opening the door,corporal brunson telephoned the fire department for assistance.three firefighters arrived with what corporal brunson described as a doorjamb spreader,which is used to open deadbolted doors.after approximately five minutes,the firefighters opened the apartment door.
upon entering the apartment,one of the firefighters exclaimed that appellant had a knife.corporal brunson drew his revolver,approached the door,and saw appellant,whose right hand was initially hidden.in response to corporal brunson orders,appellant raised his right hand,in which he held a large kitchen knife covered in blood.after ordering appellant out of the apartment,corporal brunson repeatedly asked appellant to release the knife.appellant eventually did so and corporal brunson handcuffed him.inside the apartment,corporal brunson saw anthony body,katherine bloody arms protruding from beyond a chair,and blood stains covering the carpet and walls near the kitchen.once the officers determined that no one else was in the apartment,they allowed medical personnel to enter and begin treating katherine,who said to corporal brunson,he killed my baby,and i have been waiting for you to come.
