kevin melancon,louisiana prisoner,appeals the district court dismissal of his petition as.melancon was granted a certificate of appealability coa as to whether his supervisory writ application to the louisiana court of appeal was properly filed and whether his state application was pending until february,thereby allowing him to toll the limitations period under d.because we find that melancon was not entitled to tolling for a period of time that would make his application timely,we affirm the dismissal.
in october,a louisiana jury convicted melancon of possession of cocaine.the trial court sentenced him to twenty years imprisonment because he was a multiple offender.melancon conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal.on march,the louisiana supreme court denied melancon application for a supervisory writ.
on november,melancon filed a state habeas application contending that he was denied his sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel.in february,after the trial court failed to acknowledge his petition,melancon filed a writ of mandamus with the louisiana court of appeal urging the court to direct the orleans parish district attorney to respond to his application.the court of appeal granted this motion in april and directed the trial court to appoint melancon an attorney and to conduct an evidentiary hearing.on december,the trial court denied melancon habeas application on the merits.
on may,approximately five months after his application for a supervisory writ was rendered untimely under louisiana court of appeals rule,melancon filed an application for a supervisory writ with the court of appeal.the court of appeal granted the writ on august,but denied relief.the court of appeal suggested that melancon application was untimely,but noted that the trial court set the return date as may.the opinion considered the merits of the claim because this court ordered the evidentiary hearing in response to defendant relator pro se writ.
on august,melancon filed a timely application for rehearing from the court of appeal determination,which was denied on september.he then filed an application for a supervisory writ with the louisiana supreme court on october.the louisiana supreme court denied the writ without explanation on february.
melancon filed this pro se federal habeas petition on june,arguing again that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel.the magistrate judge issued a report recommending dismissal of melancon petition as.the magistrate judge determined that both melancon may,application for a supervisory writ to the louisiana court of appeal and his october,application for a supervisory writ to the louisiana supreme court were untimely,and therefore that the tolling provisions in d did not apply to these applications.the district court,reviewing the magistrate judge recommendations,the petitioner objections,and the record,found that the one year statute of limitations was only tolled until december,because the may,application for a supervisory writ with the court of appeal was not properly filed under the meaning of d.the district court also found that even if melancon was entitled to tolling while his application for a supervisory writ was before the court of appeal,his application was because the limitations period was not tolled during the time between melancon applications.the district court therefore dismissed the application.
this court granted melancon a coa as to whether melancon may,application for a supervisory writ was properly filed with the court of appeals and whether melancon state application was pending until february.
we review de novo the district court denial of melancon habeas application on procedural grounds.see emerson johnson,cir.the antiterrorist and effective death penalty act aedpa established a one year statute of limitations on the filing of federal habeas applications.d.under d,the time during which a properly filed application for state or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation under this subsection.
melancon,whose conviction became final prior to the enactment of the aedpa,was entitled to a one year grace period from the date of aedpa,file his petition.see hall cain,cir.the one year period therefore began on april,and continued until melancon filed his state post conviction application on november,encompassing days of the limitations period.from that point,the limitations period was clearly tolled until december,when the trial court denied post conviction relief.
after the trial court denied relief,melancon had thirty days to request review of the trial court determination,according to louisiana court of appeal rule however,melancon did not file his application for a supervisory writ to the louisiana court of appeal until may.the louisiana court of appeal denied his application on the merits on august.his application for rehearing and his application for a supervisory writ to the louisiana supreme court were then timely filed.after the louisiana supreme court denial of melancon application on february,the limitations period clearly ran until june,when melancon filed his federal habeas application,adding another days to the limitations period.
this pattern of events leads to two issues,both of which must be resolved in melancon favor to find this habeas petition timely filed.first,melancon untimely application for a supervisory writ to the court of appeal must have be considered properly filed under d to merit tolling the time between may,and february.second,melancon claims before the trial court must have been pending between the trial court december,denial of relief and his may,application to the court of appeal to merit the tolling provision under d for that time period.if the limitations period on melancon federal habeas application was not tolled for either of those blocks of time,melancon application is untimely.
louisiana court of appeal rule allows the court of appeal to consider an application that was not timely filed if there is a showing that the delay in filing was not due to the applicant fault.because rule entitled the court of appeal to consider melancon application for a supervisory writ on the merits,and the court of appeal did consider melancon application on the merits,the may,application was properly filed in state court see emerson,at finding that we defer to state courts application of state law when determining whether something is properly filed dilworth johnson,cir noting that because the petitioner application was accorded some level of judicial review by the state courts,it is considered a properly filed application under section d citing villegas johnson,cir.melancon subsequent application for rehearing and application for a supervisory writ were both timely filed thus,these applications also tolled the limitations period.
the main issue on appeal,then,is the question of when the state habeas application was considered to be pending under d.the district court only tolled the limitations period for periods of time in which an application was actually before the louisiana court it allowed the limitations period to run during the time between the date of one state court decisions and the petitioner filing of a further appeal.however,if melancon application was pending during the time between the trial court denial in december,and melancon application for a supervisory writ to the court of appeal in may,his application was properly filed.
as a starting point for our analysis,we must consider whether the time period for a federal habeas application is tolled during the intervals between the state court denial of relief and the timely appeal from that denial.this determination affects the total number of days tolled between the court of appeal denial of the writ and the supreme court denial of the application for a supervisory writ.every circuit that has addressed the issue has found that a state application is pending during the intervals between the state court disposition of a state habeas petition and the petitioner timely filing of a petition for
