the general store in joliet,illinois,was the scene of an armed robbery on the night of october,and the store clerk on duty cheryl smithson identified darryl allen as the from a photographic array and also during his two state trials.the first of the two trials ended in a deadlocked jury,but the second trial resulted with allen being convicted of armed robbery,which was upheld on appeal.in the petitioner initial appeal of his conviction he alleged that his trial counsel was ineffective for eliciting testimony from detective farmer referring to the defendant silence,and also the petitioner argued that his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the issue of trial counsel ineffectiveness on direct appeal.the state appellate court rejected each of these arguments,holding that,even if counsel performance was deficient,he was not prejudiced by the trial counsel question because the evidence of guilt was overwhelming.we affirm.
allen second jury trial lasted less than a day.as previously pointed out the store clerk identified the armed robber and during her testimony referred to him as a frequent customer and went on to explain that he had visited the store on two different occasions on the night of the robbery.smithson testimony also revealed that the robber was unmasked,which afforded her ample time to observe and recognize him.she also mentioned that he had been a frequent patron of the store.she further stated that the unmasked robber displayed a gun while standing within a foot of her and directed her to give him the money in the cash register.shortly after the crime,the witness smithson immediately identified allen as the armed robber during a photo lineup and again at trial.in addition to smithson eyewitness account,a videotape of the robbery was displayed to the jury.even though the pictures on the videotape film were not of perfect quality,they were of sufficient quality to assist the jury in substantiating smithson testimony as well as her identification of allen as the robber.
finally,the state as proof of consciousness of guilt offered the evidence that allen fled to georgia about two months after the crime.it is well established that evidence of flight is admissible as a circumstance tending to show a consciousness of guilt.see illinois pursley,d.
it is also interesting to note that during his of the investigator,defense counsel,as distinguished from appellate counsel,elicited the following testimony concerning the questioning of allen 
counsel okay.now,you said that you read allen the rights off the miranda form,correct 
farmer that is correct.
counsel but you filled the answers out 
farmer that is correct.
counsel okay.is it a fact that allen refused to answer any questions 
farmer he refused to answer questions in reference to the case in which i asked him about.
counsel okay.so,he was cooperating with you,correct 
farmer that is correct.
the jury returned a verdict of guilty,and the judge sentenced allen to years imprisonment.
on appeal,allen challenged the trial court refusal to instruct the jury on robbery,a offense.he also argued that the presentence investigation report was limited because the probation officer should have interviewed more people.allen undermined this contention by refusing to be interviewed or cooperate in the preparation of the presentence report.finally,the defendant complained that the trial judge abused his discretion when sentencing him to years in prison.the appellate court rejected this argument as allen had been convicted of a number of crimes at least twenty other armed robberies including a prior armed robbery at the same store.the latest robbery was committed while he was on parole status.allen conviction and sentence of years were affirmed on appeal.see allen,at.allen next brought a motion for leave to appeal,which the state supreme court denied.people allen.
allen then proceeded with a second round of postconviction litigation in the illinois courts,arguing that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by eliciting testimony concerning his silence,and that prior appellate counsel was ineffective in not raising this issue on direct appeal.the state appellate court did not reach the question of whether trial counsel elicitation of the testimony fell outside the range of professionally competent assistance,and rather focused on the prejudice prong.over a dissent,the court upheld the denial of relief on this issue,reasoning that allen could not have been prejudiced because the totality of the evidence of his guilt was overwhelming.people allen,d,unpublished.the state appellate court majority explained that smithson identification of allen was both prompt and strong because she had more than ample opportunity to observe the unmasked perpetrator at close range,and also remembered him as a frequent customer of the store,and furthermore she had opportunities to observe him on two separate occasions in close proximity as little as one foot on the evening of the robbery.id.at.the majority added that the surveillance video tended to corroborate smithson testimony and that allen flight and arrest in the state of georgia some two months after the robbery tend ed to show consciousness of guilt.id.the state supreme court again denied leave to appeal.people allen.
subsequently,allen filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal court.the district court concluded that the state appellate court application of strickland was not unreasonable,and thus controlling.allen challenges that conclusion here.
we agree that strickland has reasonably been applied to allen claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.a federal court may not grant a habeas corpus petition unless the state court adjudication of the claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.d.under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,ineffective assistance of counsel is a mixed question of law and fact reviewed de novo with a strong presumption that the attorney performed effectively.see united states fudge,cir.the law governing ineffective assistance claims,announced in strickland,requires that allen must demonstrate that counsel performance fell outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance and there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland,at.the bar for establishing that a state court application of the strickland standard was unreasonable is a high one,and only a clear error in applying strickland will support a writ of habeas corpus.to demonstrate prejudice under strickland,the petitioner must establish that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.id.at.the state appellate court rejected this claim on the merits,holding that petitioner could not satisfy strickland prejudice prong because overwhelming evidence supported his conviction.
the petitioner advances three other challenges to the state appellate court adjudication of his claims.initially,he argues that the court failed to apply the correct legal standard for prejudice,resulting in a decision contrary to strickland.second,he contends that,to the extent the court applied the correct standard for prejudice under strickland,it was an unreasonable application of the law to the facts of the case.finally,he argues that the court did not properly consider his claim that his appellate attorney was ineffective.
a.a decision contrary to strickland prejudice prong.
allen argues that the state court decision was contrary to the prejudice prong of strickland because,in assessing whether counsel performance prejudiced him,the court wrote that counsel alleged error did not tip the scales of justice unfairly in favor of the state.although the court repeatedly referred to strickland,allen contends that the state appellate court use of its scales of justice language raised his burden of proof,
