petitioner miguel paredes,convicted of capital murder in texas and sentenced to death,appeals the federal district court denial of his petition for writ of habeas corpus.we consider whether paredes is entitled to relief based on his contentions that the state trial court violated paredes constitutional rights by failing to require a unanimous verdict as to which two or more of three decedents paredes murdered and he was denied effective assistance of counsel because at trial,his attorney failed to object to the jury instructions in this regard.we affirm.
we have previously considered other grounds on which paredes seeks habeas relief in paredes quarterman paredes i in our earlier opinion,we described the events leading to paredes conviction and death sentence.we recount in this opinion only the facts essential to the disposition of the issues presently before us.
paredes,john saenz,and greg alvarado,who were all members of the hermanos pistoleros latinos gang,anticipated a confrontation regarding an illegal drug transaction and allegedly armed themselves,lay in wait,then shot and killed rival gang members adrian torres,nelly bravo,and shawn cain inside saenz home.the victims were slain within seconds of one another.paredes was charged with murdering more than one person during the same criminal transaction under the texas capital murder statute the state of texas alleged alternatively that paredes should be held responsible for the deaths of more than one of the three decedents under texas law of parties,which permits a defendant to be held criminally responsible for an offense committed by another if with intent to promote or assist the commission of the offense,he solicits,encourages,directs,aids,or attempts to aid the other person to commit the offense.
at trial,a witness testified that paredes admitted to shooting bravo,and other witnesses testified that paredes remained silent when,in paredes presence,john saenz recounted that paredes had shot both bravo and cain.one witness,eric saenz,the brother of john saenz,testified that after john saenz,in paredes presence,had described in some detail how he,john saenz,shot torres,how paredes shot bravo in the head,and how paredes then shot cain,paredes stated to eric saenz that eric should have been there,that eric would have had some fun.medical evidence was consistent with testimony that paredes was the shooter in the deaths of bravo and cain but not torres.there was direct evidence that paredes was in john saenz home at the time of the killings and assisted in cleaning blood off the floor and walls of the home and in disposing of the bodies afterwards.there was also strong circumstantial evidence that paredes was present during the killing of each of the three decedents,and that at a minimum,he aided or attempted to aid saenz in carrying out the plan to kill these individuals.
in a general charge,the trial judge instructed the jury that it could convict paredes of capital murder if it found that he killed torres and either bravo or cain or bravo and either torres or cain or cain and either torres or bravo.the jury was also permitted to find that paredes had committed capital murder under the law of parties.the jury was not required to specify which of the alternative grounds it found to be true,and paredes lawyer did not object to the instructions.the jury returned a general verdict finding paredes guilty of capital murder as charged in the indictment,and paredes was subsequently sentenced to death at the conclusion of the penalty phase of his trial.
paredes appealed his conviction and sentence,and the texas court of criminal appeals affirmed he then filed a habeas application in state court but was denied relief.in its unpublished opinion denying habeas relief,the texas court of criminal appeals did not discuss paredes contentions regarding jury unanimity,but the court did adopt the findings and conclusion of the state trial court with regard to the habeas petition the state trial court conclusions as to the jury charge issue were brief,stating only that it did not violate the holding of schad,referring to the supreme court decision in schad arizona in schad,four members of the court in a plurality opinion and one justice in a concurring opinion held that a conviction based on an instruction that did not require jury unanimity as to whether the murder was premeditated or alternatively was a felony murder did not violate the petitioner right to due process.
paredes filed the instant federal habeas petition and requested an evidentiary hearing.the district court denied habeas relief and the request for a hearing,but granted a certificate of appealability coa on the issue of whether trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to raise confrontation clause objections to the testimony of two trial witnesses.
paredes appealed and requested a coa on six additional issues.we affirmed the denial of habeas relief on the confrontation clause issue and denied coas on four issues we granted a coa on the two related questions that we now address whether the jury instructions violated paredes constitutional rights by not requiring the jury to agree unanimously on which two of the victims he killed and whether paredes attorney was constitutionally ineffective for failing to object to those instructions 
we review paredes habeas petition under the highly deferential standard for evaluating rulings set forth in the and effective death penalty act aedpa the question before us is not whether the state trial court should have instructed the jury as it did but instead whether the determination of the texas court of criminal appeals that there was no violation of paredes constitutional rights was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court of the united states.the supreme court has repeatedly admonished that an unreasonable application of federal law is different from an incorrect application of federal law.a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.instead,the application must be objectively unreasonable.this standard of review creates a substantially higher threshold for obtaining relief than de novo review.
but even if a state court determination was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,that is not the end of the inquiry.generally,on collateral review,petitioners are not entitled to habeas relief based on trial error unless they can establish that it resulted in actual prejudice.an error is prejudicial if it had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict.the supreme court has recently confirmed that jury charge error in a case in which a jury rendering a general verdict had been instructed on alternative theories of guilt and may have relied on an invalid theory is not structural error and is subject to analysis so long as the error at issue does not categorically vitiat e all the jury findings.
to determine whether the texas court determinations relating to the jury instruction at issue in the case before us constituted an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court,we must attempt to ascertain what the supreme court has held regarding the requirement of unanimity in jury instructions in criminal cases.the most recent guidance is found in the plurality opinion in schad and justice scalia concurring opinion in that case there,the plurality and justice scalia concluded that a murder conviction based on jury instructions that did not require agreement on whether the defendant was guilty of premeditated murder or felony murder was not unconstitutional.but in arriving at that decision,the court did not,as we shall discuss below,set forth an analytical framework that can be applied to determine readily whether process has been due when facts such as those in the instant case are presented.
in schad,the arizona supreme court had authoritatively determined that the state has chosen not to treat premeditation and the commission of a felony as independent elements of the crime,and the question was whether arizona choice was unconstitutional in the present case,it is not clear that the texas court of criminal appeals has authoritatively determined what elements the texas legislature has prescribed for the crime of murdering more than one person during the same criminal transaction 
the state argues that the single offense of murdering more than one person during the same criminal transaction may be proven by alternative means,such as showing that the defendant killed a and either b or c,b and either a or c,or c and either a or b,and that the jury does not have to agree as to which two of the victims the defendant murdered.the state argues that the murder of the same decedent does not have to be the predicate for each alternative means of committing the crime of multiple murder when alternative means of committing multiple murder under this statute are alleged.the state acknowledges,however,that there is no case law in texas that addresses this precise question.
the decision of the texas court of criminal appeals that comes closest to answering how the texas statute should be construed arose out of the conviction of john saenz one of paredes cohorts in the killings of torres,bravo,and cain,for saenz participation in the same criminal transaction leading to paredes conviction.the court of criminal appeals opinion in saenz reflects that e ach count alleged the murder of a different victim,and each count alleged the murder of the two other victims as aggravating circumstances.saenz was convicted of three counts of capital murder.under each count,the jury found that saenz would not be a future danger,and life imprisonment was imposed for each count the only issue that the texas court decided was whether saenz had been subjected to multiple punishments for the same offense in violation of the double jeopardy clause,when separate judgments for the offense of capital murder were entered for each victim of a multiple murder committed in the same criminal transaction.after surveying the legislative history of section a a,the texas court held that the double jeopardy clause had been violated and ruled that saenz could receive only one life sentence for his crime of multiple murder 
in construing section a a,the texas court concluded in saenz that the statute reflects that the killing of at least two persons allows the state to charge a single count of capital murder.the court recounted that the impetus behind the enactment of section a a was the state inability to seek the death penalty as punishment for the concomitant murders of six dallas nightclub patrons by an individual,and that the texas legislature goal was not to create a means to seek multiple death penalties but to mak e it possible for the state to execute mass murderers.in the concluding paragraph of its opinion in saenz,the court held that t he most reasonable interpretation of the statute and its legislative intent is that,under the circumstances presented here saenz case,the statute allows only a single capital murder conviction.the court held that the double jeopardy clause had been violated when the state charged appellant with three separate counts of capital murder under section a a because the charges rely on the same three murders for each charge.
it is not clear from the saenz opinion whether saenz was charged in precisely the same manner as paredes was charged in the present case,and we do not know from the saenz opinion how the jury instruction was worded in that case.we can discern,however,that the holdings in saenz do not directly answer the question of whether the texas legislature intended to permit a capital murder conviction under section a a to be established by alternative means such as that the defendant murdered a and either b or c,b and either a or c,or c and either a or b.the opinion in saenz does at least hint that the texas court of criminal appeals does not think that such a charge would be proper,but instead is of the view that a single predicate murder must be alleged together with an allegation that one or more additional murders was committed.in discussing the allowable unit of prosecution under section a a,the texas court said a predicate to charging capital murder is that a defendant commit murder as defined under section b.the texas court reasoned that the aggravating circumstance for a capital murder prosecution under section a a is the murder of more than one person during the same criminal transaction.the texas court continued,t he commission of at least one murder,then,which is in addition to the predicate murder,is the aggravating circumstance required by section a a.this would seem consistent with the requirement in section a a that a person commit a knowing or intentional murder of one individual under section b.the texas court of criminal appeals has long held that under section b,the murder of only one specific individual may be charged the unit of prosecution under section b is a single,named individual 
we nevertheless do not have a definitive construction of section a a from the texas court of criminal appeals as to whether it is proper in a jury charge to permit the crime of multiple murder to be established by alternate means of varying combinations of more than one murder.however,the trial court charge to the jury that convicted paredes allowed such varying combinations.the jury instructions did not require all jurors to agree on whether paredes killed bravo and cain or torres,cain and bravo or torres,or torres and cain or bravo.in reviewing the trial court charge in this case,the texas courts have held that this did not violate paredes due process rights,and we will therefore consider whether united states supreme court decisions have clearly established that this jury charge was beyond constitutional limits on how a state may define the elements of an offense 
we conclude that the texas courts did not unreasonably apply clearly established federal law as determined by the united states supreme court because whether the jury charge at issue went beyond the limits of how a state may define a single offense of multiple murder is not clearly established.indeed,the means by which we are to determine if the process accorded paredes in submitting the question of his guilt to the jury was due is not clearly established.
as discussed above,in schad,arizona law permitted a murder conviction to rest on proof that a defendant murdered either with premeditation or in the course of committing a robbery.the plurality opinion in schad reasoned that the petitioner real challenge is to arizona characterization of murder as a single crime as to which a verdict need not be limited to any one statutory alternative.the petitioner had contended that premeditated murder and felony murder were separate crimes as to which the jury must return separate verdicts.according to the plurality,the issue then,is one of the permissible limits in defining criminal conduct,as reflected in the instructions to jurors applying the definitions,not one of jury unanimity.
the disagreement between the plurality and concurring opinions in schad concerned the reasoning leading to their shared conclusion that the jury instruction was not unconstitutional.while both opinions acknowledged that the ultimate question to be resolved was whether the process that was received was due,the two opinions diverged beyond that point,with no resulting majority view.
in answering whether the due process clause was violated,the plurality opinion began with the understanding that there are limits on a state capacity to define different courses of conduct as merely alternative means of committing a single offense,thereby permitting a defendant conviction without jury agreement as to which course of conduct actually occurred.the plurality reasoned that the practical consequence of the axiomatic requirement of due process that a statute may not forbid conduct in terms so vague that people of common intelligence would be relegated to differing guesses about its meaning is that a
