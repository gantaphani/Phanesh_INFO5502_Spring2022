this is a habeas proceeding brought by a state prisoner against a massachusetts correctional official in an effort to secure relief from a conviction and life sentence for murder.in pursuit of that habeas relief,he advances three discrete claims of constitutional error.after thoughtful consideration,the district court rejected these claims.so do we.
background 
because the petitioner asseverational array includes a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence,we rehearse the background facts in the light most flattering to the jury verdict.see foxworth amand,cir.in the summer of,david and nancy magraw were in the throes of a nasty divorce.the warring spouses and their attorneys arranged to meet at on july,but nancy magraw never arrived.after unsuccessfully attempting to ascertain her whereabouts,the attorneys and her husband the petitioner here were advised of her death.they immediately went to her home in walpole,massachusetts and found her badly bruised body on the living room floor.the police were already at the scene.
an autopsy determined the cause of death to be mechanical asphyxiation due to compression of the neck and perhaps the mouth and nose.following further investigation,a state grand jury indicted the petitioner for the slaying.the petitioner initial trial resulted in his conviction for murder,but that conviction was set aside on appeal.see commonwealth magraw.
at his second trial,the petitioner argued,inter alia,that the victim had died from natural causes and that,in all events,he was not her killer.the jury rejected these contentions and found the petitioner guilty of murder.
the petitioner appealed unsuccessfully to the massachusetts appeals court mac.see commonwealth magraw magraw ii,p,wl,at.the massachusetts supreme judicial court denied his application for leave to seek further appellate review.see commonwealth magraw,table.the petitioner then repaired to the federal district court,seeking a writ of habeas corpus.see.the district court proved inhospitable to the petitioner importunings,see magraw roden magraw iii,wl,at,but issued a certificate of appealability as to three claims,see c.
after limning the framework for habeas relief,we consider the petitioner claims of error sequentially.
ii.the habeas framework 
when as in this case the district court has not undertaken independent factfinding,its decision to grant or deny habeas relief engenders de novo review.see pike guarino,cir.the beacon by which a federal habeas court must steer is the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat,codified at.where,as here,the state court has adjudicated a petitioner federal claims on the merits,the federal court may issue the writ if the proceedings resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.under the aedpa unreasonable application standard,a state court decision is not vulnerable unless it evinces some increment of incorrectness beyond mere error.leftwich maloney,f d,cir accord mccambridge hall,cir en banc.
iii.sufficiency of the evidence 
the petitioner first claim of error posits that the evidence adduced at his trial was insufficient to support his conviction for murder.in his view,the evidence failed to establish either that the victim was murdered or that,if a murder occurred,he was the perpetrator.
the constitutional standard for evidentiary sufficiency is familiar.under clearly established supreme court precedent,a conviction must be sustained if,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson virginia.although this standard exhibits great respect for the jury verdict,an inquiring court must nonetheless avoid evidentiary interpretations and illations that are unreasonable,insupportable,or overly speculative.united states spinney,cir.for present purposes,the question reduces to whether the mac unreasonably applied the jackson standard in determining that the evidence was sufficient to allow a rational jury to conclude both that the victim was murdered and that the petitioner was her killer.
cause of death.
we need not linger long over the sufficiency of the evidence anent the cause of death.the commonwealth introduced considerable evidence that the victim was strangled.this evidence included the testimony of two medical examiners,one of whom was the physician who had performed the autopsy.
the autopsy findings bolstered this opinion testimony.the autopsy showed petechial hemorrhages on the victim face,lungs,heart,and inner eyelids.the physician who performed the autopsy explained that these findings were consistent with rupture upon asphyxiation.similarly,the autopsy revealed hemorrhage around the thyroid cartilage and other tissues in the victim neck.her inner lips were cut,and her tongue had bite marks.the medical witnesses attested that this pattern of injuries was consistent with strangulation.
this is not to say that the evidence was completely.the petitioner proffered a medical expert who opined that the victim died of natural causes.this witness expressed skepticism about the commonwealth theory because the victim corpse lacked some common indicia of manual strangulation,such as bruising in certain neck tissues,suspicious marks on the outside of the neck,and fractured hyoid and cricoid bones.this witness also tried to explain away the petechiae and larynx hemorrhages.the capstone of this testimony was the witness determination that the victim had suffered from chronic and acute inflammation of the heart,which he concluded was the probable cause of her death.
citing this conflicting evidence,the petitioner reminds us that when the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict gives equal or nearly equal circumstantial support to a theory of guilt and a theory of innocence of the crime charged,this court must reverse the conviction,cir quoting united states flores rivera,cir.he argues that the evidence as to cause of death in this case is in equipoise and,thus,that the mac unreasonably applied the jackson standard in allowing the conviction to stand.
this argument is wide of the mark.it fails to recognize that this rule takes hold only after we have drawn all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict.see,morgan dickhaut,cir,cert.denied.in this case,the jury had to choose between the conflicting views of each side expert witnesses,and its verdict indicates that it chose to believe the commonwealth experts.once that choice is factored into the equation,the evidence can not fairly be said to be in equipoise.
nor can we the mac decision to accept the jury choice.see magraw ii,wl,at.resolving conflicts in the evidence is customary fare for jurors and there is nothing unreasonable about what the jurors did here.this is particularly true because the record makes manifest that the commonwealth experts responded directly to the petitioner theory.one acknowledged that the victim heart showed signs of inflammation,but explained that such inflammation is not typically fatal.the other stated flatly that the victim cardiac condition had nothing to do with the cause of death.
that ends this aspect of the matter.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict,it is readily evident that the jury chose to credit the commonwealth amply supported hypothesis.because that choice was well within the jury province,the mac reasonably applied the jackson standard in deeming the evidence sufficient to support a finding that the victim met her death through strangulation.see cavazos smith,per curiam summarily reversing grant of habeas relief and upholding jury choice between competing theories.
identity of the perpetrator.
the petitioner likewise brands the evidence insufficient to show that he killed his wife.in support,he notes that the case against him was entirely circumstantial that no hard evidence linked him to his wife demise and that the prosecution put the time of death at sometime between and,whereas the evidence indicated that he had left his wife home no later than that day 
with this view of the record in mind,the petitioner invokes our decision in.there,we granted habeas relief after deeming circumstantial evidence insufficient to support the conviction.see at.
the principal problem with this argument is that,under jackson,direct evidence is not necessary to sustain a conviction.see,united states,cir.this principle is even more firmly established in connection with the deferential approach to decisionmaking that federal habeas review demands.see,morgan,at leftwich,at hurtado tucker,cir.
what is more,not all circumstantial evidence cases are created equal.the evidence in this case,though circumstantial,is far stronger than the evidence in,especially with respect to motive and opportunity.
to begin,the petitioner has never questioned that he possessed the physical ability to strangle his wife.he also had a powerful motive the couple was embroiled in an acrimonious divorce with hundreds of thousands of dollars on the line.no items were missing from the victim house a fact that tended to exclude robbery as a possible motive.in addition,the petitioner had recently left a rifle on the victim bed an act easily construed as threatening.
furthermore,the petitioner had access to the victim home and there were no signs of forced entry the jury could plausibly have concluded that the petitioner was the last person to have seen the victim alive.witnesses testified that,by his own account,he was with her in her home from roughly to on the morning of the murder.although this does not line up perfectly with the time of death estimated by the medical examiner,estimates are merely estimates and the jury had room to conclude either that the slaying occurred earlier or that the petitioner left later than he claimed here,moreover,a jury reasonably could have rejected both the petitioner claim that his wife had been unharmed when he left her home and his related claim that she had died from natural causes.this is significant because if the jury disbelieves a defendant story,it may legitimately presume that the fabrication was an indicium of his guilt.leftwich,f d at.virtually by definition,any circumstantial evidence case requires some level of conjecture.but a conjecture consistent with the evidence becomes less and less a conjecture,and moves gradually toward proof,as alternative innocent explanations are discarded or made less likely.stewart coalter,cir.so it is here.
the short of it is that the commonwealth presented evidence adequate to show that the victim was murdered that the petitioner had both the means and the motive to commit the murder that he had threatened the victim in the past that he had been with the victim in close proximity to the time of her death and that his explanation of the events was open to question.in conducting its review of a conviction for evidentiary sufficiency,a habeas court may not freely reweigh competing inferences but must accept those reasonable inferences that are most compatible with the jury verdict.see,tash roden,cir.adhering to this principle,we conclude that the mac did not unreasonably apply the jackson standard in rejecting the petitioner claim of evidentiary insufficiency.
iv.spoliation 
at some time after the autopsy,the commonwealth discarded the victim larynx.the petitioner now claims that the loss of this potential source of evidence violated his due process rights.the mac rejected this claim.see magraw ii,wl,at.so did the district court.see magraw iii,wl,at.
the record indicates that the larynx was examined both at the autopsy and at a subsequent meeting involving three state medical examiners.however,the commonwealth failed to preserve the larynx,and it was not to be found when in the defense team asked to examine it in preparation for the petitioner first trial.
it is common ground that,upon request,a criminal defendant has a due process right to review all evidence in the government possession that is material to his guilt or punishment.see brady maryland.but this right would be empty if the government could trump it by the simple expedient of destroying evidence harmful to its theory of the case.a pair of supreme court decisions speak to the dimensions of a defendant rights when requested evidence,formerly in the government possession,is lost,destroyed,or otherwise unavailable.
the first of these bookend decisions is california trombetta.under trombetta,a state violates due process when it fails to preserve irreplaceable evidence possessing exculpatory value that is apparent before its destruction.see id.this precept holds true regardless of why the evidence was destroyed.see united states laurent,cir.
the other bookend decision is arizona youngblood.under youngblood,a different rule obtains when the evidence is merely potentially useful to the defense that is,when its exculpatory value was not apparent before its destruction.see id.at.in that event,the defendant can not prevail on his due process claim unless he establishes that the state acted in bad faith.see id.
fairly read,trombetta and youngblood frame a dichotomy between evidence that is apparently exculpatory and evidence that is no more than potentially useful.see illinois fisher,per curiam olszewski spencer,cir.because the record contains nothing to suggest that the commonwealth acted in bad faith,the petitioner claim of error necessarily turns on which branch of the dichotomy applies here.
we conclude that youngblood is controlling.there,the court considered the import of spoiled semen samples in a rape case in which the rapist identity had been the primary issue at trial.see at.the defendant argued that these samples,if properly preserved or tested earlier,might well have served to exonerate him.see id.at.but the court was chary of imposing upon police an absolute duty to retain and to preserve all material that might be of conceivable evidentiary significance in a particular prosecution.id.at.since the semen samples were no more than potentially exculpatory evidence and there was no evidence that the authorities had acted in bad faith,the court ruled that the defendant due process rights had not been infringed.id.at quoting trombetta,at.
the parallel between youngblood and the case at hand is striking.the petitioner does not point to any frankly exculpatory aspect of the larynx but,rather,argues merely that if his expert had the opportunity to inspect the larynx,he might well have found evidence that the victim was not strangled.so viewed,the the semen samples in youngblood is evidence about which no more can be said than that it could have been subjected to tests,the results of which might have exonerated the defendant.id.at.
despite the obvious similarity between this case and youngblood,the petitioner strives to convince us that logic militates toward a conclusion that the larynx was exculpatory.in support,he notes that the commonwealth experts inspected the larynx at some length and speculates that the commonwealth surely would have introduced the larynx into evidence if that examination tended to establish that the victim was strangled.building on this speculation,he insists that if the larynx was not inculpatory,then it must have been exculpatory.
we do not agree.giving force to this line of reasoning would topple the careful balance constructed by the supreme court decisions in trombetta and youngblood.it will often be the case that evidence no longer available might have been inculpatory,exculpatory,or simply inconclusive.if the state failure to preserve such evidence could give rise to an inference that the evidence was exculpatory,there would be little need for the trombetta youngblood dichotomy.
we add that,if the inference suggested by the petitioner were to prevail,the state would have little choice but to preserve all evidence that might conceivably be useful to the defense.such a result would run directly contrary to the goal of the youngblood court.see at.
if more were needed and we doubt that it is the petitioner thesis that the larynx was most likely exculpatory is not supported by the factual record.a plethora of evidence glea
