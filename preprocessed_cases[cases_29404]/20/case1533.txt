scott smith filed a petition for habeas corpus raising claims of double jeopardy and insufficient evidence.the district court denied smith petition on the ground that smith could have pursued further remedies through the ohio courts but lost that opportunity by failing to comply with the state procedural rules regarding the timing of filing an appeal to the ohio supreme court.the district court rejected smith argument that his procedural default should be excused because of the ineffective assistance of his appellate,his counsel failure to provide him with timely notification of the judgment of the ohio court of the basis that smith had no right to counsel before the ohio supreme court.we disagree and instead conclude that the failure of smith counsel to provide smith with timely notice of the decision of the ohio court of appeals related to the representation on direct appeal of right at the ohio court of appeals,a proceeding during which smith had a right to counsel,and that counsel performance was constitutionally deficient.nevertheless,we affirm the dismissal of smith habeas petition on the ground that smith can not rely on ineffective assistance of counsel to overcome the procedural default of his claims because he has not shown that he would have timely appealed the decision of the ohio court of appeals but for his counsel deficient performance,and thus he can not show that he was prejudiced thereby.

general contours 
a petitioner for a writ of habeas corpus must meet certain procedural requirements to permit review of his habeas claims by a federal court.the petitioner must first exhaust the remedies available in state court by fairly presenting his federal claims to the state courts unexhausted claims will not be reviewed by the federal court.deitz money,cir lott coyle,cir.the exhaustion requirement is satisfied when the highest court in the state in which the petitioner was convicted has been given a full and fair opportunity to rule on the petitioner claims.lott,at internal quotation marks omitted.the federal court will not review claims that were not entertained by the state court either due to the petitioner failure to raise those claims in the state courts while state remedies were available or when the petitioner failure to comply with a state procedural rule prevented the state courts from reaching the merits of the claims.lundgren mitchell,cir.
for noncompliance with a state procedure to serve as a bar to habeas review,the state procedure must satisfy the standards set forth in maupin smith,cir.first,there must be a state procedure in place that the petitioner failed to follow.id.second,the state court must have actually denied consideration of the petitioner claim on the ground of the state procedural default.id.third,the state procedural rule must be an adequate and independent state ground to preclude habeas review.id.this inquiry generally will involve an examination of the legitimate state interests behind the procedural rule in light of the federal interest in considering federal claims.id.a state procedural rule must be firmly established and regularly followed to constitute an adequate basis for foreclosing habeas review.deitz,at quoting ford georgia,d.a state procedural rule is an independent ground when it does not rely on federal law.coleman thompson,d.if these three factors are satisfied,the petitioner can overcome the procedural default by either demonstrat ing cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law,or demonstrat ing that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.id.at.
procedural default failure to file timely notice of appeal to the ohio supreme court 
the district court blanket assertion that the denial of an appeal as untimely is an adequate and independent state ground on which the state can rely to foreclose federal review of a federal constitutional claim,smith,d at,overstates the law of this circuit and is not completely accurate.the determination of whether a state a procedure governing the timing of adequate requires an application of the maupin factors to the specific state procedure invoked and to the operation of that procedure in practice.see,deitz,at hutchison bell,cir maupin,at.in fact,we have applied such an analysis to hold that a state procedural rule governing the timing of filing an appeal was inadequate to bar federal habeas review of claims that were rejected by the state court as untimely under the rule.deitz,at holding that the ohio court of appeals denial of petitioner motion for leave to file a delayed appeal under ohio rule of appellate procedure a was not an adequate basis to preclude habeas review because that rule leaves the decision as to whether to permit a delayed appeal solely within the discretion of the appellate court and thus it is not firmly established and regularly followed internal quotation marks omitted.
smith failed to comply with a state procedural rule by not filing his appeal to the ohio supreme court within the period set forth by ohio supreme court rules,and the ohio supreme court denied his motion for delayed appeal under ohio supreme court rule ii a a we have previously held that denial of review on the basis of rule ii a a is an adequate procedural ground to foreclose federal habeas review.bonilla hurley,cir.therefore,smith procedurally defaulted his double jeopardy and ineffective assistance claims by failing to file a timely notice of the appeal to the ohio supreme court.
overcoming procedural default on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel 
smith asserts that the ineffective assistance of his appellate,his appellate lawyer failure to notify him promptly of the ohio court of appeals decision denying his as cause to overcome the procedural default of his double jeopardy and insufficient evidence claims.constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel can serve as cause to overcome procedural default.deitz,at.to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the sixth amendment,const.amend.vi,a defendant must show both that his counsel performance was deficient,and that his counsel deficient performance was prejudicial.ballard united states,cir citing strickland washington,d.the performance and prejudice elements of strickland are mixed questions of law and fact,and thus we review de novo the district court conclusions on these issues.strickland,at.combs coyle,cir.
there can be a constitutional claim of ineffective assistance of counsel only at a stage of the proceedings when there is a right to counsel under the sixth amendment.coleman,at.we have recently held that there is no right to counsel for ohio appellate rule b filings.lopez wilson,cir en banc.however,smith claim does not relate to his lawyer performance regarding the rule b motion rather,he claims that his lawyer performance regarding her representation of smith during his direct appeal to the ohio court of appeals was deficient because the attorney failed to provide smith timely notice of the outcome of the appeal 
performance 
there is no doubt that there is a constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel during a direct appeal as of right,see,smith robbins,d harbison bell,cir,the stage of the proceedings at which smith claims that his lawyer failed,and that appellate counsel duties do not terminate the moment the court of appeals hands down its decision.because a defendant is entitled to effective assistance of counsel on direct appeal,such an individual must be accorded effective assistance of counsel throughout all phases of that stage of the criminal proceedings.white schotten,cir citation omitted,overruled on other grounds by lopez,at.the court ultimate decision regarding a particular legal proceeding is part of that legal proceeding,and appointed counsel duties in representing a client during that legal proceeding include the duty of informing her client of the outcome of the proceeding.see paris turner,wl,at cir.may,unpublished opinion holding in part that due to counsel delay in informing defendant of the decision on his first appeal of right and counsel fail ure to communicate to his client how to proceed with further appeals,it can not fairly be said that the defendant truly had his first appeal of right,cert.denied,d.the constitution requires that counsel make objectively reasonable choices,and must do so not only during the legal proceeding for which the counsel represents the client,but also after the judicial proceeding has concluded in determining whether an appeal should be filed.roe,d.the supreme court has applied this standard to hold that trial counsel has a constitutional duty to consult with clients about filing an appeal after the trial proceedings have concluded when there is reason to think either that a rational defendant would want to appeal,or that this particular defendant reasonably demonstrated to counsel that he was interested in appealing.id.at.expecting that lower courts will find that in the vast majority of cases counsel had a duty to consult with the defendant about an appeal,id.at.
from counsel function as assistant to the defendant derive the overarching duty to advocate the defendant cause and the more particular duties to consult with the defendant on important decisions and to keep the defendant informed of important developments in the course of the prosecution.strickland,at.emphasis added.because the decision regarding whether to take an appeal is a fundamental decision that the accused has the ultimate authority to make,jones barnes,d,counsel has a duty to inform the accused of the resolution of a proceeding in a timely fashion so that the accused retains his control over the decision to appeal.local rule b of the ohio court of appeals for the ninth district,the court that issued the decision at issue,states that t he clerk of court for each county shall mail copies of journal entries,court notices,and the final decision and journal entry to counsel of record for a party to the appeal at the last known business address of counsel as listed in the court of appeals records.the only way that smith could have learned of the unpublished decision of the ohio court of appeals affirming his conviction was if his counsel notified him.when she failed to do so,smith was without any means of notice of the decision and thus did not and could not know that the day deadline for filing a notice of appeal to the ohio supreme court had started to run.smith did not learn of the decision until he wrote to his counsel on august,and she mailed him a copy of the decision along with her august letter in response,which he did not receive until august,three days before his appeal was due because there was no conceivable benefit to delaying notice to smith of the ohio court of appeals decision,similar to a counsel failure to file an appeal after specifically being instructed to do so by her client,the conduct of smith counsel can not be considered a strategic decision,at.citing rodriquez united states,d,and peguero united states,d.for these reasons,the failure of smith counsel to inform smith of the decision of the ohio court of appeals affirming his conviction within days of the deadline for filing of the appeal can not be deemed objectively reasonable,and thus constitutes constitutionally deficient performance.see id.at.paris,wl,at holding that counsel delayed notice to his client of a decision of the state appellate court constituted ineffective assistance.
claims typically allege specific errors that counsel made in the course of a legal proceeding,at.a defendant can also raise an ineffective assistance
