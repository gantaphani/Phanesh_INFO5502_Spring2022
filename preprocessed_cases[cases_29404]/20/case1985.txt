a dispute between two intoxicated friends turned lethal when cedell davis stabbed donovan also known as david coleman as they watched football together one afternoon.before,during,and after his trial,davis implored his counsel to investigate a number of potential witnesses who would have supported his claim of,including the only sober to the altercation.notwithstanding these pleas,his attorneys never contacted any of the witnesses that davis identified and called no defense witnesses at trial.after making his way through the illinois courts,davis filed a pro se petition for habeas corpus stating a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on his attorneys failure to investigate these witnesses.
the district court rejected his claim as procedurally defaulted and further found that the illinois courts had not unreasonably applied strickland washington,d,when they concluded that his attorneys failure to contact these witnesses was reasonable and that he suffered no prejudice as a result.because we can not provide a meaningful review of davis habeas petition and the illinois courts adjudication of his strickland claim without more information regarding the content of these potential witnesses testimony,we vacate the district court denial of davis habeas petition and remand for an evidentiary hearing on this issue.
on september,davis,coleman,lovell love,and moses perry were watching football at davis apartment in the hilliard homes,a chicago housing authority cha development.davis,coleman,and love were all intoxicated.an altercation between davis and coleman erupted when the latter attempted to use illegal drugs in davis apartment.davis angrily forbade him from doing so,out of concern that the cha would evict him if his guests used drugs.coleman then demanded that davis repay a debt and threatened to have davis ousted from a newspaper sales job with the chicago.davis then demanded that coleman leave his apartment,whereupon the argument quickly escalated into a physical confrontation.
the parties dispute the details of the fight,but they agree that it culminated in davis stabbing coleman once in the leg and once in the chest.at trial,davis argued that he acted out of.according to davis,coleman reached for his waistband in a threatening manner and then stabbed davis with a knife,which prompted davis to grab a sharp knife.davis testified that he feared that coleman,who was years younger,would overpower him.davis stabbed coleman in the leg,but coleman continued to wrestle with davis,attempting to grab davis hand holding the sharp knife.as davis began to fall,he fatally stabbed coleman in the chest.at some point immediately before or immediately after davis stabbed coleman,love awoke from his slumber and attempted to separate the parties.davis instructed love to call and then unsuccessfully attempted to resuscitate coleman.
the state argued that davis could not claim because coleman was unarmed throughout the altercation.it did so despite the fact that a second knife,which davis had used earlier in the day to fix his stereo system,was recovered from the area in which the fight occurred.neither party introduced evidence regarding whose blood or fingerprints were on the knife.the parties also dispute love account of the incident.at trial,the state called love to testify that coleman did not have a knife at the time of stabbing,consistent with love statement to the police after the incident.on,however,love conceded that he probably told davis neighbor,robert williams,immediately after the incident that coleman had attacked davis with a knife.the state also called as a witness a police detective who testified that davis gave a statement after his arrest stating that coleman had been unarmed during the encounter.davis moved to suppress this statement,asserting that he was high and incoherent during the altercation and the interview because he was still under the influence of a binge of alcohol,cocaine,and heroin use.
davis experienced difficulties with his counsel from the outset.the state trial court ultimately replaced assistant public defender david eppenstein,who first represented davis,with public defender charles buchholz.prior to and after his bench trial,davis vigorously objected to his attorneys failure to investigate potential defense witnesses,including perry,the only sober to the altercation.his attorneys presented no witnesses at trial,other than davis,who testified against counsel advice.the court ultimately held that davis had not proved by a preponderance of the evidence and that the state had proved the elements of murder.it also found,however,that coleman use or threatened use of drugs in davis home was a mitigating factor sufficient to establish a sudden and intense passion,which,under illinois law,allows for conviction for murder.see ilcs.the court found davis guilty of murder and sentenced him to years in prison.davis filed a pro se motion for a new trial,arguing ineffective assistance of counsel based on his attorneys failure to investigate the witnesses he identified.the court denied his motion.
davis appealed his conviction,contending that the trial court erred in failing to investigate his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.in its order rejecting his direct appeal,the illinois appellate court acknowledged that p rior to trial,defendant,who at this time was represented by a different assistant public defender than the one who had represented him at the suppression hearing,advised the court that he had seven witnesses,but his attorney would not even consider five of them and made no effort to contact them.in addition,the court found that at sentencing,davis had reminded the court that he had seven witnesses whom his attorney refused to present.the court concluded,without further explanation,that under these circumstances the trial court adequately inquired into the nature of defendant allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel,learned that defense counsel failure to present the evidence or testimony was a result of appropriate trial strategy,and properly found defendant allegations without merit.
davis then filed a pro se petition in state court,raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on his attorneys failure to investigate the potential defense witnesses,whom davis identified and whose proposed testimony he described in his petition.these witnesses included perry,the only sober to the altercation robert williams,who would have testified that love had told him that davis stabbed coleman only after coleman attacked davis with a knife deana bradley,who would have testified to davis intoxicated and confused state when he was taken to the police station following the stabbing,contradicting the interviewing detective testimony that davis was coherent during his interview kimberly oliver,a character witness and resident of davis building who would have testified to coleman propensity for violence sharon pierce,who would have corroborated davis testimony that the second knife,which davis claims coleman used to threaten him,had been used by davis to fix the stereo prior to the fight mckinnely,the cha manager for davis building,who would have testified to coleman destructive and physically abusive nature and certain chicago police officers,who would have testified to a violent fight they had with coleman after they tried to arrest him for assaulting his girlfriend.davis explained that the reason there are no affidavits included in this petition is because the entire complex building where all of my potential witnesses resided which is cha,has been evac u ated and defendant is u nable to locate any of the five witnesses new residency.in addition to seeking relief,davis specifically asked that the court afford him an evidentiary hearing on his claims.
the cook county circuit court rejected davis petition and his strickland claim,stating in full 
i find that under strickland,first of all,the conduct of his counsel did not rise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel that it denied davis his constitutional rights to a fair trial and his constitutional rights under the amendment.
i also find that under the second prong of strickland that his allegations,even if this type of evidence was admitted in,would not change the results.
therefore,i find that there has been no effective assistance of counsel denial in this case 
davis appealed to the illinois appellate court,which also rejected his petition.with respect to his strickland claim,the court stated only defendant petition was subject to dismissal at the first stage of proceedings where his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel was res judicata or otherwise lacking in the requisite support neither court addressed davis request for an evidentiary hearing on his strickland claim.the illinois supreme court summarily denied davis leave to appeal.
davis then filed a pro se habeas petition in federal district court,arguing among other things that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to call the seven potential defense witnesses that he had identified.the court observed that the illinois appellate court had found that davis strickland claim was res judicata and that he had failed to state a cognizable claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.the district court concluded that s ince the illinois rule of res judicata and failure to state a claim are independent and adequate state law grounds,davis claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel are all dismissed with prejudice as procedurally defaulted internal citation omitted.the court nonetheless went on to address the merits of davis strickland claim,concluding 
this court finds that the illinois appellate court ultimate resolution of this issue was not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.this court finds that there is no evidence to otherwise suggest that davis trial counsel was deficient in not tendering the seven potential witnesses.this court also finds no evidence demonstrating how any alleged deficiency by trial counsel prejudiced davis case.
on this basis,the court held that davis could not obtain habeas relief based on his strickland claim.
davis then filed a notice of appeal,which we construed as an application for a certificate of appealability.we granted the certificate of appealability with respect to the questions whether davis had procedurally defaulted his strickland claim and whether the state court resolution of that claim was a reasonable application of strickland.
the first question we must address is whether davis has procedurally defaulted his strickland claim.if the district court correctly concluded that the illinois court reliance on res judicata was an adequate and independent state ground for rejecting the petition,then davis quest for habeas corpus relief is over.see harris reed,d a n adequate and independent finding of procedural default will bar federal habeas review of the federal claim,unless the habeas petitioner can show cause for the default and prejudice attributable thereto,or demonstrate that failure to consider the federal claim will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.internal citation and quotation marks omitted.we review the district court procedural default ruling de novo.hadley holmes,cir.our task here is relatively easy,as the state has conceded on appeal that neither of these grounds constitutes a procedural forfeiture and thus neither precludes federal habeas review of his claim.
w e have repeatedly held that res judicata is not a bar to consideration of claims in a federal habeas action.moore bryant,cir patrasso nelson,cir.in page frank,cir,for example,the state appellate court based its disposition of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim on its conclusion that the merits of the claim had been resolved previously.id.at.we explained that s uch a determination is not a bar to further consideration in a federal habeas action f ederal review is precluded only by procedural forfeitures,not by res judicata concerns.consequently,the district court erred in its determination that the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel was barred by a procedural default.id.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.likewise,we have held that dismissal for failure to state a claim is a decision on the merits.state city of chicago,cir paganis blonstein,cir u nless the judgment provides otherwise,a dismissal for failure to state a claim under rule b is an adjudication on the merits.lee village of river forest,cir.
as the illinois appellate court relied exclusively on these two grounds in rejecting davis strickland claim,his claim is not procedurally defaulted and his federal habeas corpus petition is properly before us.we turn then to the district court alternate ruling on the merits of his claim.
davis seeks habeas corpus relief exclusively on the ground that he was denied his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel when his attorneys failed to investigate any of the seven potential defense witnesses that he identified.our review of davis petition is governed in the first instance by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,which permits a federal court to issue a writ of habeas corpus only if the state court reached a decision on the merits of a claim,and that decision was either contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d see also terry williams taylor,d.under strickland,a defendant alleging ineffective assistance of counsel must show that trial counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,at,and that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.at.strickland first element requires proof that the petitioner trial counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the sixth amendment.id.at.our review of the attorney performance is highly deferential and reflects a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance that is,the defendant must overcome the presumption that,under the circumstances,the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.the second part of the strickland inquiry requires a showing of prejudice,that is,proof that counsel errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial,a trial whose result is reliable.id.at.a reasonable probability of a different result is one sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.id.at.
in davis case,we face a preliminary question.the record as it now stands is devoid of the kind of information about the potential testimony of the defense witnesses that he has identified that we would need in order properly to assess the conclusions of the illinois courts under the strickland standards.see matheney anderson,cir an adequate record is imperative to properly evaluate ineffective assistance claims.see also united states ex rel.hampton leibach,cir t he district court could not assess what impact the exculpatory eyewitnesses likely would have had upon the petitioner trial without hearing their testimony.united states ex rel.cross derobertis,cir when the allegation of the ineffectiveness of counsel centers on a supposed failure to investigate,we can not see how,especially in the context of a habeas proceeding that collaterally attacks the state court conviction,the petitioner obligation can be met without a comprehensive showing as to what the investigation would have produced.in particular,we can not properly review the illinois courts determination that davis did not suffer prejudice due to his counsel failure to investigate these potential witnesses without knowing the content of their testimony.we must decide,therefore,whether davis showed enough to require an evidentiary hearing to flesh out the record,or if the district court was within its discretion to decide the case based solely on what was before it.
the availability of an evidentiary hearing on habeas review is addressed in e,which provides that no such hearing may be held i f the applicant has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in state court proceedings,subject to several narrow exceptions provided in e a and b.davis argues that e does not bar a hearing in his case because he has satisfied its requirement that he develop the factual basis of his strickland claim before the illinois courts.in these circumstances,his eligibility for a hearing in federal court should be determined under standards.the state ignores this issue in its brief on appeal.it contends only that davis claim does not come within e a and b.the supreme court has made clear,however,that b y the terms of its opening clause the statute applies only to prisoners who have failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in state court proceedings.michael wayne williams taylor,d see also id.at.o nly a prisoner who has neglected his rights in state court need satisfy these conditions.hampton,at.thus,we do not apply e a and b unless davis comes within the provision opening is,unless the failure to develop the factual basis of the claim should be attributed to davis.
the supreme court has held that a failure to develop the factual basis of a claim is not established unless there is lack of diligence,or some greater fault,attributable to the prisoner or the prisoner counsel.williams,at.diligence for purposes of the opening clause depends upon whether the prisoner made a reasonable attempt,in light of the information available at the time,to investigate and pursue claims in state court it does not depend upon whether those efforts could have been successful.id.at.boyko parke,cir the court emphasized that the focus ought to be on whether the petitioner was diligent in his efforts to develop the facts,not on whether the facts were discoverable.the court further explained that d iligence will require in the usual case that the prisoner,at a minimum,seek an evidentiary hearing in state court in the manner prescribed by state law.williams,at.
we look first to see if davis was diligent in pursuing his opportunities to develop the necessary facts in the state courts.because this is a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel,the relevant place to look is the state proceeding,as these facts are virtually never in the direct appeal record.in illinois,p petitions are adjudicated through a process set forth by the hearing act,ilcs et west.people gardner,d.in the first stage,the petition must state the gist of a constitutional claim or it will be summarily dismissed at the second stage,the petitioner must make a substantial showing of a constitutional violation to survive dismissal.only then will the petition advance to the third stage,an evidentiary hearing.id.citing people edwards.under the illinois hearing act,a petitioner must attach to his initial petition affidavits,records,or other evidence supporting its allegations or shall state why the same are not attached.ilcs.as to evidentiary hearings,the act provides only that t he court may receive proof by affidavits,depositions,oral testimony,or other evidence.ilcs emphasis added.where a petitioner seeking relief in the illinois courts did not seek an evidentiary hearing or even attempt to raise the issue,however,this court has held that he failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in state court proceedings.harris mcadory,cir.
in his pro se petition,davis requested that the court grant him an evidentiary hearing,described the anticipated content of the testimony of each of the seven witnesses that he had asked his counsel to investigate,and explained that the reason he had not submitted any affidavits from those witnesses was because he was unable to locate them as a result of the cha decision to move tenants away from the building where they lived.davis verified the facts stated in his petition with a sworn affidavit.this explanation for davis difficulty in locating the five witnesses who resided in the hilliard homes is credible in light of the cha difficulties in tracking the tenants displaced during rehabilitation of its properties.see,liam ford,cha oks contract to track,chi.trib,resident leaders and their attorneys have said the cha has not been able to provide proof it is keeping track of residents as the residents are relocated from public housing developments being demolished.see also evan osnos,cha oks preservation of hilliard homes,chi.trib,noting that the hilliard complex is now less than.this explanation is not applicable,of course,to the unnamed chicago police officers or mckinnely,the cha building manager,whom davis also identified as potential witnesses that his attorneys failed to investigate.we have no reason to upset the conclusion of the illinois courts that these latter witnesses were not essential to davis claim.
despite davis submissions and his explanation for the lack of affidavits,the state court did not give him a hearing.davis,however,did all that he could,and we therefore conclude that he is not responsible for failing to develop the factual basis of his claim in state court under e.according to williams,the relevant inquiry is not simply whether the petitioner theoretically could have discovered the evidence while he was still in the state forum,but whether he made appropriate efforts to locate and present that evidence to the state courts.hampton,at citing williams,at.it is not reasonable to characterize davis efforts as less than diligent.davis repeatedly implored his various trial attorneys,the state trial court,and the state court to assist him in obtaining the testimony of these witnesses.as we have previously observed,the requirement under e that a petitioner develop the factual basis of a claim should not bar her from obtaining an evidentiary hearing on habeas corpus review,when the basis of her strickland claim is counsel failure fully to develop the record below.see matheney,at j ustice dictates that a hearing on whether counsel was constitutionally deficient in failing to establish petitioner competency to stand trial can not be barred by counsel failure to secure a hearing and develop a very product of the alleged ineffectiveness.indeed,it would defy logic to deny davis an evidentiary hearing on whether his counsel failure to investigate the witnesses violated strickland on the ground that he did not fully present those witnesses testimony to the state courts.we therefore find e no bar to an evidentiary hearing on davis strickland claim.
even in the absence of this statutory bar,however,davis is not necessarily entitled to an evidentiary hearing.if e does not apply,it is then necessary to evaluate the request for an evidentiary hearing under standards.matheney,at hampton,at.under standards,a federal evidentiary hearing is required only if the petitioner alleges facts which,if proved,would entitle him to relief and the state courts,for reasons beyond the control of the petitioner,never considered the claim in a full and fair hearing.see also townsend sain,d where the facts are in dispute,the federal court in habeas corpus must hold an evidentiary hearing if the habeas applicant did not receive a full and fair evidentiary hearing in a state court,either at time of the trial or in a collateral proceeding,overruled in part by keeney,d.applying this test to davis case,we find that davis was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his strickland claim.
davis has alleged facts which,if proved,would entitle him to habeas corpus relief.accepting the allegations in davis own affidavit,the and impeachment witnesses davis wanted to call would have bolstered his claim a complete defense to conviction,it is important to recall and confirmed his confused state of mind at the time of his arrest and confession.it is undisputed that none of davis three attorneys investigated any of the witnesses that davis identified.indeed,his attorneys never called any defense witnesses.davis only witness was himself,taking the stand against his attorneys advice.
davis objected to his attorneys failure to investigate these witnesses twice before trial,at sentencing,on direct appeal,in his pro se motion,on appeal of the denial of his motion,and,finally,in his pro se habeas petition.at his pretrial hearing,davis informed the court that his attorney,assistant public defender eppenstein,had omitted key witnesses that could be instrumental in his defense.davis also stated t here is a second eye witness by the name of moses that my attorney is aware of that has been presented to the court attention.while the court said it would hold a hearing on this and davis other objections to his counsel conduct,no such hearing ever occurred.rather,the court substituted public defender buchholz as counsel for davis.at trial,davis stated your honor,i had several witnesses buchholz did consider.i had seven i have a reason why i want them here.the court informed davis that the trial would begin that day,but that it would require attorney buchholz to provide an explanation why these people are not coming in or what he has done to get a hold of them or could get ahold of them by the next court date.buchholz never provided such explanation during trial.at sentencing,davis again stated on the issues of witness es,none of the seven i requested in my behalf were located or my public defender did choose to call them.davis then described the testimony that witnesses bradley and williams would have provided.while buchholz acknowledged that davis told him the names of witnesses,his only explanation for his decision not to call them was the conclusory statement that his theory of the case did require the use of those witnesses.he never explained how he knew this without even talking to the witnesses.
the supreme court has made clear that counsel failure to investigate potential defenses may constitute deficient performance under the first prong of strickland.in strickland itself,the court stated that counsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.at.see williams,at.finding deficient performance where counsel failed to conduct an investigation that would have uncovered extensive records graphically describing williams nightmarish childhood.applying strickland,we have repeatedly found that counsel failure to investigate potential witnesses can constitute deficient performance.in washington smith,cir,for example,we found that the wisconsin trial court had unreasonably applied strickland in finding that counsel was not deficient when he investigated only one of the witnesses identified by the defendant and made only efforts to locate that witness,id.at.emphasizing that a failure to investigate can certainly constitute ineffective assistance,we stated that t elling a client,who is in custody awaiting trial,to produce his own witnesses falls painfully short of conducting a reasonable investigation.id.at.h ad the wisconsin court properly applied strickland,it would have concluded that counsel failure to subpoena a witness until the eleventh hour and his failure to try to ascertain what exculpatory evidence new witnesses might have were flagrant examples of ineffective assistance.id.at see also hampton,at hall washington,cir stewart gramley,cir harris reed,cir chambers armontrout,cir en banc.
of course,it is not sufficient for davis to show only that counsel failed to investigate potential witnesses.he must also overcome the presumption that,under the circumstances,the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.strickland,at.internal quotation marks omitted.davis theory at trial was one of.according to davis,coleman had threatened to use drugs in davis apartment,triggering an argument between the two.davis testified that coleman pulled a knife that davis had out,and he charged at davis with it while davis was at the time attempting to call the police on the telephone.fearing that the younger coleman would him,davis stabbed coleman in the leg and,as they wrestled to the ground,again in the chest.the detective who interviewed davis testified that he had not seemed intoxicated when he informed the police that coleman had not wielded a knife during the altercation.at trial,however,davis denied making the statement and claimed that he was incoherent,coming off a binge of cocaine,heroin,and alcohol use.
we consider the relevance of the witnesses that davis identified,and that his counsel failed to investigate,against this backdrop.first,and most troubling,davis attorneys did not investigate moses perry.there were only two eyewitnesses to the fight between davis and coleman love,who was intoxicated and asleep during most of it,and perry,who was sober and awake throughout.davis counsel never contacted perry,despite the state reliance on love as its lead prosecution witness and the obvious importance of this potential testimony to davis argument.second,davis attorneys did not interview williams.love testified,consistent with his statement to the police at the time of davis arrest,that coleman did not have a knife in his hands during the altercation.according to davis,williams would have testified that love told him immediately after the incident that coleman did have a knife in his hands.third,davis counsel did not contact bradley,who allowed davis to wear her shoes when he was arrested because he was so perplexed and high that he was barefoot as he left his apartment.davis identified bradley as the only mutual party that witnessed his condition shortly before he was questioned,and a person who could have testified to davis state of mind when he was arrested.finally,though less significantly,davis counsel did not inquire further regarding the identity of the other witnesses davis identified at the start of trial or make any attempt to investigate their potential testimony.
as davis relied exclusively on a theory of at trial,his counsel failure to interview perry,the only other to the altercation,is inexplicable.furthermore,given that davis defense turned on whether coleman posed a serious whether he wielded a are mystified by his attorneys decision not to contact williams,who would have impeached the state lead witness on this crucial issue,and bradley,who would have testified contrary to the police detective regarding davis mental condition when he informed the police that coleman did not have a knife.counsel sole explanation for his failure to call these witnesses was that his theory of the case did require the use of those witnesses.counsel post hoc explanation for this failure to investigate is entirely inadequate how could a theory of the case that relies on not require the testimony of the only to the altercation who was sober and alert,as well as that of other witnesses who would impeach testimony presented by the state regarding whether the victim was armed 
just as a reviewing court should not second guess the strategic decisions of counsel with the benefit of hindsight,it should also not construct strategic defenses which counsel does not offer.harris,at see also crisp duckworth,counsel should not be allowed to shield his failure to investigate simply by raising claim of trial strategy and tactics.here,neither davis counsel nor the state has presented anything worthy of being called a strategic defense.in hall,we explained that an attorney decision not to present particular witnesses can be strategically sound if it is based on the attorney determination that the testimony the witnesses would give might on balance harm rather than help the defendant.such a determination can rationally be made,however,only after some inquiry or investigation by defense counsel.at internal citation omitted.while t his does not mean that only a strategy will suffice,it does mean that the attorney must look into readily available sources of evidence.id.internal citation omitted.yet davis attorneys never contacted or interviewed perry,williams,or bradley,although davis had named them as defense witnesses and described their potential testimony.
on review,neither the circuit court nor the illinois appellate court provided any explanation as to why this failure did not render the performance of davis lawyers deficient.in the absence of any reasonable explanation for the failure of davis counsel to conduct even a cursory investigation of these witnesses,the state courts finding that davis counsel was not de
