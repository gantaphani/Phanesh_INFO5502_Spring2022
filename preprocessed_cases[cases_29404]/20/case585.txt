opinion of the court 
in this appeal,paul mckernan contends that,because of the egregious advice given him by his counsel,he was deprived of the right to a fair trial before an impartial tribunal.he asserts that the judge in his murder trial was so concerned over what she considered to be slanderous,hurtful,and terrible things written about her on a website that she lost her ability to be impartial.he further asserts that his counsel,unlike any competent counsel,failed to recognize this loss of impartiality and,in doing so,deprived him of the effective assistance of counsel that the constitution guarantees.we agree with the latter argument and,for this reason,we will remand this case to the district court with instructions to grant mckernan petition for a writ of habeas corpus unless within days of the date of remand,the commonwealth of pennsylvania shall decide to retry paul mckernan.
in july,after a bench trial in the philadelphia county court of common pleas,mckernan was convicted of first degree murder in the death of mark gibson.mckernan and gibson were former roommates.mckernan was found to have killed gibson with a baseball bat during an argument outside mckernan home.a witness to the events,joseph rodgers,did not see mckernan strike gibson but did hear a loud thump,after which he saw gibson lying on the ground,bleeding profusely.mckernan told rodgers that he hit gibson in the chest,a statement contradicted by a defense witness who testified that he saw mckernan hit gibson in the head.
a medical examiner testified that gibson died after being hit behind the ear with a blunt instrument,such as an aluminum baseball bat.mckernan admitted to hitting gibson with the bat but claimed that it was in and that gibson head injuries arose from the impact of gibson hitting his head on the curb.the trial judge,judge lisa richette,found mckernan guilty of first degree murder and sentenced him to a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.
on the second day of the bench trial,after the commonwealth had rested but before the defense had started its,judge richette called the victim mother,beatrice gibson,and his brother,david gibson,into her robing room,along with the assistant district attorney,mark gilson,and defense counsel,fred harrison.mckernan was not present for the ensuing meeting,but the meeting was transcribed by the court reporter.
it is difficult to convey in excerpts the inappropriate nature of this lengthy conference.it is even more difficult to understand why defense counsel harrison failed to object to the proceedings or to move for the judge recusal at any point during the conference.harrison himself noted in later testimony that he had never before or since been part of a similar conference.
the judge began the conversation by saying that she was very disturbed after finding a website that the gibsons had created,containing criticism of the judge the judge said to gibson that the site was vicious and unfair and that the judge did not want to hear this case if gibson was unhappy with her the judge had a printed copy of the website and read from portions of it.the website described an ongoing controversy between the judge and the actor charlton heston,who had criticized the judge as being soft on crime and referred to her as let em loose lisa.the judge read a passage from the website stating lisa richette is a bleeding heart judge that often sympathizes with murderers and other violent criminals and gives them light sentences,which the judge characterized as a total lie.the judge then accused the gibsons of writing dreadful,slanderous things about her throughout the website 
despite the judge anger caused by the website,she sought the gibsons approval of her actions in the trial.she characterized the case as a horrible,horrible murder,told the gibsons that she just want ed to make sure that you folks are happy with me,and told the assistant district attorney she did want these people they have already been hurt enough,and i do want them to have this case heard by a judge in whom they have no faith.she told the gibsons,you very fortunate,i tell you what,you have a witness,you have rodgers because,m any of these murders occur with nobody willing to come forward and say i saw it.after being assured by the gibsons that they were satisfied with judge richette presiding over mckernan trial,she concluded,i do want to open the daily news tomorrow and read the usual 
throughout this conversation,mckernan defense counsel stood mute.indeed,it was assistant district attorney gilson who eventually asked mckernan counsel if he was concerned about the conference,to which harrison replied,the only input i have is i guess i need to apprise mckernan of what is going on.after making this statement,harrison did not request that the meeting be recessed,but rather left gilson,the judge,and the gibsons alone together in the robing room while harrison conferred with his client.as harrison left,the judge said,go ahead,i just talk to the family generally.
in harrison absence,david gibson,the victim brother,who was primarily responsible for creating the offending website,offered to allow the judge to red line anything she did not approve of from the site and write her own thoughts about victimology,which david gibson would post in the judge defense.the judge agreed to do so.the judge told gibson that she the judge would have acted similarly if the same events had happened to her son,noting that we all mothers here.she also told gibson that they were very lucky that they were assigned gilson,the assistant district attorney,and that gilson is one of the best in the world.the gibsons then left the judge chambers 
after conferring with mckernan,harrison returned to the robing room and told the judge and gilson that his client had concerns because the website said the judge was a lenient judge and the fact that you mentioned rogers and his testimony,he thinks that you may be constrained to lean over backwards,to prove gibson wrong and the judge would not give mckernan a fair trial.gilson had the same concerns.harrison said that mckernan was unsure what to do harrison indicated that he had advised mckernan to continue before judge richette.he further noted that he and gilson believed what might solve the problem would be if we brought mckernan back and let him talk to you just like you talked to the victim family 
mckernan was brought to the robing room where the judge told him that she had discussed the website with the victim family,that the family was now satisfied with her because they had been assigned gilson,and that the victim family wanted the judge to continue to hear the case she told mckernan that the conversation was not going to influence her thinking at all about this and that she would listen to your side of the case very carefully and reach a verdict.she also stated she would try and pray to god that i be fair to you.although mckernan stated that he believed that the judge could be fair,gilson seemed to sense some doubts in mckernan demeanor,causing him to ask the judge to allow mckernan more time to speak with harrison before continuing the colloquy 
after this second private conversation,harrison stated that he had an opportunity to speak with his client by himself,and indicated to him reiterated to him what your honor has said to him previously.mckernan has indicated to me that he thinks that you can be fair.gilson asked whether anyone had forced mckernan to accept judge richette and if anyone had threatened or promised him anything,to which mckernan replied the bench trial then resumed,with mckernan putting on his defense,after which the judge found mckernan guilty of first degree murder.
mckernan appealed his conviction to the pennsylvania superior court,which affirmed in an unpublished opinion among the grounds of the appeal were the claims that the trial judge erred in failing to recuse herself based on the robing room conference and that harrison was ineffective for failing to move for recusal.the superior court rejected both arguments,finding neither trial court error nor ineffective assistance of counsel on t
