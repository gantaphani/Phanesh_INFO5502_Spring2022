convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death,christopher coleman petitions for a certificate of appealability coa from the district court denial of federal habeas corpus relief.because we find that reasonable jurists could not debate the propriety of the district court decisions regarding coleman multiple alleged constitutional errors,we deny coleman application for a coa.
facts and proceedings 
on the night of december,christopher coleman and two other men were driving together around houston,texas.they stopped on a street and waited.soon after,another car arrived and parked behind the car in which coleman was riding.this second car carried four people the driver,jose luis his girlfriend,elsie prado prado brother,heimar prado hurtado and prado son,danny giraldo.coleman and the two other men got out of their car and approached the second vehicle,where one of coleman companions spoke to hurtado.then,standing close to the passenger side of the car,coleman opened fire on the occupants of the second vehicle.
when police arrived,they found hurtado,and giraldo dead and prado seriously injured.prado survived her injuries and told police that she would never forget the shooter face.she picked coleman picture from a photo spread nine days after the shooting.a week later,police arrested coleman in lawrenceburg,tennessee.
two houston police officers traveled to tennessee to transport coleman back to texas.upon arriving at the lawrenceburg police station,the houston officers read coleman the warnings required by miranda arizona,d,and coleman waived his rights.after roughly three hours of being interviewed by the officers,coleman gave a recorded statement in which he admitted being present when the murders occurred he did not admit to being the actual shooter.
in june,a texas state jury convicted coleman of capital murder and sentenced him to death.the texas court of criminal appeals affirmed coleman conviction and sentence,coleman state.may,and denied his initial state application for a writ of habeas corpus,ex parte coleman.a second state habeas application was dismissed as an abuse of the writ.ex parte coleman.in september,the federal district court denied coleman federal habeas application and refused to grant a coa on any of coleman claims.
ii.standard of review 
coleman filed his federal habeas petition after the effective date of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa.accordingly,the petition is subject to the requirements imposed by aedpa.see lindh murphy,d.under aedpa,coleman must obtain a coa before he can appeal the district court denial of habeas relief.see c.see also cockrell,d u ntil a coa has been issued federal courts of appeals lack jurisdiction to rule on the merits of appeals from habeas petitioners.the district court refused to grant coleman a coa,so coleman only alternative is to petition this court directly for a coa.see c.
to determine whether a coa should be granted requires an overview of the claims in the habeas petition and a general assessment of their merits.summers dretke,cir.coleman must make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,c,such that reasonable jurists would find the district court assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong,slack mcdaniel,d.the question is the debatability of the underlying constitutional claim,not the resolution of that debate,at.
a federal court collateral review of a decision must be consistent with the respect due state courts in our federal system,at.accordingly,a federal court review of a claim adjudicated in a state court is deferential.summers,at.
under d,a federal court can not grant habeas corpus relief with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of that claim either resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
hughes dretke,cir citing d.the statute permits a federal habeas court to assess only the state court decision,not the propriety of its analysis and reasoning.pondexter dretke,cir.furthermore,under aedpa,a determination of a factual issue made by a state court shall be presumed to be correct.e.a federal habeas petitioner has the burden of rebutting this presumption with clear and convincing evidence.hughes,at citing e.a credibility determination by the state habeas court also is afforded deference.guidry dretke,cir.
iii.discussion 
coleman requests a coa on fifteen separate claims.we review the claims in turn.
coleman brings a facial challenge to the texas death penalty system.specifically,coleman points to the fact that special issue in his case,the mitigation special issue does not contain a burden of proof and contends that,therefore,jurors could have believed that he was required to prove mitigation beyond a reasonable doubt.coleman suggests that the ambiguity prevented the jury from properly considering his mitigating evidence in violation of penry johnson,d penry ii.
the district court noted that coleman raised this claim for the first time on a successive state habeas that had been dismissed as an abuse of the writ.accordingly,because the basis of the claim was reasonably available at the time of his first state habeas application,the district court found that the claim was procedurally defaulted and that even if coleman could demonstrate cause for his default he suffered no prejudice.we agree.
under the procedural default doctrine,a federal court may not consider a state prisoner federal habeas claim when the state based its rejection of that claim on an adequate and independent state ground.thacker dretke,cir.quoting martin maxey,cir,cert.denied,d.texas abuse of the writ doctrine is a valid state procedural bar foreclosing federal habeas review.kunkle dretke,cir.furthermore,assuming that coleman could show cause for his default,he is unable to show any resultant prejudice because his challenge necessarily fails n o supreme court or circuit precedent constitutionally requires that texas mitigation special issue be assigned a burden of proof.rowell dretke,cir,cert.denied,d.reasonable jurists could not debate the district court decision to deny habeas relief on this claim.
claims two,three,and four 
for his next three claims,coleman contends that the supreme court decision in bush gore,d,implicitly overrules twenty years of supreme court death penalty jurisprudence,including mccleskey kemp,d,and requires that a hearing be held to determine if the decision to seek the death penalty and the texas clemency process are unconstitutionally infused with racial considerations,in violation of the equal protection clause.the district court concluded that these claims were procedurally defaulted,since they were first raised on a successive state habeas that was dismissed as an abuse of the writ.alternatively,the district court reasoned that bush gore did not announce a rule applicable to criminal cases,and if it did,that teague lane,d,barred its retroactive application to coleman case.
reasonable jurists would not find the district court resolution of these claims debatable.in two unpublished decisions,this court previously has discussed bush gore utter lack of implication in the criminal procedure context.see wyatt dretke.cir unpublished hughes dretke.cir unpublished.we adopt the reasoning of those persuasive opinions and,likewise,conclude that the question is beyond debate.
claim five 
coleman argues that the time limit texas imposes on filing a habeas petition in a capital case is unconstitutional.specifically,coleman complains that he had only days to file a petition,whereas had he been convicted of a crime,he would have had days.see crim.proc,a.despite the position taken,coleman never even alleges injury from the earlier filing deadline.in ferguson estelle,cir,this court held that a habeas petitioner is without standing to raise the potential problems of others.the district court found that coleman lacked standing to contest the filing deadlines,since he filed his petition in the applicable timeframe and suffered no injury.reasonable jurists could not debate the district court determination.
claims six,seven,and eight 
for his next three claims,coleman contends that his statement to the police should have been excluded at his trial,claiming the police beat him and denied him requested counsel.the trial court held a pretrial hearing,during which the police who interviewed coleman testified that he was read the miranda warnings and waived his rights.at this hearing,coleman never claimed that he had requested or been denied counsel.based on the evidence adduced at the hearing,the trial court denied coleman motion to suppress.during the state habeas process,coleman introduced unsworn,unnotarized statements from three individuals who were not present at the interrogation,purportedly in support of his claim.the state habeas court determined that the police who interviewed coleman were credible,implicitly rejecting the credibility of the statements offered by coleman.noting that the offered statements were internally inconsistent and lacked any indicia of reliability,the district court found that coleman had failed to rebut the presumption of correctness afforded the state habeas court factual findings and credibility determinations.
to prove that his confession was coerced and that he was denied requested counsel,coleman offers only the same unsworn statements of three individuals who were not present at the time coleman made his statement to the police.not only were these statements not competent evidence for purposes of defeating the director motion for summary judgment below,see.e,they also,as the district court noted,contradict one another.further,the fact that these statements were not offered to the trial court at the suppression hearing casts doubt on their reliability.coleman has not offered clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption of correctness we afford the state habeas court factual findings under aedpa.reasonable jurists would not find the district court determination debatable.
claim nine 
coleman contends that a at which prado tentatively identified him was impermissibly suggestive.after hearing testimony at a suppression hearing,the trial court found that the did not violate coleman constitutional rights.the state habeas court found that the was not improperly suggestive and that prado identification of coleman was based on her observation of coleman at the time of the murders.the state habeas court also found that the earlier photo spread from which prado identified coleman as the shooter just nine days after the murders was not improperly suggestive.the district court found that coleman failed to rebut the determinations of the state habeas court.additionally,the district court found that prado identification of coleman from the photo spread,standing alone,was sufficient to support the later identification,regardless of any impropriety in the.alternatively,the district court independently found that the and identification were sufficiently reliable.coleman did not challenge the photo spread on federal habeas,thereby acceding to its propriety.
a conviction based on an eyewitness identification at trial following a pretrial identification by photograph will be set aside only if the identification procedure was so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a substantial likelihood of misidentification.herrera collins,cir citing simmons united states,d.a process governs the admissibility of identification evidence first,a court must determine whether the pretrial identification was impermissibly suggestive if it was,then second,a court must determine whether,under the totality of the circumstances,the suggestiveness leads to a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.id.such an analysis is a mixed question of law and fact.livingston johnson,cir.see also sumner mata,d t he ultimate question as to the constitutionality of the pretrial identification procedures is a mixed question of law and fact.accordingly,coleman can not prevail in federal habeas unless he shows that the state court acted contrary to or unreasonably applied supreme court precedent in finding that the was not impermissibly suggestive and that,even if it were,it did not taint prado identification of coleman.the supreme court has identified several factors to help determine the likelihood of misidentification the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the crime scene the witness degree of attention the accuracy of the witness prior description of the criminal the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation and the length of time between the crime and the confrontation.neil biggers,d livingston,at applying biggers.prado was inside the car,in the rear seat,when coleman fired on the car from the passenger side prado said she saw the assailant fire the gun,at one point claimed that she would never forget the shooter face,and described the shooter as having several identifying physical features that coleman does not dispute accurately describe him.furthermore,as the district court noted,nine days after the crime prado was shown a photographic array from which she positively identified coleman,and that array is not challenged on appeal.assuming,without deciding,that the was impermissibly suggestive,coleman has failed to demonstrate that the state habeas court determination that prado identification was not improperly tainted is contrary to or an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent.reasonable jurists could not debate the district court determination.
coleman argues that the trial court should have instructed the jury that he would be ineligible for parole for forty years,in order for them to consider that circumstance in assessing his future dangerousness.alternatively,coleman argues that the equal protection clause is violated by the discretionary ability of texas trial judges to inform the jury of a defendant parole eligibility.the district court noted supreme court precedent indicating that juries need not be informed if a defendant will be eligible for parole,see ramdass angelone,d and nine decisions from this circuit explicitly stating that no such requirement exists,see,miller johnson,cir.for coleman alternative equal protection argument,the district court pointed out that coleman cited no authority on the issue and,therefore,even if his claim were true,relief would be barred by teague principles.given the ample precedent opposing coleman position,see,elizalde dretke,cir,reasonable jurists could not debate whether the district court erred in its determination.
claim eleven 
coleman argues that his due process rights were violated because two trial witnesses testified under duress because the witnesses and their mother had been held as material witnesses.the state habeas court found that the witnesses had been properly held pursuant to texas law to secure their appearance at trial,not to coerce them into testifying favorably for the prosecution.the district court found that coleman offered no evidence to rebut the state habeas court factual determination and that,furthermore,coleman did not allege,much less prove,that the witnesses testified falsely.
coleman argument is wholly conclusory and in no way rebuts the presumption of correctness afforded the state court.furthermore,a review of the trial transcript shows that at least one of the witnesses told the jury that he was testifying unwillingly,thereby quelling coleman credibility concerns reasonable jurists could not debate the district court denial of federal habeas relief on this claim 
claim twelve 
coleman argues that the trial court violated the confrontation clause by refusing to permit coleman attorney to testify during the guilt phase that prado photo spread identification was only tentative.as the district court noted,coleman argument misstates the facts of the case coleman attempted to call his counsel only during the sentencing phase.coleman attorney proffered testimony about a conversation
