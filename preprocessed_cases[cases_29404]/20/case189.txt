this case requires us to decide whether the bureau of prisons bop may,through rulemaking,deny placement in a community corrections center ccc to all prisoners during the first ninety percent of their sentences.the question has divided district court judges in this and other circuits,although the four circuit courts of appeal that have considered the issue have determined that the bop lacks such authority each of the circuit opinions has been accompanied by a dissent.while we are loath to create a circuit split,we respectfully side with the dissenters.the bop may make rules of general applicability to guide the individualized application of its discretion.of course those rules must conform to the strictures of the administrative procedures act,et.apa and,as here,where congress has mandated that the bop consider certain factors in its determination,the rules the bop makes must still leave room for meaningful consideration of the factors.our analysis differs from the other circuits in two important respects.first,our analysis of the statute reveals that the decision whether to transfer an inmate is not constrained by the factors congress lists,although the decision where to transfer an inmate might be.and second,even in initial assignment decisions,the question whether a ccc is appropriate is only a part of the overall decision with which the bop is charged by statute.the remaining options provide opportunity for meaningful individualized consideration,as the statute implies.because the bop is merely setting background rules for the operation of its discretion,the bop can apply its regulation and still comply with the statute.
petitioners richard muniz and victor gonzalez sought writs of habeas corpus pursuant to.each claimed that bop regulations delaying his transfer to a ccc were contrary to the bop statutory mandate and therefore invalid.the district court consolidated the cases,agreed with the petitioners,and granted the petitions.the district court also certified the two cases under b,finding that there was a controlling question of law the legality of the bop regulations as to which there was a substantial ground for difference of opinion the split in the district courts.the bop appealed.
the statute 
the authority to assign and transfer prisoners to places of confinement is conferred on the bop by b the statute affords the bop wide discretion to choose any appropriate and suitable facility,considering five factors.broadly,those are the facility,the offense,the prisoner,any statement of the sentencing court,and any pertinent policy statement issued by the sentencing commission id.in addition,the bop may at any time,having regard for the same matters,direct the transfer of a prisoner from one penal or correctional facility to another.id.
bop policy 
the bop had a longstanding practice of transferring inmates,with some exceptions,to cccs to serve the last six months of a sentence.see goldings winn,cir describing policy before iacaboni united states,d,r ecommendations to community confinement have been made in thousands of cases by hundreds of judges continuously since at least,and in nearly all instances accepted by the bop.for some short sentences,this might mean that the entire sentence was served in community confinement,rather than in a prison or jail.indeed,the bop would sometimes place convicts serving sentences longer than six months in cccs for their entire sentences.see,iacaboni,d at sentence with recommendation for community confinement that was initially adopted by bop before policy change id.at sentence of one year and one day prisoner assigned to ccc on judge recommendation before bop policy change.in doing so,the bop often relied on the recommendation of the sentencing judge.see also monahan winn,d,noting bop policy and practice of adopting judicial recommendations to place nonviolent inmates in such facilities to serve short terms of imprisonment.
in december,the department of justice office of legal counsel issued a memorandum deeming the practice unlawful.see goldings,at.the bop advised its officers that placement in cccs would thenceforth be available only to inmates during the last ten percent of their sentences,however short,regardless of the sentencing judge recommendation.id.
the new policy the policy was predicated on the interaction of b and another statute,c,which provides 
the bureau of prisons shall,to the extent practicable,assure that a prisoner serving a term of imprisonment spends a reasonable part,not to exceed six months,of the last per centum of the term to be served under conditions that will afford the prisoner a reasonable opportunity to adjust to and prepare for the prisoner into the community.
c.the policy was based on the argument that c marked the limits of the bop discretion to use cccs as places of imprisonment,or,in the alternative,that cccs were not penal or correctional facilities within the scope of b at all.see goldings,at.
the new policy was applied to prisoners already sentenced,including both those who had already been placed in a ccc under the old policy,those who had been sentenced and assigned but had not yet reported to begin serving their terms,and those who had been sentenced but not yet assigned.this upset the considered expectations not only the prisoners themselves,but of the judges who had sentenced them.unsurprisingly,the policy generated a flood of lawsuits in the federal district courts.id.at.
we held in goldings that the policy was contrary to the plain meaning of b.see also elwood jeter,cir adopting reasoning and conclusion of goldings.we held the time limits in c did not cabin the discretion afforded to b,but merely marked the limits of the time period for which the bop had to assure to the extent practicable that conditions would be conducive to.we further held that cccs were correctional facilit ies for the purposes of b,and therefore the bop could place prisoners in them.goldings,at.
in the bop promulgated regulations the regulations providing its categorical exercise of discretion for designating inmates to community confinement.a.the bop maintained that it would assign inmates to community confinement only as part of custody and programming,during the last ten percent of the prison sentence being served,not to exceed six months.a thus,the bop has codified as a formal rule the substance of the policy,reaching the same result by relying on the opposite rationale instead of arguing,as previously,that it lacks discretion to make ccc placements before the last ten percent of a sentence,bop now claims its discretion is broad enough to allow it to make a categorical rule preventing such placements.
jurisdiction and mootness 
we regard this case as properly before us,but we pause to address two possible obstacles to our review jurisdiction and mootness.
first,jurisdiction is appropriate because a habeas petition seeking relief from the manner of execution of a sentence is properly brought under.rogers united states,cir habeas petition under appropriate vehicle for challenging failure to designate state prison as place for confinement see also levine,at finding jurisdiction under for habeas challenge to the same bop regulations challenged here.but see richmond scibana,cir challenge to the policy must be pursued as civil litigation under the apa,rather than in habeas under 
second,the issue is not moot.petitioner gonzalez has a predicted release date of august.according to the district court,he would have been eligible for ccc transfer on february,under the old policy,but has been informed that he will not be transferred to a ccc until march.petitioner muniz case is likely moot but that in no way hinders our review because gonzalez case is clearly not moot 
standard of review 
when we are asked to review an agency construction of a statute that it administers,we review that agency interpretation de novo,subject to established principles of deference.chavez,cir citing goldings,at.we afford no deference to the district court grant or denial of habeas relief.healy spencer,cir,cert.denied,d.
we must determine whether the regulations comport with the authority and obligations conveyed by section b.to do so,we must answer two questions.first is the categorical exercise of discretion through rulemaking permissible in this context second if so,does the substance of the regulations comport with statute intent the first question requires us to apply the supreme court decision in lopez davis,d,and decide whether a clear expression of congressional intent forecloses categorical rulemaking.the second question invokes the chevron doctrine of agency deference.the chevron analysis begins with the statute itself.if the regulations conflict with the statute,the regulations are invalid.chevron,nrdc,d if a court,employing traditional tools of statutory construction,ascertains that congress had an intention on the precise question at issue,that intention is the law and must be given effect.if,however,we find the statute ambiguous,we afford significant deference to the agency interpretation,and ask only whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.because the lopez and chevron inquiries are interrelated,we examine the statute only once,with both in mind.we begin with the plain language of the statute.
a.the statute 
the plain language of the statute contains a grant of discretion and a command that the bop consider the five factors when exercising that discretion.the bop shall designate the place of the prisoner imprisonment.b.the bop is provided the discretion to choose any available penal or correctional facility that meets minimum standards of health and habitability that the bureau determines to be appropriate and suitable,considering the five factors id.this is a broad grant of discretion.see thye united states,cir decisions to place a convicted defendant within a particular treatment program or a particular facility are decisions within the sole discretion of the bureau of prisons.internal quotation marks omitted.the statute allows that t he bureau may,at any time,having regard for the same matters,direct the transfer to another facility.id.
the statute also contains a prohibition on favoritism given to prisoners of high social or economic status.the inclusion of one forbidden factor implies that other factors,not among the five,might be considered.if the five factors were exclusive,the prohibition on favoritism would be unnecessary.see levine,at cohen united states,cir section b gives the bop ample room for judgment by listing a set of factors for the bop to consider and leaving to the bop what weight to assign to any particular factor.thye,at holding it well within bureau discretion to consider alienage in placing inmate.the statute is silent on whether one of the five factors,or another factor not listed,may for some prisoners or for some facilities predominate over all others in importance.
applying lopez,we discern no clear expression of congressional intent to foreclose rulemaking.as an initial matter,the transfer provision in b leaves more to the bop discretion than the assignment provision.but moreover,even the assignment provision lacks a clear expression of congressional intent to forbid rulemaking that assists bop in its individualized determinations.
the provision of b governing transfers,properly read,contains language to the provision the supreme court considered in lopez.that case considered e,which provides that the period of custody for some prisoners may be reduced by the bureau of prisons.e b.lopez held that this represented a grant of discretion to the bop,and that the bop could prescribe additional requirements through rulemaking.at.in other words,the bureau thus has the authority,but not the duty to reduce the sentence.id.the transfer provision at issue in this case contains the same permissive language the bureau may at any time,having regard for the same matters,direct the transfer of a prisoner from one penal or correctional facility to another.b.we read this provision differently than our sister circuits.it appears to us that the phrase having regard for the same matters the five factors applies to any transfer that the bureau may direct,but that the statute leaves it to the bop discretion whether to undertake a transfer at all see woodall,at fuentes,dissenting t he b factors need not be considered by the bop until an inmate is actually considered for a transfer,and the bop is not required to consider any inmate for transfer to a ccc until the lesser of six months or ten percent of an inmate sentence remains.yip fed.bureau of prisons,d,the matter does not end there,however.according to our analysis,under lopez even the assignment provision supports the rulemaking at issue here.
the plain language of the statute contains no explicit guidance on whether the bop may facilitate assignments through categorical exercises of discretion.other courts have viewed the conjunctive list of the five factors and the mandatory nature of the language shall designate,considering as foreclosing the possibility of a categorical exercise of discretion.see wedelstedt,at levine,at fults,at woodall,at.we agree,to a point.congress certainly intended that the five factors be considered in the placement decision.but we do not believe that this constitutes the clear expression of congressional intent required by lopez to foreclose all rulemaking whatsoever.even where a statute requires individualized determinations,the decisionmaker has the authority to rely on rulemaking to resolve certain areas of general applicability unless congress clearly expresses an intent to withhold that authority.lopez,at.internal quotation omitted.the statute does require individualized determinations,but if that were sufficient to prevent rulemaking altogether,the statement in lopez would be a paradox,because it implies that some statutes that require individualized determinations nonetheless permit rulemaking.something more must be required of congress,and we see no more here.
because the plain language of the statute does not address the precise question s at issue,we turn to the statute legislative history to help resolve the ambiguity.we provide some context.section,enacted as part of the sentencing reform act of,replaced previous statutory language committing prisoners to the custody of the attorney general and granting him discretion to choose the place of confinement,see also a b,amended by,a old statutory scheme.
the other circuits have found the plain language of the statute dispositive.wedelstedt,at levine,at fults,at woodall,at.consequently,they did not need to pursue other avenues of statutory construction such as legislative history.but each majority opinion does go on to examine the legislative history,a practice this circuit often follows as well.see succar ashcroft,cir approving consideration of legislative history as a check on interpretation of statutory language.each opinion cites the same snippet of the legislative history,either directly or by citing one of the other opinions a part of the senate judiciary committee report that was included with the bill when it was enacted.see levine,at quoting and citing no,reprinted in,woodall,at same see also wedelstedt,at citing levine and woodall for the proposition that the legislative history supports the invalidity of the regulations fults,at finding its view of the plain language bolstered by the statute legislative history as discussed in woodall.we set out the relevant portion of the report in full in the appendix.
we find this passage to be ambiguous when viewed in the light of our construction of the statute plain language.the passage states that the bill follows existing law with regard to assignments and transfers,at,reprinted in.the report does say that in determining the availability or suitability of the facility selected,the bureau is specifically required to consider such factors as the five factors.id.but even this command is tempered the report goes on to say that by listing factors the committee does not intend to restrict or limit the bureau in the exercise of its existing discretion.
this legislative history just as easily supports our reading of the statute nothing in this passage requires consideration of the five factors for every facility or type of facility that is ruled out.nor is there a clear expression of intent to withhold the authority to make rules of general applicability.in any event,we find the legislative history sufficiently ambiguous that we proceed to chevron second step.
are the regulations a reasonable interpretation of b 
finding that congress did not address whether the bop could make a categorical exclusion of one type of facility from its placement decisions,we ask,under the second step of the chevron analysis,whether the regulations are a reasonable interpretation of the statute.at.see also id.at.i f the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.
the regulations are a reasonable interpretation of the mandate delivered to the bop by congress congress has instructed the bop to place each prisoner in an appropriate facility,considering the five factors.in carrying out that responsibility,the bop has made the reasonable determination that some facilities are simply categorically inappropriate for prisoners during the first ninety percent of their sentences or for periods of longer than six months.neither the substance of that decision,nor the method the bop used to codify the decision represents an unreasonable interpretation of b.
the concurring opinion in goldings predicted that e ven if the statutory criteria for making assignments and transfers could be read to guarantee some sort of individualized treatment bop would still have the authority to make a categorical rule excluding some or all ccc placements,except as required for end of sentence placements governed by c.goldings,at howard,concurring.the concurrence relied on lopez,quoting a passage we have already mentioned 
even if a statutory scheme requires individualized determinations the decisionmaker has the authority to rely on rulemaking to resolve certain issues of general applicability unless congress clearly expresses an intent to withhold that authority.lopez,at.at quoting american hosp.ass nlrb,d.bop is not required continually to revisit issues that may be established fairly and efficiently in a single rulemaking proceeding.id.quoting heckler campbell,d.
goldings,at howard,concurring.the first question is whether this statement in lopez applies.it does.
on the one hand,lopez is particularly instructive because it treats the authority of the same agency,the bop,to promulgate regulations under another part of the same statutory scheme,e.on the other hand,that part of the statute lists no factors for consideration.the other circuits to have considered the question find lopez inapplicable to b they reason that b is different because inclusion of the factors as a conjunctive list demonstrates clear congressional intent that all of the factors be considered.wedelstedt,levine,at fults,at woodall,at.as previously discussed,we do not think this is the sort of clear expression of intent required.
the second question is whether the substance of the regulations is an acceptable implementation of the governing statute.it is.two facts compel us to that conclusion.
first,the decision with which the bop is charged in the statute is not the one being made by the regulations.if b were directed solely at the determination of whether a ccc or a traditional prison facility was the right type of facility,we might come to a different result.but requires bop to consider the five factors in a much broader context deciding what specific facility is the right one to house each prisoner.the question whether a ccc is an appropriate facility for any prisoner during the first ninety percent of a term is a subset of that question,and deciding it on a categorical basis is not the same as deciding the final issue of placement on a categorical basis this,then,is nothing more than a background rule of general applicability,promulgated in the interest of efficiency and uniformity,that serves to focus the individualized consideration congress required.this is precisely what lopez envisioned.the bureau is not required continually to revisit issues that may be established fairly and efficiently in a single rulemaking proceeding.lopez,at.quoting heckler,at.
second,the regulations were promulgated with explicit reference to some of the five factors.see community confinement,proposed rule.at discussing facility resources and policy statements of the sentencing commission.the proposed rule also expressly relied on the importance of deterring future crime,which is one of the stated goals of sentencing,as well as b prohibition on treating inmates differently based on wealth or social status.id.at.under the statute,other factors may be considered and may even be dispositive.when experience or common sense shows that the housing decision will be the same no matter what the evidence regarding a particular factor,the bop need not go through the motions of collecting the evidence and noting that the one factor can not outweigh the others in the particular circumstance.wedelstedt,at hartz,dissenting see also levine,at raggi,dissenting the bop might reasonably conclude,as it implicitly did here,that,regardless of an individual prisoner offense,history,and personal characteristics,or any statement made by a sentencing judge,other factors combine to warrant a categorical rule excluding ccc facilities from consideration in general b designations.if congress had limited consideration to only these five factors,or had laid out how the factors ought to be balanced,we would face a different question.pragmatically,we can not imagine that congress intended by its silence to make pointless work for the bop.
we note also that the bop has other policies that deny ccc placement in other circumstances.see federal bureau of prisons,program statement,community corrections center ccc utilization and transfer procedure at,available at loc last visited.those policies restrict the transfer of inmates who are assigned a sex offender or deportable alien public safety factor or who require inpatient medical,psychological,or psychiatric treatment,among others id.these policies are entitled to less deference under chevron,because they are merely interpretive rules and were not promulgated under the apa provisions.but they have nevertheless been upheld.see fox lappin,d,upholding policy of denying transfer to ccc to those with sex offender public safety factor.we believe this is in accordance with the bop ability to make rules of general applicability that guide its decisions.
stepping back,we recognize that the dispute is in part over the bop substantive decision to restrict ccc availability.assuming the decision itself is not contrary to the wishes of congress,the bop will one way or the other be able to carry it out the regulations at least have the advantage of transparency.there is no dispute that,as long as the bop considers the five factors,it has virtually unlimited discretion to place inmates wherever it deems appropriate.the bop could simply consider the five factors in each case but decide,in each case,not to place each inmate in a ccc.at the very least,the regulations have the advantage of being consistent,formal rules of general applicability that can be attacked under the apa for the circumstances of their promulgation and can be discussed as matters of public policy in the elected branches.similarly,even courts striking down the regulations seem to acknowledge that the bop could close the cccs entirely.see levine,at.that such a result would frustrate petitioners desires is obvious.
our holding is a narrow one of statutory interpretation.we emphasize that we express no opinion about the validity of the regulations under the apa.neither do we pass any judgment on the wisdom of the decision to limit ccc placements.we recognize that sentencing discretion is crucial to district court judges,and urge and expect the bop to be sensitive to this in its policymaking.
because the individualized consideration of the five factors mandated by b is directed at the overall placement decision,and because the question
