factual and procedural history 
harrison was convicted of sexual assault after a trial in which six witnesses appeared for the prosecution and three for the defense.the first witness to appear for the prosecution was christina jones jones,the victim of the sexual assault.jones testified that,prior to the sexual assault,she had been friends with harrison for about five months,and that she had previously had sex with harrison on one occasion while using drugs.on july,harrison came to her apartment at about or,told her that he had broken up with his girlfriend,and asked to take a shower.jones told him that he could take a shower and that she was going to be on the couch because she was not feeling well due to the herniated disks in her neck and back.
jones testified that she then fell asleep and that she woke up when harrison sat at the end of the couch wearing only his boxer shorts.next,she stated that harrison engaged in forced sexual intercourse with her and that she heard something pop in her neck during the assault.after harrison was finished,he put on his clothes and left.due to her neck and back pain,jones remained on the couch for several days until her stepfather came to her apartment and found her.
jones further testified that she was in the hospital for approximately four months following the assault.jones also stated that,at the time of trial,she had not regained use of her legs and was living in a nursing home.
on,dennis jones,harrison trial counsel challenged jones testimony.trial counsel asked jones whether she had consensual sex with harrison and another man,tony west,on july.jones responded that west was not at her apartment that night,and that she did not have consensual sex with harrison and west that night.trial counsel then asked jones whether she had told patricia herron herron,an acquaintance and jones drug supplier,that she had consensual sex with harrison and west which got rough and.jones denied ever telling herron about such an encounter,and she stated that she never had consensual sex with harrison and west.
the second witness to testify for the prosecution was jodi cotner,a nurse at baylor university medical center.cotner testified that jones suffered from extreme dehydration,paralysis,and an infection when jones was admitted to the intensive care unit on july.according to cotner testimony,a rape examination was performed,and the results were pretty normal,except for some edema and swollen labia which cotner believed were consistent with sexual assault.the examination did not reveal evidence of seminal fluid or spermatozoa,but cotner stated that she was not surprised that semen was not found due to the passage of time between the rape and jones admission to the hospital.
charles weise,jones stepfather,was the final witness to appear for the prosecution.weise testified that he went to jones apartment on july because he became concerned when he had not heard from jones for several days.weise went to his daughter apartment and discovered her lying on the couch.the prosecution rested its case after weise testimony.
darlene waddle was the first witness to appear on harrison behalf.waddle had known harrison for about ten years,and they had lived together for about years beginning in.waddle related a conversation that she had with jones in the summer of in which jones stated that she was obsessed with harrison.according to waddle testimony,jones became angry and would not speak to her after jones learned that she had lived with harrison.on,waddle admitted to a prior felony conviction for possession of methamphetamine and a prior misdemeanor theft conviction.
herron was the next witness to testify for the defense.she had known harrison for about two or three years and had sold drugs to jones.herron testified that jones told her that she severely injured her back while having rough sex with harrison and another man.herron identified the other man as brian fincher.on,herron conceded that she did not know what happened at jones apartment on july,and that she could not recall when the conversation with jones took place.
at the time of the trial,herron was in jail awaiting sentencing after having pled guilty to a federal drug conspiracy charge.herron also admitted that there were pending state charges relating to possession with the intent to deliver methamphetamine.
dana hobbs was the final defense witness.she testified that she had known harrison for about fourteen years.hobbs stated that jones worked at the eight liners heaven game room in july of.hobbs testified about jones back condition prior to the assault.she stated that,although she had heard that jones had a back injury,she had observed jones cleaning up,doing odd jobs,and running errands.the defense rested after hobbs testimony.
the following day,the jury returned a verdict that harrison was guilty of sexual assault.harrison subsequently appealed to the court of appeals for the tenth district of texas,which affirmed his conviction.see harrison state,slip op.unpublished.harrison did not seek discretionary review from the texas court of criminal appeals.harrison,proceeding pro se,submitted a state application for a writ of habeas corpus which alleged,among other claims,ineffective assistance of counsel.on february,the texas court of criminal appeals denied his application without a written order and without holding a hearing.see ex parte harrison,application.
finding no relief from his conviction for sexual assault in the texas state courts,harrison filed a federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus under,again alleging ineffective assistance of counsel.on august,a magistrate judge issued a report recommending that the petition be denied.over harrison objection to the report,the district court adopted the magistrate judge findings and denied the petition.on january,this court granted a certificate of appealability on the ineffective assistance of counsel claim.
ii.standard of review 
in a habeas appeal,this court reviews the district court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo,applying the same standards to the state court decision as did the district court.coble dretke,cir.
harrison filed his habeas petition after the effective date of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,therefore,aedpa governs this appeal.lindh murphy,d.under aedpa,this court may not grant habeas relief on a claim that a state court has adjudicated on the merits unless the adjudication of the claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.riddle cockrell,cir quoting d internal quotation marks omitted.a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if it relies on legal rules that directly conflict with prior holdings of the supreme court or if it reaches a different conclusion than the supreme court on materially indistinguishable facts.busby dretke,cir citing williams taylor,d.a decision constitutes an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if it is objectively unreasonable.pondexter dretke,cir.the decision of the state court might be incorrect,but still fall below the objectively unreasonable threshold.see neal puckett,cir.this court must presume that a state court findings of fact are correct,and the petitioner has the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.see e.
iii.discussion 
in strickland washington,d,the supreme court articulated the standard for establishing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.harrison must demonstrate both that his counsel performance was deficient and counsel deficient performance prejudiced his defense.id.at.counsel performance is deficient if it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.id.at.judicial scrutiny of counsel performance must be highly deferential.id.at.a reviewing court should make every effort to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight and to evaluate the conduct from counsel perspective at the time.id.further,strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable and strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation.id.at.
harrison must demonstrate prejudice in addition to deficient performance.deficient performance results in prejudice when there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.id.at.
deficient performance 
harrison alleges that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by not interviewing west pretrial and by not calling west as a witness at trial harrison avers that west would have testified that he,harrison,and jones had consensual sex on july.according to harrison,west made it known that he was readily available and willing to testify on behalf of harrison.harrison maintains that he advised trial counsel,verbally and in writing,in october and november of to contact west harrison also contends that he told trial counsel how to contact west,for he informed trial counsel that west was incarcerated in the dallas county jail.trial counsel,harrison alleges,never interviewed west or issued a subpoena for west to appear at trial.
if harrison characterization of west potential testimony is accurate and west was willing to so testify,then harrison has a strong argument that trial counsel failure to interview west,a potential eyewitness,and call him as a witness at trial fell below the standard of a reasonably competent attorney.it is beyond cavil that an attorney must engage in a reasonable amount of pretrial investigation and,at a minimum,interview potential witnesses and make an independent investigation of the facts and circumstances in the case.bryant scott,cir internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.in bryant,this court held that trial counsel failure to interview eyewitnesses to the crime was constitutionally deficient representation.id.at.in this case,trial counsel failure to interview west,a potential eyewitness,raises serious concerns about whether counsel provided constitutionally adequate representation.see soffar dretke,cir holding that counsel failure to interview the only known eyewitness to the crime charged amounted to deficient performance under strickland see also anderson johnson,cir holding that counsel failure to investigate an eyewitness constituted constitutionally deficient representation.
the district court reasoned,however,that harrison could not satisfy strickland deficient performance prong because west testimony,assuming that it would have been consistent with harrison representations,would have been cumulative of herron testimony.see united states harris,cir this court has previously refused to allow the omission of cumulative testimony to amount to ineffective assistance of counsel.the district court also determined that trial counsel failure to have west appear as a witness at trial may have been a strategic choice,for trial counsel may well have determined that in light of all the credibility issues at play it would not have advanced the defense to have presented the testimony of a person then confined at the dallas county jail.see murray maggio,cir observing the strong presumption that counsel decision not to call a witness is strategic see also martinez quarterman,cir noting that counsel strategic choices are entitled to deference.
contrary to the district court conclusion,west potential testimony would not have been cumulative of herron testimony.the defense theory was that jones injured her back while having consensual,albeit rough,sex with harrison and west on july.the defense called herron in an attempt to impeach jones testimony in which she stated that she never told herron that she had sex with harrison and west.herron testified that jones told her that jones had rough sex with harrison and brian fincher.herron could not recall when the conversation took place and she conceded that she had no idea what happened at jones apartment on the night of july.
admittedly,there is some overlap between herron testimony and west proposed testimony,but herron impeachment testimony is no substitute for west proposed eyewitness testimony.herron could not corroborate the defense theory that west was the other man,for she identified fincher as the third participant.furthermore,herron testimony suggested that the sex may not have been consensual another important difference between herron testimony and west proposed testimony is that herron,unlike west,could not testify that jones and harrison had consensual sex on the night of july.west proposed testimony can not be dismissed as cumulative because the difference between his testimony and herron testimony goes to the heart of whether a sexual assault occurred on july,as the state charged.see washington smith,cir holding that additional alibi witness testimony was not cumulative where the alibi witness who did testify had no direct knowledge of the defendant whereabouts at the time of the robbery see also stewart wolfenbarger,cir finding additional alibi testimony was not cumulative where it would have added a great deal of substance and credibility to the defendant alibi defense.
we are equally unpersuaded by the district court reasoning that trial counsel made a strategic choice by not calling west as a witness at trial.first,strickland counsels that strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable and strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation.at.emphasis added.in anderson,we acknowledged that a lack of credibility might support a strategic decision not to call a witness to testify,but we also explained that a witness character flaws can not support a failure to investigate.at.if counsel does not speak to a witness,then counsel is to assess his credibility or persuasiveness as a witness.see also griffin warden,cir holding that counsel did not make a strategic choice not to call a witness when counsel did not talk to that witness.in this case,harrison alleges that trial counsel did not interview west.if this allegation is true,then,under anderson,trial counsel did not make a strategic choice when he did not call west to testify at trial.
second,the district court supposition that trial counsel did not have west testify at trial because trial counsel may well have determined that in light of all the credibility issues at play it would not have advanced the defense to have presented the testimony of a person then confined at the dallas county jail is speculation unsupported by the record.trial counsel called two witnesses with blemished criminal records during the trial.waddle had a prior felony conviction for possession of methamphetamine and a prior misdemeanor theft conviction,and herron was awaiting sentencing after having pled guilty to federal drug conspiracy charges given the fact that trial counsel called two witnesses with criminal histories,one of whom was in jail awaiting sentencing,the district court erred in speculating that trial counsel excluded west from the witness stand because he was incarcerated in the dallas county jail.
if harrison allegations are true,then he has a strong argument that,under stri
