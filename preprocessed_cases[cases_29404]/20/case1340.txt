timothy hoffner appeals the district court order denying his petition for habeas corpus.hoffner was convicted of aggravated murder,aggravated kidnapping,and robbery and was sentenced to death.in his petition,he claims that the trial court improperly weighed aggravating and mitigating circumstances,that he received ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel,that statements were admitted at trial in violation of his miranda rights,and that the cumulative effect of the errors at trial violated his constitutional rights.for the reasons set forth below,we now affirm the district court decision and deny hoffner habeas petition.
the ohio supreme court summarized the facts of the case as follows 
on september,timothy hoffner,and archie dixon kidnapped and robbed christopher hammer,then drove hammer to a remote area where they buried him alive in a shallow grave and left him to die.
hoffner was convicted of the aggravated murder,aggravated robbery,and kidnapping of hammer,and he was sentenced to death.
hoffner and hammer met in august.for a short period of time in,hoffner,hammer,and dixon lived at the toledo home of kirsten wilkerson,dixon girlfriend.
in early september,michael elting,a friend of hammer,hoffner,and dixon,borrowed hammer car,a dodge daytona,to go to the movies with hoffner and dixon.according to elting,hoffner and dixon discussed how to get rid of hammer car,and hoffner said that he knew a place where he could take the car,presumably after hammer was killed.approximately one month after hammer disappearance,elting discovered hammer car at a used car lot in toledo.
on the afternoon of september,dixon told wilkerson that he and hoffner were going to get hammer tonight.wilkerson understood this to mean that dixon and hoffner were going to kill hammer.
in the early morning of september,hoffner,dixon,and hammer went to wilkerson house.once there,hoffner and dixon attacked hammer.hoffner restrained hammer in a headlock while dixon beat him.hoffner tried to break hammer neck,and dixon struck hammer in the head with a wine bottle.hoffner and dixon then tied hammer to a ladder,and dixon went through hammer wallet,taking out his money,birth certificate,and social security card.then hoffner and dixon discussed how they should dispose of hammer body.
while hammer remained tied to the ladder,hoffner and dixon left wilkerson house to dig a grave.hoffner and dixon returned to wilkerson house and they,along with wilkerson,drove hammer,blindfolded,to the gravesite in hammer car.wilkerson stayed at the car while hoffner and dixon walked hammer into the woods,where they permitted hammer to smoke a cigarette.then they gagged and again blindfolded hammer,tied his hands and feet behind his back,grabbed him by his arms and legs,and dropped him into the grave,still alive.at one point,hammer was able to remove the gag from his mouth and free one of his legs.hoffner jumped into the grave and placed his foot over hammer mouth when hammer yelled for help.hoffner and dixon then held hammer down and covered him with dirt.after hammer was completely buried,hoffner and dixon walked back and forth across the grave,packing down the dirt.hoffner,dixon,and wilkerson then returned to wilkerson house in hammer car.
after killing hammer,hoffner and dixon carried out their plan to sell his car.on september,dixon obtained a state of ohio identification card with his photograph but in hammer name.on september,hoffner and dixon went to the automobile title bureau,where dixon obtained a duplicate certificate of title for hammer car using the fraudulent id card.hoffner and dixon then took hammer car to a used car lot,where they sold the car for.
by november,police officers investigating hammer disappearance had located his dodge daytona at a used car lot in toledo,had confirmed its unauthorized sale on september,and had identified dixon as the prime suspect in the vehicle transaction.on november,police went to wilkerson home and arrested dixon for forgery.the police also executed a search warrant at wilkerson home.during the search,police questioned hoffner regarding hammer disappearance.hoffner denied involvement but made statements implicating dixon.hoffner agreed to accompany police detectives downtown to make a statement.on the way to the station,hoffner told police that dixon had shown him the location of hammer body,and he then led police to the gravesite.
once at the station,police read hoffner his miranda rights,but hoffner was not placed under arrest.hoffner waived his rights and gave a taped account of dixon involvement in hammer murder.after hammer body was discovered,dixon confessed to hammer murder and also implicated hoffner.police subsequently arrested hoffner on november at his mother home.at police headquarters,detectives read hoffner his miranda rights,and hoffner signed a form.hoffner then gave a taped statement confessing to his part in hammer death.
cynthia beisser,deputy coroner of lucas county,performed an autopsy and concluded that hammer had died of asphyxiation.according to beisser,hammer likely died within five minutes of being buried alive,and he might have remained conscious during the first two to three minutes.
a grand jury indicted hoffner,dixon,and wilkerson for the aggravated murder,kidnapping,and aggravated robbery of hammer.hoffner was indicted on three counts of aggravated murder.count one of the indictment charged hoffner with aggravated murder involving prior calculation and design.ohio ann.a.count two charged hoffner with aggravated murder while committing kidnapping,and count three charged hoffner with aggravated murder while committing aggravated robbery,both pursuant to ohio ann.b.hoffner was additionally indicted for kidnapping in count four,aggravated robbery in count five,and three counts of forgery in counts six,seven,and eight.
the three counts of aggravated murder each contained two ohio ann.a death penalty specifications.the first specification charged aggravated murder during a kidnapping,and the second charged aggravated murder during an aggravated robbery.
the jury convicted hoffner as charged and recommended the death penalty.thereafter,the trial court sentenced hoffner to death for the murder,to ten to years each for kidnapping and aggravated robbery,and to months for each forgery charge.on appeal,the court of appeals affirmed hoffner convictions and death sentence.

after considering the thirteen propositions of law hoffner raised on direct appeal,the supreme court of ohio rejected each of them and affirmed hoffner conviction and sentence on july.id.at.the supreme court denied hoffner petition for a writ of certiorari.hoffner ohio.while his direct appeal was pending,hoffner also sought state relief under ohio revised code on three grounds.his petition was dismissed by the trial court,and the dismissal was affirmed by the ohio court of appeals on september.state hoffner hoffner iii,no,wl ohio.the ohio supreme court denied leave to appeal.state hoffner,ohio.on june,hoffner applied to reopen his appeal under ohio appellate rule b in order to assert a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.as hoffner filed the petition roughly five years after his conviction became after the window provided for by statute,see ohio app.b the ohio court of appeals recognized that the petition was untimely but nonetheless denied the petition on the merits.state hofner hoffner iv,no,slip op.at,ohio.the ohio supreme court affirmed the lower court judgment but did so on untimeliness grounds only.state hoffner hofner v,ohio.

on appeal,hoffner failed to brief four of the ten claims for which the district court granted a coa and therefore has abandoned them.see fed.a a geboy brigano,cir.thus,we will address the six issues that hoffner has preserved 
whether hoffner death sentence violated his due process rights because it was based on the consideration of improper aggravating circumstances.
whether trial counsel performance at the guilt phase of trial was constitutionally ineffective.
whether trial counsel performance at the penalty phase of trial was constitutionally ineffective.
whether appellate counsel performance was constitutionally ineffective.
whether hoffner conviction is invalid because it was based on statements obtained in violation of his miranda rights.
whether the cumulative effect of the errors in this case violated hoffner constitutional rights.
the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,et,governs all habeas petitions filed after april.see lindh murphy.aedpa provides 
an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
a state court adjudication is contrary to supreme court precedent under d if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court confronts facts that are materially indistinguishable from a relevant supreme court precedent and arrives at an opposite result.williams taylor.a state court makes an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent under d if the state court identifies the correct governing legal rule from the supreme court cases but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular case or if the court unreasonably extends or refuses to extend existing supreme court precedent to new factual situations where it should apply.id.at.under aedpa,the question for this court to answer is not whether a federal court believes the state court determination was incorrect but whether that determination was substantially higher threshold.schriro landrigan.factual findings made by state courts based on the trial record are entitled to a presumption of correctness that may be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.e warren smith,cir.
however,federal courts need not review every point of error raised by a habeas petitioner.when a state prisoner has defaulted his federal claims in state court pursuant to an independent and adequate state procedural rule,federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice or demonstrate that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.coleman thompson.in this circuit,to determine whether a federal claim has been procedurally defaulted,we apply the test initially laid out in maupin smith,cir 
first,the court must determine that there is a state procedural rule that is applicable to the petitioner claim and that the petitioner failed to comply with the rule second,the court must decide whether the state courts actually enforced the state procedural sanction third,the court must decide whether the state procedural forfeiture is an adequate and independent state ground on which the state can rely to foreclose review of a federal constitutional claim 
jacobs mohr,cir quoting maupin,at.if the state procedural rule was not complied with and that rule was an adequate and independent ground for default,we may still excuse the default if the petitioner can demonstrate that there was cause for him not to follow the procedural rule and that he was actually prejudiced by the alleged constitutional error.maupin,at.
hoffner claims that the trial court violated his due process rights by improperly weighing the statutory aggravating factors of his crime.this argument has two.first,hoffner argues that the trial court wrongly considered the nature and circumstances of the offense to be an aggravating factor.second,hoffner argues that the trial court considered various elements of the charged statutory aggravating factor as separate aggravating factors,thus multiplying the value of what should have been one factor.
i t is not the province of a federal habeas court to reexamine determinations on questions.estelle mcguire.errors may warrant habeas relief if the errors rise for some other reason to the level of a denial of rights protected by the united states constitution.barclay florida.nonetheless,if a trial court considers unconstitutional aggravating factors,the supreme court has held that this error can be cured by the state appellate court independently reweighing aggravating and mitigating factors and reaching a sentence without the consideration of the factors found impermissible at the trial level.see lundgren mitchell,cir citing clemons mississippi,ohio ann.a the supreme court shall review and independently weigh all of the facts and consider the offense and the offender to determine whether the aggravating circumstances the offender was found guilty of committing outweigh the mitigating factors in the case,and whether the sentence of death is appropriate.
in support of his claim that the trial court improperly considered the nature and circumstances of his crime,hoffner points to various parts of the sentencing opinion where the trial judge used several inflammatory adjectives to describe hoffner conduct.for example,the trial court described hoffner crime as graphic,macabre,sinister,and depraved.state.hoffner hoffner i,no,slip op.at.com.pl.june.further,hoffner claims,the trial court explicitly considered impermissible factors when it allegedly explained that its job was to weigh the relative heinousness of his crime.appellant br.at.he claims that the trial judge conclusion is evidence of improper consideration 
sympathy for the defendant mistreatment as a child,however,can in no way excuse the depraved,violent and calculated nature of the acts he committed against christopher hammer.it was,and is the conclusion of this court that the aggravating circumstances so clearly demonstrated by the evidence at trial,far,far outweighed the modest cumulative mitigating circumstances presented in this case and during the penalty phase.
hoffner i,slip op.at.hoffner claims that the trial court actions violated his due process rights under the fourteenth amendment and hicks oklahoma.
hoffner properly preserved this claim by raising it on direct appeal,but the ohio supreme court found the claim to be meritless.the court noted that the trial court never referred to the nature and circumstances of the crime as an aggravating circumstance and that the sentencing opinion reflect ed the trial court understanding of the difference between statutory aggravating circumstances and facts describing the nature and circumstances of the offense.hoffner ii,at.further,the court explained that the trial court can evaluate the nature and circumstances in order to conclude that no mitigating feature can be extracted.id.at quoting state steffen,d,ohio internal quotation marks omitted.the court also conducted an extensive review of the evidence,independently weighed the aggravating and mitigating factors,and concluded that the death penalty was appropriate.id.at.
we agree with the district court that there was no violation,or unreasonable application,of clearly established supreme court law.as noted above,a violation of state law is not grounds for habeas relief unless it rises to the level of a due process deprivation.estelle,at.we find no such deprivation we agree with the ohio supreme court that no violation of state law occurred,let alone one of such magnitude as to violate due process.furthermore,the ohio supreme court independent reweighing of the relevant evidence cured any error that the trial court may have committed.hoffner has made no showing of fundamental unfairness,and we affirm the district court denial of relief on this.
hoffner also argues that the trial court improperly multiplied the statutory aggravating circumstances at sentencing.hoffner was charged in the indictment with three separate counts of with prior calculation and design,murder in the course of kidnapping,and murder in the course of aggravated robbery.for each count,the indictment provided two death penalty specifications that the offense was committed while committing kidnapping and that the offense was committed while committing aggravated robbery,both pursuant to ohio ann.a.the specification requires that,in addition to proving that the murder was committed in the course of an enumerated violent felony,the government must also prove that either the offender was the principal offender in the commission of the aggravated murder or,if not the principal offender,committed the aggravated murder with prior calculation and design.ohio ann.a.the jury found hoffner guilty of all three counts of murder and of both specifications for each count.however,the trial court held that the two counts of murder during the commission of kidnapping and aggravated robbery constituted allied offenses of similar import under ohio ann.a and sentenced hoffner only for murder with prior calculation and design.
hoffner argues that,under ohio law,the court could not have used the kidnapping and aggravated robbery as separate aggravating circumstances because they both fall under the same statutory provision.see ohio ann.a.as evidence that the aggravating circumstances were multiplied,hoffner points to the trial court sentencing opinion,where it wrote that it was established beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravated murder was committed by hoffner in the commission of both a kidnapping and an aggravated robbery,and that he also committed the aggravated murder with prior calculation and design.hoffner i,slip op.at.in the next sentence,however,the court writes that t hese findings,of course,merely reiterate the jury verdicts.id.hoffner also points out that the trial court referred to the death penalty specification under subsection a as aggravating circumstances throughout the opinion.hoffner cites to state green,ohio,in which the ohio supreme court held that it was improper for the trial court to have consider ed as two separate and distinct aggravating circumstances the defendant involvement in committing both an aggravating robbery and a kidnapping when the indictment had charged a single death specification of murder while committing or attempting to commit kidnapping or aggravated robbery.
the district court rejected this on the grounds that it is a violation of state,not federal,law and that even if the trial court alleged error rose to the level of a due process violation,the state supreme court cured it through independent reweighing.hoffner vii,slip op.at.we agree.in the first instance,as the ohio supreme court held,see hoffner ii,at,two separate death penalty specifications were listed in the indictment,rather than just one as in green.thus,it was not improper for the trial court to refer to aggravating circumstances.the trial court conjunctive reference to hoffner prior calculation and design in its sentencing opinion was in reference to the jury verdict finding such facts beyond a reasonable doubt.but even if this were error,the ohio supreme court conducted a detailed independent review of the evidence presented at the penalty phase.it found that the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt the two a aggravating circumstances and concluded that hoffner collective mitigation evidence is relatively modest when compared with the aggravating circumstances.hoffner ii,at,emphasis added.hoffner does not object to the ohio supreme court reweighing of the evidence.we therefore affirm the district court denial of habeas on this.
hoffner second claim is that his trial counsel performed ineffectively at the guilt phase of trial by failing to argue that dixon,not hoffner,was the principal offender and failing to move to suppress hoffner taped confession on the ground that he had previously requested counsel.hoffner raised both of these arguments for the first time in his state petition see hoffner iii,wl,at third and sixth.because the claims did not involve evidence outside of the record and therefore could have been raised on direct appeal,the court of appeals found both to be barred by res judicata.id.at citing state cole,syllabus ohio.the supreme court of ohio denied review.
under ohio doctrine of res judicata,
a final judgment of conviction bars the convicted defendant from raising and litigating in any proceeding,except an appeal from that judgment,any defense or any claimed lack of due process that was raised or could have been raised by the defendant at the trial which resulted in that judgment of conviction or on an appeal from that judgment.
state perry,ohio.in cole,at,the ohio supreme court held that res judicata is a proper basis upon which to dismiss an claim in a petition for relief where a defendant who is represented by new counsel on direct appeal fails to raise that claim and the basis for that claim could fairly be determined without examining evidence outside the record.fautenberry mitchell,cir.thus,in fautenberry we held that ohio application of res judicata pursuant to cole is an actually enforced,adequate and independent state ground upon which the ohio state courts consistently refuse to review the merits of a defendant claims.id.the district court followed this rule and held that this claim was procedurally defaulted.we agree.
the first three prongs of the maupin test for procedural default are all met in this instance.as discussed,hoffner failed to raise these subclaims on direct appeal,thus failing to comply with a state procedural rule the court of appeals enforced the rule by holding the claim barred by res judicata and res judicata is an adequate and independent state ground on which to foreclose federal review.see maupin,at.
in his reply brief,however,hoffner offers two reasons why his claim is not procedurally defaulted.first,he claims that the state court improperly applied res judicata because his claim was,in fact,based on evidence outside the record.see hill mitchell,cir t he ohio court of appeals improper application of its res judicata rule does not bar our review of a federal habeas claim.hoffner outside evidence consists of an expert affidavit concerning the standards of representation in a capital case.reply br.at.in order to excuse the procedural default,the proffered affidavit must have been required,in addition to the original record,to bring hoffner claim for ineffective assistance on direct appeal.see state gibson,ohio citing ohio ann.yet,nothing in the brought here suggests that the affidavit was necessary and that they could not have been brought without it.thus,procedural default is not excused on this ground.
hoffner also argues that procedural default should be excused because his appellate counsel deficient performance in not raising these claims on direct appeal constitutes cause and prejudice under the fourth part of the maupin test see maupin,at once the court determines that the first three parts of the test have been met,then the petitioner must demonstrate under sykes that there was cause for him to not follow the procedural rule and that he was actually prejudiced by the alleged constitutional error.citing wainwright sykes,additional citations omitted.ineffective assistance of appellate counsel can constitute cause to excuse a procedural default.see murray carrier,howard bouchard,cir.
appellate counsel failure to raise these claims does not establish cause to excuse the default,however,because the underlying claims are meritless.to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of trial or appellate counsel,see smith robbins,hoffner must show that his counsel performance was deficient and that the deficiency prejudiced his defense.strickland washington.to prove deficiency,hoffner must show that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.id.at.prejudice can be shown by proving that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.id.at.
hoffner first trial counsel were deficient for failing to argue that hoffner was not a principal meritless because,as the district court found,ample evidence showed that hoffner and dixon fully collaborated in burying hammer alive.hoffner vii,slip op.at.to be eligible for the death penalty under ohio ann.a as the principal offender,the defendant must have been the actual killer.state taylor,ohio citing state penix,ohio.substantial evidence at trial shows that hoffner was intimately involved in the planning and execution of the murder.hoffner and dixon discussed killing hammer and selling his car well in advance of the murder.hoffner held hammer in a headlock and tried to break his neck while dixon beat him.while dixon was burying hammer,hoffner jumped into the grave and put his foot on hammer mouth to prevent hammer from crying for help.
the record is replete with evidence that hoffner was the actual killer of hammer.hoffner arguments that,because hoffner followed dixon,only dixon could have been the principal offender are irrelevant because,under ohio law,two defendants can be considered principal offenders when they act in concert to cause the death of another.see state franks,wl,at ohio,citing state keene,wl,at ohio.especially considering the deference given to counsel tactical choices,it is clear that counsel decision not to argue that hoffner was not a principal offender was not deficient.furthermore,trial counsel failure to raise this argument could not have been prejudicial because,under ohio ann.a,a offender is eligible for the death penalty if he acted with prior calculation and design.hoffner does not argue that counsel were ineffective for failing to argue that he did not act with prior calculation and design,and the record clearly supports the jury finding that his actions were premeditated.we affirm the district court holding that this was procedurally defaulted.
hoffner second is that trial counsel were constitutionally deficient for failing to move to suppress his taped confession under minnick mississippi,on the ground that hoffner had requested counsel before giving the confession.the only evidence hoffner offers in support of this claim is his own affidavit,which states that he had requested an attorney before being interrogated and that trial counsel response was,in effect,that the denial of my right to an attorney prior to the interrogation did matter.this affidavit carries little weight,especially in light of the copious evidence in the record to contradict it.the transcripts of hoffner statements to the police reveal that he was advised of his miranda rights,voluntarily waived those rights,and chose not to request an attorney prior to interrogation.at the suppression hearing before the trial court,the investigating officers both testified that hoffner never requested to speak to an attorney.counsel decision not to pursue suppression of hoffner confession was not unreasonable,nor was appellate counsel decision not to argue trial counsel ineffectiveness on these grounds.we affirm the district court denial of this on the basis that it was procedurally defaulted.
hoffner third ground for assistance of counsel at the penalty based on three allegations.first,hoffner claims that trial counsel deficiently advised him to show no emotion throughout the proceedings,thus dehumanizing him in the jurors eyes.second,hoffner argues that counsel ceased functioning as his advocate at closing argument when counsel cast hoffner in a negative light instead of arguing for mitigation.third,hoffner claims that counsel were deficient in failing to object to the court response to a jury question requesting the definition of a preponderance.we find that the state courts resolutions of the first two claims were not an unreasonable application of federal law and therefore affirm the district court denial of habeas relief on these grounds.hoffner has defaulted his third argument and we therefore affirm the district court rejection of that claim as well.
hoffner claims that trial counsel advised him to show no emotion throughout the entire trial and specifically during his unsworn statement in the mitigation phase.he claims that this adversely affected his chances of avoiding the death penalty because it dehumanized him to the jury.in support of this claim,he offers the affidavit of juror eve gimple.the affidavit states that the jury wanted to know why hoffner appeared to show no emotion during his unsworn statement.it was this lack of emotion which also was a factor in my vote to recommend the death penalty for hoffner.
because this claim was based on an affidavit outside the trial record,hoffner properly raised it for the first time in his state petition.see hoffner iii,wl,at.the ohio court of appeals applied ohio aliunde rule,under which jurors are not competent to testify about their deliberations or their mental processes during deliberations without first establishing this evidence from an outside nonjury source.id.at citing ohio evid.b.ohio courts have applied this rule to juror testimony in postconviction proceedings where the defendant alleges ineffective assistance of counsel.id.at see also doan brigano,cir,overruled on other grounds by wiggins smith,u.discussing the differences between the ohio rule and its federal analogue state hessler,wl,at ohio.june,applying the aliunde rule in state proceedings to exclude consideration of a juror affidavit.the state court ruled that the juror was not competent to testify as to her mental processes during the trial and rejected hoffner claim.hoffner iii,wl,at.
the district court found that this ruling was not an unreasonable application of constitutional law,noting also that the affidavit was weak evidence of prejudice anyway as the juror had specified that hoffner affect was only a factor but had crossed out the modifier significant.hoffner vii,slip op.at.we agree.the affidavit does not allege that the jury was influenced by any extraneous information,and therefore the juror testimony was properly excluded from consideration by the ohio courts.this court has previously held that there is no constitutional impediment to enforcing ohio aliunde rule,and hoffner has cited no authority to the contrary.see brown bradshaw,cir see also tanner united states,chronicling the legal history of and policy underlying federal rule of evidence b.without the affidavit,hoffner can not establish that trial counsel advice regarding his demeanor was prejudicial under strickland.we affirm the denial of habeas on this ground.
hoffner also claims that some of the comments trial counsel made during closing argument at mitigation rendered counsel assistance constitutionally ineffective.at summation,counsel stated the following 
this is a heinous crime,it unbelievable.as the prosecutor said,i ca begin to put it into words,and it really rather difficult.
please do mistake any of my remarks as an attempt to evoke sympathy on behalf of timothy hoffner,because i do feel any,not a bit.i feel revulsion and confusion in equal parts because of everything that we have heard,these amazingly gruesome photographs,and they hard to look at.i looked at them for months.and how is it that one young man can find it within himself to commit an act of homicide on his friend 
please understand at the outset what i asking of you.there are three sentences available there is death,life imprisonment with possibility of parole after serving the first full years,and then life imprisonment with the possibility of possibility of parole eligibility after serving the first years.do even think about that.to stand before you and ask for full years to the parole board is an abomination and it an insult to you,to me and to the hammers.
ja at.hoffner claims that,through these comments,trial counsel essentially ceased functioning as hoffner advocate during the penalty phase and failed to subject the prosecution penalty case to meaningful adversarial testing in violation of his sixth amendment rights.see united states cronic.
the ohio supreme court determine d that defense counsel comments do not reflect deficient performance and that they were not prejudicial.rather than an abandonment of hoffner mitigation defense,counsel comments were an apparent attempt to acknowledge the particularly gruesome nature of the crime and to preserve credibility between counsel and the jury.hoffner ii,d at.the court applied highly deferential scrutiny to the strategic decisions of trial counsel under strickland and reasoned that trial counsel apparently believed that any attempt to seek the lesser sentence of life with the possibility of parole after years would have alienated the jury.id.at.the court concluded that the tactic was not unreasonable in light of the particularly heinous nature of the aggravated murder committed here.id.at.the district court held that the ohio supreme court decision was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law and denied relief.hoffner vii,slip op.at.
we affirm the district court ruling.trial counsel comments quoted above constitute only a small portion of the entirety of the closing argument,roughly the first page and a half of the transcript.for the remainder of the transcript recounted at length the mitigating evidence that had been presented at the penalty phase in an attempt to prove that there is indeed sufficient evidence to diminish the appropriateness of the death penalty.ja at.counsel decision to cast hoffner crime in a negative light only briefly at the start of argument was clearly a strategic decision aimed at maintaining the trust of the jury.the ohio supreme court decision to that effect was not unreasonable.
the cases hoffner cites in support of his claim are of no avail.hoffner relies heavily on rickman bell,cir,in which we held that counsel strategy of attacking his own client constructively deprived his client of representation to the extent that prejudice could be presumed.in rickman,however,the hostility and disgust that counsel exhibited toward his client was far more extensive than in this case.counsel performance in rickman convey ed to the jurors an unmistakable personal antagonism toward rickman,characterized both by attacks on rickman and by repeatedly eliciting information detrimental to rickman interests.id.at.the lawyer portray ed rickman as crazed and dangerous throughout the trial and paint ed a picture of his client even more frightening than the prosecution could paint.id.at.we characterized the lawyer conduct as combin ing a total failure to actively advocate his client cause with repeated expressions of contempt for his client for his alleged actions.id.at.not only did we find counsel performance deficient,but we held that the deficiency was so substandard as to be presumptively prejudicial under cronic.counsel performance here was limited to a strategic choice to gain favor with the jury by asking that hoffner receive eligibility for parole after thirty years instead of after twenty.counsel did not depict hoffner as frightening or create an image of him more damaging than what the prosecution presented.rickman is thus inapposite.
hoffner also cites our decision in spisak hudson,cir,which,since oral argument in this case,has been reversed by the supreme court,smith spisak.in spisak,counsel described his client acts in vivid detail,argued that his client deserved no sympathy for his actions,and a t no point endeavor ed to direct his negative statements about his client toward an express appeal for leniency.id.at stevens,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.however,the court unanimously held that counsel actions were not prejudicial in light of the context in which the argument was made.id.at majority opinion.the court reasoned that,because evidence from the guilt phase was still fresh in the jurors minds,because counsel made repeated appeals to the jurors sense of humanity,and because the testimony of the defense mental health experts had presented many of the arguments for mitigation,it could not find a reasonable probability that the result of the case would have been different had closing argument been more persuasive.see also id.at stevens,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment in my judgment even the most skillful of closing one befitting clarence not have created a reasonable probability of a different outcome in this case.
even if we were to find counsel performance deficient in this case,under spisak we could not find it to have prejudiced hoffner defense.hoffner counsel only referred to the heinous nature of his client acts he did not go into vivid detail or argue that hoffner deserved no sympathy.further,counsel spent substantial time presenting a case for leniency.when viewed in light of the extensive evidence of the crime produced at the guilt phase of trial and the substantial mitigating evidence produced at the penalty phase,we can hardly find counsel comments here to be prejudicial.our decision is only bolstered by the deference due under aedpa to the ohio supreme court determination of this issue.we therefore affirm the district court denial of habeas on this.
finally,hoffner argues that trial counsel was ineffective at the penalty phase for failing to object to the trial judge definition of a preponderance,which was given in response to a question from the jury during deliberations.hoffner claims that counsel should have requested an additional instruction to make clear that the jury knew the prosecution carried the ultimate burden of proving that the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.according to hoffner,counsel failure to do so was constitutionally deficient because the sixth amendment requires a criminal defense attorney to remain an active advocate on behalf of his or her client.appellant br.at citing evitts lucey.
hoffner raised this claim for the first time in his state petition.the ohio court of appeals held that,because this claim could have been brought solely on the basis of the trial record,it was barred by res judicata.hoffner iii,wl,at.therefore,this claim is procedurally defaulted.hoffner claims in a footnote in his reply brief that ineffective assistance of appellate counsel excuses his default but,on appeal,he has not developed any argument for why counsel error here was prejudicial,and,thus,his claim fails 
we affirm the district court denial of habeas relief for ineffective assistance of trial counsel at the penalty phase.
in his fourth claim for relief,hoffner contends that appellate counsel failure to raise various meritorious issues on appeal amounted to constitutionally deficient performance.on appeal,hoffner points to four issues in particular that appellate counsel should have raised that the trial court failed to define the term aggravating circumstances in the jury instructions that the prosecution committed misconduct by arguing that the nature and circumstances of the case were to be considered as aggravation that the trial court jury instruction as to the process of weighing mitigating and aggravating factors was faulty and that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the above errors.
under ohio law,a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel must be raised as part of an ohio appellate rule b motion to reopen an appeal before the ohio court of appeals.state murnahan,ohio ohio.b.rule b requires that the application for reopening shall be filed within ninety days from journalization of the appellate judgment unless the applicant shows good cause for filing at a later time.the ohio court of appeals decision on hoffner direct appeal was journalized on march,but hoffner did not file his rule b application until june.the ohio court of appeals thus found hoffner application to be untimely on its face and dismissed it.hoffner iv,slip op.at.the court further rejected his attempts to establish cause for the late filing and his challenge to the constitutionality of the rule.id.at.despite this ruling,however,the court of appeals proceeded to address each of hoffner claims and rejected them all on their merits.id.at.on appeal,the ohio supreme court affirmed the dismissal of the b application on untimeliness grounds only.hoffner v,at.
this court precedents guide our application of the maupin test for procedural default when a rule b motion has been denied for untimeliness.by the time hoffner filed his rule b motion in june,it was well established that claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel must be raised in a motion for reconsideration before the ohio court of appeals.monzo edwards,cir considering whether rule b was an independent and adequate state procedural rule as of may.since at least,ohio law has provided sufficient guidance on what constitutes a good cause for a late filing under rule b.id.at.furthermore,as of january,the time constraints of rule b were firmly established and regularly followed.parker bagley,cir discussing fautenberry mitchell,cir emphasis omitted.although we have,in prior cases,found rule b not to be an adequate and independent ground on which to find procedural default,those precedents are not applicable here because rule b was firmly established and regularly followed by june see id.at applying the firmly established and regularly followed requirement as of the time rule b was to be applied.thus,we conclude that hoffner has procedurally defaulted his claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.nevertheless,even if hoffner claims were not defaulted,each fails on the merits.see fautenberry,at analyzing the merits of a procedurally defaulted claim in the alternative.
the usual analysis of claims under strickland also governs claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.robbins,at.thus hoffner must demonstrate that appellate counsel decision not to raise the issues raised here was below an objective standard of reasonableness and that the deficiency caused a reasonable probability that the result of the proceedings would have been different.strickland,at.it is not required that an attorney argue every conceivable issue on appeal.jones barnes,citation and quotation marks omitted.rather,appellate counsel must examine the record with a view to selecting the most promising issues for review.id.at.generally,only when ignored issues are clearly stronger than those presented,will the presumption of effective assistance of counsel be overcome.robbins,at citation and quotation marks omitted.
because we are reviewing these claims under aedpa,we must give the appropriate deference to the last state court to issue a reasoned opinion on the issue.payne bell,cir see also joseph coyle,cir citing barrientes johnson,cir when the last state adjudication of the claim is silent or ambiguous,the federal court should look through to the last clear state decision on the matter.further,we give aedpa deference to a ruling on the merits despite the fact that the reasoning was given as an alternative to a primary ground for this case,the court of appeals dismissal of the rule b application as untimely.see brooks bagley,cir.therefore,we will review the ohio court of appeals determination of the merits of the claims hoffner raises here and accord that decision the appropriate deference under aedpa.
hoffner first argues that appellate counsel were deficient for failing to argue that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury on the meaning of aggravating circumstances.without a proper definition,hoffner claims,the jury was left with untrammeled discretion to impose or withhold the death penalty.appellant br.at citing gregg georgia.the ohio court of appeals rejected the claim,relying on a prior case in which the exact same argument was raised and rejected.hoffner iv,slip op.at.in state hutton,the ohio supreme court held that appellate counsel decision not to argue that the trial court erred by not including a definition of aggravating circumstances was reasonable,especially considering the fact that,because trial counsel had not objected to the instructions,plain error review would have applied on appeal,ohio.the court cited robbins and barnes and held that appellate counsel decision not to raise the issue was not unreasonable.id.at.applying hutton to hoffner claim,the ohio court of appeals concluded that counsel decision not to argue for the need for a definition of aggravating circumstances did not constitute deficient performance,as the issue was not clearly stronger than the numerous other issues counsel did raise,including other alleged defects in the jury instructions.see hoffner iv,slip op.at.
relying primarily on the same cases,the district court held that the ohio court of appeals decision was not an unreasonable application of federal law.hoffner vi,slip op.at.we agree.trial counsel failure to object to the jury instructions meant that plain error review would have applied appellate counsel decision not to raise a waived issue was reasonable.furthermore,as the district court explained,the ohio supreme court reweighing of the mitigating and aggravating factors would effectively cure any error caused by an improper definition of aggravating circumstances.see id.at citing slagle bagley,cir.moreover,hoffner can not show that,even if appellate counsel was deficient for not having raised the claim,the result of the proceeding would have been different.hoffner argues that the failure to provide this instruction was a structural defect in the trial under arizona fulminante.this is a mischaracterization of the trial court omission.structural defects affect the framework within which the trial proceeds and are not simply errors in the trial process itself,see,such as a faulty jury instruction is.the ohio court resolution was not unreasonable.we affirm the district court rejection of this.
next,hoffner claims that the prosecutor made several comments during closing argument at the penalty phase that improperly represented that the nature and circumstances of the offense could be considered an aggravating factor.at closing argument,the prosecutor stated 
archie dixon went through chris wallet and later both hoffner and dixon took and sold chris car.i do think there any question there an aggravating circumstance,maybe more than one here.
is there anything mitigating about the nature of circumstance of this crime is there anything mitigating,ladies and gentlemen,about trying to snap someone neck,trying to snap his neck,leaving,digging a hole,coming back,walking him to the car,driving him there with other people,walking him down a path and taking him to his grave,is there anything mitigating about that 
who benefited in this murder i think the evidence is clear that hoffner and dixon sold chris hammer car.he bought at least one car,and there are a couple of exhibits,state exhibit,after the taking and selling of chris hammer car,and then he initially lied to the police and blamed everything on archie dixon.is there anything mitigating about the nature and circumstances of this crime,a planned,premeditated,calculated killing 
emphasis added by hoffner.hoffner claims that these statements allowed the jury unbridled discretion to consider any number of aggravating factors.appellant br.at citing zant stephens.
the ohio court of appeals once again conducted review,as hoffner counsel had not objected at trial.hoffner iv,slip op.at.as to the prosecutor first comment,the state court reasoned that although the prosecutor reference to more than one aggravating circumstance technically may have been improper,i solated comments by a prosecutor are not to be taken out of context and given their most damaging meaning.id.at quoting state ahmed,ohio.as to the remainder of the statements,the court held that the remarks properly stated the law.under ohio law,the facts and circumstances of the offense must be examined to determine whether they are mitigating.ohio ann.b.thus,a prosecutor may legitimately refer to the nature and circumstances of the offense,both to refute any suggestion that they are mitigating and to explain why the specified aggravating circumstance s outweigh mitigating factors.state sheppard,ohio.therefore,the court of appeals reasoned,the prosecutor was justified in arguing to the jury that the nature and circumstances of hoffner crime should not be considered mitigating,and appellate counsel was not deficient for failing to raise the claim.hoffner iv,slip op.at.
we agree with the district court that this conclusion was not an unreasonable application of federal law.the prosecutor statements could hardly qualify as prosecutorial misconduct under ohio law as they accurately reflected ohio rules on the use of aggravating and mitigating evidence.therefore,appellate counsel failure to raise the claim on appeal could not have been deficient,especially considering the review to which the claim would have been subject.we affirm the district court decision on this.
hoffner also argues that the trial court instructions to the jury were erroneous in their explanation of the process by which the jury should weigh aggravating and mitigating evidence.first,he claims that the court omitted an instruction that the jury need not reach a unanimous decision as to the existence of any mitigating factor.the instructions read if the weight of the evidence is equally balanced,or if you are unable to determine which side of an issue has the preponderance as to any one or more of the mitigating factors,then the defendant has not established that mitigating factor or factors as the case may be.hoffner argues that this instruction could have led the jurors to believe that they could not consider a mitigating factor unless all the jurors believed it had been proven,in violation of mills maryland.
the ohio court of appeals rejected this claim,concluding that the trial court in fact was properly instructing the court as to the defendant burden to prove a mitigating circumstance by a preponderance,which is constitutionally valid.hoffner iv,slip op.at citing state tenace,ohio.in a prior case,we held that requiring unanimity as to the presence of a mitigating factor a process prohibited by a far different matter than requiring unanimity as to the results of the weighing.coe bell,cir emphasis omitted.similarly,it is a far different matter than emphasizing that the defendant carries the burden of proving mitigating factors by a preponderance.f ailing to expressly state that mitigating factors need not be unanimously found does not improperly imply that mitigating factors must be unanimously found.williams anderson,cir.we affirm the district court finding that the court of appeals resolution of this was not unreasonable.
second,hoffner contends that the district court erred by instructing the jury that it could consider penalties other than death only after finding that the prosecution failed to prove that the aggravating factors did not outweigh the mitigating factors.hoffner does not cite a particular portion of the jury instructions where the trial court made such an error,but we will assume that he is referring to the same passage that he cited in his rule b application.the instructions read 
if after a full and impartial consideration of all the evidence in this case you are firmly convinced that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors,then the state has established this beyond a reasonable doubt and your sentence recommendation should be death.
if you are not firmly convinced that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors,then your sentence recommendation must be life imprisonment with parole eligibility only after either full years of imprisonment or full years of imprisonment.
now,in conclusion,as you shall recommend the sentence of death only if you unanimously,all jurors,find by proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors.if you do not so find,you should unanimously recommend either a life sentence with parole eligibility after serving full years of imprisonment or a life sentence with parole eligibility only after serving full years of imprisonment.
hoffner claims that this instruction was faulty in requiring the jury to reject the death penalty before considering another option and that counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the claim.appellant br.at citing mapes coyle,cir.
the ohio court of appeals distinguished the instructions given here from an ohio supreme court case prohibiting instructions.hoffner iv,slip op.at.in state brooks,ohio,the ohio supreme court h eld that the jury need not unanimously reject the death penalty in order to recommend a life sentence.state murphy,n,ohio.but the instruction given in brooks you are now required to determine unanimously that the death penalty is inappropriate before you can consider a life sentence,brooks,at clearly distinguishable from the instructions in this case,which state nothing about unanimously rejecting the death penalty nor do they state anything about the order in which the jury should proceed,hoffner iv,slip op.at.
we agree with the ohio court of appeals that counsel was not deficient for failing to raise this state claim as the claim itself was meritless under ohio precedent.the claim would have also failed under federal law.as it recently noted,the supreme court ha s not previously held jury instructions unconstitutional for requiring rejection of the death penalty first.spisak.at.the jury instructions here are substantively congruent to those in spisak,in which the court held the instructions not to be contrary to clearly established supreme court precedent.id.the ohio court conclusion was not an unreasonable application of federal law,and we affirm the district court on this.
finally,hoffner claims that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise a claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the errors discussed here.because we find none of the alleged underlying errors to be meritorious,trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object.therefore,appellate counsel failure to raise the ineffective assistance issue was not constitutionally deficient.the ohio court of appeals reached the same conclusion.
we therefore affirm the district court denial of habeas on hoffner claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.
in his fifth claim for relief,hoffner contends that the police questioning that led to his arrest was conducted in violation of his fifth amendment rights under miranda arizona,and that the trial court erred by failing to suppress the statements.hoffner argues that the atmosphere at the house where he was initially questioned by the police was such that it constituted custodial interrogation necessitating a miranda warning.according to hoffner,because the police failed to give the warning at that time,later statements given in the police car and at the police station were so tainted that a miranda warning could not cure the violation.appellant br.at citing missouri seibert.
hoffner properly preserved this issue for our review by raising it on direct appeal.see hoffner ii,at.under aedpa,factual findings made by the state courts based on the trial record are entitled to a presumption of correctness that may be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.e warren,at.the ohio supreme court made extensive factual findings on this issue 
on november,hoffner and dixon were living at wilkerson house.at approximately on that date,toledo police officers executed a search warrant at the wilkerson residence and arrested dixon for forgery.
during the search,lieutenant charles hunt discovered hoffner covered with a blanket lying on a couch in the family room.hunt,with his weapon drawn but pointed in the air,ordered hoffner off the couch.hunt then pulled the blanket away from hoffner,holstered his weapon,and searched hoffner for weapons.to prevent hoffner from interfering while police searched the premises,hunt asked hoffner to sit in a nearby chair.
hunt and detective robert leiter then searched the family room.during their sear
