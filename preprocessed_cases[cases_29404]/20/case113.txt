before this court on appeal is the dismissal of petitioner joseph delong federal habeas corpus petition.after careful review,we remand to the district court.we begin by outlining the procedural posture of delong case.
delong was convicted by a jury in massachusetts state court on two indictments charging him with unarmed robbery,and sentenced to concurrent terms of fifteen to twenty years imprisonment.delong filed a motion for a new trial,alleging ineffectiveness of trial counsel and requesting an evidentiary hearing he later filed an amended motion claiming newly discovered evidence a surveillance tape and still photographs was exculpatory and warranted a new trial,or at minimum an evidentiary hearing on his motion.the court denied delong motion for a new trial,finding the evidence was reasonably discoverable at the time of trial.delong appealed the judgments and the denial of his motion for new trial.
the massachusetts appeals court affirmed the convictions but found delong had made an adequate showing to warrant an evidentiary hearing on the newly discovered photographic and video evidence.the appeals court remanded the matter to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing.following the evidentiary hearing,the trial court again denied the motion for a new trial delong appealed and the appeals court subsequently affirmed.delong then sought further appellate review of his motion for a new trial with the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc,arguing ineffective assistance of counsel and violations of his right to due process.the sjc denied his application.delong applied again to the sjc for further appellate review of the appeals court affirmance of his convictions,arguing ineffective assistance of counsel,denial of his right to fair trial,and reversible error.the sjc also denied this request.
delong then filed,pro se,a federal habeas corpus petition in the district court of massachusetts.his petition raised claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and violations of his right to due process on november,respondent thomas dickhaut moved for dismissal on the ground that delong petition contained unexhausted claims.although the parties disagree as to precisely which claims were exhausted,it is undisputed that some claims in delong habeas petition had not been previously raised before the massachusetts state courts.
on november,the district court granted dickhaut motion in an electronic order,which stated only motion allowed.this case is dismissed as it contains both exhausted and unexhausted claims.ros e lundy,d the case was dismissed on december.
on december,the district court received from delong a handwritten motion for extension of time to oppose respondent motion to dismiss,dated december.the district court denied his motion as moot,as the case had already been dismissed.delong then sent a handwritten notice of appeal listing the denial of his motion for extension of time and the order denying this motion as moot,dated december.he mistakenly sent his appeal to this court,which we received on january,and transmitted to the district court.the notice of appeal was docketed by the district court clerk as an appeal from both the district court order denying the motion for extension of time and the order dismissing the case.delong also sent a letter to the clerk of the district court,dated december,stating he had not received any notification from the court regarding the dismissal of his case and requesting any written decisions or rulings in his case.
on february,this court ordered the district court to issue or deny a certificate of appealability coa for its final order,which the district court ultimately denied stating,this appeal would be frivolous.delong then sought and was granted by this court a coa to appeal from the dismissal of his mixed habeas petition on the ground he was not given the option to delete his unexhausted claims and proceed only with his exhausted claims.we now review the district court dismissal of delong petition.
jurisdiction 
we first need to address the preliminary issue of jurisdiction.specifically,dickhaut challenges our jurisdiction in this matter,arguing delong failed to file an appropriate notice of appeal to the district court dismissal of his case.recall,if you will,that on december,delong filed a handwritten notice of appeal.in this notice,delong stated his appeal consisted of the district court denial of his motion for extension of time,ruling the motion denied as moot.it is dickhaut position that even though delong notice may have properly evidenced an intention to appeal the district court denial of his motion for extension of time,it did not properly appeal the december order dismissing his habeas petition.delong counters that his december notice of appeal adequately evidenced an intention to appeal all adverse rulings of the district court,including the dismissal of his case,and was timely filed.in order to determine if we have jurisdiction to entertain this appeal we must determine whether delong notice of appeal was timely filed and provided sufficient indication of his intention to appeal the district court december dismissal of his petition.see campiti matesanz,cir.
we first address whether delong notice was timely filed.the district court dismissed delong habeas petition on december,and delong notice of appeal was not docketed until january,more than thirty days later,ordinarily considered untimely.fed.a a.however,under the prison mailbox rule,an inmate confined in a correctional institution may file a notice of appeal by depositing it in the institution internal mail system on or before the last day of filing.fed.c.timely filing may be shown by a declaration in compliance with that set s forth the date of deposit and state s that postage was prepaid.id.delong dated his notice of appeal december,and sent it along with an affidavit which he swore was true under penalty of perjury and a certificate of service that stated the notice was mailed by mail,postage prepaid.applying the prison mailbox rule,we deem the notice of appeal filed on december,the date delong deposited it in prison mail system,which was within thirty days of the december dismissal of his case.thus,we hold delong filing was timely.see united states correa torres,cir.
having found the filing timely,we turn next to the content of delong appeal.a notice of appeal must designate the judgment,order,or part thereof being appealed.fed.c b.we construe this rule liberally,and consider the notice in the context of the record in its entirety to ascertain whether petitioner intent to appeal was sufficiently manifest.see markel am.ins,d√≠az santiago,cir.but liberal construction does not excuse noncompliance with rule,which is fatal to an appeal.smith barry,d.
here,delong notice of appeal challenges the district court order denying his motion for extension of time as moot,a ruling based on the prior dismissal of his case.we examine delong notice of appeal in the context of the record as a whole and note that the letter he sent to the district court clerk along with the notice clearly referenced the december dismissal of his case.see markel am.ins,at.delong letter explained he was not aware of the dismissal of his case until december,when he received the denial of his motion for extension of time as moot.we find delong notice of appeal plainly evidences an intention to appeal the district court entire order,which specifically mentioned the motion for extension of time and indirectly referenced the dismissal of his case.see campiti,at.although the notice does not directly cite the december order,rule buttressed by latitude for a pro se litigant forgives informalit ies of form.id.alteration in original quoting fed.c.we conclude delong intent to appeal the dismissal of his case was sufficiently manifest.
having determined delong timely filed a notice that plainly evidenced his intent to appeal,this court has jurisdiction.
