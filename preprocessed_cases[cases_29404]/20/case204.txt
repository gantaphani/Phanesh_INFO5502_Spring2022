vicki of appellant seth murdered on august,seemingly in stratham,new hampshire,and her body was found in a grave in waterboro,maine,on april.police were led to the body by joseph bader,who was seth adopted son and biological cousin.in december,joseph agreed with the state to enter a plea of true to a juvenile delinquency petition,confessing that he assisted in helping seth murder vicki.
at seth trial in april and may in new hampshire state court,joseph testified against seth for four trial days.the gist of the testimony was that seth and his girlfriend mary jean martin had plotted to murder vicki that seth had hired sandro stuto to assist in the murder and to dispose of vicki car that seth had traveled to maine with joseph a few days before the murder,located a spot in the woods and dug a grave and that joseph had kept seth younger son outside the house while the murder was committed.
joseph did not claim to have witnessed the murder,but,according to his testimony,he had been called back into the house by stuto after the murder and witnessed his adoptive father emerging from the basement with a rifle barrel and a spent casing joseph had then helped clean up the blood.joseph also testified that seth had told him earlier that he seth would shoot vicki.joseph further testified that he had then helped seth transport and bury vicki body in maine and that on the way home he and seth had gone shopping for new clothes.
the prosecution offered records of seth mobile phone to show calls from maine on the date of vicki death.credit card records showed seth card had been used that day to purchase pants in two different sizes,one pair of shoes and other items.seth did not testify at his trial but the prosecution played a recording of a police interview for the jury in which seth,while denying guilt,conceded that he might have driven with joseph to maine that day because of the good weather.
stuto testified that on the day of the murder,he,martin and seth met together in the afternoon and agreed that stuto would dispose of vicki car after the murder,leaving it at a bookstore.seth and stuto drove to the bookstore and then proceeded to seth house where,according to stuto,seth shot vicki at trial the defense sought to call martin,who refused to testify.
although the state primarily relied on the testimony of joseph and stuto,other evidence in addition to the mobile phone and credit card records was offered.vicki lawyer testified as to seth aggressive efforts to reduce his financial obligations to vicki and to secure custody of their children.in tape recordings of phone calls with vicki,seth expressed his obsession with holding onto and pleasing martin and stated that martin had said she would leave seth unless he won the alimony and custody litigation.
a woman who regularly cleaned seth house testified to prior statements that seth and his girlfriend wished vicki were dead.vicki doctor said that vicki had told him that she remained overweight so that her body would be difficult to move if she were killed.the prosecution also sought to connect seth with a pipe bomb planted in vicki mailbox one witness testified to seth having a book in his home.
the defense sought to discredit both joseph and stuto,emphasizing that stuto had reached a deal for only five years in prison and that joseph would do no time in prison.it offered evidence of martin deceptive character,her links to joseph,and joseph hostility towards vicki.it also attempted to raise doubts about the state theory in closing,the defense offered an alternative theory that,without seth involvement,martin had convinced joseph to do the killing and that both joseph and martin stood to benefit from killing vicki and framing seth.
the jury convicted seth of murder and conspiracy to murder,and he was sentenced to life imprisonment on the murder charge.the new hampshire supreme court affirmed his conviction.state bader.after seth trial,juvenile court hearings were held to track joseph progress but joseph never spent any time in a correctional facility.
in october,seth filed the present habeas case in federal district court.he claimed,inter alia,that in violation of brady maryland,d,the prosecution had made but did not disclose to the defense a deal for joseph testimony,which could have been used to impeach joseph at trial.giglio united states,d.seth now conjectures that the agreement might have been kept secret from joseph himself.
the issue whether any agreement existed had been elaborately explored in the state proceedings.in september,prior to seth trial,the defense filed a motion for discovery of all details of all agreements and understandings with joseph or other.when in december joseph agreed to plead guilty in the juvenile proceedings,the state got court permission and then disclosed to seth lawyers joseph juvenile court records.
on march,after seth trial had begun,he filed a second motion for discovery,this time asking for all records relating to communication between the attorney general office and joseph attorneys and documents relating to charging decisions made by the attorney general office.defense counsel also made oral motions at trial.in response,the judge ordered that all documents in the file s relating to the juvenile filed in the family court,including notes from therapists,be provided to the court.
the trial judge then reviewed in camera the documents that the state had provided.after this review,on april,the state judge determined that the record did not contain any material which is exculpatory,essential to the defendant receiving a fair trial,or which relate s to any understandings or agreements relative to plea decisions or other information which can be construed as giglio materials.
the prosecutor reaffirmed on april,that the state had disclosed all agreements with joseph and his attorneys.the judge nevertheless ordered expedited access to the transcript of joseph plea hearing,which had occurred in december.although defense counsel inferred from tapes of that hearing that a agreement existed the trial judge listened himself and ruled that there was no evidence of a deal requiring joseph to testify at seth trial.
at seth trial,the judge let seth trial counsel joseph about any such deal.joseph admitted that his plea agreement meant that he would not be incarcerated even for one second,that the disposition hearing in his case would not occur until after seth trial,and that the juvenile court would know of his testimony in seth trial.but joseph said that he had not made any agreement to testify 
nevertheless,on his state appeal,seth argued to the new hampshire supreme court that joseph plea agreement was contingent on his testifying against seth and that the trial court had erred in finding to the contrary.in rejecting the appeal,the court said 
there is no evidence in the extensive record in this case to support a conclusion that the trial court erred either in its finding following the in camera review or in its finding of no evidence of a sine qua non sic on the part of the state in return for joseph bader testimony accordingly the defendant can not prevail in his effort to secure a new trial on this issue as he has failed to prove that the prosecution withheld evidence that is favorable and material.

in federal habeas proceedings directed to state prisoners,the federal statute provides that findings by the state court are entitled to substantial deference.d,e the district court initially dismissed seth brady claim as one previously litigated and resolved,adding that joseph could not have been influenced in his testimony if a deal had existed but been kept secret from him.
seth then discovered that a social worker had kept notes of a november,meeting attended by joseph public defenders,his social workers and a state prosecutor.shortly after the district court dismissed seth habeas petition,seth sought reconsideration,accompanying the motion with affidavits from one of his own trial lawyers saying that he had not known of the november,meeting.the notes kept by one of the social workers attending the meeting said 
joe will be charged with conspiracy to c
