in this habeas corpus petition,petitioner nathaniel lewis argues that the trial court exclusion of certain evidence in his rape trial prevented him from conducting appropriate,thus violating his sixth amendment right of confrontation.because we find that the excluded evidence reasonably goes to the issue of the victim consent,as well as her motive in pursuing charges against lewis,petitioner constitutional right of confrontation has been violated.therefore,the district court denial of habeas relief is reversed in accordance with this court opinion.
appellant nathaniel lewis was indicted on november,by a summit county grand jury on the charge of rape,a violation of ohio revised code a.the case proceeded to jury trial before the court of common pleas on june.the jury returned a guilty verdict on june.on july,lewis was sentenced to the ohio department of rehabilitation and correction for a term of eight years and is presently serving his sentence.lewis filed a motion for new trial,which was denied by the trial court on july.
the court of appeals,ninth judicial district affirmed lewis conviction on august.the parties argued in their briefs,and the court of appeals discussed in its opinion,the trial court decision to exclude certain evidence in terms of the rape shield law.while the sixth amendment was mentioned in the heading entitled first assignment of error,it was not specifically discussed by the parties or the court.lewis appealed to the ohio supreme court his brief before that court explicitly addressed the constitutional right to confrontation.the ohio supreme court denied leave to appeal and dismissed lewis appeal as not involving any substantial constitutional question.although the ohio supreme court brief journal entry did not elaborate on the sixth amendment argument,the court was clearly presented with the constitutional issue and may be presumed to have considered the merits of that issue.for purposes of seeking habeas corpus relief,the exhaustion requirement is satisfied if the federal issue has been presented to the highest state court.it is settled law in this circuit that a constitutional claim which is presented to the state courts,regardless of whether they address and dispose of it,will satisfy the exhaustion requirement.rudolph parke,cir citations omitted.
on july,lewis filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to in the united states district court for the northern district of ohio.magistrate judge george limbert issued a report and recommendation on january,which recommended that the petition be denied.lewis filed objections,and the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation denying the habeas petition.the district court issued the following certificate of appealability w hether failure to admit specific portions of the victim diary at trial effectively denied lewis his sixth amendment right to confront a witness.this appeal followed.

on the evening of october,at,heaslet called lewis and invited him to her dormitory room.lewis arrived at approximately.they made plans earlier in the day for him to come to her room to borrow some music compact discs.heaslet and lewis watched television,listened to music,and talked with keryn mayback,while heaslet drank wine coolers.mayback left at approximately or,and heaslet and lewis were alone in heaslet room.shortly after mayback left,while heaslet and lewis were listening to music,lewis got up and turned off the light.according to heaslet testimony,lewis grabbed her,threw her on the bed,and took off all her clothes.lewis then completely disrobed,stood up,pulled out a condom,and placed it on his penis.heaslet testified she was repeatedly pushed down by lewis,and her legs were forced apart,while she continued to cry do do this.lewis then penetrated her.
lewis testimony was that after he turned the lights off he told heaslet to come and find him.heaslet found him on the bed,and he put his hand up her shirt.heaslet removed her bra,and they started kissing.together they removed heaslet sweatshirt,and then lewis disrobed and put on a condom.meanwhile,heaslet took off the rest of her clothes.according to lewis,heaslet did not say anything during the time they had intercourse.
lewis then turned on the lights,wrapped the condom in a tissue and threw it in the trash.heaslet picked up the condom wrapper,threw it in the trash,and told lewis he had to leave.heaslet left the room with lewis.lewis stopped a couple of doors down the hall to write a note on another girl door.heaslet rode down the elevator with lewis and signed him out at the front desk.
heaslet then went to see alison legitt,the resident coordinator for the dormitory,who called the police.heaslet did not want to speak to the police initially.she was taken to the hospital,but did not want to see a rape counselor,and for the first several hours did not wish to file any charges.heaslet eventually agreed to see a counselor on october,and was encouraged by her counselor to keep a diary.lewis was arrested in his dormitory room in the early hours of october.he waived his miranda rights and gave a statement explaining that he and heaslet had consensual sex.
several weeks prior to the scheduled trial date,lewis received in the mail an envelope that had been sent anonymously to his home address.the envelope contained xeroxed excerpts of heaslet diary.lewis gave the envelope to his trial counsel,who disclosed the contents to the assistant prosecutor and the trial judge.lewis counsel requested the production of the entire diary.the state acquired heaslet complete diary and provided it to the court for in camera review.the state moved the court in limine to exclude reference to the diary except for certain limited portions.the court marked the entire diary as exhibit e.the portions anonymously sent to lewis were marked exhibits a,b,c and d.defense counsel argued for permission to heaslet on excerpts a,b,c and d,arguing they were relevant to heaslet veracity and motive to lie and spoke directly to the issue of consent.defense counsel was particularly interested in excerpt b contained in the entry dated april,
i ca believe the trial only a week away.i feel guilty sort of for trying to get nate locked up,but his lack of respect for women is terrible.i remember how disrespectful he always was to all of us girls in the courtyard he thinks females are a bunch of sex objects and he such a player he was trying to get with holly and me,and all the while he had a girlfriend.i think i pounced on nate because he was the last straw.that,and because i always seemed to need some drama in my life.otherwise i get bored.that definitely needs to change.i sick of men taking advantage of me and i sick of myself for giving in to them.i not a nympho like all those guys think.i just not strong enough to say no to them.i tired of being a whore.this is where it ends.
citing the rape shield law,ohio revised code d,the trial court prohibited the defense from introducing the following language from exhibit b 
and i sick of myself for giving in to them.i not a nympho like all those guys think.i just not strong enough to say no to them.i tired of being a whore.this is where it ends.
the defense had argued that this provision,when read in context,was vital because it stated,or at least implied,that heaslet had not said no to lewis,and it could be construed as an admission that she had consented to intercourse with lewis.it also provided an apparent motive as to why she would falsely claim she was was upset with herself for giving in to men.the state had argued that the language at issue constituted opinion and reputation evidence of the victim past sexual activity and was therefore protected under the rape shield law.the trial court agreed with the state,holding that any probative value of the evidence was outweighed by its prejudicial effect.
the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa set forth new standards for reviewing a federal habeas corpus petition.the supreme court described the new standards,which strengthen the presumption of correctness given to state court determinations 
under d,the writ may issue only if one of the following two conditions is adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.under the contrary to clause,a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by this court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than this court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.under the unreasonable application clause,a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from this court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.
williams taylor,d.
with regard to the first prong of d,the state court decision will be contrary to established supreme court law if the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in our cases,or the state court confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of this court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from our precedent.id.at.
on the question of unreasonableness,the supreme court held that under d unreasonable application clause,a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.rather,that application must also be unreasonable.id.at.
regarding the state court determinations of questions of fact,e provides for a presumption of correctness which is rebuttable only by clear and convincing evidence 
in a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court,a determination of a factual issue made by a state court shall be presumed correct.the applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.

the boggs case involved the trial court exclusion of evidence in a rape trial of an alleged prior false accusation of rape.the defense sought to introduce such evidence so that the jury could infer that if the victim lied or fabricated once,she would do so again.id.at.the court found this to be an attack on the witness general credibility.under davis and its progeny,the sixth amendment only compels if that examination aims to reveal the motive,bias or prejudice of a.id.at.the court was unable to find a plausible theory of motive or bias for allowing such evidence to be presented,and concluded that boggs did not demonstrate a confrontation clause infraction.id.

petitioner prayer for relief concerns the evidentiary rulings made by the trial court under ohio revised code section d,ohio rape shield law.that section provides 
evidence of specific instances of the victim sexual activity,opinion evidence of the victim sexual activity,and reputation evidence of the victim sexual activity shall not be admitted under this section unless it involves evidence of the origin of semen,pregnancy,or disease,or the victim past sexual activity with the offender,and only to the extent that the court finds that the evidence is material to a fact at issue in the case and that its inflammatory or prejudicial nature does not outweigh its probative value.
evidence of specific instances of the defendant sexual activity,opinion evidence of the defendant sexual activity,and reputation evidence of the defendant sexual activity shall not be admitted under this section unless it involves evidence of the origin of semen,pregnancy,or disease,the defendant past sexual activity with the victim,or is admissible against the defendant under section of the revised code,and only to the extent that the court finds that the evidence is material to a fact at issue in the case and that its inflammatory or prejudicial nature does not outweigh its probative value.

appellant argues that the trial court ruling to exclude a portion of the victim diary goes against the supreme court clearly established precedent that regarding motive is constitutionally protected.in support,appellant cites to olden kentucky,d,wherein defendant olden was charged with the rape and kidnap of the victim.olden defense was consent,and he sought to confront the victim with evidence of her cohabitation with another man.olden theory was that the victim had concocted a story to protect her relationship with the other man.the trial court excluded this evidence because while the victim was white,her boyfriend was black and so was olden,and the court believed this fact would have created prejudice against the victim.the supreme court concluded that the prejudicial effect of any testimony could not justify the exclusion of with such strong potential to demonstrate the falsity of the victim testimony.id.at.
in this case,the trial court stated its reason for excluding the portion of the diary as follows 
the court finds that the evidence at issue does not fall within the exceptions to the rape shield law set forth in,subsection d,that the introduction of that evidence will directly elicit information about the opinion of this victim sexual activity,all of which is excluded under the rape shield statute that even if this were to be construed as admissible somehow,it would be misleading to the jury and unduly prejudicial and inflammatory,would outweigh any possible probative value in this case,in particular,the court notes that where the victim meant to describe the defendant nate,she did use his name in particular,the generic references to them are too misleading,too ambiguous in this case to generate a true probative issue as far as the court is concerned.
this court duty is not to determine whether the exclusion of the evidence by the trial judge was correct or incorrect under state law,but rather whether such exclusion rendered petitioner trial so fundamentally unfair as to constitute
