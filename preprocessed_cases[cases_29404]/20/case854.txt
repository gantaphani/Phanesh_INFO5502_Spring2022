torrance jones was convicted in on federal cocaine trafficking charges and sentenced to months imprisonment.his sentence was enhanced by,among other things,two prior florida state court convictions.following his sentencing and appeal,jones filed a motion under in october for relief,which the district court denied.we dismissed jones subsequent appeal.
thereafter,jones challenged his two florida state convictions and obtained vacaturs of both,one in and the other in.he then filed two motions in federal court under and federal rule of civil procedure b,challenging the sentence imposed for his federal conviction because his florida state convictions had been vacated.the district court treated his motions as motions and denied them as successive.
finally,in march,jones filed the instant motion,arguing that it was not successive because he had obtained the vacaturs of the florida convictions after he had filed his first motion.the district court,however,denied this motion as untimely under f because it was not filed within one year after jones learned of his florida state vacaturs.
jones now argues on appeal that his failure to meet the requirements of f should not bar his motion because the vacaturs of his state convictions rendered him actually innocent of his sentence.in making this argument,he relies on the recent supreme court decision in mcquiggin perkins,which held that a defendant who demonstrates actual innocence of his crime of conviction may,in extraordinary circumstances,proceed with a habeas petition that otherwise would have been statutorily under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa.jones asks that we extend mcquiggin holding to provide relief to defendants who demonstrate actual innocence of their sentences,thus providing jones an avenue to bypass f year statute of limitations.we decline to do so and affirm the judgment of the district court 
jones conviction resulted from his involvement in a substantial cocaine distribution conspiracy.he was convicted in the eastern district of north carolina on one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base,in violation of and a,and two counts of possession with intent to distribute cocaine,in violation of.a and.during sentencing,the district court found that jones maintained a managerial role in the offenses and was accountable for trafficking in kilograms of cocaine and kilograms of cocaine base,which,under the sentencing guidelines,resulted in an offense level of.the court found that jones criminal record established a criminal history category of iii,based on a juvenile adjudication and two florida state court convictions one in for misdemeanor possession of marijuana and one in for carrying a concealed firearm,loitering or prowling,and possession of burglary tools.the offense level and criminal history category resulted in an advisory guidelines sentencing range of months to life imprisonment.the court sentenced jones to months imprisonment.on direct appeal,we affirmed.united states jones,wl cir,per curiam,cert.denied.
jones filed a motion for relief in october,alleging eight grounds for relief,primarily based on ineffective assistance of counsel.the district court denied jones motion,and we dismissed his subsequent appeal.united states jones,app x,cir per curiam.
following jones unsuccessful motion,he successfully obtained orders from florida state courts vacating his two prior convictions.the marijuana conviction was vacated on february,and the firearm conviction was vacated on november.
jones thereafter filed two pro se motions to obtain relief from his federal drug trafficking sentence based on the vacaturs of his two florida convictions.on november,he filed a motion under,and on november,he filed a motion under federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court treated both as motions under and dismissed them as successive.we thereafter denied jones requests for a certificate of appealability and for authorization to file a successive motion.united states jones,app x,cir per curiam.
finally,in march,jones filed the instant motion,again contending that he should be resentenced in light of the vacaturs of his two prior florida state convictions.he argued that this motion should not be dismissed as successive because his prior state convictions were vacated after he had filed his original motion in october.therefore,he argued,his october motion could not have raised the issue of the effect of his vacaturs.
the district court did not rule on whether jones motion was successive but,instead,dismissed it as untimely under f,which provides for a year limitation period,running from the date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.the court pointed out that the facts giving rise to jones motion first became known to him no later than when he received notice of the latter of the two vacaturs on november.consequently,his motion filed in march was untimely.finding no extraordinary circumstances that would justify equitable tolling or that would allow jones to benefit from the filing date of his timely but previously dismissed motion filed on november,the court dismissed the motion.it did,however,grant jones a certificate of appealability on the issue of whether his instant motion was timely filed.
jones filed this appeal and now argues that mcquiggin perkins,which was decided after the district court order,should provide him with relief from the year limitation period in f,as he is actually innocent of his sentence.
as noted,the two florida state convictions that were used,in part,to enhance jones federal sentence were vacated in and,respectively.thus,his motion based on those vacaturs and filed in was not filed within one year of when he learned of the vacaturs,and therefore it failed to comply with f as the supreme court has noted,in the context of a challenge made on the ground that a state conviction used to enhance a federal sentence has since been vacated,the year limitation period begins when a petitioner receives notice of the order vacating the prior conviction,provided that he sought it with due diligence in state court.johnson united states,u,see also united states gadsen,cir.
jones contends that because he is innocent of his current federal sentence,we should exercise the traditional,equitable power of federal courts and grant him relief from the bar of f.he relies on the supreme court recent decision in mcquiggin,which held that,in extraordinary circumstances,a defendant who demonstrates actual innocence of his crime of conviction may proceed with a habeas petition that otherwise would have been statutorily under aedpa.thus,he asks us to apply a rule providing for relief based on actual innocence of a crime of conviction to a situation where he is actually innocent of a federal sentence.his claim for relief is grounded on the fact that his sentencing range without the enhancements caused by the two florida convictions would have been to months imprisonment,whereas the range that the district used in sentencing him was months to life imprisonment.
in response,the government argues that mcquiggin is inapposite because jones has not even attempted to claim that he is actually innocent of the federal charge for which he was convicted.rather,he attempts to use the term actual innocence to assert that his criminal history category was improperly calculated.
it is true that the supreme court has recognized a limited actual innocence exception to certain procedural bars to habeas review.under the exception,in an extraordinary case,where a constitutional violation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent,a federal habeas court may grant the writ of habeas corpus even in the absence of a showing of cause for the procedural default.murray carrier,emphasis added see also mcquiggin.at in other words,a credible showing of actual innocence may allow a prisoner to pursue his constitutional claims on the merits notwithstanding the existence of a procedural bar to relief bousley united states.this rule,or fundamental miscarriage of
