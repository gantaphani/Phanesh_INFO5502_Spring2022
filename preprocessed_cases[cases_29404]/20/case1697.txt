stanley adams appeals the district court order conditionally granting a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to on behalf of burt lancaster.on appeal,respondent argues that the district court erred in concluding that the decisions of the michigan state courts were contrary to and unreasonable applications of united states supreme court precedent as set forth in batson kentucky,d and hernandez new york,d.although petitioner has not and the district court did not issue a certificate of appealability,in his brief petitioner argues that the decisions of the michigan state courts were contrary to or unreasonable applications of doyle ohio,d and other issue that the district court found to have been procedurally defaulted.for the reasons stated below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
petitioner was charged in michigan state court with violating michigan compiled laws annotated,premeditated murder,and michigan compiled laws annotated,possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.the charges arose out of an april,incident in which petitioner shot and killed his girlfriend,toni king,in the parking lot of a southfield,michigan shopping plaza.at trial,petitioner did not dispute that he had killed king,but raised insanity and diminished capacity defenses and argued that the murder was not premeditated.a jury convicted petitioner of both charges.petitioner was sentenced to serve life in prison without parole for the murder conviction to be followed by a sentence of an additional two years imprisonment for the firearms conviction.
on june,the michigan court of appeals affirmed petitioner conviction and sentence in an unpublished per curiam decision.see people lancaster,wl.june.on february,the michigan supreme court denied petitioner application for leave to appeal the decision of the michigan court of appeals in a brief order.see people lancaster.
on february,petitioner filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to the petition in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan.the petition requested relief upon six grounds,including the two that are the subject of this appeal whether the decisions of the michigan state courts finding that petitioner had not satisfied his burden of proving that the prosecutor purposefully discriminated in exercising his peremptory challenges was contrary to or an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent as set forth in batson kentucky,d and its progeny and whether the michigan state appellate court decision that petitioner was not denied his fifth amendment right to remain silent and his fourteenth amendment right to due process of law when the prosecutor elicited testimony that he had remained silent during custodial questioning on the advice of counsel was contrary to or an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent as set forth in doyle ohio,d and other cases.
in a september,decision,the district court conditionally granted the petition,finding petitioner batson claim meritorious.the district court concluded that petitioner doyle claim had been procedurally defaulted and denied his other claims.respondent now appeals the district court decision and concomitant judgment granting petitioner relief pursuant to on the batson claim.as mentioned above,though petitioner seeks to inject the doyle claim into this appeal,he has neither lodged a nor obtained a certificate of appealability from the district court on this issue.the district court stayed the grant of the writ of habeas corpus pending this appeal.
ii.standard of review 
this court reviews a district court decision to grant habeas corpus relief de novo.lucas,cir.we review the district court findings of fact for clear error.carson burke,cir.
because the petition was filed after april,the effective date of the and effective death penalty act of aedpa,our review of the decisions of the state trial and appellate courts is governed by aedpa.see lindh murphy,d holding aedpa applicable to petition filed on or after aedpa effective date barker yukins,cir.
in aedpa,congress provided that 
an application for writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or an involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states 
in williams taylor,d,the supreme court interpreted the statutory standard for reviewing a petition for writ of habeas corpus.in particular,the court explained that a state court decision is contrary to the supreme court precedent if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court confronts facts that are materially indistinguishable from a relevant supreme court precedent and arrives at a result opposite to the result reached by the supreme court.williams,at.see lewis wilkinson,cir.
a state court decision may be an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court precedent if the state court identifies the correct governing legal rule from the supreme court cases but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular case or if the state court either unreasonably extends a legal principle from the supreme court precedent to a new context where it should not apply or unreasonably refuses to extend that principle to a new context where it should apply.williams,at.see lewis,at discussing standard.
in reviewing petitioner batson claim,which presents a mixed question of law and fact,our review necessarily focuses on the reasonableness of the decisions of the state is,whether those decisions constituted an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent.see harpster ohio,cir suggesting that mixed questions of law and fact are reviewed under the unreasonable application prong.we are mindful,however,that the question of w hether a prosecutor intended to discriminate on the basis of race in challenging potential jurors is,as batson recognized,a question of historical fact.hernandez,at.under aedpa,p rimary or historical facts found by state courts are presumed correct and are rebuttable only by clear and convincing evidence.boggs collins,cir quoting mapes coyle,cir see e a determination of a factual issue made by a state court shall be presumed to be correct.the applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.
iii.batson kentucky claim 
relevant facts

juror bowden yes.
the court can you swear and assure to us that you listen to the testimony and make your decision only on the facts and evidence and the law that i give to you 
juror bowden i swear.
the court can you commit to us that your decision will be based only on the facts and not because you like somebody or you do like somebody 
juror bowden yes.
the court that what it all about.any questions 
at the conclusion of this colloquy,neither the prosecutor nor defense counsel had any questions for bowden.
shortly after this colloquy,the prosecutor simultaneously exercised three peremptory challenges,striking the juror in seat two,roanne hassinger,the juror in seat twelve,bednaris,and bowden,who was in seat nine.hassinger and bednaris are not.the trial court immediately excused hassinger and bednaris,but told bowden to remain in his seat and called for a bench conference.after a bench conference,the transcript of which is not in the record before this court,the trial court took a recess.
when court returned to session,the trial court announced that a batson challenge had been made in connection with the prosecutor challenge to bowden,which was based on the prosecution contention that bowden responses were not strong enough to satisfy the prosecution.
at the request of the trial court,the prosecution then argued that it had a basis independent of race for striking bowden.the prosecution first pointed out that three men had already been called to sit on the jury mitchell,whom the trial court excused for cause hurd,who was still on the jury and bowden.second,the prosecutor stated that both he and an investigator sitting with him at counsel table,detective phillips,who the prosecutor made clear is,agreed that bowden was not favorable to the prosecution.they had reached this conclusion,the prosecutor explained,based on bowden responses,demeanor,attitude,tone,and temperament.finally,the prosecution argued that the fact that there were three minorities called in this case and two of them remain on the jury does not demonstrate that there is a prima facie showing of exclusion on the basis of race.
in response to the prosecution arguments,the trial court voiced concern about the exclusion of bowden i understand that,but once he is excluded there will be only one on that panel i understand that.i understand it the reality of it though counsel for petitioner then echoed this sentiment,agreeing that,as a practical matter,the exclusion of bowden may result in no serving on the jury.petitioner counsel then argued that bowden responses indicated that he could be fair and,therefore,that there existed no reasonable basis for striking bowden.after this argument,the trial court rejected the prosecution proffered reasons for the strike as pretextual and ruled that the prosecution had purposefully discriminated on the basis of race by attempting to strike bowden.
the trial court resumed juror voir dire.approximately thirty minutes later,after the trial court had seated another,keith webb,and three other jurors,who were not,the prosecution requested a bench conference.after the bench conference,the transcript of which is not in the record,the trial court announced bowden,i going to ask that you go down to the jury office.thank you very much.okay.next please 
the following morning,the trial court attempted to describe the ruling it had made on the previous day.in particular,the trial court explained that,after the prosecution initial attempt to strike bowden,the trial court had not been satisfied by the prosecution explanation that the strike was based on bowden responses during voir dire and the prosecution belief that bowden was not favorable to the prosecution.however,as voir dire continued,the trial court believed the government subsequent conduct lent credibility to its earlier explanation of its attempt to strike bowden.in particular,the trial court focused on the fact that,subsequent to its initial decision,another,webb,had been seated without objection by the prosecution.thus,the trial court explained,it had reconsidered its opinion based on this subsequent voir dire and concluded that the prosecution strike of bowden had,in fact,been legitimate.
on appeal,the michigan court of appeals found,without mention of any supreme court decision,that petitioner had not made a prima facie showing of purposeful discrimination and,therefore,that there was no error in the trial court ruling that the prosecutor use of a peremptory challenge against bowden had been constitutional.see people lancaster,at,wl.june.
legal standard 
it is clearly established that a prosecutor may not exercise his peremptory challenges to exclude a potential juror on the basis of race.in batson kentucky,d,the supreme court articulated a analysis to be applied to an equal protection clause claim that purposeful discrimination occurred in the selection of the petit jury based solely on the prosecutor exercise of his peremptory challenges at trial.see bartholomew,at.first,the defendant must establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination.see copeland,at.this requires an initial showing that the defendant is a member of a cognizable racial group and that the prosecutor has exercised peremptory challenges to remove from the venire members of the defendant race.batson,at.citation omitted.t he defendant is entitled to rely on the fact,as to which there can be no dispute,that peremptory challenges constitute a jury selection practice that permits those to discriminate who are of a mind to discriminate.id.quoting avery georgia.ultimately,the defendant,relying on this presumption and other facts,must raise an inference that the prosecutor used the practice of peremptory challenges to exclude the veniremen from the petit jury on account of their race.id.
second,once the defendant has raised the necessary inference,the burden shifts to the state to come forward with a neutral explanation for challenging potential jurors.id.at.the government is not required to persuade the court that its reasons for dismissing the juror were rather it need only demonstrate that its reasons were.copeland,at.more specifically,
the second step of this process does not demand an explanation that is persuasive or even plausible.at this step of the inquiry,the issue is the facial validity of the prosecutor explanation.unless a discriminatory intent is inherent in the prosecutor explanation,the reason offered will be deemed race neutral.
purkett,at.quoting hernandez,at.
third,the party opposing the strike must demonstrate that the prosecutor purported explanation is merely a pretext for racial motivation.see mccurdy,at describing batson test.ultimately,the court must determine whether the defendant has carried his burden of proving purposeful discrimination.hernandez,at.in making this determination,the court presumes that the facially valid reasons proffered by the prosecution are true.id.at.racially discriminatory purpose or intent must be affirmatively shown by the opponent of the strike.id.at.the ultimate burden of persuasion always remains with the opponent of the strike.see united states mcferron,cir.
respondent argues that the district court erred in finding that the decisions of the michigan trial and appellate courts were contrary to and unreasonable applications of clearly established supreme court precedent.the michigan trial court initially found that the prosecutor challenge to juror bowden was improperly based upon purposeful discrimination,but then,upon reconsideration,the trial court found the challenge constitutional.the michigan appellate court affirmed this finding on another petitioner had failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination.the focus of our review,as explained above,is on whether the decisions of
