this is an appeal brought by the commonwealth of massachusetts commonwealth from the district court grant of a writ of habeas corpus to appellee james lattimore lattimore.on april,lattimore brought a petition for habeas corpus pursuant to supp.ii,in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.he asserted that his murder conviction in the massachusetts superior court violated the federal constitution because his appellate counsel had been ineffective by not complaining,on direct appeal to the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc,of the trial judge refusal to instruct on manslaughter rejecting the commonwealth contentions that lattimore habeas claim was and that lattimore had not shown sufficient cause and prejudice to overcome his procedural default in not preserving the ineffective assistance issue in the massachusetts courts,the district court granted the writ.however,the district court stayed the writ execution so as to allow this court to determine first the commonwealth appeal.
we reverse,on the ground that lattimore did not file his habeas petition within the grace period for defendants whose convictions occurred prior to the passage of the and effective death penalty act of,stat.aedpa.we also conclude that there is no basis for equitable tolling of the grace period,given the many years available to lattimore for filing a habeas petition,his failure to show sufficient cause for his state procedural default,and,in the end,the lack of merit of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.
procedural background 
state proceedings 
lattimore was indicted by a grand jury for the murder of robert phillips phillips,armed assault with intent to murder glen smith,and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon upon glen smith smith.on june,after a jury trial in the massachusetts superior court,lattimore was found guilty as charged on each of the counts.he was sentenced to life imprisonment for first degree murder.he was also sentenced concurrently to nine to ten years imprisonment for the armed assault with intent to murder and the assault and battery with a dangerous weapon.
the facts presented below are taken from the opinion of the sjc in commonwealth lattimore,with supplementation from the state trial record the shooting for which lattimore was convicted arose from what the sjc described as a neighborhood brawl.id.at.smith was the divorced husband of linda smith linda whom lattimore had been dating for several weeks prior to the murder.testimony at trial revealed that smith had physically abused linda over a period of years,both during their marriage and after their divorce.there was evidence that during the week prior to the homicide smith sometimes surveilled his apartment from his parked car and had spoken with lattimore about the latter relationship with linda.in the early afternoon on october,smith went to linda apartment and broke down the door.linda was struck and apparently bruised by the door.diane smith,smith,and brenda lucas,a friend who lived in the same building as linda,were in linda apartment when smith forced his way in.both women witnessed and testified to the incident.lattimore was not present.diane smith called the police.linda went to the boston city hospital emergency room where she was treated and released later that afternoon.smith,after leaving,made a telephone call to brenda lucas castigating her for sheltering linda and also threatening her husband and diane smith husband for their roles in assisting linda.linda,meanwhile,had returned from the hospital and was present with the others through the early evening but left several hours prior to the homicide.
later that evening,smith returned in his car with phillips as a passenger.he circled diane smith apartment building and the nearby building where linda and the lucases lived,shouting threats and obscenities reflecting his anger at those who had been helping linda.at,brenda lucas called her husband,james lucas,at work to alert him to smith conduct,specifically that smith had threatened brenda for becoming involved in the dispute between him and linda earlier that afternoon.shortly after,when james lucas returned from work,his wife pointed out smith who was sitting in his parked car with phillips in a location near diane smith apartment.lucas drove over to smith car where smith sat,and demanded to know why smith was harassing the lucases.meanwhile brenda lucas who was in diane smith apartment at the time raced downstairs and ran to the smith vehicle carrying a baseball bat.no physical fight erupted,however,and james lucas testimony suggests he felt the altercation was calming down.
suddenly,shots were fired.according to smith trial testimony,lattimore had approached smith car from behind,on the driver side and,without warning,shot several times through the back driver side window.two bullets struck smith,one lodged in his back and the other passed through his hand.another bullet struck phillips behind his ear,wounding him critically.phillips died several days later of the gunshot wound.smith,to the police and in his trial testimony,identified lattimore positively as the shooter of both men.both brenda lucas and her husband james testified to seeing lattimore at the time they heard the shots according to them,he was standing behind james lucas on the driver side.neither saw a gun nor saw lattimore shoot,but the shots came from where he was standing.brenda lucas testified to also seeing linda smith standing close to lattimore at this moment.her husband said that he did not see linda at the scene it was dark at the time.no witnesses testified that lattimore had been present at any of the day events prior to his appearance at the shooting,nor was there evidence of any conversation between him and the victims before he shot.
lattimore theory of defense,as argued by his counsel to the jury lattimore himself did not testify,was that linda smith,and not lattimore,must have pulled the trigger although no witness testified to having seen linda do so.lattimore presented no witnesses of his own other than an investigator who testified to being earlier told by james lucas that lucas had seen linda at the homicide scene.lattimore counsel,however,the government witnesses intensively,in particular the two lucases,diane smith and smith.all witnesses,except smith,emphasized glen smith violent behavior towards linda for many years,and smith himself testified to his frequent surveillance of his apartment.only brenda lucas testified to seeing linda standing in the dark next to lattimore at the shooting.lattimore counsel also brought out that his investigator had sought to interview linda prior to the trial but had been told by her that,on advice of counsel,she would not talk about the shooting.the prosecution sought to secure linda presence at trial but could not locate her.
although counsel urged,therefore,that lattimore was not guilty of having committed the homicide,defense counsel also requested the trial judge to give a manslaughter instruction.the following dialogue between the trial judge and defense counsel ensued 
court i am only going to send this case to the jury on either or murder or not guilty.i am not going to charge on manslaughter.there no evidence of manslaughter here.i think you agree to that,wo you sir 
counsel well,your honor,most respectfully,i would suggest to the court that,based on the testimony of the feelings between glen smith and his wife that day and the relationship that seems to have been established with lattimore,this could have been obviously it is the position of the defense that it was not done by could have been done in the heat of passion.
court i do think there is any evidence that,of heat of passion,here.even if linda smith were on trial,based on the present evidence,a judge could charge on manslaughter with respect to her,even if she were on trial.
counsel is it the court position that,because of the time factor,it too far removed.
court oh,certainly.i just do see any evidence here of adequate 
counsel all right.i would respectfully request my rights be preserved.
lattimore appealed directly from his conviction to the sjc.he was represented on his appeal by a new attorney who raised four issues the misuse of peremptory challenges to systematically exclude members of a discrete group the court failure to exclude two jurors challenged for cause the denial of lattimore motion for additional peremptory challenges and ineffective assistance of counsel based on defense counsel failure at trial to articulate a basis for the admissibility of certain evidence.appellate counsel did not claim as error on direct appeal that the trial judge had erred by rejecting the defense counsel request that,besides instructing on first and second degree murder as was done,the court also instruct the jury on manslaughter.
while the sjc rejected all four of lattimore articulated claims of error,it provided significant relief to lattimore through exercise of its power under.laws ch,the sjc substituted a finding of murder in the second degree for that of first degree murder.after reviewing the evidence the sjc concluded that 
the shots were wild and look ed like the consequences of an untoward,foolish introduction of a dangerous weapon in a fight not otherwise at lethal pitch,but if malice is suggested,it is not the deliberated or purposeful malice of an assassin.commonwealth king.
the overwhelming evidence is that smith,not the defendant,was intent on provoking an incident.we believe that the weight of the evidence supports the inference that the defendant criminal involvement was not of the nature that judge and juries,in weighing evidence,ordinarily equate with murder in the first degree.commonwealth williams.
lattimore,at.the case was remanded to the superior court for imposition of a finding of second degree murder and.lattimore was sentenced to life imprisonment for second degree murder.
soon thereafter,on july,lattimore,acting pro se,filed a motion for a new trial in the massachusetts superior court pursuant to rule b of the massachusetts rules of criminal procedure.in his motion,lattimore argued,inter alia,that it was error for the trial court to have refused defense counsel request to instruct the jury on manslaughter and that the judge charge to the jury regarding the commonwealth burden of proof had misstated the law.lattimore also filed a motion for the appointment of counsel.the motions were denied by the superior court without a hearing.
lattimore appealed to the massachusetts appeals court from the denial of his motion for a new trial.he also requested the massachusetts appeals court to appoint counsel on his behalf.the appeals court appointed counsel for lattimore,as requested.counsel reiterated the claims of errors raised in lattimore motion for a new trial,including that the trial judge had committed error by denying the request to instruct on manslaughter.counsel did not,however,attempt to argue that appellate counsel had been ineffective on direct appeal to the sjc for omitting to claim as error the trial judge refusal to instruct on manslaughter.
the massachusetts appeals court affirmed the superior court denial of a new trial.in its decision,the appeals court noted that the issues raised in the motion for a new trial had not been raised on direct appeal.as a result,the appeals court concluded 
the defendant entire case has already been reviewed,and he has received a reduction of his verdict pursuant to.laws ch,it is apparent from the record that there is no risk of a miscarriage of justice in any of his newly asserted claims.

lattimore,acting through his appointed appellate counsel,then filed an application for further appellate review alofar with the supreme judicial court.for the first time,he argued that his counsel had rendered ineffective assistance on direct appeal to the sjc by not raising the issue of the trial court refusal to give a manslaughter instruction.the sjc denied lattimore alofar.
several years later,in june,lattimore filed in the superior court another motion for a new trial.he asserted in that motion that the trial judge reasonable doubt instructions had been constitutionally defective and that his appellate counsel had been ineffective in not raising the reasonable doubt error on direct appeal.lattimore did not,in his further new trial motion,raise the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal based on counsel failure to have claimed error based upon the trial judge refusal to instruct on manslaughter.lattimore once more filed a motion for the appointment of counsel to assist him in his further motion for new trial.on june,the superior court entered an order refusing to act on these matters.the order stated i t is clear that the present motion does not raise any issues which could not have been raised in the prior appeals including petitioner first motion for new trial.accordingly,i refused to act on this motion,and i have directed the clerk office to make this notation on the motion.the court denied lattimore motion for appointment of counsel.lattimore did not appeal.
federal proceedings 
lattimore petition for writ of habeas corpus under was entered on the docket of the district court for the district of massachusetts on monday,april.the petition included the two related claims that petitioner had received ineffective assistance of appellate counsel because of counsel failure to claim as error on direct appeal the state trial court refusal to instruct on manslaughter,and that the state trial court had committed error amounting to a miscarriage of justice,see supra,note,when it refused to charge on manslaughter as requested.the civil cover sheet on the habeas petition was signed and dated friday,april.
on june,the commonwealth moved to dismiss the petition as under aedpa.aedpa contains a statute of limitations set forth in d limiting to one year the time within which a person in custody pursuant to a judgment of the state court may apply for a writ of habeas corpus the time for prisoners whose state convictions became final prior to aedpa to apply for a writ has since been held to be one year running from aedpa effective date,april.gaskins duval,cir.on august,prior to our pronouncement in gaskins,the district court issued an order denying the commonwealth motion.
i am not inclined to dismiss the petition because lattimore filed it on april,instead of april,date suggested by the respondent as the absolute.prior to aedpa,habeas petitioners did not have to hew to a particular statute of limitations,and i decline to require such unduly strict adherence in lattimore case.
lattimore dubois.august,order denying motion to dismiss.
having lost on the argument,the commonwealth contended that lattimore habeas claims were procedurally defaulted in the state courts and that lattimore could demonstrate neither the cause nor prejudice necessary to revive them.the district court disagreed that lattimore was unable to meet the stringent cause and prejudice standard.it found adequate cause for the default in the superior court alleged abuse of discretion when it refused to appoint counsel to assist lattimore with his initial new trial motion,and when it did not hold a hearing on that motion.according to the district court,h ad there been a hearing the commonwealth would have raised the fact that the manslaughter issue had never been raised on appeal had there been counsel he or she would likely have amended the motion to include a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel or raised it during the hearing.lattimore dubois,d.further,the district court concluded that lattimore had demonstrated actual prejudice from the defaulted ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim.in so concluding,the court stated that 
the record is clear that counsel inexplicably ignored a significant and obvious trial judge failure to instruct the jury on favor of three less worthy claims t he evidence surrounding the killing of robert phillips fairly raised the issue of voluntary manslaughter.the trial judge refusal to so charge the jury,over the repeated requests and objections from defense counsel,constituted reversible error under massachusetts law.there was no conceivable strategic reason to drop this issue on appeal.
id.at.the court reasoned that had appellate counsel raised the failure to instruct on manslaughter on direct appeal,there is plainly a reasonable probability that the outcome of his direct appeal would have been different.id.at.the district court opined 
and by failing to raise it,lattimore appellate counsel relinquished the possibility of his client receiving a maximum statutory sentence for voluntary manslaughter,ch,and ensured a sentence of life imprisonment,ch.
id.lattimore petition for a writ of habeas corpus was granted.
the commonwealth appealed.
ii.discussion 
grace period 
the commonwealth asserts that the district court erred when it ruled that lattimore petition for habeas corpus,deposited in the prison mail system on april,and docketed on april,was timely.we agree.the effective date of aedpa,providing prisoners a statute of limitations for habeas petitions,was april.it is established in this circuit,as elsewhere,that the grace period for prisoners whose state convictions became final prior to aedpa to file a petition under is one year.gaskins,at.the grace period runs from the date of aedpa enactment and ends on april.rogers united states,cir see also duncan walker,d stevens,concurring noting that the courts of appeals have uniformly created a grace period,running from the date of aedpa enactment.
lattimore petition was docketed on april,four days after the grace period expired.if lattimore is given the benefit of the prisoner mailbox rule,see united states,cir holding the prisoner mailbox rule is applicable to petitions filed pursuant to,and his petition were deemed to be filed on april,the date it was allegedly deposited in the prison mail system,his petition was still one day late and hence barred 
while lattimore concedes that,pursuant to the current case law,his petition was untimely,he argues that at the time he filed his petition in the proper measurement of the year in this circuit had yet to be established and was insufficiently clear to exclude a petition that was filed on april.he says he lacked adequate notice that the grace period would end on april and not april.to support his argument,lattimore cites to two district courts within this circuit that opted for the april,date in decisions rendered after he filed his petition.
considered as a legal argument,lattimore contention is without merit.wrong guesses,even reasonable ones,as to precisely how a new statute of limitations will be authoritatively applied do not entitle a disappointed petitioner to relaxation of rules once adopted.see united states marcello,cir,cert.denied,d denying a motion filed one day late because of confusion over the applicable deadline.the language in aedpa put petitioners,including those with preexisting causes of action,on notice of congress new limitations.in instances where congress has altered an established statute of limitations,courts have commonly construed the grace period for preexisting claims to be the shorter of the original limitation period,or the new,shortened limitation period,commencing from the date the statute became effective.see rogers,at brown angelone,cir united states flores,cir.under existing case law,it could be expected that someone in lattimore position would be allowed one year to file,measured from the effective date of the aedpa,april.when a limitations period is measured in years,the last day for instituting the action is traditionally the anniversary date of the start of the limitations period.rogers,at citing.a.one in lattimore shoes had no reason to be surprised that his petition was out of time.
we note that before lattimore had filed his petition,two circuit courts and the department of justice doj had spoken regarding the applicable grace period.peterson demskie,cir no need to accord full year lindh murphy,cir en banc,rev on other grounds,d implied period ended on april.the doj official position,announced in a memo dated june,was that it would not seek to enforce the limitations period against prisoners convicted prior to aedpa until one year after the act took april.mickens united states,cir.
as a legal proposition,therefore,lattimore petition was too late.we turn next to whether it could or should be tolled equitably.
equitable tolling 
anticipating our conclusion,lattimore requests that his petition be remanded to the district court for consideration of his equitable tolling argument.bending backwards,we shall assume for purposes of argument that lattimore preserved his equitable tolling claim below.see neverson bissonnette,cir liberally construing a pro se prisoner petition to include an equitable tolling argument.in his response to the commonwealth motion to dismiss,lattimore argued against the application of the grace period because he has limited knowledge of the law,is a pro se litigant,and his freedom and liberty is controled sic by the department of corrections personal sic,and he has limited access to the courts.
even if we assume arguendo that equitable tolling would be available in an appropriate case a proposition not so far established in this circuit,lattimore has pointed to insufficient facts to warrant favorable application of that doctrine here.as the party seeking to invoke the doctrine of equitable tolling,lattimore bears the burden of establishing a basis for it.trenkler united states,cir.we have made it pellucid that equitable tolling,if available at all,is the exception rather than the rule and that resort to its prophylaxis is deemed justified only in extraordinary circumstances.donovan maine,cir.it is reserved for cases in which circumstances beyond the litigant control have prevented him from promptly filing.trenkler,at delaney matesanz,cir.ignorance of the law alone,even for incarcerated pro se prisoners,does not excuse an untimely filing.delaney,at citing fisher johnson,cir,cert.denied,d.in this case,lattimore had ample time to exhaust his state law claims and pursue habeas relief.instead he waited over a decade after his direct appeals were completed before pursuing habeas relief in.
lattimore claim,moreover,is of dubious merit.brackett united states,cir equitable tolling unavailable to resuscitate a claim lacking in merit,cert.denied,d.the sole constitutional claim in lattimore habeas petition is that his state appellate counsel was ineffective for not asserting as error,on direct appeal to the sjc,the superior court refusal to instruct on manslaughter unlike the district court,we are not persuaded of the potential strength of lattimore claim,nor are we persuaded that lattimore met the cause and prejudice prerequisites.
first,it is doubtful there is cause sufficient to excuse lattimore procedural default in not having placed his constitutional claim properly before the state judiciary.the district court based its cause finding upon the superior court alleged abuse of discretion under state law in refusing to appoint counsel to assist lattimore in that court.but lattimore did not appeal to the massachusetts appeals court from the court refusal to appoint counsel.his failure to appeal results in a separate procedural default relative to the appointment of counsel issue.adequate cause can not rest upon a ground that has itself been procedurally defaulted,at least without identifying some additional adequate cause to justify that default.edwards carpenter,d.
second,even were lattimore to show cause,he has not established that his appellate counsel was in fact ineffective for not raising the manslaughter instruction error on direct appeal.murray carrier,d lattimore has not demonstrated that there is a reasonable probability that the result of the appeal would have been different absent the attorney purported error in not pressing the manslaughter issue.strickland washington,d.
the record evidence does not make out a viable case of voluntary manslaughter as that term has so far been interpreted in massachusetts jurisprudence.to warrant a manslaughter instruction,there must be adequate provocation for the defendant to kill.commonwealth schnopps.and the killing must have been in the heat of passion.commonwealth pitts,holding manslaughter instruction not warranted if there
