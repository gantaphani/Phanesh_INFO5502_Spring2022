horacio montenegro appeals a dismissal of his motion for failure to file within the limitations period.we affirm.
on october,a grand jury returned a indictment against horacio montenegro and two others,charging them with conspiracy to distribute and possession with the intent to distribute more than grams of cocaine,in violation of a and and.pursuant to a plea agreement with the government,montenegro entered a plea of guilty,and was sentenced to months imprisonment.the district court entered judgment on the conviction and sentence on april.on march,montenegro filed a motion pursuant to,which the district court dismissed on june.the court held that because montenegro filed this motion months after his conviction and sentence became final,it was barred by the statute of limitations embodied in.the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of added a limitations period to motions,and required federal prisoners who wished to appeal final orders on motions to obtain a certificate of appealability from the court of appeals.see.following montenegro petition to this court,we granted him a limited certificate of appealability on the questions of when the time limit began to run and whether montenegro had filed his motion within that limit.montenegro argued that the limitations period began to run in,when he first discovered that his appeal had not been filed.finding the record devoid of adequate information to determine the merits of the appeal,this court issued an order remanding the case to the district court for an evidentiary hearing on the issue of montenegro diligence 
the district court held an evidentiary hearing on december,at which montenegro called two witnesses his trial counsel,nikola kostich,and himself.kostich testified that he did not recall montenegro instructing him to file a notice of appeal,and testified that,if he had been instructed to file an appeal,he would have done so.kostich also testified that,based on his practice and routine,the lack of notes or documents in his file about an appeal meant that he had not been directed to file one.montenegro testified that he instructed kostich to file a notice of appeal immediately after his sentencing.montenegro also testified that while he was incarcerated following his sentencing,he asked an inmate to write a letter to kostich requesting transcripts of his plea and sentencing he testified that he did not dictate the contents of the letter because he can speak little english.the letter was not intended to inquire about an appeal,and it did not do so.in response to the letter,kostich sent montenegro a copy of the docket sheet.montenegro was later transferred to another prison about one year after his sentencing.there,several inmates informed montenegro that appeals could take a year or longer,and so montenegro simply waited to hear the outcome of his appeal.he did not determine that an appeal had not been filed until the middle of,and he did not file a motion until march.
following the evidentiary hearing,the district court decided that montenegro had not instructed his counsel to file a notice of appeal,and that he had not exercised due diligence in determining that an appeal of his case had not been filed.on the first issue,the court reasoned that kostich is an experienced criminal defense attorney with an excellent reputation,and thus credited his testimony that,if someone instructs him to file a notice of appeal,he will do so.it also reasoned that it would not make sense for kostich not to appeal a case and thereby lose a paying client.as to the issue whether montenegro exercised due diligence,the district court determined that he did not.the only contact montenegro made with his lawyer was through the september,letter,in which he did not inquire about the status of his appeal.the court also cited davenport davenport son in concluding that lack of sophistication is irrelevant to due diligence inquiries.cir,overruled on other grounds by short belleville shoe,cir.the court concluded that montenegro was not diligent because when he received a docket sheet in response to his request for a transcript,that should have been a red flag that the appeal was not being processed he did not call or write to kostich or the court to inquire about his appeal any language barrier would not have prevented kostich from determining from the docket which there was no record of an an appeal had not been filed,particularly because someone assisted him in translating the docket sheet and the letter did not inquire about the status of an appeal.montenegro filed a notice of appeal and a motion for issuance of a certificate of appealability.the district court issued a certificate of appealability.
ineffective assistance of counsel 
although this court remanded this case for an evidentiary hearing solely on the issue of montenegro diligence,the district court also made a finding that kostich had not provided ineffective assistance of counsel,and that is the issue on which the district court certified the appeal.montenegro argues that kostich failed to provide effective assistance of counsel in violation of the sixth amendment by failing to file an appeal,failing to consult with montenegro about the merits of his appeal and failing to consult with montenegro about how to obtain a transcript of his plea and sentencing proceedings.to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim,montenegro must show that his attorney performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that the deficient performance caused him prejudice.see strickland washington,d united states boyles,cir.failure to file an appeal when one has been requested constitutes a per se violation.see castellanos united states,cir.the district court found that montenegro did not ask kostich to file an appeal,and that therefore kostich did not render ineffective assistance by not filing one.the court reasoned that kostich was an experienced criminal defense attorney with an excellent reputation,and it had no reason to doubt kostich testimony someone instructs him to file a notice of will do so.second,the court reasoned,it made no sense that kostich,if asked to appeal,would reject a paying client.third,if there had been a discussion,there would have been some record of it in kostich file.
the court concluded that montenegro did request transcripts in a letter sent to kostich,and that kostich neither sent the transcripts nor told montenegro how he might obtain them.it also concluded that,because of the lack of notes in kostich file,there had been no discussion of the possibility of appeal between kostich and montenegro.we are not satisfied that the court evidentiary proceeding addressed all the concerns of montenegro ineffective assistance claim,particularly in light of the requirement that a criminal defense attorney consult with his client if there are any nonfrivolous grounds for appeal.see roe,d.but we need not go into this potentially contentious issue,because montenegro loses on the grounds of timeliness.
ii.due diligence and 
the parties have ignored the limits of the district court certificate of appealability,and made substantial arguments on the due diligence issue further,this court remanded the case specifically for consideration of montenegro due was the apparent focus of the district court thus we will now address that issue.
prior to the enactment of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,there was no statute of limitations for filing a motion.under the new law,a limitation period applies.the period runs from the latest of four events 
the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final 
the date on which the impediment to making a motion created by governmental action in violation of the constitution or laws of the united states is removed,if the movant was prevented from making a motion by such governmental action 
the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the supreme court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review or 
the date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.
montenegro argues that his claim is not because the dates described in and are within the limitations period.we shall first address his argument under that he could not have discovered the facts supporting his claim prior to march.whether montenegro could have discovered the facts earlier depends on how due diligence is defined.
this court has been unable to find any appellate decisions setting forth the standard of review of a district court decision concerning due diligence in the context of.the government argues that the appropriate standard of review should be similar to the standard applied to rule cases abuse of discretion.rule governs decisions on motions for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence,in which courts apply an abuse of discretion standard of review.see.united states woolfolk,cir united states austin,cir.in support of using this analogy,the government notes the high degree of similarity between and rule,in that both have a limitation period,affect the liberty interests of the defendant and require a showing that the evidence could not have been discovered sooner through due diligence.but the analogy is incomplete.rule provides that the court,on motion of a defendant,may grant a new trial to that defendant if the interests of justice so require.the decision is therefore committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge.woolfolk,at.by contrast,provides that the limitations period will run from the latest of four specified events.nothing in the language implies discretion committed to the trial judge.rather,it involves a finding of due diligence was by a determination that the factual scenario satisfies the strict confines of the statute.thus,clear error review is more appropriate.
the better analogy for a due diligence finding on a motion is to rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure,which assigns to the trial judge the responsibility of determining not only the historical events that are relevant to how the case should be decided but also the legal significance of those events.see mucha king,cir.this means that legal characterizations,such as negligence,possession,ratification,principal place of business and the like are facts to which the clearly erroneous standard applies.see id.due diligence is one such characterization,and we therefore review the district court decision on this issue for clear error.it is undisputed that,if montenegro used due diligence to discover kostich failure to file the appeal,he timely filed his motion.this has nothing to do with discretion,or the abuse of it.
montenegro argues that the supreme court interpretation of due diligence in e a ii should apply to an interpretation of due diligence in.see williams taylor,d.williams,a case,held that due diligence is considered in light of the information available at the time and that it does not depend on whether the prisoner efforts would have been successful at uncovering the underlying facts.see.at.the analogy to is probably appropriate,even though the relevant provision applies to a determination whether an applicant is excused from a failure to develop the factual basis for the claim in state court proceedings.see e.but we need not decide that here,because even under hints that a prisoner special circumstances may have an impact on the due diligence district court due diligence finding would stand.as we conclude below,montenegro failed to meet even the most lenient standard of diligence.
in wims united states the second circuit addressed a case similar to montenegro,and concluded that t he proper task in a case such as this one is to determine when a duly diligent person in petitioner circumstances would have discovered that no appeal had been filed,cir.thus,the court held,an evaluation of whether due diligence was exercised must take into account the conditions of confinement and the reality of the prison system.see id.at citing easterwood champion,cir.we agree with the second circuit a due diligence analysis under requires consideration of a prisoner individual circumstances.thus,we reject the reliance by both the district court and the government on davenport davenport son,cir.first,davenport addressed the issue whether the statute of limitations should be equitably tolled,which is a wholly different inquiry from whether the defendant in a habeas proceeding fits within the exception to the statute of limitations.we discuss the issue of equitable tolling in section iv of this opinion.for now,it is sufficient to say that davenport,a securities fraud case in which the defendant sought equitable tolling,does nothing to assist our evaluation of a habeas petitioner diligence under.
montenegro next argues that his lack of sophistication should support a finding that he exercised due diligence.this argument places davenport cited by the government at odds with two state court cases cited by montenegro and we hardly need to address a conflict between a distinguishable case and a case.neither is relevant here.the government argues that,under davenport,montenegro lack of sophistication is irrelevant to the due diligence inquiry.montenegro argues that davenport is distinguishable because it is a securities case and because the plaintiff was represented by counsel throughout the relevant securities transaction.he is correct.due diligence in the securities regulation context is a far cry from due diligence in a criminal procedure context.we need not reach the lack of sophistication issue,however,taking montenegro lack of sophistication into find that he did not exercise due diligence.we need say only that it is possible,under some circumstances,that lack of sophistication could become part of a due diligence analysis,because the limitations with which a prisoner is faced might influence how quickly facts could have been discovered.see wims,at.but the facts of the case before us indicate that the district court could reasonably have concluded that montenegro did not exercise due diligence,regardless of the standard of review or the level of deference due to the district court.that an appeal had not been filed was a matter of public record,which reasonable diligence could have unearthed.owens boyd,cir.about six months after his conviction and sentence were final,montenegro had the docket sheet that revealed that an appeal in his case had not been filed,and he never asked kostich about the appeal.on the basis of these facts,the district court did find that,even with the language barrier and other difficulties faced by montenegro,due diligence would have revealed that an appeal had not been filed.we agree.
montenegro next argues that his motion is timely under because a right newly recognized by the supreme court is retroactively applicable to his case on collateral review.section provides that the limitation period will begin running on the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the supreme court,if that right has been newly recognized by the supreme court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.montenegro bases his argument on the supreme court holding in roe,d.there,the court held that defendants counsel have a duty to consult with the defendant about an appeal when there is reason to think either that a rational defendant would want to appeal for example,because there are nonfrivolous grounds for appeal,or that this particular defendant reasonably demonstrated to counsel that he was interested in appealing.id.at.the government attempts to play down the impact of by arguing that that decision merely provides instruction on the application of the strickland test to a particular fact situation.to prevail on an ineffective assistance claim based on counsel failure to file a notice of appeal,a defendant must satisfy the familiar test of strickland washington,d.under strickland,the defendant must first demonstrate that his counsel performance was deficient by showing that it was unreasonable under prevailing professional norms.see id.at.
it is neither necessary nor appropriate for us to decide at this time whether the portion of flores ortega on which montenegro relies establishes a newly
