in martinez ryan,this court held that a procedural default will not bar a federal habeas court from hearing a substantial claim of ineffective assistance at trial if,in the state collateral proceeding,there was no counsel or counsel in that proceeding was ineffective.martinez regarded a prisoner from arizona,where state procedural law required the prisoner to raise the claim during his first state collateral review proceeding.ibid.this case regards a prisoner from texas,where state procedural law does not require a defendant to raise his claim on collateral review.rather,texas law appears to permit a prisoner to raise such a claim on direct review,but the structure and design of the texas system make it virtually impossible for a prisoner to do so.the question presented in this case is whether,despite this difference,the rule set out in martinez applies in texas.
petitioner trevino was convicted of capital murder in texas state court and sentenced to death after the jury found insufficient mitigating circumstances to warrant a life sentence.neither new counsel appointed for his direct appeal nor new counsel appointed for state collateral review raised the claim that trevino trial counsel provided ineffective assistance during the penalty phase by failing to adequately investigate and present mitigating circumstances.when that claim was finally raised in trevino federal habeas petition,the district court stayed the proceedings so trevino could raise it in state court.the state court found the claim procedurally defaulted because of trevino failure to raise it in his initial state postconviction proceedings,and the federal court then concluded that this failure was an independent and adequate state ground barring the federal courts from considering the claim.the fifth circuit affirmed.its decision predated martinez,but that court has since concluded that martinez does not apply in texas because martinez exception applies only where state law says that a defendant must initially raise his claim in initial state collateral review proceedings,while texas law appears to permit a defendant to raise that claim on direct appeal.
held where,as here,a state procedural framework,by reason of its design and operation,makes it highly unlikely in a typical case that a defendant will have a meaningful opportunity to raise an claim on direct appeal,the exception recognized in martinez applies.
a a finding that a defendant state law procedural default rests on an independent and adequate state ground ordinarily prevents a federal habeas court from considering the defendant federal constitutional claim.coleman thompson.however,a prisoner may obtain federal review of a defaulted claim by showing cause for the default and prejudice from a violation of the federal law.martinez,supra,at.in martinez,the court recognized a narrow exception to coleman statement that an attorney ignorance or inadvertence in a postconviction proceeding does not qualify as cause to excuse a procedural default.at.that exception allows a federal habeas court to find cause to excuse such default where the claim was a substantial claim the cause consisted of there being no counsel or only ineffective counsel during the state collateral review proceeding the state collateral review proceeding was the initial review proceeding in respect to the claim and state law requires that the claim be raised in an collateral proceeding.at.
b the difference between the texas law which in theory grants permission to bring an claim on direct appeal but in practice denies a meaningful opportunity to do so and the arizona law at issue in martinez which required the claim to be raised in an initial collateral review proceeding does not matter in respect to the application of martinez.
this conclusion is supported by two characteristics of texas procedures.first,texas procedures make it nearly impossible for an claim to be presented on direct review.the nature of an claim means that the trial record is likely to be insufficient to support the claim.and a motion for a new trial to develop the record is usually inadequate because of texas rules regarding time limits on the filing,and the disposal,of such motions and the availability of trial transcripts.thus,a writ of habeas corpus is normally needed to gather the facts necessary for evaluating these claims in texas.second,were martinez not to apply,the texas procedural system would create significant unfairness because texas courts in effect have directed defendants to raise claims on collateral,rather than on direct,review.texas can point to only a few cases in which a defendant has used the mechanism to expand the record on appeal.texas suggests that there are other mechanisms by which a prisoner can expand the record on appeal,but these mechanisms seem special and limited in their application,and can not overcome the texas courts own determination that collateral review normally is the preferred procedural route for raising an claim.respondent also argues that there is no equitable problem here,where appellate counsel failure to bring a substantial claim on direct appeal may constitute cause to excuse the procedural default,but respondent points to no case in which such a failure by appellate counsel has been deemed constitutionally ineffective.
the very factors that led this court to create a narrow exception to coleman in martinez similarly argue for applying that exception here.the right involved adequate assistance of trial counsel is similarly and critically important.in both instances practical considerations the need for a new lawyer,the need to expand the trial court record,and the need for sufficient time to develop the claim argue strongly for initial consideration of the claim during collateral,not on direct,review.see martinez,at.in both instances failure to consider a lawyer ineffectiveness during an collateral proceeding as a potential cause for excusing a procedural default will deprive the defendant of any opportunity for review of an claim.see,at.thus,for present purposes,a distinction between a state that denies permission to raise the claim on direct appeal and a state that grants permission but denies a fair,meaningful opportunity to develop the claim is a distinction without a difference.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit 
justice breyer delivered the opinion of the court.
in martinez ryan,we considered the right of a state prisoner to raise,in a federal habeas corpus proceeding,a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.in that case an arizona procedural rule required a defendant convicted at trial to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel during his first state collateral review proceeding or lose the claim.the defendant in martinez did not comply with the state procedural rule.but he argued that the federal habeas court should excuse his state procedural failing,on the ground that he had good cause for not raising the claim at the right time,namely that,not only had he lacked effective counsel during trial,but also he lacked effective counsel during his first state collateral review proceeding.
we held that lack of counsel on collateral review might excuse defendant state law procedural default.we wrote 
a procedural default will not bar a federal habeas court from hearing a substantial claim of ineffective assistance at trial if,in the state collateral proceeding,there was no counsel or counsel in that proceeding was ineffective.at slip,at.
at the same time we qualified our holding.we said that the holding applied where state procedural law said that claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel must be raised in an collateral proceeding.ibid.emphasis added.
in this case texas state law does not say must.it does not on its face require a defendant initially to raise an claim in a state collateral review proceeding.rather,that law appears at first glance to permit but not require the defendant initially to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel on direct appeal.the structure and design of the texas system in actual operation,however,make it virtually impossible for an ineffective assistance claim to be presented on direct review.see robinson state.crim.app.we must now decide whether the martinez exception applies in this procedural regime.we conclude that it does.
a texas state court jury convicted petitioner,carlos trevino,of capital murder.after a subsequent hearing,the jury found that trevino would commit criminal acts of violence in the future which would constitute a continuing threat to society,that he actually caused the death of linda salinas or,if he did not actually cause her death,he intended to kill her or another,or he anticipated a human life would be taken,and that there were insufficient mitigating circumstances to warrant a sentence of life imprisonment rather than death.fed.appx.the judge consequently imposed a sentence of death.
eight days later the judge appointed new counsel to handle trevino direct appeal.app.seven months after sentencing,when the trial transcript first became available,that counsel filed an appeal.the texas court of criminal appeals then considered and rejected trevino appellate claims.trevino appellate counsel did not claim that trevino trial counsel had been constitutionally ineffective during the penalty phase of the trial court proceedings,at.
about six months after sentencing,the trial judge appointed trevino a different new counsel to seek state collateral relief.as texas procedural rules provide,that third counsel initiated collateral proceedings while trevino appeal still was in progress.this new counsel first sought postconviction relief through collateral review in the trial court itself.after a hearing,the trial court denied relief and the texas court of criminal appeals affirmed that denial,at.trevino postconviction claims included a claim that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective during the penalty phase of trevino trial,but it did not include a claim that trial counsel ineffectiveness consisted in part of a failure adequately to investigate and to present mitigating circumstances during the penalty phase of trevino trial,at see wiggins smith,counsel failure to investigate and present mitigating circumstances deprived defendant of effective assistance of counsel.
trevino then filed a petition in federal court seeking a writ of habeas corpus.the federal district court appointed another new counsel to represent him.and that counsel claimed for the first time that trevino had not received constitutionally effective counsel during the penalty phase of his trial in part because of trial counsel failure to adequately investigate and present mitigating circumstances during the penalty phase.app.federal habeas counsel pointed out that trevino trial counsel had presented only one witness at the sentencing phase,namely trevino aunt.the aunt had testified that trevino had had a difficult upbringing,that his mother had an alcohol problem,that his family was on welfare,and that he had dropped out of high school.she had added that trevino had a child,that he was good with children,and that he was not violent,at.
federal habeas counsel then told the federal court that trevino trial counsel should have found and presented at the penalty phase other mitigating matters that his own investigation had brought to light.these included,among other things,that trevino mother abused alcohol while she was pregnant with trevino,that trevino weighed only four pounds at birth,that throughout his life trevino suffered the deleterious effects of fetal alcohol syndrome,that as a child trevino had suffered numerous head injuries without receiving adequate medical attention,that trevino mother had abused him physically and emotionally,that from an early age trevino was exposed to,and abused,alcohol and drugs,that trevino had attended school irregularly and performed poorly,and that trevino cognitive abilities were impaired,at.
the federal court stayed proceedings to permit trevino to raise this claim in state court.the state court held that because trevino had not raised this claim during his initial postconviction proceedings,he had procedurally defaulted the claim,at and the federal district court then denied trevino claim,at.the district court concluded in relevant part that,despite the fact that even the most minimal investigation would have revealed a wealth of additional mitigating evidence,an independent and adequate state ground namely trevino failure to raise the issue during his state postconviction proceeding barred the federal habeas court from considering the claim,at.see coleman thompson.
trevino appealed.the fifth circuit,without considering the merits of trevino claim,agreed with the district court that an independent,adequate state ground,namely trevino procedural default,barred its consideration.fed,at.although the circuit decided trevino case before this court decided martinez,the fifth circuit reasoning in a later case,ibarra thaler,makes clear that the fifth circuit would have found that martinez would have made no difference.
that is because in ibarra the circuit recognized that martinez had said that its exception applies where state law says that a criminal defendant must initially raise his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel in initial state collateral review proceedings,at.texas law,the circuit pointed out,does not say explicitly that the defendant must initially raise the claim in state collateral review proceedings.rather texas law on its face appears to permit a criminal defendant to raise such a claim on direct appeal,at.and the circuit held that that fact means that martinez does not apply in texas,at.since the circuit holding in ibarra that martinez does not apply in texas would similarly govern this case,we granted certiorari here to determine whether martinez applies in texas.
we begin with martinez.we there recognized the historic importance of federal habeas corpus proceedings as a method for preventing individuals from being held in custody in violation of federal law.martinez,at slip,at.see generally preiser rodriguez.in general,if a convicted state criminal defendant can show a federal habeas court that his conviction rests upon a violation of the federal constitution,he may well obtain a writ of habeas corpus that requires a new trial,a new sentence,or release.
we similarly recognized the importance of federal habeas corpus principles designed to prevent federal courts from interfering with a state application of its own firmly established,consistently followed,constitutionally proper procedural rules.martinez,supra,at slip,at.those principles have long made clear that a conviction that rests upon a defendant state law procedural default for example,the defendant failure to raise a claim of error at the time or in the place that state law requires,normally rests upon an independent and adequate state ground.coleman,at.and where a conviction rests upon such a ground,a federal habeas court normally can not consider the defendant federal constitutional claim.see martinez,at slip,at.
at the same time,we pointed out that t he doctrine barring procedurally defaulted claims from being heard is not without exceptions.a prisoner may obtain federal review of a defaulted claim by showing cause for the default and prejudice from a violation of federal law.at slip,at.and we turned to the issue directly before the court whether martinez had shown cause to excuse his state procedural failing,at slip,at.
martinez argued that his lawyer should have raised,but did not raise,his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel during state collateral review proceedings,at slip,at.he added that this failure,itself amounting to ineffective assistance,was the cause of,and ought to excuse,his procedural default,at slip,at.but this court had previously held that n egligence on the part of a prisoner postconviction attorney does not qualify as,primarily because a principal such as the prisoner,bears the risk of negligent conduct on the part of his agent,the attorney.maples thomas,slip,at quoting coleman,supra,at emphasis added.martinez,in effect,argued for an exception to coleman broad statement of the law.
we ultimately held that a narrow exception should modify the unqualified statement in coleman that an attorney ignorance or inadvertence in a postconviction proceeding does not qualify as cause to excuse a procedural default.martinez,at slip,at.we did so for three reasons.first,the right to the effective assistance of counsel at trial is a bedrock principle in our justice system.indeed,the right to counsel is the foundation for our adversary system.at slip,at.
second,ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appellate review could amount to cause,excusing a defendant failure to raise and thus procedurally defaulting a constitutional claim,at slip,at.but states often have good reasons for initially reviewing claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel during state collateral proceedings rather than on direct appellate review,at slip,at.that is because review of such a claim normally requires a different attorney,because it often depend s on evidence outside the trial record,and because efforts to expand the record on direct appeal may run afoul of a bbreviated deadlines,depriving the new attorney of adequate time to investigate the claim.at slip,at.
third,where the state consequently channels initial review of this constitutional claim to collateral proceedings,a lawyer failure to raise an claim during collateral proceedings,could were coleman read broadly deprive a defendant of any review of that claim at all.martinez,supra,at slip,at.
we consequently read coleman as containing an exception,allowing a federal habeas court to find cause,thereby excusing a defendant procedural default,where the claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel was a substantial claim the cause consisted of there being no counsel or only ineffective counsel during the state collateral review proceeding the state collateral review proceeding was the initial review proceeding in respect to the claim and state law requires that an ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim be raised in an collateral proceeding.martinez,supra,at slip,at.
here state law differs from that in martinez in respect to the fourth requirement.unlike arizona,texas does not expressly require the defendant to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel in an initial collateral review proceeding.rather texas law on its face appears to permit but not require the defendant to raise the claim on direct appeal.does this difference matter 
two characteristics of the relevant texas procedures lead us to conclude that it should not make a difference in respect to the application of martinez.first,texas procedure makes it virtually impossible for appellate counsel to adequately present an ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim on direct review.robinson,at.as the texas court of criminal appeals itself has pointed out,the inherent nature of most ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims means that the trial court record will often fail to contai n the information necessary to substantiate the claim.ex parte torres,en banc.
as the court of criminal appeals has also noted,a convicted defendant may make a motion in the trial court for a new trial in order to develop the record on appeal.see reyes state.and,in principle,the trial court could,in connection with that motion,allow the defendant some additional time to develop a further record.ibid.but that vehicle is often inadequate because of time constraints and because the trial record has generally not been transcribed at this point.torres,supra,at.see.rule app.proc.motion for a new trial must be made within days of sentencing rules a,c trial court must dispose of motion within days of sentencing rules b,c transcript must be prepared within days of sentencing where a motion for a new trial is filed and this deadline may be extended.thus,as the court of criminal appeals has concluded,in texas a writ of habeas corpus issued in state collateral proceedings ordinarily is essential to gathering the facts necessary to evaluate claims.torres,supra,at.see robinson,supra,at noting that there is not generally a realistic opportunity to adequately develop the record for appeal in motions and that t he time requirements for filing and presenting a motion for new trial would have made it virtually impossible for appellate counsel to adequately present an ineffective assistance claim to the trial court 
see also thompson state,and.crim.app.i n the vast majority of cases,the undeveloped record on direct appeal will be insufficient for an appellant to satisfy the dual prongs of strickland only r arely will a reviewing court be provided the opportunity to make its determination on direct appeal with a record capable of providing a fair evaluation of the merits of the claim goodspeed state.crim.app.similar andrews state.crim.app.similar ex parte brown.crim.app.per curiam similar jackson state.crim.app.per curiam similar.see also dix schmolesky,texas practice series,ed.hereinafter texas practice explaining that o ften the requirement that a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel be supported by a record containing direct evidence of why counsel acted as he did will require that the claim be raised in postconviction habeas proceedings where a full record on the matter can be raised 
this opinion considers whether,as a systematic matter,texas affords meaningful review of a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.the present capital case illustrates why it does not.the trial court appointed new counsel for trevino eight days after sentencing.counsel thus had days to decide whether,and on what grounds,to make a motion for a new trial.she then may have had an additional days to provide support for the motion but without the help of a transcript which did not become available until much later seven months after the trial.it would have been difficult,perhaps impossible,within that time frame to investigate trevino background,determine whether trial counsel had adequately done so,and then develop evidence about additional mitigating background circumstances.see reyes,supra,at m otions for new trial must be supported by affidavit specifically showing the truth of the grounds of attack 
second,were martinez not to apply,the texas procedural system would create significant unfairness.that is because texas courts in effect have directed defendants to raise claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel on collateral,rather than on direct,review.as noted,they have explained why direct review proceedings are likely inadequate.see supra,at.they have held that failure to raise the claim on direct review does not bar the defendant from raising the claim in collateral proceedings.see,robinson,at ex parte duffy.crim.app.overruled on other grounds by hernandez state.crim.app.they have held that the defendant decision to raise the claim on direct review does not bar the defendant from also raising the claim in collateral proceedings.see,lopez state.crim.app.torres,supra,at.they have suggested that appellate counsel failure to raise the claim on direct review does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.see sprouse state,no,wl.crim,unpublished.and texas highest criminal court has explicitly stated that a s a general rule the defendant should not raise an issue of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal,but rather in collateral review proceedings.mata state,internal quotation marks omitted.s
