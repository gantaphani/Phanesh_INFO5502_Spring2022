opinion of the court 
appellant daniel heleva filed a habeas petition,challenging his state court conviction for homicide,near the end of the statute of limitations for such though he had not yet exhausted his claims in state court as required.because heleva feared that he would not have sufficient time left in the limitations period to file the petition in federal court once he had exhausted his claims,he instead filed a motion to stay the petition until he could fulfill the exhaustion requirement.the district court denied the motion,ruling that under rhines weber,d,it had authority to issue a stay only where the petition was mixed that is,only for petitions containing both exhausted and unexhausted claims.because the district court did not consider the supreme court decision in pace diguglielmo,d,in holding that the rhines procedure applies exclusively to mixed petitions,we vacate the order of dismissal and remand for further proceedings 
heleva was convicted of criminal homicide in a november jury trial in the pennsylvania court of common pleas,resulting in a sentence of life in prison.heleva counsel,demetrius fannick,appealed the conviction to the superior court of pennsylvania,but failed to file a brief supporting the appeal.the superior court therefore dismissed the appeal on december.heleva had days from that date to seek review of the dismissal by the pennsylvania supreme court.
heleva proceeded pro se,filing a petition with the superior court in may,which was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction a month later.he also filed an application for leave to file in the supreme court of pennsylvania in september,which was granted,after which he sought mandamus relief from that court.the supreme court denied his petition without considering the merits.heleva petition for certiorari from the united states supreme court seeking review of the state supreme court decision was also denied.finally,heleva filed a petition for relief under the pennsylvania relief act pcra.ann.et,in the court of common pleas on december.a day later,on december,fannick also filed a petition under the pcra challenging heleva conviction,unbeknownst to heleva himself.heleva later filed an amended pcra petition on march,framing it as an amendment to the december petition filed by fannick.
on august,heleva filed a habeas petition in the district court for the middle district of pennsylvania under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,along with a motion for abeyance seeking a stay of the petition until he could exhaust his state law claims under the pcra.the district court dismissed the petition for failure to exhaust state court remedies pursuant to b and denied the motion for abeyance on the ground that a stay under rhines weber would be available only for a mixed petition containing both exhausted and unexhausted habeas claims.heleva timely appealed the district court decision,and was granted a certificate of appealability on the issue of whether the denial of a stay was appropriate as to heleva unexhausted petition.
the district court had jurisdiction under a.we have jurisdiction over the subsequent appeal pursuant to and.we apply a plenary standard of review to the question of whether a district court has authority to stay a habeas petition.crews horn,cir.
one of the threshold requirements for a petition is that,subject to certain exceptions,the petitioner must have first exhausted in state court all of the claims he wishes to present to the district court.b an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted unless it appears that the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the state.the supreme court has interpreted b to require dismissal of a habeas petition if it contains even a single unexhausted total exhaustion requirement.rose lundy,d.
in rhines weber,d,however,the supreme court held that lundy total exhaustion requirement was no longer the unyielding rule.rhines created an exception to lundy for mixed petitions,recognizing that otherwise a petitioner might have to choose between pursuing his exhausted and unexhausted claims 
as a result of the interplay between aedpa 
year statute of limitations and lundy dismissal requirement mandating the dismissal of a petition containing any unexhausted claims,petitioners who come to federal court with mixed petitions run the risk of forever losing their opportunity for any federal review of their unexhausted claims.if a petitioner files a timely but mixed petition in federal district court,and the district court dismisses it under lundy after the limitations period has expired,this will likely mean the termination of any federal review.for example,if the district court in this case had dismissed the petition because it contained unexhausted claims,aedpa statute of limitations would have barred rhines from returning to federal court after exhausting the previously unexhausted claims in state court.similarly,if a district court dismisses a mixed petition close to the end of the period,the petitioner chances of exhausting his claims in state court and refiling his petition in federal court before the limitations period runs are slim even a petitioner who files early will have no way of controlling when the district court will resolve the question of exhaustion.thus,whether a petitioner ever receives federal review of his claims may turn on which district court happens to hear his case.
therefore,the supreme court held that a district court may stay a mixed petition rather than dismiss,holding the petition in abeyance while the petitioner seeks exhaustion of any unexhausted claims in state court.id.however,the court feared that liberal use of this procedure might undermine aedpa twin purposes of encouraging the swift execution of criminal judgments and favoring the resolution of habeas claims in state court,if possible,before resorting to federal review.id.at.therefore,rhines mandated that a district court should grant a stay only where the petitioner had good cause for his failure to exhaust,his unexhausted claims are potentially meritorious,and there is no indication that the petitioner engaged in intentionally dilatory litigation tactics.id.at.
heleva contends that he satisfies these three requirements and thus should be granted a stay under rhines.his request for a stay is rooted in his concern that,if his current petition is dismissed for failure to exhaust,he will not have sufficient time to file a new petition once his pcra claims are properly exhausted.aedpa provides a statute of limitations for filing a petition once a defendant has completed the direct appeal process in state court.see d.heleva asserts that the period began on december,when the pennsylvania supreme court dismissed his direct appeal of his conviction.although heleva filing of a pcra petition tolled the running of the statute of limitations,see d,he did not file it until december.therefore,once the pcra claims are resolved,heleva fears he will have only one day to file a petition in federal court before aedpa statute of limitations runs out,a time period that may not be enough given the vagaries of the prison mail system.he points to that tight timeline as good cause for allowing him to leave the petition pending in federal court while he pursues exhaustion in state court.
the district court reasoned that,whether or not heleva could demonstrate good cause,rhines confines the availability of solely to mixed petitions.however,that limited approach ignores a case decided by the supreme court just one month after rhines.in pace diguglielmo,d,the supreme court sanctioned the use of the procedure in a context outside that of mixed petitions.
pace involved the question of whether under d,which provides for tolling of the aedpa limitations period during the time when a properly filed application for state or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending,an untimely filed petition for state review triggers such tolling.the supreme court held that it does not,rejecting the petitioner argumen
