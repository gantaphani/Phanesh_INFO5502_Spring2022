petitioner robert dale rowell rowell was convicted and sentenced to death in texas state court for the capital murder of raymond david mata.rowell filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the southern district of texas pursuant to.the district court denied rowell petition.rowell now requests a certificate of appealability coa from this court pursuant to c,seeking to appeal the district court denial of habeas relief.to begin,this court grants rowell motion for leave to file a reply to respondent opposition to request for coa and further grants rowell motion for leave to file oversize reply.
for the reasons detailed below,we deny rowell application for coa because he has failed to make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right as to his claims that his constitutional rights were violated when the trial court refused to define for the jury the term society in the future dangerousness special issue of the punishment charge and that texas law is unconstitutional because it fails to assign a proper burden of proof on the special issues and fails to provide for appellate review of the mitigating evidence.
background 
rowell was convicted and sentenced to death in april for the capital offense of murdering raymond david mata while in the course of committing or attempting to commit robbery.on direct appeal in december,the texas court of criminal appeals tcca affirmed rowell conviction and sentence.in october,the supreme court denied rowell petition for writ of certiorari.
thereafter,in april,rowell filed a state application for writ of habeas corpus.the trial court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law recommending the denial of relief.in september,the tcca adopted the trial judge findings and conclusions and denied rowell habeas relief.rowell then filed a federal habeas petition in the district court in september.respondent filed an answer and a motion for summary judgment.in february,the district court granted respondent motion,dismissed rowell petition,entered a final judgment,and denied rowell a coa on his claims.rowell timely filed the instant application for coa.
discussion 
rowell filed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus after the effective date of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa.therefore,his petition is subject to the procedures imposed by aedpa rowell right to appeal is governed by the coa requirements of c.see slack mcdaniel,d.
under aedpa,a petitioner must obtain a coa before an appeal can be taken to this court.c see also cockrell,d u ntil a coa has been issued federal courts of appeals lack jurisdiction to rule on the merits of appeals from habeas petitioners.when a habeas petitioner requests permission to seek appellate review of the dismissal of his petition,this court limits its examination to a threshold inquiry into the underlying merit of his claims,at.this threshold inquiry does not require full consideration of the factual or legal bases adduced in support of the claims.in fact,the statute forbids it.id.at.
a coa will be granted if the petitioner makes a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.c.meeting this standard requires a petitioner to demonstrate that reasonable jurists could debate whether or,for that matter,agree that the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further,at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.at issue is the debatability of the underlying constitutional claim,but not the resolution of that debate.id.at.a claim can be debatable even though every jurist of reason might agree,after the coa has been granted and the case has received full consideration,that petitioner will not prevail.id.at.
when the district court denies a petitioner petition on procedural grounds without reaching the underlying constitutional claim,a coa should issue if the petitioner demonstrates both that reasonable jurists would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling and that reasonable jurists would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right.slack,at.in death penalty cases,doubts on whether a coa should issue are resolved in the petitioner favor.hernandez johnson,cir.
whether the district court procedural determination as to rowell claim based on the trial court refusal to define society for the jury is debatable.
rowell challenges the trial court refusal to define the term society used in issue of the special issues submitted to the jury during the penalty phase of his trial rowell argues the trial court should have responded to the jury note by instructing them to consider the interests of both the prison population and free society when answering special issue.rowell contends the trial judge instead erroneously informed the jury that he was prohibited by law from expanding the jury charge.rowell asserts the judge ex parte and contradictory jury instruction violated texas procedural law and his sixth,eighth,and fourteenth amendment rights.rowell relies on bollenbach united states,and united states stevens,cir,for the proposition that a trial court has a constitutional duty to expand on the charge in response to a jury note.
in addition,rowell challenges the interaction of the judge alleged unconstitutional reply with the instruction that the jury could not consider how long rowell could be confined if they sentenced him to life imprisonment rowell argues there is no way of knowing in what way jurors were confused about the definition of society in the context of the parole law instruction they may have excluded prison society from their definition of society.
rowell also challenges the tcca standard of review used to assess the trial court reply to the jury question.rowell argues a coa should issue because the district court failed to address this issue.rowell relies on boyde california,d,and contends full briefing would allow him to show there is a reasonable possibility that the trial court incorrect reply prevented consideration of the constitutionally relevant evidence that he is not a danger to prison society.
rowell argues that despite any procedural default related to the jury instruction issue,the federal courts should intervene when state courts interpret state law so as to evade consideration of a federal issue.rowell alternatively contends his default should be excused because he did not have an opportunity to object to the trial court answer to the jury note due to the court communication to the jury being made ex parte and in secret.rowell stresses he was prejudiced by the trial court response because there is no way to know what a jury properly instructed on the definition of society would have done.
respondent replies that the district court correctly determined that rowell challenge to the trial court refusal to define society is procedurally defaulted because he objected to the trial court response for the first time in his state habeas petition.respondent argues the state habeas court properly concluded that rowell defaulted his claim based on the texas contemporaneous objection rule.see barrientes johnson,cir noting that the failure to timely object waives any error in jury instructions unless so prejudicial no instruction could cure the error.respondent maintains this court has consistently upheld this texas procedural rule as an independent and adequate state ground that procedurally bars federal habeas review of a petitioner claims.see sharp johnson,cir nichols scott,cir.
respondent contends rowell can not show cause to excuse his procedural default for three reasons.first,rowell presented no evidence showing the trial judge did not follow the typical procedure of addressing the matter in open court.crim.proc.second,rowell at essence is arguing that the state court incorrectly interpreted texas procedural law by finding he defaulted his claim it is not the role of the federal habeas court to reexamine determinations of questions.see estelle mcguire,d.finally,rowell had a duty to preserve any error in the proposed charge definition of society in writing before the charge was read to the jury.see crim.proc.in addition,respondent stresses rowell can not establish prejudice and has not alleged actual innocence of capital murder or of his death sentence for miscarriage of justice.
the district court here noted that the state court explicitly found that rowell had defaulted his jury instruction claim under texas rule.the court relied on this circuit clear and consistent statement that the texas contemporaneous objection rule constitutes an adequate and independent state ground that procedurally bars federal habeas review of a petitioner claims.fisher texas,cir see also cotton cockrell,cir.the district court then continued on to a cause and prejudice analysis of rowell circumstances.the court concluded that rowell made no argument that cause and prejudice existed to overcome the state procedural bar he only disputed,based on the silent record,whether he in fact defaulted his claim under state procedural law.the court cited estelle for the proposition that reexamining state court determinations of state law issues is not proper on federal habeas.at.
the district court then considered the merits of rowell jury instruction claim,apart from the procedural bar,coming to the conclusion that it was bound by supreme court and fifth circuit caselaw allowing texas to withhold parole eligibility information from its capital juries and by this court specific holding that texas use of the language continuing threat to society in the future dangerousness special issue is not so vague as to require clarifying instructions.james collins,cir,cert.denied,d.the court thus found no reason to disturb texas use of the continuing threat to society special issue.
here,our circuit caselaw forecloses us from reviewing rowell barred jury instruction claim.see,sharp,at explaining that petitioner argument that the texas contemporaneous objection rule is not an independent and adequate state ground upon which to base a procedural bar to federal review was foreclosed by amos scott,cir.based upon the threshold inquiry this court performs under slack,we find reasonable jurists could not debate whether the district court was correct in its ruling of procedural default based on the independent and adequate state bar under the texas contemporaneous objection rule,and in its findings of no cause and prejudice to excuse the default.we therefore do not need to address the possible validity of rowell claims related to the jury instruction as he has not met one of the required prongs under slack.at.encouraging courts to analyze the procedural prong first where possible.
whether the district court denial of relief based on rowell challenges to the mitigation special issue is debatable.
rowell also objects on appeal to texas use of special issue,the mitigation special issue.rowell argues this special issue is unconstitutional because texas law fails to assign a burden of proof.rowell also contends this special issue is unconstitutional because it is not subject to appellate review of the sufficiency of the mitigating evidence.rowell also made the argument now foreclosed by schriro summerlin,d that ring arizona,d,is a new substantive rule of criminal law that should be given retroactive effect on collateral review.rowell insists that just as ring should be construed to require texas to provide for some burden of proof on whether a sufficient mitigating circumstance has been proven,the constitution also entitled him to have the tcca review whether there was evidence to support the jury answer.
respondent replies that there is no doubt texas special issues are constitutional.see jurek texas,d.respondent stresses that here the jury at the phase first found beyond a reasonable doubt that rowell was guilty of the intentional murder of raymond mata and that the murder occurred in the course of rowell committing or attempting to commit robbery.during the punishment phase,the jury then answered yes to the question of whether rowell would pose a continuing threat to society,thereby finding that the state had met its burden of proving rowell future dangerousness to society beyond a reasonable doubt consistent with supreme court precedent,respondent argues this a defendant falls within the narrowed class of properly subject to review by the tcca.see,swearingen state,reviewing sufficiency of evidence on conviction guevara state,reviewing sufficiency of evidence on future dangerousness.respondent contends the mitigation special issue satisfies the eighth amendment requirements for the individualized selection decision because it allows the jury to consider relevant mitigating evidence of the character and record of the defendant and the circumstances of the crime.tuilaepa california,d see also franklin lynaugh,d noting texas special issues sufficiently allow for jury discretion to consider mitigating aspects 
in addition,respondent maintains ring has no application to rowell case because there the supreme court did not contemplate the sixth amendment reasonable doubt requirement to a capital sentencing jury findings regarding mitigating factors ring focused exclusively on certain judicial findings regarding aggravating factors.at.see also apprendi new jersey,d noting distinction between facts in aggravation of punishment and facts in mitigation.respondent argues rowell can not rely on ring because that case did not address the constitutional issue he presents.respondent contends that unlike the sentencing schemes challenged in ring and apprendi,the texas mitigation special issue does not operate as the functional equivalent of an element of a greater offense.apprendi,at.moreover,the trial judge has no role in a capital murder case under texas law.proc.code ann.e.respondent also stresses the supreme court does not require the jury to make its individualized determination of the defendant moral culpability in any particular way,as long as it is allowed to judge what is mitigating and in what way.see,franklin,at.respondent argues the texas mitigation special issue serves its constitutionally mandated function and rowell reading of ring would present the absurd circumstance of requiring prosecutors to prove the absence of mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt.respondent also emphasizes this court has consistently rejected the claim that a capital defendant is entitled to appellate review of the mitigating evidence.see woods cockrell,cir johnson cockrell,cir,cert.denied,d.
moreover,respondent argues that rowell claims related to the mitigation special issue lack of burden of proof and of appellate review are barred from federal habeas review under teague lane,d,because he argues for new rules of constitutional law.moreover,to the extent rowell relies on ring for his claims,the supreme court has held ringis not retroactive.summerlin.at.
in apprendi,the supreme court held the sixth amendment and due process require other than the fact of a prior conviction,any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury,and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.at.the court thus invalidated as a violation of the fourteenth amendment a new jersey state hate crime statute that authorized an increase in the defendant maximum prison sentence based on the judge finding by a preponderance of evidence that the defendant acted with the purpose to intimidate the victim based on particular characteristics of the victim.id.at.
the supreme court relied on apprendi in ring to overrule part of arizona capital sentencing scheme,which had provided that trial judges determine the presence or absence of aggravating factors required by arizona law for imposition of the death penalty,and which had been previously upheld by walton arizona,d.ring,at.the sixth amendment requires that c apital defendants,no less than noncapital defendants are entitled to a jury determination of any fact on which the legislature conditions an increase in their maximum punishment.id.at.however,the supreme court underscored that ring had made no sixth amendment claim wi
