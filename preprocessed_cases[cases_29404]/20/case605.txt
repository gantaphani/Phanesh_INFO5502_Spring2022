antyane robinson appeals the district court denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus under.robinson received a death sentence after a jury convicted him of first degree murder and related charges.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm the judgment of the district court.
on march,following a jury trial in the cumberland county court of common pleas,robinson was convicted of first degree murder of rashawn bass,attempted criminal homicide of tara hodge,and related offenses.the evidence at trial established that,on june,robinson made an unannounced visit to hodge,his,at her apartment.when robinson discovered that hodge new boyfriend,bass,was taking a shower in the apartment,an argument ensued.robinson told hodge to make bass leave the apartment,but hodge refused and attempted to block robinson from entering the bathroom.robinson pulled a semiautomatic handgun out of his waistband and shot hodge in the head,rendering her unconscious.robinson then proceeded into the bathroom and shot bass seven times,killing him.hodge survived and called the police after she regained consciousness.
at trial,the prosecutor emphasized that robinson was from the big city,and that he shot two people for a perceived disrespect.see appendix app.the prosecutor elicited testimony concerning robinson attempts to purchase firearms years before the offense as well as robinson possession of a gun,bulletproof vest,ammunition,and other military gear.the trial court also admitted evidence seized from robinson home,including photographs of robinson posing with guns.see commonwealth robinson,robinson i.in his closing argument,the prosecutor described robinson as follows 
now,there was an image projected here,and it that big city image man,i got to carry a gun wherever i go.robinson not the person in here that all my life i been treated so badly.this is the image of a kind of person capable of forming specific intent to kill.this is a lifestyle.you look at that and you judge these acts carefully.a person that wants to project this kind of image,the kind of guy that has to drive into cumberland county and have guns in his waistband and his home has to have a bullet proof vest,those are the kind of guys i submit to you that say i ai going to be disrespected,disrespect me and you going to have to pay.
during the penalty phase of robinson trial,the prosecutor elicited testimony indicating that robinson was on probation at the time of the murder for a prior assault and battery and carrying a deadly weapon,app.violated various conditions of his probation,app.and was convicted for assaulting another woman,app.the prosecutor also described to the jury the purpose of aggravating circumstances there are some crimes and the manner in which you do them that are more terrible than other ones,and we want to tell people,okay,do the first crime but for god sake then stop.app.explaining the applicability of aggravating circumstances to robinson case,the prosecutor stated a nd then while he is killing rashawn bass another person gets almost killed.that a serious thing that we have to stop app.in addition,he described the applicability of the grave risk aggravating circumstance.d,to the jury as follows 
here we trying to say,gees,if you going to kill somebody,do create a risk of killing someone else.because in the course of this killing,and by your very verdicts you said,yeah,he killed rashawn bass and he had the specific intent to do that,and while he doing that,in the course of that killing,he also created grave risk of death to tara hodge,and you heard that testimony.the doctor said had that angle changed just a bit,that girl would be dead.you all heard about what a vital organ the head is,and that just a common sense thing.so if you going to create a grave risk of death,that puts you in that seat that we sitting in today.
following closing arguments at the penalty phase,robinson counsel moved for a jury instruction,pursuant to simmons south carolina,that robinson would be ineligible for parole should he receive a life sentence rather than the death penalty.see,d holding that the jury must be informed that the defendant is ineligible for parole when the prosecution raises the defendant future dangerousness and state law prohibits release on parole for capital defendants.robinson counsel argued that the commonwealth put the issue of future dangerousness in when he said it was a lifestyle choice and bringing into issue the other shootings makes future dangerousness an issue.app.the prosecutor responded i think the jurors have a right to hear what his past has been.i do not intend to argue that he will be a future danger.id.the trial court denied defense counsel motion and did not give the jury a simmons instruction.
finally,the trial court gave the following jury charge,in pertinent part,regarding aggravating circumstances 
in this case,the aggravating circumstances that are being submitted to you for your consideration to determine whether the commonwealth has proven them beyond a reasonable doubt are right out of the pennsylvania statute one,in the commission of the criminal homicide defendant knowingly created a grave risk of death to tara hodge and in addition to rashawn bass who was the victim of the offense.
app.robinson counsel did not object to this instruction.
the jury found unanimously that two aggravating circumstances applied to robinson knowingly creating a grave risk of death to another person in addition to the victim in the commission of a murder.d and committing a murder while in the perpetration of a felony,id.d.the jury also found two mitigating circumstances robinson youth,id.e and his future contributions to society,see id.e.after concluding that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances,see id.c iv,the jury returned a verdict of death.on april,the trial court formally imposed upon robinson a death sentence for first degree murder and a consecutive term of imprisonment of six years and nine months to twenty years for aggravated assault.
the pennsylvania supreme court affirmed robinson conviction and sentence.robinson i.the united states supreme court denied robinson petition for a writ of certiorari.robinson pennsylvania,d.on october,robinson filed a counseled petition under pennsylvania post conviction relief act pcra.following hearings held on october and,november,and december,the state court denied robinson pcra petition.the pennsylvania supreme court affirmed the denial of his pcra petition.commonwealth robinson,robinson ii.
on august,robinson filed a counseled petition for a writ of habeas corpus under in the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania.on january,he filed an amended petition.robinson asserted eighteen grounds for relief,including the two that he argues in this appeal the state trial court violated his due process rights when it declined to give a simmons instruction and there was insufficient evidence to support the jury finding of the grave risk aggravating circumstance,and the trial court improperly instructed the jury with regard to this aggravating circumstance.
on september,the district court denied robinson petition.the district court found that when considered in context,the prosecutor questioning and comments did not convey a message that robinson posed a threat of future dangerousness if not sentenced to death,and therefore a simmons instruction was not required,robinson beard,cv,wl,at,and there was ample evidence to support the jury finding that the grave risk aggravating circumstance applied,and the trial court did not improperly instruct the jury,id.at.the court granted a certificate of appealability on the issues of whether the trial court jury instruction on the grave risk aggravating circumstance ran afoul of the eighth amendment and whether there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that the grave risk aggravating circumstance was applicable to robinson.id.at.
robinson filed a notice of appeal on october.thereafter,he filed a motion in this court to expand the certificate of appealability under c to include seven more issues.we granted a certificate of appealability on the additional issue of whether the state supreme court determination on direct appeal that the trial court did not err in declining to instruct the jury,pursuant to simmons south carolina,d,that appellant was ineligible for parole was contrary to or an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent.app.we noted that j urists of reason could debate whether the prosecutor argued future dangerousness,thereby triggering the need for the simmons instruction.id.we also ordered the parties to brief whether the trial court failure to give a simmons instruction would constitute harmless error under brecht abrahamson,d.we denied robinson motion in all other respects 
the district court had jurisdiction over robinson habeas corpus petition pursuant to,and we have appellate jurisdiction under and.because the district court did not hold an evidentiary hearing and relied on the state court record,we exercise plenary review.see lambert blackwell,cir.
section d of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa provides,in pertinent part,that 
an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states 
this is a difficult to meet and highly deferential standard for evaluating rulings,which demands that decisions be given the benefit of the doubt cullen pinholster,d quotation marks and citation omitted.to determine whether a state court decision is contrary to clearly established law,a federal court must consider whether the decision applies a rule that contradicts such law and how the decision confronts the set of facts that were before the state court.id.at quotation marks omitted.a state court decision is contrary to clearly established precedent if the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in supreme court cases,williams taylor,d,or if the state court confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of the supreme court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from supreme court precedent,id.at.if the state court decision identifies the correct governing legal principle in existence at the time,a federal court must assess whether the decision unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.cullen.at quotation marks omitted.
in order for d to apply,the state court must have adjudicated a petitioner claim on the merits.a state court decision is an adjudication on the merits where it is a decision finally resolving the parties claims,with res judicata effect,that is based on the substance of the claim advanced,rather than on a procedural,or other,ground.simmons beard,cir quotation marks omitted.in such cases,the federal court review is limited to the record that was before the state court that adjudicated the claim on the merits.cullen.at.if a petitioner claims were not adjudicated on the merits,they do not fall under d,and the federal court must apply the standard,reviewing pure legal questions and mixed questions of law and fact de novo and presuming that the state court factual determinations are correct unless those factual determinations are rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.beard,at.
in the present case,the district court applied the deferential aedpa standard to robinson simmons claim,but not to his claims regarding the grave risk aggravating circumstance.we review de novo the district court legal conclusion as to whether aedpa deference applies.id.in considering whether d applies,we review the last reasoned decision of the state courts on the petitioner claims.id.at.
robinson contends that the state impliedly argued his future dangerousness during the guilt and penalty phases of his trial.thus,robinson argues,the trial court should have instructed the jury that life imprisonment under pennsylvania law means life imprisonment without parole.
robinson relies primarily on simmons south carolina to support his argument.in simmons,the defendant was convicted of capital murder for killing an elderly woman.at.the defendant had a history of assaulting elderly women,and both defense and state witnesses agreed that the defendant posed a continuing danger to elderly women.id.at.during the penalty phase of the defendant trial,the prosecutor stated that the question for the jury was what to do with the defendant now that he is in our midst.id.quotation marks omitted.the prosecutor urged that a death sentence would be a response of society to someone who is a threat.your verdict will be an act of.id.defense counsel requested a jury instruction regarding parole ineligibility,and the trial court denied this request.id.at.during deliberations,the jury asked if a life sentence included the possibility of parole.id.at.the trial court instructed the jury not to consider parole or parole eligibility and told the jury that life imprisonment and death should be understood in their plain and ordinary meaning.id.the jury returned a death verdict.id.
a plurality of the supreme court ruled that,under these circumstances,due process required the trial judge to inform the jury that the defendant would not have been eligible for parole if sentenced to life imprisonment.it held that,where the defendant future dangerousness is at issue,and state law prohibits the defendant release on parole,due process requires that the sentencing jury be informed that the defendant is parole ineligible.id.at.the plurality reasoned that t he state may not create a false dilemma by advancing generalized arguments regarding the defendant future dangerousness while,at the same time,preventing the jury from learning that the defendant never will be released on parole.id.at.
in her concurrence,justice phrased the dispositive question as whether the prosecution argues that the defendant will pose a threat to society in the future.id.at,concurring.this narrower view is controlling.see,bronshtein horn,cir rompilla horn,cir,rev on other grounds sub,rompilla beard,d see also richmond polk,cir noting that justice concurrence in simmons is controlling.
eight years later,the supreme court considered whether a simmons instruction should have been given in kelly south carolina,d.in kelly,the prosecutor told the jury in his opening statement i hope you never in your lives again have to experience what you are experiencing right now.being some thirty feet away from such a person.murderer.id.at quotation marks omitted.the prosecutor also presented evidence that,while in prison,kelly crafted a knife,attempted to escape,and planned to hold a female guard as a hostage.id.in addition,the state relied upon evidence of kelly sadism at an early age,and his inclination to kill anyone who rubbed him the wrong way.id.citation omitted.during closing arguments,the prosecutor referred to kelly as the butcher of batesburg,bloody billy,and billy the kid,and told the jury that kelly does have any mental illness.he intelligent he.does that make somebody a little more dangerous d oes that make him more unpredictable murderers will be murderers.and he is the one right over there.id.at.the trial court did not give the jury a simmons instruction.id.at.
the supreme court held that the trial court should have provided a parole ineligibility instruction because the state accentuated the clear implication of future dangerousness raised by the evidence.id.at.the majority observed that evidence of violent behavior in prison can raise a strong implication of generalized future dangerousness,so that a jury hearing evidence of a defendant demonstrated propensity for violence reasonably will conclude that he presents a risk of violent behavior,whether locked up or free,and whether free as a fugitive or as a parolee.id.at quoting simmons,at.the majority explained,moreover,that e vidence of future dangerousness under simmons is evidence with a tendency to prove dangerousness in the future its relevance to that point does not disappear merely because it might support other inferences or be described in other terms.id.at.
the kelly dissenters,including two of the justices who joined justice concurring opinion in simmons,argued that the court had improperly extended the reach of simmons.justice rehnquist,joined by justice kennedy,observed that the test is no longer whether the state argues future dangerousness to society the test is now whether evidence was introduced at trial that raises an implication of future dangerousness to society.id.at rehnquist,dissenting.justice thomas,joined by justice scalia,dissented separately and asserted the court dilutes the simmons test,now requiring that a parole ineligibility instruction be given where the prosecution makes arguments that have a tendency to prove dangerousness in the future.id.at thomas,dissenting.we have noted accordingly that kelly arguably broadened the holding in simmons.rompilla,at see also bronshtein,at same.
on direct appeal,the pennsylvania supreme court rejected robinson argument that the trial court erred in declining to give a simmons instruction the court held that,where the only references to the dangerousness of appellant relate to appellant past dangerousness a simmons instruction is not necessary.robinson i,at.the court also reasoned that a simmons instruction is necessary only when the future dangerousness of the defendant is expressly implicated.id.since the pennsylvania supreme court adjudicated robinson claims on the merits,we will review its determination under the deferential standard set forth in d.
robinson asserts,under d,that the pennsylvania supreme court unreasonably applied simmons when it held that future dangerousness is never placed at issue by references to a defendant prior conduct and must be expressly implicated to trigger the need for a simmons instruction.
under d,our review is limited to deciding whether a state court decision is contrary to or an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent as of the time of the relevant decision.williams taylor,d see also greene fisher,d section d requires federal courts to focus on what a state court knew and did quotation marks and alteration omitted.since the supreme court decided kelly after robinson conviction became final,we must determine whether to apply kelly in the instant matter.
robinson argues that kelly did not create or apply any new rule of law,but simply applied the holding of simmons to the specific facts before it.robinson br.therefore,he suggests,we may consider kelly in determining whether the state court application of simmons was unreasonable.our prior case law,however,forecloses this argument.as noted earlier,the supreme court decision in kelly arguably broadened the holding in simmons.rompilla,at see also bronshtein,at same.accordingly,we have declined to apply kelly where a state court decision preceded it,rompilla,at,and we will not apply kelly here 
the fundamental takeaway from simmons is that a jury can not be presented with generalized arguments regarding the defendant future dangerousness while also being prevented from learning that the defendant will never be released on parole.while we recognize that the evidence in many,if not all,capital cases will tend to show that a defendant may be dangerous in the future,simmons does not require a parole ineligibility instruction in every case.the state court view that a simmons instruction is not necessary where the only references to a defendant dangerousness relate to his past conduct draws a reasonable limiting principle that is consistent with the concerns set forth by the supreme court.robinson i,at.
furthermore,the state court conclusion that the defendant future dangerousness must be expressly implicated to trigger the need for a parole ineligibility instruction comports with justice formulation of the simmons rule.at,concurring requiring the trial court to ask whether the prosecution argues that the defendant will pose a threat to society in the future.a prosecutor may expressly implicate a defendant future dangerousness that is,he or she may argue it without actually saying those particular words.
unlike the prosecutor in simmons,the prosecutor at robinson trial made no explicit mention of robinson ability to conform to society in the future.the prosecutor statements characterizing robinson as a dangerous big city hoodlum,as well as the evidence regarding robinson ownership of guns and his criminal past,conveyed robinson specific intent to kill bass and hodge.see,app.this is the image of a kind of person capable of forming specific intent to kill.none of the prosecutor statements implied that the jury should elect to sentence robinson to death as an act of.moreover,the prosecutor comment regarding aggravating circumstances t hat a serious thing that we have to stop conveyed the deterrent purposes of aggravating factors in a general sense.app.
we agree with the district court that the pennsylvania supreme court rejection of robinson simmons claim can not be disturbed under the narrow standard of review prescribed by aedpa,and therefore we will affirm the district court with respect to this claim.
robinson remaining two arguments relate to pennsylvania grave risk aggravating circumstance.the pennsylvania capital sentencing statute sets forth eighteen aggravating factors,including the following i n the commission of the offense,the defendant knowingly created a grave risk of death to another person in addition to the victim of the offense.d.the jury concluded unanimously that this aggravating circumstance applied to robinson.robinson argues that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury finding that the grave risk aggravating circumstance applied and the trial court failed to limit its jury instruction properly,rendering the aggravating circumstance vague and overbroad.
before considering robinson substantive arguments,we must determine whether they are properly before this court and,if so,which standard of review applies.it appears from robinson briefs that he expects us to review his claims de novo.
aedpa requires a petitioner in state custody to exhaust all remedies available in the state courts before a federal court can grant his or her habeas petition.b a.in pennsylvania,a habeas corpus petitioner exhausts a claim by raising it either on direct appeal or in a petition under the pcra.see holloway horn,cir.in order to satisfy the exhaustion requirement,a petitioner must fairly present his or her federal claims to the state courts.picard connor,d.that is,the petitioner must present a federal claim factual and legal substance to the state courts in a manner that puts them on notice that a federal claim is being asserted.mccandless vaughn,cir.
on direct appeal,robinson did not raise any arguments pertaining to the grave risk aggravating circumstance.however,under.h,the pennsylvania supreme court must automatically review all death sentences and affirm a given death sentence unless it determines that the evidence fails to support the finding of at least one aggravating circumstance.in robinson case,the court reviewed his death sentence and determined that the evidence was sufficient to establish the aggravating factors found by the jury.robinson i,at.
in his pcra petition,robinson expressly raised the arguments he now raises before this court.the pennsylvania supreme court determined,however,that robinson had offer ed nothing that was not already reviewed by this court on direct appeal.robinson ii,at.the court held that robinson arguments relating to the grave risk aggravating circumstance had been previously litigated on direct appeal and thus declined to address his claims.id.at see.a.
with regard to robinson sufficiency of the evidence claim,we must decide whether the pennsylvania supreme court automatic review on direct appeal satisfied aedpa exhaustion requirements.in bronshtein horn,we rejected the argument that a claim could automatically be exhausted on direct appeal by virtue of the pennsylvania supreme court mandatory appellate review in capital case
