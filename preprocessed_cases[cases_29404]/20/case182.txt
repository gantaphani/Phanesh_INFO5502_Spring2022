gerald malone was convicted in massachusetts superior court of rape and abuse of a child under sixteen,and indecent assault and battery of a child under fourteen,based on a series of sexual assaults that he committed against his daughter when she was between the ages of eleven and fourteen.after exhausting his state court remedies,malone petitioned for federal habeas relief pursuant to.malone alleged that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failure to subpoena a police officer who could have impeached the testimony of his daughter,who we refer to as,the principal witness against him.the district court denied the petition.because we conclude that the massachusetts appeals court decision that malone suffered no prejudice from his counsel failure to subpoena the witness was neither contrary to,nor an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,we affirm the district court denial of malone habeas petition.
brenda and gerald malone were married and have two children together,and whitney.on july,as they often did,gerald and brenda argued.following the argument on this occasion,however,brenda informed gerald malone malone that she no longer wanted to be his wife,that she had consulted with a divorce attorney,and that she wanted him to move out of their house.after malone packed his belongings and left the house,told her mother that her father had been raping her for nearly four and a half years.

at trial,the commonwealth case consisted of the testimony of,her younger sister whitney,and brenda.was the main witness and she provided a vivid account of years of repeated rapes and sexual assaults by her father began with the first incident which occurred in,telling the jury that when she was years old,her father called her into her mother and brenda lived apart at that time,but malone regularly asked if she could do him a favor.testified that malone was lying on the bed and a pornographic movie was playing on the television.he pulled the covers off of himself,exposing his naked body to his daughter.malone,referring to his penis,told that he needed her to suck this for him.did as she was told,but while performing fellatio,she accidentally bit malone penis.malone hit her on the head,telling her do bite my shit again.continued performing oral sex until malone ejaculated.

in august,when was around thirteen years old,brenda,whitney,and malone moved into the house of malone brother,tony,or uncle tony as referred to him.testified that many instances of sexual abuse occurred at tony house.on one occasion,came home from school with a bad progress report and showed it to malone,who responded angrily to the news and asked why the report was poor.she told malone that she was doing the best she could,but he accused her of lying.he ordered her to drop her drawers,which testified meant that he wanted her to take everything off from the waist down.malone then began to beat her with his belt,stopping only after he noticed that his brother had pulled his vehicle into the driveway.
testified about another assault at tony house.this one occurred after came home from school and malone confronted her with news that school had called to tell him that she had received detention because she was talking in class and being disruptive.malone became angry and began beating her with a belt.malone told her that she had a chance to redeem herself.performed oral sex on malone,but because she was crying,she twice accidentally bit his penis.this made malone angry,which resulted in him beating and raping her.

testified to other assaults,which included the playing and viewing of pornographic videos while malone received oral sex from,raped her,or both.testified that she had seen pornographic tapes with her father on seven or eight occasions,and that,all told,he had assaulted her many times.
finally,testified about the events of july.after the argument in which brenda informed malone of her desire to have him leave the home,malone called his daughters from their bedrooms.he took them to friendly restaurant to sa y.once there,malone gave whitney some money to get something to eat in the restaurant,but malone and stayed in the car.malone asked if she was going to tell brenda about the sexual abuse.told him that she was indeed going to tell brenda.malone responded to this by offering to give his pager to if she would remain quiet for at least hours.he then asked whether she would remain quiet for three weeks if he gave her his cell phone.then he offered to give her every three months for the rest of her life if she agreed to remain silent.took the pager and cell phone and then went home.at home,she told her mother that malone had been raping her for almost four and a half years.
on,malone counsel sought to establish that had animus toward malone because he was,in the words of the defense,a strict disciplinarian.in an effort to undermine credibility,defense counsel also focused on inconsistencies or omissions between trial testimony and the statements she made to officer gomsey,as those statements were recorded in gomsey two police reports.gomsey reports were not entered into evidence,but defense counsel used the reports to refresh memory when,during her testimony,she expressed uncertainty about the contents of the reports or when her testimony was inconsistent with the statements that she had made to gomsey.
according to defense counsel,had told gomsey that tony never came home during an assault,yet she testified that tony came home during one of the assaults.on,denied telling gomsey that tony came home while malone was committing a sexual assault,but testified that she told gomsey that he came home during a physical assault.defense counsel questioned about whether she had told gomsey that the christmas assault had in fact occurred the day after christmas.acknowledged that she was not good with remembering exactly what she said,but insisted that she did not remember telling gomsey that the sexual assault had occurred the day after christmas.counsel challenged testimony that malone was unclothed when brenda walked in on them she testified on cross that she did remember whether she told gomsey that malone was unclothed.after viewing gomsey report to refresh her memory,then denied telling gomsey that malone was clothed.
defense counsel further challenged with gomsey report,in her direct testimony,stated that malone had given her his pager for one day of silence and his cell phone for three weeks of silence,but gomsey police report stated that said that malone offered the pager for one week of silence and the cell phone for three months of silence.during,denied telling gomsey anything inconsistent with her testimony in this regard.
the defense challenged with other omissions or inconsistencies,on direct,testified that malone promised her every three months if she kept quiet forever,although there was no mention of the payments in gomsey two reports.during,testified that she did tell gomsey about the.testified that during the very first incident of sexual abuse a pornographic tape was playing gomsey reports fail to mention the pornographic tape.during,again testified that a pornographic tape had been playing during the first incident,and she insisted that she had told gomsey about it.
after finished testifying,the commonwealth revealed that their second witness,brenda,would be their only witness although the commonwealth listed several fresh complaint witnesses,including gomsey,at a pretrial hearing,the trial judge limited the commonwealth fresh complaint witnesses to one 
brenda,as the fresh complaint witness,testified about telling her that malone had been raping her for four and a half years.brenda testified that had told her that malone was making her have sex with him.
in addition to serving as the fresh complaint witness,brenda testified to two events which supported testimony.first,brenda testified that she had in fact come into her bedroom and saw malone and in bed together and that the instant she opened the door,jumped out of bed.brenda testified that denied that anything improper was taking place.second,brenda testified that on another occasion she had come home from work and entered her bedroom to find malone holding a belt and standing over,who was bent over crying and completely unclothed with a pair of socks stuffed in her mouth brenda testified that when she asked malone why he was spanking completely naked and why had a sock in her mouth,malone stated that the sock was necessary to keep from screaming.after brenda testified,the first day of the trial concluded.
on the second morning of the trial,defense counsel requested a continuance to serve officer gomsey with a subpoena to appear and testify as a defense witness.defense counsel explained that he thought that the commonwealth was going to call gomsey as a fresh complaint witness in its and therefore failed to serve her with a subpoena.the court denied the continuance,concluding that the fresh complaint witnesses had been limited to one and it was apparent at the close of the previous day proceedings that the commonwealth was not going to call gomsey.
following that,the commonwealth called whitney,who corroborated some of testimony regarding what happened at friendly.whitney also testified to seeing bruises on thighs,and seeing the door closed on the bedroom while and malone were inside.the commonwealth then rested.defense counsel renewed his request for a continuance to subpoena gomsey,but the trial judge again denied the request.
the defense called malone mother kelli,who testified to conversations she had with malone about moving to michigan,and then the defense called malone himself.malone acknowledged that,in his words,he disciplined with whoopings,which included beatings with a belt,but denied having any sexual relations with his daughter.malone also testified to animosity toward him,which he believed flowed from his disciplin ing ways.on,malone admitted to beating his naked daughter while she had socks stuffed in her mouth,as well as to other physical assaults.with that,the defense rested.
defense counsel then made an offer of proof,describing the eight alleged inconsistencies that would have been brought to light had he been allowed to subpoena gomsey testified that tony came home during a sexual and physical assault that occurred while she was living at her uncle tony house,whereas gomsey report states that uncle tony came home during an incident in which malone was beating testified that she had been raped and assaulted by malone on christmas day,whereas the report stated that had only been physically assaulted on that occasion regarding the incident where brenda nearly caught malone and in a sexual act,testified that malone was unclothed when her mother walked in on and malone,whereas the report stated that malone was clothed during this incident testified that malone had given her his pager for one day of silence and his cell phone for three weeks of silence,whereas the report stated that malone offered the pager for one week of silence and the cell phone for three months of silence testified that malone promised her every three months if she kept quiet forever,whereas the reports do not mention the testified that during the very first incident of sexual abuse a pornographic tape was playing,whereas the reports fail to mention the pornographic tape testified that malone threatened her after the first incident of sexual abuse,whereas the reports fail to mention any threats made by malone after the first sexual assault and testified that malone made her earn a limousine ride for her twelfth birthday by performing oral sex and having sexual intercourse,whereas the reports fail to mention the limousine incident 
after presenting his offer of proof,defense counsel admitted to the court that his failure to subpoena gomsey was not a strategic decision but a mistake.the trial court responded to counsel remark 
i do think you necessarily made a mistake i think you obtained from the complaining witness the inconsistencies that were described to the officer,without permitting the officer to testify as to everything else that was told,because as i understand the doctrine,simply because someone makes an inconsistent statement,unless there an accusation of recent contrivance,it does make all other consistent statements admissible.so you got the best of both worlds.so i do see where you made any mistake.
malone was found guilty of three counts of rape and abuse of a child under sixteen and one count of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen.malone appealed and,while his direct appeal was pending,he filed a motion for a new trial in the superior court.in the motion,malone argued,among other things,that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to serve gomsey with a subpoena to compel her presence at trial.malone motion for a new trial was denied by the superior court.
in his consolidated appeal to the massachusetts appeals court,malone raised the same ineffectiveness claim that had been rejected in his motion for a new trial.the appeals court affirmed malone conviction and the denial of his motion for a new trial.commonwealth malone,wl,at unpublished table decision.that court held that malone was not denied effective assistance of counsel,reasoning that the absence of gomsey testimony was not significantly prejudicial because she would have only provided cumulative impeachment testimony.malone,wl,at.malone then filed an application for leave to obtain further appellate review with the sjc,which was summarily denied.see commonwealth malone,unpublished table decision.
following the sjc denial of further appellate review,malone filed a federal habeas petition pursuant to.the district court denied the petition,but granted a certificate of appealability on the ineffective assistance of counsel claim.
we review the district court denial of habeas corpus relief de novo.teti bender,cir,cert.denied,d.the district court factual findings are reviewed for clear error,while mixed questions of law and fact are reviewed de novo.norton spencer,cir united states,cir.ineffective assistance of counsel claims are mixed questions of law and fact.strickland washington,d.
this case is governed by the standards of review established by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,and the strickland test for ineffective assistance of counsel claims,sleeper spencer,cir,cert.denied,d citing strickland,at.we briefly review the governing law before turning to the merits of malone claim.
under the aedpa,to be entitled to relief,malone must demonstrate that the state court resolution of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application,of clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d rompilla beard,d.
a state court decision is contrary to the supreme court clearly established precedents if the state court applies either a legal rule that contradicts an established supreme court precedent or reaches a different result on facts materially indistinguishable from those of a controlling supreme court precedent.williams taylor,d.
the applicable precedent in this case is the standard articulated in strickland,at.although the state court failed specifically to mention the strickland standard,applying instead massachusetts standard articulated in commonwealth saferian,we have held that for habeas purposes,saferian is a functional equivalent of strickland,ouber guarino,cir thus,the state court did not apply a legal rule that contradicts an established supreme court precedent.see williams,at.
additionally,this case does not fall under the contrary to category of the aedpa.although the supreme court has addressed a of ineffective assistance of counsel cases,petitioner has pointed us to no supreme court case reaching a different result than the state court in the this case involving materially indistinguishable facts,nor have we found such a case.
aedpa,however,does not require state and federal courts to wait for some nearly identical factual pattern before a legal rule must be applied.panetti quarterman,d quoting carey musladin,d kennedy,concurring.malone also would be entitled to relief if he shows that the state court unreasonably applied clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court.see rompilla,at.an unreasonable application of federal law occurs when the state court identifies the correct legal principle,but i applies those principles to the facts of the case in an objectively unreasonable manner ii unreasonably extends clearly established legal principles to a new context where they should not apply or iii unreasonably refuses to extend established principles to a new context where they should apply.sleeper,at citing dipaolo,cir.
neither ii nor iii applies in this is not arguing that the state unreasonably extended strickland to a new context or that the state court unreasonably refused to extend strickland to a new context.thus,the question before us is whether the state court applied the principles of strickland to the facts in malone case in an objectively unreasonable manner,to which we turn next.
ineffective assistance of counsel 
to be entitled to relief for constitutionally ineffective assistance,under strickland,malone must show deficient performance by counsel resulting in prejudice.rompilla,at.citing strickland,at.
while malone must prove both prongs to prevail,we have held that a reviewing court need not address both requirements if the evidence as to either is lacking.sleeper,at.that is,i f it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice,which we expect will often be so,that course should be followed.id.citing strickland,at.that is the course we follow here.
malone suffered no prejudice 
the prejudice prong requires malone to demonstrate a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland,at.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.id.the assessment of prejudice should proceed on the assumption that the decisionmaker is reasonably,conscientiously,and impartially applying the standards that govern the decision.id.at.a court hearing an ineffectiveness claim must consider the totality of the evidence before the judge or jury.id.
malone argues that the state court application of strickland was unreasonable because he was prejudiced by defense counsel failure to subpoena gomsey.to malone,gomsey was the sole witness capable of discrediting the alleged victim testimony.malone argues,correctly,that in a case such as this,where the commonwealth presentation of physical evidence was limited,the credibility of the victim is particularly important.given that,malone argues that trial counsel failure to insure gomsey presence at trial crippled the defense ability to impeach credibility.malone argues,t he outcome of the trial might have well been different had the defense lawyer presented the prior inconsistent statements of the alleged victim through officer gomsey.appellant br.at.
malone,however,must show more.his burden is not to demonstrate that the outcome might have been different,but to demonstrate a probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland,at.not only must malone demonstrate that counsel failure undermines our confidence in the outcome,see strickland,at,but he must also demonstrate that the state court applied strickland prejudice principles to the facts of the case in an objectively unreasonable manner,sleeper,at.
we have recognized that where the relevant error is failure to impeach a government witness,we begin by assessing the strength of the prosecution case,and the effectiveness of the defense absent the impeachment evidence.stephens hall,cir.we then consider the potential impeachment value of the evidence in undermining the credibility of the witness testimony.id.quoting united states,cir.
the strength of the prosecution case 
credibility was central to the prosecution case.the commonwealth presented no physical evidence.the parties did,however,stipulate that brenda had delivered three videotapes containing pornographic scenes to the yarmouth police and that those tapes came from the home in which malone resided.brenda and whitney did not testify to seeing sexual abuse,only physical abuse.brenda testified to seeing bruises on thighs and buttocks,malone hitti
