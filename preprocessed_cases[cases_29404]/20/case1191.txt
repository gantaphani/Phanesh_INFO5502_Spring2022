kathy miller appeals the district court denial of her petition seeking relief from her sentence for engaging in deadly conduct by riddling the unoccupied home of her with rifle fire.we conclude that the state court decision that miller was not prejudiced by her counsel failure to conduct a constitutionally adequate investigation into her mental disabilities is an objectively unreasonable application of settled federal law and reverse.
miller was charged and convicted by a jury for the offense of deadly conduct in violation of texas penal code b the evidence showed that miller had been married to larry miller,the son of maxine prismeyer and brother of laura kainer.larry died of a drug overdose,and although members of the prismeyer and kainer families blamed miller for his death,she was never charged.approximately one year after larry death,maxine prismeyer and her husband alfred left their nearly completed home in el campo,texas,in the care of laura kainer and her husband,charles kainer,for a weekend.the kainers stayed in a mobile home located directly behind the prismeyer residence.
at approximately on december,six rounds from a caliber rifle were fired into the prismeyer residence.four of the bullets passed through the residence and struck the mobile home in which the kainers were sleeping.charles kainer exited the mobile home and saw a truck driving away on the road fronting the prismeyer house.shortly thereafter,local police spotted miller truck abandoned in a ditch.miller,who had been drinking earlier in the evening,was found riding a tractor a short distance away.she admitted that she had driven her truck into the ditch and had walked home carrying her caliber rifle.a dps firearms examiner matched the casings recovered at the scene of the crime to miller rifle.
at the punishment phase of miller trial,the state presented evidence that at various times prior to the shooting,miller had swerved her vehicle into the path of the kainers automobile,given the kainers the finger,and mouthed the words i am going to get you to the kainers while in the checkout line at an heb grocery store.the state also presented evidence that miller had been charged with resisting arrest while being apprehended on the deadly conduct charge,and had been charged with public intoxication and disorderly conduct one week before her sentencing.
miller testified on behalf of the defense that,in,miller was hospitalized for several weeks after suffering head injuries in a severe car accident.he stated that as a result of her accident,she suffered from reverse forward amnesia,stress disorder,and severe clinical depression,requiring extensive medication and the care of numerous physicians.he pointed out that before her accident,miller had been an industrious and responsible worker.miller aunt testified that miller was a good person,and that she hoped to move to louisiana to care for her elderly mother after the trial.
miller testified that she had never been arrested prior to her husband death.she claimed that she was taking several medications on account of her accident,and was seeing a number of physicians,including a neurologist and some psychiatrists.she stated that she was suffering from a variety of ailments,including memory loss,severe migraine headaches and a white matter disease that had to be monitored using mri every so often to see if it still growing.she asserted that,as a result of her condition,she had no memory of the shooting incident and could not recall mouthing the words i am going to get you to the kainers.
on,the prosecutor pointed out that miller did not have a close relationship with her mother and had not returned to care for her mother even though she lived only miles away.he also assailed miller claim that she was suffering from memory loss,insinuating that her testimony on this score was a fabrication in closing argument,the prosecutor opined 
and what a wonderfully selective memory she has.she can remember so many specific details about her employment and those types of things.she can remember specific details about being on the tractor and not being intoxicated.she can remember specific details that happen at heb,but she just does have a clue what could have happened out there on county road on december the.what does that look like you have common sense,ladies and gentlemen.i think you perfectly well know.
the jury imposed a sentence of eight years and a fine,and did not recommend that miller sentence be suspended.
after sentencing,miller trial counsel,richard manske,asked miller if she knew of any evidence that might convince the court to grant a new trial.miller told him the names of several doctors who were treating her for medical and psychiatric problems resulting from injuries she sustained in her car accident.manske contacted internist arthur tashnek,neurologist leonard hershkowitz,and clinical psychologist robert borda,and obtained letters from each regarding miller condition.
in his letter,tashnek stated that miller had been a patient of his since,and that she was suffering from stress disorder ptsd,gastro esophageal reflux disorder,irritable bowel syndrome,degenerative disk disease,memory loss,severe anxiety and depression,and retrograde amnesia.he noted that she was required to maintain a regular regimen of medications,and that her health would suffer significantly if these medications were not administered.
hershkowitz wrote in his letter that miller was suffering difficulties with cognitive function,and diagnosed organic brain syndrome.he noted that miller condition had been documented on several very sophisticated neuropsychological tests,but admitted that he was unaware of her prognosis or general condition.
finally,borda stated in his letter that he had tested miller at the request of hershkowitz,and had found indications of ptsd and syndrome.he noted that patients with severe ptsd exhibit marked feelings of vulnerability,suffer from depression and high anxiety,and may appear paranoid.according to borda,testing had revealed that miller suffered from cognitive rigidity and poor skills which typically are seen in injuries involving the frontal lobe.although he had not seen miller in over four years,he stated that her condition likely had not changed appreciably,and that imprisonment may exacerbate her ptsd,requiring intense psychiatric intervention.
armed with this evidence,miller filed an unsuccessful motion for new trial.her conviction was then affirmed on direct appeal and she filed a state habeas application alleging,inter alia,that manske was ineffective for failing to investigate and present evidence from miller doctors about her mental and emotional problems.attached to her state habeas application was an affidavit prepared by manske in which he admitted that he did not prepare much for the punishment phase because i thought that miller would accept the plea bargain offer of deferred adjudication probation.he conceded that he could have obtained the doctors letters before the punishment phase of the trial,and stated that in retrospect,he should have interviewed her doctors before trial and called them to testify in mitigation of punishment.the texas court of criminal appeals denied miller application without written explanation 
miller filed a petition under in the federal district court for the southern district of texas.the court denied miller petition and granted the state motion for summary judgment the court observed that admission of miller medical evidence was within the trial court discretion,and that manske could not be faulted for failing to offer it because it established no connection between miller mental condition and her illegal actions.further,the court held that miller was not prejudiced by manske failure to present the medical evidence because miller and her had testified regarding her condition,and the evidence showed that miller was guilty of the crime,had previous with the law,and had attempted to intimidate witnesses.
miller filed a notice of appeal,and the district court denied her application for coa.a single judge of our court granted coa on miller claim that manske was ineffective during the punishment phase of the trial because he failed to present expert testimony regarding miller medical and psychological problems.
this appeal is governed by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act,which provides that habeas relief may not be granted unless the challenged state court proceeding resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court.a decision must be more than merely incorrect in order to constitute an unreasonable application of federal law it must be objectively unreasonable habeas relief is inappropriate when a state court,at a minimum,reaches a satisfactory conclusion.
because we review only the reasonableness of a state court ultimate decision,the aedpa inquiry is not altered when,as in this case,state habeas relief is denied without a written opinion in this situation,we assume that the state court applied the proper clearly established federal law,and then determine whether its decision was contrary to or an objectively unreasonable application of that law.
we review the federal district court factual findings for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo 
on appeal,miller contends that the state court judgment is an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court,citing strickland washington because manske failure to adequately investigate her mental condition,contact her physicians,and present expert medical testimony at the punishment phase of her trial constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.our analysis of this claim is controlled by the test of deficient performance and prejudice set forth in strickland washington.we will examine the application of each prong in turn.
we first consider whether the state court unreasonably applied strickland in concluding that manske did not perform in a constitutionally deficient manner at the punishment phase of miller trial.in order to establish deficient performance,a petitioner must demonstrate that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.our scrutiny of counsel performance must be highly deferential,and we must presume that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance further,we must make every effort to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight,to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel challenged conduct,and to evaluate the conduct from counsel perspective at the time.to this end,a conscious and informed decision on trial tactics and strategy can not be the basis for constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel unless it is so ill chosen that it permeates the entire trial with obvious unfairness.
however,strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation.when assessing the reasonableness of an attorney investigation,we must consider not only the quantum of evidence already known to counsel,but also whether the known evidence would lead a reasonable attorney to investigate further.to establish that an attorney was ineffective for failure to investigate,a petitioner must allege with specificity what the investigation would have revealed and how it would have changed the outcome of the trial 
turning to the facts of this case,we note that manske was aware prior to the commencement of the punishment phase of miller trial that miller had suffered mental and emotional injuries as a result of her car accident.manske was also cognizant of the fact that these injuries comprised mitigating evidence,as indicated by his decision to elicit testimony about them from both miller and her.despite this knowledge,manske failed to contact miller treating physicians,and made no effort to call them as expert medical witnesses at trial.
we are mindful that complaints of uncalled witnesses are not favored given that the presentation of testimonial evidence is a matter of trial strategy.in this case,however,manske made his decision not to call miller physicians as witnesses without speaking to them,and without even procuring their names.in his affidavit,manske offers no tactical or strategic explanation for this lack of investigation.rather,he points to his erroneous belief that miller would accept the state plea bargain offer,and that miller would be acquitted or given probation if she refused to accept the offer,as grounds for his failure to adequately prepare for the punishment phase of trial.
the state hastens to add that manske could reasonably have declined to pursue the testimony of miller physicians because he could reasonably have believed that such evidence would not have been admitted at trial.we find this rationale unconvincing.under texas law,psychological evidence is admissible in a trial at the punishment stage if it is relevant to sentencing in muhammad state the el paso court of appeals held that a trial court abused its discretion when it excluded psychological evidence showing that a defendant calm demeanor after shooting his girlfriend was attributable to his introspective personality which affected his ability to express his emotions openly.the court found this evidence to be reliable and relevant to the defendant heat of passion defense in reaching this conclusion,the court observed that m itigating circumstances relevant to punishment are circumstances which will support a belief that defendants who commit criminal acts that are attributable to such circumstances are less culpable than others who have no such excuse.
applying these standards,the testimony of borda and hershkowitz likely would have been admissible at the punishment phase of miller trial.borda is a licensed psychologist who based his diagnosis on neuropsychological testing he conducted on miller.he diagnosed miller as suffering from ptsd and possible mild traumatic brain injury resulting in feelings of vulnerability,depression,high anxiety,appearances of paranoia,attentional deficits,emotional blunting,cognitive rigidity and poor skills.he noted that incarceration in a typical prison setting would exacerbate miller ptsd,requiring intense psychiatric intervention.doctor hershkowitz,in turn,is a neurologist and diplomat of the american board of neurology and psychiatry,and noted that miller mental problems had been documented on several very sophisticated neuropsychological tests.hershkowitz stated that miller has memory problems and a problem with cognitive function,and diagnosed her as having organic brain syndrome 
this evidence would likely have been relevant at the punishment stage of miller trial in a variety of ways.first,evidence that miller had ptsd would have mitigated the effect of miller prior charges for resisting arrest and disorderly conduct by providing an explanation for her erratic,paranoid,and hostile behavior.this evidence would also have provided an explanation for the shooting incident given that the prismeyers and kainers blamed miller for the death of larry miller further,evidence that miller had memory problems stemming from organic brain disease would have provided support for her claim that she could not remember the shooting incident or the altercation at claim that was effectively dismantled by the state vigorous and closing argument finally,the jury could have inferred based on the fact that miller had not sought treatment in roughly four years that her condition could be improved with consistent therapy,thus building a better case for probation.
the state also contends that manske made an informed and reasonable tactical decision to forego investigation into miller mental condition in order to focus his limited resources on more promising defenses.the state points out that manske was aware of miller condition,and argues that his prediction that miller would either accept a plea bargain or be acquitted was reasonable.
this argument misses the point.while manske may have made reasonable tactical decisions based on the information that he had at the time,our review must focus on whether the information he poss
