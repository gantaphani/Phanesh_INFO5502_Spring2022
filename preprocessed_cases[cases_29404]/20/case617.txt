corbin thomas appeals the district court order denying his motion for an extension of time to file a motion for relief pursuant to,and requests a certificate of appealability coa pursuant to.for the reasons discussed below,we will grant thomas request for a and affirm the district court order denying his motion for an extension of time.
from to,thomas was the director of a criminal enterprise that transported thousands of pounds of marijuana from california to pennsylvania.thomas wife was murdered in,and later that year he fled from the united states to jamaica.on march,a federal grand jury returned a count indictment against thomas based on his marijuana enterprise.in november,thomas was arrested in the united kingdom pursuant to a provisional extradition warrant.he contested that warrant until.during april of that year,he was finally brought before the district court for prosecution on the charges contained in the indictment.he was subsequently convicted of numerous offenses and sentenced to a total of months imprisonment.we affirmed on direct appeal,and on june,the united states supreme court denied thomas petition for certiorari.
as a federal prisoner,thomas could file a motion to vacate,set aside or correct his sentence in the district court within one year from denial of certiorari.see f.however,during that period,thomas was temporarily transferred to state custody,convicted of his wife murder,and sentenced to life imprisonment.specifically,thomas was in state custody at the time his certiorari petition in this case was denied june,he remained there until august,a period of approximately days,and was again in state custody from february,until may,a period of approximately days.on may,approximately three weeks before thomas deadline for filing a motion for relief under,he filed a pro se motion for a day extension of time.he argued that extra time was warranted because he was in state custody without access to legal materials needed to prepare his motion for over days during the one year limitations period.
on june,the district court entered an order denying thomas motion for an extension of time.in doing so,it explained,in a footnote,that thomas failed to demonstrate why the one year period of limitation should not apply under f.see united states thomas,cr.june,order denying motion for an extension of time.
thomas appealed that order,but he never filed an actual motion for relief under.instead,he submitted an application for a certificate of appealability coa to the district court in an effort to again appeal its denial of his motion for an extension of time.thomas coa application restated that he had been in state custody without access to legal materials,and also asserted a batson challenge to the jury selection prosecutorial misconduct for knowingly withholding material evidence of petitioner innocence,in violation of brady maryland and jury misconduct.app.at,d,d.the district court did not rule on his coa application.rather,it referred his coa application to us apparently because thomas appeal from the denial of his motion for extra time was pending.accordingly,we now review the district court denial of thomas motion and decide whether he should be entitled to a coa.
we have jurisdiction pursuant to.however,before evaluating the merits of thomas appeal,we must determine whether the district court had jurisdiction to enter its order denying thomas motion for extra time.see steel citizens for a better env t,d the requirement that jurisdiction be established as a threshold matter springs from the nature and limits of the judicial power of the united states and is inflexible and without exception.quoting mansfield,ry.swan.
the judicial power of federal courts is limited to cases and controversies.see const.art.iii,cl.already,llc nike,d.a judicial decision rendered in the absence of a case or controversy is advisory,and federal courts lack power to render advisory opinions.see bank of or.indep.ins.agents of,d.
this case arises under t he antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,which enacted the present and.lindh murphy,d.section gives federal courts jurisdiction to grant habeas relief to prisoners held in state custody,and does the same for federal prisoners.it is that a petition submitted by a state prisoner initiates a civil,rather than criminal,action for relief.see henderson frank,cir browder,dep t of corr.of,d ex parte tom tong.the prosecution against him is a criminal prosecution,but the writ of habeas corpus which he has obtained is not a proceeding in that prosecution.on the contrary,it is a new suit brought by him to enforce a civil right therefore,no case or controversy generally exists before an actual petition is filed.barden keohane,cir j urisdiction over a petition for a writ of habeas corpus is determined when the petition is filed.citing ross mebane,cir.
however,courts consider,among other things,judicial economy and the legal sophistication of pro se litigants when evaluating aedpa matters.see,united states miller,cir patton mullin,cir in the interest of judicial economy,however,we briefly consider the merits of appellant claim.citing b.in light of such considerations,mislabeled motions,or those preceding a formal request for substantive relief,are sometimes recharacterized as requests for relief under aedpa.see miller,at federal courts have long recognized that they have an obligation to look behind the label of a motion filed by a pro se inmate and determine whether the motion is,in effect,cognizable under a different remedial statutory framework referring to mason myers,cir applying miller rule for recharacterizing aedpa filings to jurisdictional issues that may arise by exercising judicial power in the absence of a formal request for habeas relief are thereby avoided.see id.this appeal is a matter of first impression in this circuit,as it requires that we determine the necessity of such an approach under,as well as the more pressing question of whether a sentencing court has jurisdiction over preliminary matters before a formal request for relief is filed.
this latter issue arose in united states leon,where the court of appeals for the second circuit evaluated whether there was jurisdiction to rule on a motion for an extension of time to file a motion before an actual motion was filed,cir.there,the court held that a district court could not rule on such a motion because no case or controversy exists until a formal request for relief is made.see id.at because appellant has not yet filed an actual petition,there is no case or controversy to be heard,and any opinion render ed on the timeliness issue would be merely advisory.in reaching this conclusion,the court implicitly viewed proceedings under and as different sides of the same coin for purposes of subject matter jurisdiction.see green united states,cir.that is,it essentially viewed proceedings as civil actions separate from prisoners underlying criminal cases,which is how motions under have been viewed.
we disagree with the court holding in leon because,although certain aspects of a proceeding may be considered civil a proceeding is a continuation of a defendant federal criminal case.see infra.as a result,under,a motion for an extension of time can be decided prior to a formal request for relief because the underlying prosecution satisfies article iii case or controversy requirement.
a review of the legislative history of clarifies this jurisdictional nuance.see united states williams,cir where the statutory language does not express congress intent unequivocally,a court traditionally refers to the legislative history and the atmosphere in which the statute was enacted in attempt to determine the congressional purpose.quoting united states gregg,cir.
the authority of federal courts to issue writs of habeas corpus originates in the constitution and was first given effect in the judiciary act of.see const.art.i,powell rice,d.initially,the act only applied to federal prisoners,and it empowered district courts in the jurisdiction where federal prisoners were confined to adjudicate requests for habeas relief.see id.at hayman.in,the act was amended to extend the authority of district courts to state prisoners seeking habeas relief,but it continued to require that petitions be submitted to the district court where a prisoner was confined.see id.in,the judicial conference of the united states charged a committee of federal judges with the duty of thoroughly examining habeas procedure in order to develop prudent reforms.see hayman,at.statistics showed that the volume of habeas cases nearly tripled between and,and that the burden of this increase was primarily born by a small number of district courts in jurisdictions where federal prisons were located.id.at,courts in such areas were required to handle an inordinate number of habeas corpus actions far from the scene of the facts,the homes of the witnesses and the records of the sentencing court solely because of the fortuitous concentration of federal prisoners within the district.id.at 
to rectify this problem,the conference proposed requiring prisoners convicted in federal courts to apply by motion in the sentencing court instead of making application for habeas corpus in the district in which they are confined.id.at internal citation omitted.in a revision of the judicial code,congress adopted the conference recommended approach by amending the code through two bills a procedural bill which provided that state prisoners shall file petitions for habeas corpus in state courts,or in the federal district of incarceration if exceptional circumstances exist and a jurisdictional bill requiring prisoners convicted in federal courts to apply by motion in the sentencing court instead of making application for habeas corpus in the district in which they are confined.see also and,sess.procedural bill and,cong.sess.jurisdictional bill.in developing these reforms,the senate judiciary committee of the congress issued a report which stated that t he legal and practical considerations for a different approach,in federal court habeas proceedings,to sentences in state courts and to sentences in federal courts is evident and has long been recognized by the congress and the courts,at.the report explained that the main advantages of such a motion remedy over the present habeas corpus are as follows 
h abeas corpus is a separate civil action and not a further step in the criminal case in which petitioner is sentenced ex parte tom tong.it is not a determination of guilt or innocence of the charge upon which petitioner was sentenced.where a prisoner sustains a right to discharge in habeas corpus,it is usually because some right such as a lack of counsel has been denied which reflects no determination of his guilt or innocence but affects solely the fairness of his earlier criminal trial.even under the broad power in the statute to dispose of the party as law and justice require,the court or judge is by no means in the same advantageous position in habeas corpus to do justice as would be so if the matter were determined in the criminal proceeding.for instance,the judge by habeas corpus can not grant a new trial in the criminal case.since the motion remedy is in the criminal proceeding,this section affords the opportunity and expressly gives the broad powers to set aside the judgment and to discharge the prisoner or resentence him or grant a new trial or correct the sentence as may appear appropriate.
at emphasis added.
thus,the motion to vacate a sentence,which was subsequently codified as was viewed as a continuation of the criminal case in the sentencing court in order to alleviate practical difficulties associated with fragmentation,and to more evenly distribute caseloads amongst districts.by making proceedings a continuation of the criminal case,congress also gave federal courts broader procedural latitude than in habeas actions.the latter were viewed as initiating federal civil suits that were separate from prisoners prior state criminal cases.
congress intent regarding the procedural posture of and is reflected in the titles congress adopted in promulgating each section procedural rules namely,the rules governing section cases in the united states district courts,and the rules governing section proceedings in the united states district courts.emphasis added.the advisory committee on the rules governing and repeatedly reinforces this distinction in its commentary for the rules.specifically,under rule of,titled scope,the advisory committee explains that a habeas motion under is a further step in a movant criminal case and not a separate civil action and,by contrast,habeas corpus is a separate civil action and not a further step in the criminal case in which a petitioner is sentenced.rule,advis.comm.notes.under rule,the committee explains that as in other motions filed in a criminal action,there is no requirement of a filing fee.it is appropriate that the present situation of docketing a motion as a new action and charging a fee be remedied rule,advis.comm.notes.similarly,rule commentary provides that s ince the motion is part of the criminal action in which was entered the judgment to which it is directed,the files,records,transcripts,and correspondence relating to that judgment are automatically available to the judge in his consideration of the motion.he no longer need order them incorporated for that purpose.rule,advis.comm.notes.the committee also explains that rule pertaining to differs from the corresponding discovery rule under the rules in that it includes the processes of discovery available under the federal rules of criminal procedure as well as the civil.this is because of the nature of a motion as a continuing part of the criminal proceeding rule,advis.comm.notes see also united states goodman,cir.
this interpretation of is consistent with instances in which congress and the advisory committee use the words motion and petition when referring to and,respectively,in a manner that highlights each measures distinct procedural posture.black law dictionary defines motion as a written or oral application requesting a court to make a specified ruling or order.black law dictionary ed.by contrast,petition is defined as a formal written request presented to a court or other official body,and i n some cases,the first pleading in a lawsuit.id.at emphasis added.this difference parallels the common understanding that motion often refers to a request submitted to a court during an action,while petition typically refers to the commencement of an action.thus,the senate report discussed above referring to and as sections and,respectively,provided that a petition for habeas corpus may be filed before any circuit or district judge within the circuit or district where the petitioner is confined and,by contrast,s ection creates a statutory remedy consisting of a motion before the court where a movant was convicted,at emphasis added.similarly,under rule of,the advisory committee emphasizes this distinction by explaining that u nder these rules the application for relief is in the form of a motion rather than a petition t herefore,there is no requirement that the movant name a respondent.rules,advis.comm.notes.even more convincingly,under rule,the advisory committee unequivocally states that c alling a request for relief a motion rather than a petition militates toward charging no new filing fee,not an increased one.in absence of convincing evidence to the contrary,there is no reason to suppose that congress did not mean what it said in making a action a motion.rule,advis.comm.notes emphasis added 
our analysis is consistent with that of the court of appeals for the tenth circuit in united states cook,cir.there,the tenth circuit held that courts should treat motions pertaining to proceedings as part of a defendant underlying criminal case.see id.specifically,under,an indigent prisoner can proceed in forma pauperis without paying otherwise applicable filing fees.the cook court explained that,prior to the enactment of the rules governing proceedings,this circuit,following the lead of the supreme court,interpreted to be a separate civil action which required either payment of a filing fee in the district court or leave to proceed in forma pauperis by the district court.id.
