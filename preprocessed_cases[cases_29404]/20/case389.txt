ortiz involvement in the riot 
several videotapes depicting scenes from the riot placed ortiz amidst the crowd between and.at various times,ortiz was clapping,smiling and pumping his arm.one video recording captured him waving his arm at and pointing down a road.ortiz can be heard to tell the crowd,hey everybody be quiet,the bitch is over there down the road by the pole.tr.as a result,other individuals pointed and headed in that direction.tr.ortiz was also placed at the scene when a whole bunch of people were rushing towards a certain point.tr.he is captured in a different video recording reach ing back and grab bing an unidentified woman from behind.tr.ortiz is shown facing forward and reaching back and smiling and grabbing her breast.id.
video evidence also depicted ortiz smiling and clapping at the scene of the riot when victims who testified at trial were also present.testified that she was surrounded by a large group of men,that several of them pulled down her top,exposing her breasts,and that they touched her breasts and buttock and penetrated her vagina until she was able to break free from the crowd.testified that a group of approximately twenty men surrounded her,doused her with water,and ripped her tank top.she alleged that ortiz himself grabbed her breasts and then restrained her while others groped her body and penetrated her vagina and rectum with their fingers video evidence placed ortiz at the scene with both women.
testifying on his own behalf,ortiz acknowledged that men in the crowd were attacking women,including both and.he further admitted that he was present in the crowd during these attacks.he testified,however,that he was trying to assist and and that he did not participate in any of the attacks.ortiz acknowledged pointing out women to the men in the crowd and saying,s hush,be qu iet,look at them bitch,she is over there by the pole.tr.he testified,however,that he made the comment not to encourage further incidents but to divert rioters from a woman under threat of attack.finally,ortiz testified that at he noticed the situation was getting out of control,and he left the park.tr.
twenty other women testified that they were molested by crowds of men in ways similar to the attacks on and.some of these victims were attacked before ortiz allegedly left the scene.for example,ortiz conceded in his brief to the appellate division that video evidence placed him at the scene when and were attacked.see pet r app.div.br.testified that,as she was exiting the park at around or,a group of approximately twenty to thirty men surrounded her and her companions,dousing them with water.approximately five men grabbed breasts,clothing,and buttocks,and she fell to the ground,whereupon more men grabbed her exposed breasts.as escaped from the crowd,yet additional men grabbed her breasts and buttocks,a friend of and a companion of hers that day,testified that she was separated from and her other friends by the same large group of men.the crowd attempted to remove clothing,and at one point her shirt was pulled down and her breasts exposed.breasts and buttocks were groped multiple times over her clothing.
the first degree riot counts lodged against ortiz required the state to establish,among other things,that a person other than one of the riot participants suffer ed physical injury.penal law mckinney.of the seven victims named in the counts charging ortiz with first degree riot,five testified that they were attacked subsequent to ortiz claimed time of departure.for example,and,newlyweds honeymooning in the united states,exited central park around testified that twenty to forty men surrounded them and sprayed them with water.a group of men threw him to the ground and kept him there,while others surrounded testified that she was surrounded by men,pushed to the ground,and that she had her skirt and underwear removed.they touched her breasts and vagina.she suffered injuries,including scratches above her chest and a laceration near her vagina,also named in a riot count,was attacked sometime after.her assailants ripped off her shirt and took a necklace she was wearing.during the fracas,then fifteen years old,sprained her knee and suffered bruises and scratches.similarly,a college student visiting from england,was attacked twice between and.she was punched in the face as assailants removed her shirt,touched her exposed breast,and reached inside her shorts to penetrate her anus and vagina.lost about in cash and a bank card when assailants left with her handbag.
based on the time estimates they provided,two of the victims named in the first degree riot counts may have been attacked either before or after,when ortiz claims to have left the park.stated that more than forty men surrounded her,and that many touched her breasts,buttocks,and vaginal area,both over and under her clothing,sometime between and.she suffered a cut to her back and received bruises on her arms and legs and scratches on her chest,neck,and buttocks as a result of the assault,a young mother from new jersey,was attacked sometime between and.she was kicked in the shin when,surrounded by a crowd of men who were touching her breasts and buttocks,she tried to push away one who was attempting to put his hand inside her pants.suffered a bruised and swollen leg.
ii.state court proceedings 
ortiz was indicted for seven counts of riot in the first degree,in violation of penal law.he was also charged with seven counts of assault in the second degree,in violation of penal law,for causing injury in furtherance of the commission of a felony,to wit,riot in the first degree.finally,ortiz was indicted for four counts of sexual abuse in the first degree,in violation of penal law,for sexual contact with 
the scope of ortiz criminal liability for actions taken by rioters after his alleged departure was an issue during his trial.in particular,the defense argued at the charge conference that in this particular situation,i think what we have to say,is when somebody is no longer there they are not responsible tr.the court disagreed,stating that w hat i think i will say is once one joins a riot,that person remains criminally liable for the conduct set in motion until he withdraws tr.when instructing the jury on this issue,the court first read the text of the riot statute,which,at the time of ortiz conduct,stated as follows 
a person is guilty of riot in the first degree when a simultaneously with ten or more other persons he engages in tumultouous sic and violent conduct and thereby intentionally or recklessly causes or creates a grave risk of causing public alarm,and b in the course of and as a result of such conduct,a person other than one of the participants suffers physical injury or substantial property damage occurs.
penal law mckinney see also tr.
the court then continued 
furthermore,one who participates in a riot is responsible for the violence of any committed during the entire riot.this is because the law punishes joint behavior.and one who joins a riot takes it as one finds it m erely leaving the riot scene would not end one s criminal responsibility for someone actions.that because the law punishes a joint action and a participant is responsible for the consequences of the group s joint action or the conduct set in motion by the riot regardless of whether that person was actually there or present at the precise moment of the conduct.moreover,once one joins a riot,that person remains criminally liable for the conduct set in motion until he makes substantial effort to end the conduct.
tr.in short,the court instructions made clear that,absent substantial efforts to end the riot,ortiz was criminally liable for injuries inflicted by the continuing riot subsequent to the time that he testified he had departed from the scene.
after deliberating,on april,the jury convicted ortiz of all seven counts of riot in the first degree and assault in the second degree.ortiz was acquitted of three counts of sexual abuse of,regarding contact with her buttocks,vagina and anus,and the jury was unable to reach a verdict on the fourth,regarding her breasts.he received concurrent sentences of five years on the assault convictions and one and one third to four years for the riot convictions.
ortiz appealed his convictions to the appellate division first department,making two arguments that are relevant here.first,ortiz argued that his convictions were supported by insufficient evidence because there was not enough proof to show that he was taking part in the riot at the time when any of the women named in the riot counts received injury.second,ortiz argued that,because the jury instructions imposed liability for actions taken by members of the continuing riot after he left the scene,the instructions were so fundamentally flawed as to deny him a fair trial under the fourteenth amendment.in particular,ortiz argued that the scope of criminal liability articulated in the jury instructions was completely in derogation of the plain terms of the statute,the legislative intent and the law purposes.pet r app.div.br.
the appellate division rejected ortiz arguments and affirmed his convictions 
the verdict was based on legally sufficient evidence.contrary to defendant argument,the people were not required to prove that he was still present at,or participating in,the riot at the moment of the victims injuries.the riot statute permits a riot participant to be held criminally liable for the acts of other participants,in the course of the same continuing riot,even after his or her own participation may have terminated.similarly,the court instruction in this regard was correct.
people ortiz,citations omitted.the new york court of appeals denied ortiz leave to appeal.people ortiz.
iii.federal court proceedings 
on january,ortiz filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the southern district of new york.in the petition,he reiterated the same arguments he made to the appellate division.on february,magistrate judge ronald ellis issued a report and recommendation denying ortiz claims.judge ellis found,inter alia,that the jury instructions did not deprive ortiz of the right to a fair trial and that his convictions were supported by sufficient evidence.specifically,judge ellis found that the trial court instructions on liability for the actions of other riot participants was not a misstatement of state law,app.at,and that the appellate division interpretation of the riot statute was not so egregious as to be fundamentally unfair and thus violate the fair notice aspect of the due process clause,id.at quoting ponnapula spitzer,cir internal quotation marks omitted.on february,the district court adopted judge ellis report and recommendation in full,denied ortiz petition,and declined to issue a certificate of appealability.
ortiz moved for a certificate of appealability from this court pro se,and on january,we granted the certificate and appointed counsel.we instructed counsel to brief the issue of whether the application of new york penal law to ortiz,who was absent at the time of the assaults underlying his conviction,violated his due process right to fair notice.app.at.thus,our review is limited to ortiz claim that the state courts interpretation of the new york riot statute deprived him of the due process right to fair notice.see armienti united states,cir we will not address a claim not included in the certificate of appealability.c unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability,an appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a state court.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review a district court denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus de novo.see,anderson miller,cir.the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,stat,establishes a deferential standard of review of a state court adjudication of the merits of a petitioner claim.wilson mazzuca,cir quoting dolphy mantello,cir.under aedpa,we may not issue a writ of habeas corpus with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.because the appellate division rejected ortiz due process challenge to the jury instructions construing penal law,and thereby implicitly rejected ortiz fair notice claim,that claim has been adjudicated on the merits.see dallio spitzer,cir our precedents instruct that to qualify as an adjudication on the merits,a state court decision need not mention a particular argument or explain the reasons for rejecting it.thus,as agreed by both parties,the aedpa standard of review applies.
section d defines two categories of cases in which a state prisoner may obtain federal habeas relief where the relevant decision was either contrary to clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court.williams taylor,d quoting d.we have previously stated that a state court decision is contrary to existing supreme court precedent i when it applies a rule of law that contradicts the governing law set forth in the supreme court cases,or ii when it confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of the supreme court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from the supreme court precedent.lurie wittner,cir alterations in original citations omitted quoting williams,at.ortiz does could that the new york courts stated the fair notice standard in a way that contradicts supreme court precedent moreover,he mentions no case with materially indistinguishable facts.thus,the contrary to clause of section d is not at issue.
instead,ortiz appeal is predicated upon the unreasonable application prong of section d.it is in this c ircuit that the objectively unreasonable standard of d means that a petitioner must identify some increment of incorrectness beyond error in order to obtain habeas relief.lynn bliden,cir alterations in original quoting cotto herbert,cir internal quotation marks omitted.thus,we may not issue the writ simply because we conclude in our independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.rathe
