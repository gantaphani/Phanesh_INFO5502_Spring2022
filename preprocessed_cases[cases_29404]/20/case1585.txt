in,an ohio state jury convicted biros of the aggravated murder with two death penalty specifications,felonious sexual penetration,aggravated robbery,and attempted rape of tami engstrom.engstrom left work early due to illness on the night of february,and drove from hubbard,ohio,to the nickelodeon lounge in masury,ohio,to visit her uncle,daniel hivner.engstrom consumed several alcoholic drinks at the nickelodeon.petitioner,kenneth biros,arrived at the nickelodeon around,approximately one hour after engstrom arrival.biros knew hivner but had never met engstrom.by midnight engstrom had passed out at the nickelodeon.at approximately,hivner and biros assisted engstrom in moving from the bar to the parking lot.once outside,engstrom insisted on driving herself home,but hivner determined that she was too intoxicated to drive and took her keys away from her.according to hivner,it was at this point that biros offered to take engstrom for coffee in order to counteract the effects of the alcohol.biros and engstrom left the nickelodeon parking lot at approximately in biros car.hivner waited at the bar past closing time for biros to return with engstrom,but biros never returned.
the following day andy engstrom,tami engstrom husband,drove to biros home after learning that engstrom was last seen with biros.biros claimed that he tapped engstrom on the shoulder while they were in the car and she freaked out,got out of the car and started running through these people yards on davis street in sharon,pennsylvania.biros told similar stories to several other people on february several of the individuals biros spoke to observed cuts and scratches on biros hands and a fresh wound over his right eye.biros explained that he injured his hands when he locked himself out of his house and had to break a window and cut his eye while chopping wood.biros assisted engstrom relatives in searching for her in the area where he claimed to have last seen her.
biros lived in brookfield township,ohio,with his mother and brother.on the morning of february,biros mother found a gold ring on the bathroom floor of their home.biros first told his mother that he knew nothing about the ring when she questioned him,but later said that it might belong to the woman who jumped out of his car early that morning.biros then took the ring and told his mother he would return it to the nickelodeon.rather than returning the ring to the bar,biros hid it in the ceiling of his house.
on february,police officers called biros home and left a message requesting that he come to the police station for questioning.upon hearing the message,biros drove to the police station to discuss engstrom disappearance with brookfield township,ohio,and sharon,pennsylvania,police officers.the officers informed biros that he was not under arrest and was free to leave at any time.biros repeated the same story that he had previously told engstrom family and friends.specifically,biros told police that he left the nickelodeon with engstrom early in the morning on february to get coffee and food in sharon,pennsylvania.biros claimed that engstrom passed out in his car,but later woke up while biros was withdrawing money from an automated teller machine.according to biros,engstrom insisted that he drive her back to the nickelodeon.biros told police that as he was driving on davis street in sharon,pennsylvania,engstrom jumped from the vehicle and ran away.when asked whether engstrom might have left her purse in his vehicle,biros responded that he had cleaned the vehicle and found no purse.
during the interview,captain john klaric began to question biros account of the events leading up to engstrom disappearance.klaric suggested that perhaps biros had made a sexual advance toward engstrom,which might have caused her to flee from the vehicle.biros denied making any sexual advances.klaric also suggested that perhaps biros had made a sexual advance and engstrom jumped from the vehicle and struck her head.biros also denied this hypothesis.after further questioning,klaric suggested that maybe an accident had occurred during which engstrom fell out of the car and struck her head.it was at this point that biros responded yes,and admitted that he had done something very bad.klaric offered to speak to biros alone and biros agreed.according to klaric,after the other police officers left the room,biros told him,it like you said,we were in the car together.we were out along the railroad tracks.i touched her on the hand.then i went further.i either touched or felt her leg.she pushed my hand away.the car was quite stopped.she opened the door and fell and struck her head on the tracks.biros told klaric that engstrom was dead and that the incident occurred along the railroad tracks near king graves road in brookfield township.at that point,police informed biros of his miranda rights.see miranda arizona,d.
biros signed a written waiver of his miranda rights and then repeated his story to detective rocky fonce of the brookfield township police department.biros told police that engstrom body was in pennsylvania.when police requested that biros give them an exact location,biros asked to speak to an attorney.after consulting with an attorney,biros agreed to show police the location of engstrom body.
ohio authorities discovered several of engstrom severed body parts in a desolate wooded area of butler county,pennsylvania on february.police found other portions of engstrom body in a desolate wooded area of venango county,pennsylvania,approximately thirty miles north of the butler county site.engstrom head and right breast had been severed from her torso.her right leg had been amputated above the knee.the body was completely naked except for what appeared to be remnants of black leg stockings that had been purposely rolled down to engstrom feet or ankles.the torso had been cut open and the abdominal cavity was partially eviscerated.the anus,rectum,and all but a small portion of her sexual organs had been removed and were never recovered by the police.
forensic technicians and law enforcement investigators searched the area of the railroad tracks where biros had indicated that the incident with engstrom occurred.the investigators discovered a large area of bloodstained gravel near the tracks,blood spatters on the side of one of the steel tracks,and numerous other bloodstains in the same general area.bloodstains and swabbings of blood collected at the scene were tested and found to be consistent with engstrom blood.investigators also found what appeared to be part of engstrom intestines in a swampy area near the railroad tracks.dna testing confirmed that the intestines recovered were part of engstrom remains.approximately one month later,investigators found engstrom black leather coat partially buried near the tracks.there were two cuts or slash marks on or near the collar of the coat.engstrom house keys and a tube of lipstick were also found in a shallow hole near the coat.one of engstrom black leather shoes was also found in the area near the tracks.
a number of items were also recovered by police during a search of biros house including a bloodstained pocket knife,another,much larger knife,a bloodstained coat later identified as the coat biros wore to the nickelodeon,and a pair of size eleven tennis shoes.the bloodstains from biros pocket knife and coat were tested and found to be consistent with engstrom blood.additionally,a hair found embedded in a seam near the tread of one of the tennis shoes was tested and found to be consistent with known samples of hair from the victim head.the police also searched the car biros drove to the brookfield township police department.forensic technicians identified several bloodstains in the car,some were consistent with engstrom blood and others were consistent with biros blood.a small piece of tissue,believed to be from engstrom liver,was found in the trunk of the car.
an autopsy of engstrom body revealed that she suffered premortem injuries indicative of a severe beating and an attempt at sexual mutilation and five stab wounds which were inflicted immediately after engstom death.in addition to these wounds,engstrom head,right breast,and right lower extremity had been severed from her body at some point following her death.her anus,rectum,urinary bladder,and virtually all of her sexual organs had been removed and were never found.her gallbladder,the right lobe of her liver,and portions of the bowels were also extracted from her body.the coroner found no evidence that engstrom had been struck by an automobile as biros claimed and concluded that engstrom had died of asphyxia due to strangulation.
the trumbull county grand jury issued a indictment against biros on february,charging him with aggravated murder with two specifications of aggravating circumstances count,felonious sexual penetration count,abuse of corpse count,aggravated robbery count,and attempted rape count.biros pleaded not guilty to all charges and specifications.the state of ohio dismissed the abuse of corpse charge prior to trial.a jury convicted on the remaining four counts and recommended that biros be sentenced to death on the capital charge.the trial court filed a written opinion concluding that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors and sentenced biros to death.
biros timely appealed his conviction and death sentence to the ohio court of appeals,eleventh district,and to the ohio supreme court.biros,at.his convictions and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal.biros next unsuccessfully sought relief in state court.biros,wl,at.he later filed an application to reopen his appeal from his convictions under ohio rule of appellate procedure b.the supreme court of ohio denied the application on the merits.biros,at.
in september,biros filed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court,which granted the writ as to his sentence of death and denied the writ as to his remaining claims.bagley filed a timely notice of appeal from the district court decision to vacate biros death sentence.biros filed a timely notice of from the district court decision to deny the remainder of his petition.
because biros filed his petition after april,it is subject to the requirements of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa.campbell coyle,cir.accordingly,this court reviews the district court legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.moss hofbauer,cir.here,however,the district court made no independent determination of fact,so its factual findings are also reviewed de novo.bugh mitchell,cir.
under the aedpa,a writ may not be granted unless the state court adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.a state court renders an adjudication contrary to federal law when it arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or decides a case differently than the supreme court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.williams taylor,d.a state court renders an unreasonable application of federal law when it identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.id.at.claims involving a mixed question of law and fact are reviewed under the unreasonable application prong of d.see lancaster adams,cir citing harpster ohio,cir.factual findings made by the state court,or by state appellate courts based upon the trial record,are presumed to be correct but may be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.see e bugh,at.
bagley contends that the district court improperly granted the writ as to biros claim of an insufficient indictment.as his first ground for habeas relief,biros asserted that the prosecution indictment against him was insufficient to sustain a capital charge because the two death penalty specifications did not contain language indicating whether he was the principal offender or whether he committed the offense with prior calculation and design,as mandated in ohio ann.a.biros also argued that the jury instructions lacked the requisite language to support a capital conviction,meaning that the jury did not find each element of the capital offense beyond a reasonable doubt.bagley argues that biros claim was procedurally defaulted because biros challenged the indictment for the first time on direct appeal rather than entering an objection at trial.the district court held that this claim was procedurally defaulted,but nevertheless granted habeas relief based on this court holding in esparza mitchell,cir,which affirmed the issuance of a writ because the indictment against the defendant did not indicate whether he acted as the principal offender or whether he committed the offense with prior calculation and design.see ohio ann.a.the district court also noted that the esparza decision held that review of this claim was not subject to harmless error analysis.
federal habeas review is precluded where a state court does not address a petitioner federal claims because the petitioner has failed to meet a state procedural requirement that is independent of the federal question and adequate to support the judgment.coleman thompson,d.to determine whether a petitioner has procedurally defaulted a claim for the purpose of federal habeas review,a federal court must consider whether there is a procedural rule applicable to the petitioner claim and whether the petitioner failed to follow this rule whether the state courts actually enforced the state procedural rule and whether the state procedural rule is an adequate and independent state ground to foreclose relief.monzo edwards,cir.the adequacy of a state procedural bar turns on whether it is firmly established and regularly followed a state rule is independent if the state court actually relies on it to preclude a merits review.abela martin,cir citation omitted.if the previous three questions are answered affirmatively,then the federal court must consider whether the petitioner has established cause for his failure to follow the rule and prejudice resulting from the alleged constitutional error.monzo,at.
biros claim is procedurally defaulted.on direct appeal,the ohio supreme court determined that biros raised no objection concerning the sufficiency of the indictment at trial.biros,at.the ohio supreme court held that biros failure to timely object to the allegedly defective indictment constitutes a waiver of the issues involved.id.at citing state joseph,ohio.thus the state supreme court reviewed the claim for plain error and rejected it,concluding that the indictment clearly provided appellant with adequate notice of the death penalty specifications with which he was being charged.id.at.this court has held that ohio contemporaneous objection rule constitutes an adequate and independent state ground barring federal habeas review and that the application of plain error review constitutes enforcement of the rule.see hinkle randle,cir.
biros contends that the contemporaneous objection rule was neither firmly established nor regularly followed,as the joseph decision,upon which the ohio supreme court relied for its holding that biros waived his challenge to the indictment,biros trial by four years.however,joseph cites state williams,ohio,in support of its holding.williams,which held that an appellate court need not consider an error which a party complaining of the trial court judgment could have called,but did not call,to the trial court attention at a time when such error could have been avoided or corrected by the trial court,see id.at,biros trial by nearly fourteen years and incorporates the contemporaneous objection rule as set forth in ohio rule of criminal procedure.see engle isaac,d.any other rule would create an incentive for defendants to postpone challenging a faulty indictment until after trial.
despite the fact that this claim was procedurally defaulted,the district court addressed the merits and granted the writ as to this claim.the district court reasoned that this court esparza opinion concluded that the type of error about which biros complained is a structural defect and not subject to dismissal on procedural grounds.the district court also observed that this court held that harmless error analysis was not proper for the claim in esparza.in esparza,this court explained that n one of the seminal supreme court eighth amendment cases requiring the narrowing of the class of defendants eligible for the death penalty permits the offender to be executed because the error was deemed harmless.esparza,at.
the supreme court reversed this court holding in esparza,finding that the sixth circuit exceeded its authority under d i n relying on the absence of precedent to distinguish our cases,and to hold that review is not available for this type of eighth amendment claim.mitchell esparza,d.the supreme court further stated that,a federal court may not overrule a state court for simply holding a view different from its own,when the precedent from this court is,at best,ambiguous.id.at.ultimately the court found that 
t he ohio supreme court has defined a principal offender as the actual killer,state chinn,ohio,and in this case,the jury was instructed on the elements of aggravated murder,defined as purposely causing the death of another while committing aggravated robbery,at suhrheinrich,dissenting in light of these instructions,the jury verdict would surely have been the same had it been instructed to find as well that the respondent was a principal in the offense.after all,he was the only defendant charged in the indictment.there was no evidence presented that anyone other than respondent was involved in the crime or present at the store under these circumstances,we can not say that the state court conclusion that respondent was convicted of a capital offense was objectively unreasonable.that being the case,we may not set aside its decision on habeas review.
id.at.parallel citations and footnote omitted.additionally,the court held that harmless error review can apply to eighth amendment claims based upon the trial court failure to instruct a jury on all of the statutory elements of an offense.id.at.the court distinguished between an omitted instruction that would cast doubt upon all of a jury findings,thereby voiding the conviction,and an omitted instruction that precluded the jury from determining only one element of an offense that would be subject to harmless error analysis,implicitly determining that esparza situation fell into the latter category.id.at.moreover,the court concluded that the state court harmless error review was not objectively unreasonable under aedpa,as the defendant capital conviction would have been the same had the indictment and jury instructions contained the principal offender language because t here was no evidence presented that anyone other than the defendant was involved in the crime.id.at.
biros claim calls for a similar conclusion.to determine harmfulness the court must ask,whether the error had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict.coe bell,cir quoting brecht abrahamson,d.it is clear that the erroneous indictment and jury instructions at issue in the present case had no such effect or influence on the jury verdict.the district court opinion states that if a harmless error standard of review was applied to this habeas claim,the court would be constrained to rule differently since there is absolutely no question that biros,who admitted killing tami engstrom,albeit accidentally,acted alone.based on the foregoing,we reverse the grant of the writ as to biros sentence.
biros raises four issues on whether his statements to the police should have been suppressed,whether the prosecution use of peremptory challenges to remove prospective jurors who expressed hesitation about the death penalty denied him a fair trial,whether the admission of cumulative and gruesome photographs denied him a fair trial,and whether sufficient evidence supports his conviction for aggravated robbery.
biros contends that he was denied his right against and a fundamentally fair trial because the trial court failed to suppress statements he made during a police interview as a prime suspect in police custody and without being given miranda warnings.the ohio supreme court concluded that the factual circumstances did not indicate that biros was in custody for miranda purposes and rejected the claim on the merits.biros,at.the district court held that the state court determination was not an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent.
miranda warnings are required where a suspect is in custody,which occurs when there has been a formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement.mason mitchell,cir quoting oregon mathiason,d.a reviewing court determines whether or not a defendant is in custody by considering the objective circumstances of the interrogation,rather than the subjective views harbored by either the interrogating officers or the person being questioned.id.quoting stansbury california,d.instead of focusing upon where the questioning occurred or if the individual is a suspect,the determination must be concerned with how a reasonable man in the suspect position would have understood his situation.id.quoting berkemer mccarty,d.whether a defendant is in custody is a mixed question of law and fact and therefore is subject to de novo review.united states salvo,cir citing thompson keohane,d.
the district court properly concluded that the ohio supreme court application of clearly established supreme court precedent was not unreasonable.officer frank murphy left a message on biros telephone answering machine indicating that investigators would like to interview him concerning engstrom disappearance.he asked biros to visit the police station,which biros did.on his way to the police station,a police officer passed biros on the road,stopped biros,and told him that the police wanted to speak with him.the officer then continued on his patrol,and biros proceeded to the police station,arriving alone at.when biros entered the station,officer rocky fonce accompanied him to an interrogation room,which was approximately six feet by nine feet and contained a desk,a cabinet,a few chairs,a blood alcohol content analyzer,and a video camera.the interrogation room door was left open.the police gave no indication that biros was under arrest or not free to leave.biros freedom was not limited and his movements were not restrained.biros was not told that he was under arrest or that he could not leave.in fact,at some point during biros minute conversation with officer john klaric,klaric told biros that he was free to leave and was not required to answer questions.after biros told klaric and fonce that engstrom had died while running from his car after he made sexual advances toward her,biros was given miranda warnings because the information provided during the interview justified biros arrest.
in light of the trial record,the district court properly held that the state court decis
