amended opinion 
alfred dicenzi appeals the district court dismissal of his habeas petition on the ground that the petition was not timely filed.following a guilty plea to vehicular homicide,dicenzi was given the maximum sentence under ohio law,but claims he was never informed by either the trial court or his attorney that ohio affords those sentenced to a maximum sentence a right to a direct appeal of their sentences.when dicenzi finally became aware of this right,he filed a motion for delayed direct appeal,but this motion was denied by the court of appeals of ohio and the supreme court of ohio.he then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to in federal district court,alleging that his constitutional rights had been violated both by the trial court when it did not inform him of his right to appeal,and by the state appellate court when it refused to consider his delayed appeal.the district court determined that the petition was untimely,and dismissed it without reaching the merits.because we find that the portion of dicenzi petition relating to the ohio appellate courts decisions was timely,and because we find that the district court failed to determine conclusively whether dicenzi was diligent during the time when he claims to have been unaware of his appeal rights,we vacate the district court dismissal of the petition and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
on may,in the cuyahoga county court of common pleas,dicenzi pleaded guilty to aggravated vehicular homicide and aggravated vehicular assault.he was sentenced to five years imprisonment on the vehicular homicide count and eighteen months on the vehicular assault count,to be served consecutively.this constituted the maximum possible sentence for these convictions,and thus under ohio law the sentencing judge was required to make certain specific factual findings and inform dicenzi of his right to appeal his sentence despite his guilty plea.ohio a b a.at sentencing,however,the trial judge did not inform dicenzi of his right to appeal his sentence.
eight months later,in february,dicenzi counsel filed a motion for judicial release in which he argued that good behavior rendered dicenzi eligible for probation.this motion was denied on april.on march,dicenzi filed a pro se motion to merge his two convictions for sentencing purposes,to avoid duplicate punishment for the same acts.no court appears to have acted on this motion.then,in august,dicenzi contacted the cuyahoga county public defenders office public defender,who informed him of his right to appeal his sentence.as a result,dicenzi immediately filed a motion for leave to file a delayed appeal of his sentence on august.this motion was denied by the ohio court of appeals on september.
at this point,the public defender independently decided to investigate the case.after examining the sentencing transcript and determining that dicenzi had never been notified of his right to appeal,the public defender agreed to represent dicenzi and,pursuant to ohio appellate rule,filed a motion for reconsideration in the court of appeals for cuyahoga county on october.the motion was denied without opinion on october.the public defender then filed a motion to file a delayed appeal in the supreme court of ohio on november,arguing that dicenzi had been denied his right to due process under the constitution by the state failure to grant him the right to a delayed appeal when he had been unaware of his right to appeal prior to august.though this motion was granted,the supreme court of ohio later dismissed the appeal.
dicenzi,still represented by the public defender,then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to in federal district court,alleging a sixth amendment violation arising from his attorney failure to notify him of his appeal rights and also three due process violations arising from the trial court failure to afford him the required protections of ohio law in imposing a maximum sentence,the trial court failure to advise him of his appellate rights,and the state appellate court refus al to allow him to file a delayed appeal.a magistrate judge recommended dismissal of the petition,finding both that the petition was not timely filed and that equitable tolling was not warranted.over dicenzi objections and after a de novo review of the record,the district court dismissed the petition as untimely for effectively the same reasons as those found in the magistrate judge recommendation,but granted a certificate of appealability as to the timeliness issue.the public defender timely appealed on dicenzi behalf.
standard of review 
since the only issue on appeal is whether the district court properly calculated the timeliness of dicenzi habeas petition under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat.codified at d,we review the district court interpretation of the statute de novo.see,miller collins,cir.the relevant aedpa statute of limitations is as follows 
d a period of limitation shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court.the limitation period shall run from the latest of 
a the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review 
b the date on which the impediment to filing an application created by state action in violation of the constitution or laws of the united states is removed,if the applicant was prevented from filing by such state action 
c the date on which the constitutional right asserted was initially recognized by the supreme court,if the right has been newly recognized by the supreme court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review or 
d the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.
dicenzi petition raised four grounds for granting a writ of habeas corpus.claims through deal with matters that occurred at sentencing,and claim deals specifically with a decision of the court of appeals.we will consider the claim first,and then proceed to evaluate the claims.
claim based on the ohio court of appeals denial of delayed appeal 
dicenzi first claims that the appellate court improperly refused to allow him to file a delayed appeal.this claim accrued when the court of appeals for cuyahoga county denied dicenzi motion for delayed appeal,on september.therefore,under d,the aedpa clock began running on september,see d d initiating the aedpa requirement on the date upon which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.
dicenzi did not file a motion to appeal in the supreme court of ohio until november,days after the court of appeals denied dicenzi motion for delayed appeal.in dicenzi november motion,he presented,in accordance with ohio procedural rules,reasons why the supreme court of ohio should hear his appeal despite the fact that the applicable time limit for direct appeals had ended.such a motion for delayed appeal,even if granted,does not restart the statute of limitations,but if properly filed,it does toll the statute during the time the motion was pending.see,searcy carter,cir holding that motions for delayed appeal toll the aedpa statute of limitations under d,but that such motions are not part of the direct appeal for the purposes of d.accordingly,the aedpa clock was stopped,with days elapsed,as of november,pending the ohio supreme court consideration of dicenzi motion.
on december,the ohio supreme court granted dicenzi motion for leave to file the appeal,and ordered the parties to brief the jurisdictional merits of the appeal.on april,the ohio supreme court concluded that dicenzi claim did not merit ohio supreme court jurisdiction because no significant constitutional question was presented.however,the fact that the appeal itself was ultimately denied on its jurisdictional merits does not alter the fact that dicenzi aedpa statute of limitations was tolled during the consideration of his motion,once it was accepted for filing.see bonill
