petitioner trevor neverson,a native and citizen of trinidad,was convicted of involuntary manslaughter by a massachusetts jury in.after a delay of several years,neverson sought federal habeas corpus relief.the district court held that neverson habeas petition was timely under the doctrine of equitable tolling but denied the petition on the merits.
we affirm on a different ground.this case presents a question that this court has several times noted but declined to resolve whether d,which imposes a limitations period on habeas corpus petitions by state prisoners,is subject to the defense of equitable tolling the district judge,directed to consider that question by a previous panel of this court,see neverson bissonnette,cir,held that the d limitations period is subject to equitable tolling and that neverson qualifies for protection under that doctrine.we hold that equitable tolling may apply under d in appropriate cases,but conclude that the district court was not justified in tolling the d limitations period on the facts of this case.
we begin by noting what is at stake in this appeal.though framed as an attack on his state conviction under,neverson habeas petition is at bottom an effort to prevent his removal to trinidad.while neverson was in prison for his massachusetts manslaughter conviction,the ins instigated removal proceedings against him and,in,ordered him decision based in part on the fact of neverson manslaughter conviction.a a iii commission of an aggravated felony by an alien is a ground for removal.neverson finished serving his massachusetts prison sentence in march.upon his release,he was immediately taken into ins custody,where he remains today.neverson now seeks relief from his manslaughter conviction in order to attack his removal the writ issues,he will petition the ins to reopen his deportation proceeding and reconsider his eligibility for certain kinds of relief from removal,asylum.to this end,neverson amended his petition in the district court to add claims against the ins and certain ins officials under together,the ins respondents.
we recount the facts underlying neverson conviction,together with the tangled history of state,immigration,and federal habeas proceedings that followed.because the timeliness of neverson petition is at issue,the various dates are important.details that do not bear on our decision are omitted 
neverson state conviction 
in,a massachusetts grand jury indicted neverson for the murder of leshawna wright,his infant stepdaughter.his first trial,held in,resulted in a deadlocked jury and a judgment of acquittal to the extent that the indictment charged murder.in,the commonwealth tried again.at the trial,the prosecution presented expert testimony that blunt force trauma was the cause of the baby death.the child injuries included fractured ribs,abrasions and contusions,and severe damage to internal organs.two medical experts testified for the prosecution that these injuries were likely inflicted by blunt,forceful blows,and that they were inconsistent with a household accident.further,despite minor discrepancies in their testimony,both experts concluded that leshawna death occurred at a time when neverson was home alone with the baby and her stepbrother.
the defense theory was that leshawna had fallen from the top of the bunk bed in the bedroom shared by the two children.neverson proposed to offer the testimony of james masi,a professor of physics and biomechanics.masi was prepared to testify that a child of leshawna size who fell from a height of inches,the distance between the top bunk and the floor,would strike the floor with sufficient force that she would probably not survive.masi acknowledged on voir dire,however,that his expertise was in physics,not in the medical consequences of falls.for that reason,the trial judge barred masi from testifying to the likely medical consequences to leshawna of a fall from the bunk bed,though the judge was prepared to allow testimony concerning the velocity and force with which the child would strike the floor.neverson elected not to have masi testify instead,he took the stand and testified that he did not injure the child.
on july,the jury found neverson guilty of involuntary manslaughter but acquitted him of murder.he was sentenced to serve sixteen to nineteen years in prison.neverson brought a timely appeal in the massachusetts appeals court,where he argued that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict and that the trial court erred in refusing to allow masi to testify.the court rejected both arguments,highlighting the evidence offered by the prosecution experts and upholding the exclusion of masi proposed testimony in part because it contained obvious rubbish.commonwealth neverson.the massachusetts supreme judicial court denied further appellate review on october.commonwealth neverson,table.neverson conviction became final when the period for seeking certiorari expired on january.see clay united states,d discussing finality for purposes of relief.
neverson first habeas petition and state proceedings 
on august,almost three years after the sjc rejected his direct appeal,neverson acting pro se filed his first petition for habeas corpus under.on respondents motion,the district court judge dismissed the petition without prejudice because it included unexhausted claims.see rose lundy,d federal courts must dismiss mixed habeas petitions,those containing both exhausted and unexhausted claims 
neverson then returned to state court to exhaust his state remedies.his pro se motion for a new trial,filed on july,was denied by the trial judge.the massachusetts appeals court turned down neverson appeal of that order,commonwealth neverson,table,and the sjc again denied further review,commonwealth neverson,table.
deportation proceedings 
at the same time,had illegally entered the united states in also fighting deportation.in,shortly after he began serving his massachusetts prison term,the ins began removal proceedings against neverson for entering the united states without inspection.later,the agency asserted a second ground for removal that he had been convicted of an aggravated felony,the manslaughter conviction.see a a iii.on october,an immigration judge found neverson deportable on both counts,held him ineligible for voluntary departure due to his manslaughter conviction,and ordered his removal to trinidad.the board of immigration appeals affirmed on december.neverson did not seek judicial review of that decision.
d.the instant habeas petition 
dismissal under d 
meanwhile,on august,neverson filed a new pro se petition for habeas corpus that contained only exhausted claims.the district court judge lindsay dismissed neverson petition as under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act,stat.aedpa.see neverson bissonnette,no,wl,at.aedpa imposed a statute of limitations for claims.codified at d,that limitations period expired for neverson purposes on april,one year after the date of aedpa enactment.neverson,wl,at see gaskins duval,cir allowing a grace period beginning on the date of aedpa enactment for prisoners whose convictions became final prior to aedpa.
in his arguments to the district court,neverson acknowledged aedpa but argued that the d period was tolled while his first habeas petition was pending.neverson relied in part on d,which tolls the limitations period during the pendency of a properly filed application for state or other collateral review.he contended that the reference to other collateral review in d meant that the limitations period was tolled during any prior federal habeas proceedings.if so,his second habeas petition was timely 
judge lindsay disagreed,holding that d applied only to state collateral proceedings and that,as a result,the aedpa limitations period had expired in april,before neverson filed his state petition for relief.see wl,at.judge lindsay also rejected neverson argument that his second petition relate d back to his first under.c.id.but while he denied neverson petition,judge lindsay granted a certificate of appealability on both the tolling and issues.see id.neverson then perfected his appeal.
first appeal and remand 
a panel of this court appointed counsel for neverson and heard argument on november.shortly thereafter,the supreme court granted certiorari in duncan walker,d mem.duncan presented one of the two questions raised by neverson appeal whether d meant that aedpa limitations period was tolled during prior federal habeas corpus proceedings.accordingly,we stayed neverson appeal until june,when the supreme court answered that question in the negative.see duncan walker,d.then,consistent with duncan,this court upheld the district court rejection of neverson statutory tolling and arguments.see neverson,at.
nevertheless,we recognized that the separate doctrine of equitable tolling,if available at all under d,might salvage neverson claims.id.at see also duncan,at.stevens,concurring observing that nothing in duncan or in aedpa precludes a federal court from deeming the limitations period tolled for a federal habeas petition as a matter of equity.concluding that neverson had raised an equitable tolling argument before the district court but that the court had not addressed it,we remanded the case with instructions to consider whether equitable tolling is available under d and,if so,whether it would save neverson petition.at.
remand acceptance of equitable tolling and denial on the merits 
on remand,the district court chief judge young held that equitable tolling should apply under d and tolled the limitations period for the days that neverson first habeas petition was pending before judge.the court also,in an earlier order,allowed neverson to amend his habeas petition to include claims under challenging his deportation.then on february,after taking briefs and hearing argument,the district court denied neverson habeas petition on the merits.see neverson bissonnette,d,
the district court granted a certificate of appealability as to the propriety of equitable tolling and as to each of the substantive grounds on which the court rejected the petitioner habeas claim.neverson brought the instant appeal.
provisional stay of removal 
during the pendency of this appeal,neverson immigration proceedings have been on hold.in march,while his first appeal was pending before this court,neverson completed his sentence for his massachusetts manslaughter conviction.the ins immediately took neverson into custody and prepared to deport him,acquiring the necessary travel documents and purchasing a ticket to trinidad on american airlines.
on neverson emergency motion,this court issued a provisional stay on september,barring the ins from deporting neverson until we could hear and decide his case.when neverson case was remanded to the district court,we specified that the provisional stay was to remain in effect until further order of either the district court or,if another appeal ensues,this court.at.
nevertheless,on june,after the district court had denied neverson petition on the merits,the ins announced its intention to deport neverson to though neverson had already noticed an appeal to this court and the district court had already granted a certificate of appealability.neverson sought emergency relief from the district court,which issued an order stating that it lacked jurisdiction to award relief but clarifying that its february,opinion had not modified the september,provisional stay.on july,this court entered an order confirming that the ins was not permitted to deport neverson until further notice we agree with petitioner that the provisional stay of deportation entered on september,remains in effect and that,so long as that is the case,any attempt to execute his removal is barred.
appellate jurisdiction 
before turning to the merits,we must address neverson contention that this court lacks jurisdiction to consider the commonwealth challenge to the district court use of equitable tolling under aedpa.that issue is not properly before this court,neverson says,because the district court decided it in his favor and the commonwealth failed to file a.
we disagree.neverson is correct that absent a,a party may not use his opponent appeal as a vehicle for attacking a final judgment in an effort to diminish the appealing party rights thereunder.figueroa rivera,cir see el paso natural gas neztsosie,d united states craven,cir.but respondents here do not seek to alter the judgment of the district court.on the contrary,the district court granted all of the relief that respondents,dismissal of neverson petition with prejudice under these circumstances,a would have been improper.see corporacion de puerto rico para la difusion publica,cir a party may not appeal from a favorable judgment.
here,respondents merely seek to defend the dismissal of neverson petition on an alternate legal ground that is manifest in the record.this they are entitled to do,even if it means attacking the reasoning of the district court,see neztsosie,at,and even if they lost on the same argument below,see connell trs.of the pension fund of the ironworkers dist.council,cir applying this principle in the statute of limitations context engleson burlington,cir same.there is no defect in our appellate jurisdiction.
equitable tolling under d 
availability of equitable tolling 
the next question is the same one that this court originally directed the district court to consider is equitable tolling available to extend the limitation period specified in section d neverson,at.this court has several times noted this question but declined to answer it.see supra note.in this case,because we earlier remanded on this precise issue,because the district court held that equitable tolling is available,and because respondents challenge that conclusion,we will address it.our review is de novo.almanzar maloney,cir a district court legal conclusions in a habeas proceeding are reviewed de novo.
the doctrine of equitable tolling provides that in exceptional circumstances,a statute of limitations may be extended for equitable reasons not acknowledged in the statute creating the limitations period.david hall,cir see delaney matesanz,cir.statutory filing deadlines are presumptively subject to equitable tolling.see irwin dep t of veterans affairs,d referring to the rebuttable presumption of equitable tolling united states locke,d see also zipes trans world airlines,d filing a timely charge of discrimination with the eeoc is a requirement that,like a statute of limitations,is subject to equitable tolling.
the presumption that equitable tolling is available is rebutted principally in two situations.first,deadlines that define the court jurisdiction may not be equitably tolled.see soriano united states,d david,at second,equitable tolling will not apply where there are other indications that congress intended to preclude it.see united states beggerly,d united states brockamp,d jordan,shalala,cir.
there is no indication in the text of d that the deadline is jurisdictional or that congress meant to preclude equitable tolling.the statute expressly describes the term as a period of limitation.it does not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts.zipes,at.see david,at.nor does,the provision permitting district courts to grant writs of habeas corpus,limit that power to cases in which the petition has been timely filed.see zipes,at.aedpa legislative history likewise makes clear that congress intended to create a statute of limitations for habeas claims,not a jurisdictional bar.see calderon dist.for the cent.dist.of,cir summarizing the relevant legislative history,overruled on other grounds,cir en banc.
respondent bissonnette argues that by setting out a variety of specific circumstances that will delay the running of the statute,see d b d,and by providing that the period is tolled during the pendency of state collateral review,see d,congress implicitly precluded tolling based on other equitable considerations.brockamp,at.holding that equitable tolling is not available under a tax statute because,inter alia,the statute sets forth explicit exceptions to its basic time limits,and those very specific exceptions do not include equitable tolling.this is a forceful objection,as this court has elsewhere acknowledged.see david,at noting the specific exceptions listed in d and observing that congress likely did not conceive that the courts would add new exceptions.
nevertheless,we agree with the fourth circuit that respondents argument reads too much into any negative inference that may reasonably be drawn from the exceptions.harris hutchinson,cir.congress inclusion of a few specific exceptions in d does not require the inference that the limitations period is,for all other purposes,effectively a jurisdictional bar.given that congress enacted d against the background of the irwin presumption and elected to describe the term as a period of limitation,the better conclusion is that congress intended to retain the flexibility afforded by the doctrine of equitable tolling.see young united states,d congress must be presumed to draft limitations periods in light of the hornbook law that limitations periods are subject to equitable tolling internal quotation marks omitted 
we hold that the limitations period in d is not jurisdictional and,accordingly,can be subject to equitable tolling in appropriate cases.every other circuit to address this question has reached the same conclusion.see mcclendon sherman,cir helton dep t of,cir smith mcginnis,cir harris,at kreutzer bowersox,cir taliani chrans,cir but noting that little practical room may exist under d for invoking the doctrine miller state dep t of,cir davis johnson,cir miller marr,cir calderon,at 
neverson petition 
that equitable tolling is available in theory under d,however,does not mean the district court was correct to toll the limitations period in neverson case.as the party seeking to invoke equitable tolling,neverson bears the burden of establishing the basis for it.lattimore dubois,cir.we review the district court decision to invoke equitable tolling for abuse of discretion delaney,at.
to preserve the usefulness of statutes of limitations as rules of law,equitable tolling should be invoked only sparingly.irwin,at.it is not available to rescue a litigant from his own lack of due diligence.see baldwin county welcome ctr.brown,d.equitable tolling is the exception rather than the rule resort to its prophylaxis is deemed justified only in extraordinary circumstances.donovan maine,cir quoting delaney,at see also brackett united states,cir describing equitable tolling of claims as a narrow safety valve reserved for instances of clear injustice.this means that,at a minimum,equitable tolling is appropriate only when circumstances beyond the petitioner control have prevented him from filing on time.lattimore,at delaney,at.in the habeas context particularly,care is required to avoid upsetting the strong concern for finality embodied in.brackett,at.
the district court equitably tolled the d period in neverson case because it felt neverson had been unfairly misled by a sea change in habeas law in the last decade.when judge dismissed neverson first habeas petition in,the accepted rule under rose lundy,supra,was that a district court must dismiss any habeas petition like neverson that presented both exhausted and unexhausted claims.see at.but in light of d and the supreme court decision in duncan,it is now apparent that a prisoner whose habeas petition is dismissed under rose lundy can easily find himself barred from obtaining any federal review of his petition when he tries to return to federal court.see duncan,at.breyer,dissenting citing a department of justice study indicating that,on average,district courts take days to dismiss habeas petitions on procedural grounds,and that of such petitions remain pending for longer than two years.the district court noted that the first circuit now recommends that courts stay,not dismiss,mixed habeas petitions whenever there is a realistic danger that a second petition,filed after exhaustion has occurred,will be untimely.delaney,at.if neverson mixed petition had been treated that way,the district court concluded,his fully exhausted petition would have been timely.
there is some force to this argument.in an opinion published shortly after the district court equitably tolled neverson petition,this court recognized a growing consensus that a stay is required when dismissal of a mixed petition could jeopardize the petitioner ability to obtain federal review.nowaczyk warden,cir emphasis in original see also duncan,at.stevens,concurring i n our world there is no reason why a district court should not retain jurisdiction over a meritorious claim and stay further proceedings pending the complete exhaustion of state remedies.indeed,there is every reason to do so when the failure to retain jurisdiction would foreclose federal review of a meritorious claim because of the lapse of aedpa limitations period.
in fact,several of our sister circuits have approved equitable tolling under d where,as here,the petitioner was never offered the option of a stay or warned of the hazards of returning to state court without such a stay.see brambles duncan,cir,amended on other grounds,cir hargrove brigano,cir zarvela artuz,cir see also wojcik spencer,d,same.but the fate of this line of cases is uncertain in january,the supreme court granted certiorari to determine whether the district courts must offer the alternative of a stay when dismissing a mixed habeas petition.see pliler ford,d mem.
to this argument,neverson adds the fact that judge did not affirmatively advise him of his option under rose lundy to abandon his unexhausted claims and proceed with his exhausted claims only.rose,at.nowaczyk,at stating,albeit without analysis,that rose directed district courts to offer this choice.while this circuit has not held that a district court failure to provide such advice is prejudicial error,it is certainly the wiser practice,and we recommend that courts do so.one circuit has equitably tolled the d period where a habeas petitioner was not so advised.see tillema long,cir.
nevertheless,we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in resorting to equitable tolling on the facts of this case.that is because neither the district court decision to dismiss rather than stay neverson mixed petition nor its failure to advise neverson of his options under rose lundy actually prevented neverson from filing a timely habeas petition.see lattimore,at equitable tolling is reserved for cases in which circumstances beyond the litigant control have prevented him from promptly filing.several considerations compel this conclusion.
first,the sjc rejected neverson final direct appeal in october,yet he did not bring any collateral challenge state or federal to his conviction until august,four months after aedpa was enacted.neverson offers no justification for this delay of nearly three years.most of neverson habeas claims do not depend on evidence.the only one that arguably does is his contention that his trial counsel could and should have found a medical expert who would be qualified to testify,and that neverson has since located an expert who was available at the time of his trial.but no persuasive reason is given why neverson could not have searched earlier or presented this argument earlier.
if neverson had brought his collateral attack during his three years of unexplained delay,he could easily have exhausted his state remedies and filed a perfected habeas petition in federal court before the d clock ran out equitable tolling in these circumstances is not warranted.see delaney,at equitable tolling not justified where,inter alia,petitioner waited until two years after his conviction became final,and ten months after aedpa was enacted,to file a habeas petition.indeed,there is an odor of gamesmanship here,and the district court erred in using its equitable discretion to relieve neverson of the consequences of his delay.brackett,at noting the incentives for prisoners to delay collateral challenges until trial records are destroyed and witnesses become unavailable or their memories fade.
admittedly,neverson was under no obligation prior to aedpa to act promptly in seeking habeas relief.but that is one of the very problems congress intended aepda to address,and permitting equitable tolling on these facts woul
