stephen michael west appeals the district court dismissal of his petition for habeas corpus filed pursuant to.west argues that the state trial court erred by refusing to admit two exculpatory pieces of evidence,that the trial was prejudiced by prosecutorial misconduct,and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during the sentencing phase of his trial.we reject these arguments and affirm the district court.
background 
factual and procedural.the crime 
we briefly summarize the facts of the two murders that led to west arrest.on march,west and seventeen ronnie martin left their jobs at a mcdonald in lake city,tennessee.they had known each other only about two weeks.after driving around and drinking in martin car for several hours,martin told west that he knew a girl who would give them some sex.martin was referring to fifteen sheila romines,a classmate of martin who had previously rebuffed his advances and embarrassed him in front of other students.martin and west went to the romineses house,but did not approach it.instead the two laid in wait until around,when romines left for work.they knocked on the door and wanda romines,sheila mother,let the two into the house.sometime between and,wanda and sheila were brutally murdered.cleland blake,a forensic pathologist,testified that sheila had been raped prior to being stabbed seventeen times in the abdomen.fourteen of those wounds were cuts.wanda romines had also suffered a large number of deep stab wounds,including wounds.west and martin were arrested the next day.
both west and martin were charged with the rape and double homicide,but the trials of the two defendants were severed and the state prosecuted west first.during west initial criminal trial in the criminal court of union county he was represented by two attorneys richard mcconnell,who was hired by west family and was the lead counsel,and thomas mcalexander,a court appointed.at trial,the defense argued that though west was present during the murders,martin was the architect of the crime and that west participated only because martin threatened to kill him and his wife.blake,however,testified that two different knives were used two people were involved in the infliction of the wounds.martin did not testify at west trial.on march,a jury convicted west of two counts of murder,two counts of aggravated kidnaping,one count of aggravated rape,and one count of larceny.
during the sentencing phase,six people testified on west behalf.three of them were family friends who had known west for three,twelve,and fourteen years respectively.the sheriff testified that west had not caused any problems during the year he was incarcerated awaiting trial.west sister testified that west was the baby in the family and had never been in trouble,and that his mother could not come to court because she had recently suffered a heart attack.west wife testified that they had a good relationship and that west was a good father to their daughter.finally,west himself testified.he admitted to being present during the crimes but denied that he had participated in the murders of the two victims.he also stated that he had no prior criminal record,had been an honor student in school,and had never had any disciplinary problems.despite west mitigating evidence,the jury ultimately sentenced him to death.
west directly appealed his conviction and sentence to the tennessee supreme court.west asserted numerous claims,including prosecutorial misconduct and that the trial court erred in excluding two pieces of evidence.west did not claim ineffective assistance of counsel.on february,the tennessee supreme court rejected all of his arguments.state west.
attack on prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel 
on october,west filed for relief in the criminal court of union county,tennessee.west argued that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during the sentencing phase of his trial because his counsel should have discovered existing mitigating evidence.judge john byers held evidentiary hearings on september and october.the federal district court and state court of criminal appeals summarized the evidence introduced in the evidentiary hearings,so we review it only briefly here.west,slip op.at west tennessee,slip op.at.
eric engum,a clinical psychologist,conducted a comprehensive psychological and neuropsychological evaluation of west.he testified that the test results did not indicate any signs of brain damage or cognitive compromise and that west intelligence,memory,and other skills were within normal limits.engum also testified that west suffered from chronic,significant depression and that west had a severe disorder with,avoidant,dependant,and schizoid features.according to engum,west test results indicated that he was somewhat unstable,moody,changeable,and lacked a strong sense of self.engum also stated that west test results demonstrated that he was withdrawn,introverted,brooding,a loner,and stayed to himself,and also that he had a lot of anger.engum was asked whether there was any indication that west had been abused as a child.he responded that while there was no test that could specifically tell what somebody experienced or what events occurred in somebody life west personality characteristics or behavioral or emotional characteristics were consistent with or reflect ed prior abuse.west,slip op.at.
west oldest sister,debbie west,testified that west was born on september,in a mental institution in anderson,indiana and that her mother abused west.id.at.debbie west described the abuse as follows 
i can remember when steve was a baby,and he was kept in the back bedroom,and i would get a whipping for going and giving him a bottle.if he cried,he was picked up by one arm and one leg and slammed against the wall to shut him up.if my other brother did something wrong,steve got beat for it.my sister and i would try to get between them,and we would get beat,and then his beating was finished,and this was not just one or two times.this was from the time i can remember steve coming home from the hospital.
ibid.debbie west also testified that west was slapped in the head,hit with shoes,and received a blow to the head which caused him to become.debbie west described her father as a violent alcoholic who became more violent when he drank.finally,debbie west claimed that prior to west criminal trial she told west attorney,mcconnell,about the abuse however,according to west,he told her the information about the alleged abuse was not relevant,and that,furthermore,her parents were paying him and would not admit to the abuse.
two other family members,west older sister,patricia depew,and his aunt ruby west,also testified as to the abuse west suffered.patricia was present at some of the meetings with the trial attorneys,but she said that she was never asked about the abuse,and she never offered any information about the abuse.ruby testified that she was not contacted by the trial attorneys.
mcalexander,west,testified that he did a tremendous amount of research in preparing different motions which were filed on petitioner behalf met with west many times to discuss all aspects of the case met with west family on more than one occasion met at least times with mcconnell in preparing for trial and spent hours on west case.mcalexander also testified that to the best of his recollection,west sister,did not tell him that west had been abused and that there was nothing that raised any kind of red flag in my mind about that being a factor that should have been inquired into.west,slip op.at.mcalexander also explained that while they had hired a mental health expert,ben bursten,to explore west competency and the possibility of an insanity defense,the court had rejected the defense request for funds to hire an expert to explore a duress defense.the court ruled that way because the parties had been battling over mental exams and west had previously objected to the trial court sua sponte ordering of a psychological examination to determine competency.id.at.mcalexander stated they talked about using the competency expert testimony during the sentencing phase,but ultimately decided against using such testimony because bursten told them that his evaluation could not support the support the conclusion that west had untoward mental reactions at the time of the offense.west,slip op.at.
mcconnell,west counsel,also testified.mcconnell testified he was paid a total of by petitioner family to represent him.in addition,petitioner family paid the bills of a private investigator and the competency expert.mcconnell testified that while he did not think was a reasonable fee for the case because of its magnitude,he agreed to that fee due to the financial situation of petitioner and his family.he denied complaining about his fee,but acknowledged he and joked about the fact that,who was,would make more money representing petitioner than mcconnell,retained counsel.mcconnell also admitted that he had contacted the family requesting an additional in fees and expense money.
as for mcconnell investigation of west background,he testified that he conducted a complete investigation into west life although he had no recollection of obtaining any of west employment records,birth records,or medical records.the district court noted,however,that the state record indicates the defense did file a subpoena requesting petitioner school records after the trial was in progress.mcconnell also explained that while he interviewed west family,the only member who was cooperative was west sister,debbie.mcconnell also denied that debbie west told him about west physical abuse and denied that he told her that the abuse was not relevant.he also stated that west,himself,did not mention any physical or sexual abuse.as for the military records,mcconnell explained that the defense team made a strategic decision not to introduce them because the records indicated that west had drug and alcohol problems during his service in germany.
attorney paul morrow also testified at the state hearing as an expert on professional standards.in morrow opinion,the alcohol abuse documented in petitioner military records was a red flag or i would say a rocket going off saying that you better look back into that person history.in addition,it was morrow opinion that west inability to remember his first ten years of life was a red flag that should have made the trial counsel investigate possible abuse.
the state called bursten.bursten testified that west description of his father as an alcoholic led him to ask west if he had been abused as a child.west denied any abuse.bursten also testified regarding engum report.he agreed that west had an adequate iq,however,he disagreed,based on the records,including engum report,with the conclusion that west was abused as a child.with regard to engum diagnosis of west depression and personality disorder,bursten explained that while west might suffer from those conditions,their presence would not necessarily indicate that west,at the time of the crimes,was actually under extreme duress.
on april,the criminal court denied west claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.west tennessee.april.
further state appeals and west federal habeas petition 
on may,west appealed the denial of his relief to the tennessee court of criminal appeals.on june,the court rejected his appeal.west tennessee.june.west then filed a petition for rehearing and,when that was denied,an application for permission to appeal to the tennessee supreme court.the tennessee supreme court allowed west to appeal only the issue of whether there was sufficient evidence to establish the aggravating circumstance,but the court ultimately affirmed the denial of relief.west then filed for a petition for rehearing,which was denied on june.
on february,west filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under in the united states district court for the middle district of tennessee.the case was subsequently transferred to the eastern district and assigned to the honorable thomas varlan.west asserted grounds for granting his habeas petition.on september,the district dismissed west petition and denied a certificate of appealability coa.on august,after a series of appeals,this court granted west a coa on four issues 
whether the state court was unreasonable in its determination of the facts or its application of the law when it dismissed petitioner claim that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance during the sentencing phase of trial.
whether the trial court improperly excluded the proffered testimony of libby wood during the phase of the trial 
whether the trial court improperly excluded secretly taped conversations between martin and his cellmate 
whether the prosecutor engaged in various instances of misconduct that prejudiced the outcome of the trial 
ii.discussion 
whether the district court properly dismissed west petition is a question of law that we review de novo.martin overton,cir.we review the court factual findings for clear error,except where the factual findings are based on the district court review of state court trial transcripts or other court records,in which case they are reviewed de novo.dando yukins,cir.
this court review is governed by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa.we may grant west habeas petition only if his constitutional rights were violated in the underlying criminal proceedings,a,and only if the original or subsequent state court proceedings 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
ineffective assistance of counsel 
procedural default,exhaustion,and fair presentment 
west claims that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance during the sentencing phase by failing to investigate west abusive childhood and its effects on his actions and state of mind during the crime.appellant br.west first raised this argument in his initial state review.west state of tennessee,crim.union county.april,slip at.thus,there is no procedural default.
nevertheless,west attached several pieces of evidence to his federal habeas petition,which the district court did not consider because west failed to present it to the state courts a writ of habeas corpus may not be granted unless the petitioner has exhausted available remedies.b.in order to satisfy the exhaustion requirement,a petitioner claim must be fairly presented to the state courts before seeking relief in the federal courts.whiting burt,cir citing baldwin reese,d.in other words,the substance of a federal habeas corpus claim must first be presented to the state courts.picard connor,d.
rule of the rules governing section cases,however,provides 
a t he judge may direct the parties to expand the record by submitting additional materials relating to the petition 
b the materials that may be required include letters predating the filing of the petition,documents,exhibits,and answers under oath to written interrogatories propounded by the judge.affidavits may also be submitted and considered as part of the record.
in vasquez hillery,d,the supreme court held that courts may consider additional affidavits and records so long as the supplemental evidence presented by the petitioner d oes not fundamentally alter the legal claim already considered by the state courts id.at.see also richey bradshaw,cir satterlee wolfenbarger,cir.
the decision of whether to expand the record,however,is within the sound discretion of the district court.ford seabold,cir.because the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to expand the record,we will consider only the evidence presented before the state court during the proceedings.
supreme court precedent governing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel strickland washington 
in strickland washington,the supreme court delineated a test for determining whether a defendant counsel was so ineffective as to constitute a violation of the defendant constitutional rights 
first,the defendant must show that counsel performance was deficient.this requires that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the sixth amendment.second,the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.
d.deficiency requires a showing that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.id.at.this court should indulge a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance id.at.to establish prejudice,west must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.id.at.
the supreme court has held that a failure to investigate a defendant background or present mitigating evidence can constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.see rompilla beard,d wiggins smith,d williams taylor,d 
the state courts determinations of the facts and application of the law 
the criminal court for union county,tennessee was the first state court to review west petition for relief.after holding two evidentiary hearings,the court denied west petition.in its order,the court explicitly delineated the strickland test for assessing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel,but it also stated an incorrect burden of proof.the court wrote 
the petitioner contends that he was denied his sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel.in order to be granted relief on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel,the petitioner must establish that the advice given or the services rendered were not within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases and that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland washington,d.if the petitioner fails to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the result would have been different had counsel acted differently,the prejudice prong,it is unnecessary to address the competency of counsel prong.
west,slip at.emphasis added.the correct burden of proof under strickland,however,is reasonable probability,not preponderance of the evidence.this is a point we will return to in the discussion below as to whether the state court decision was contrary to strickland.in dismissing west claim,the court pointed out that there was conflicting evidence regarding the possible mitigation evidence that trial counsel failed to present.the court concluded,after a thorough review of the overwhelming evidence presented,that west had failed to meet his burden of proof with respect to the allegations.in particular,west has failed to show how he was prejudiced by any of counsel acts or omissions.id.at emphasis added.
the court of criminal appeals of tennessee,the second state court to review west began by reviewing the evidence presented at the september,evidentiary hearing held in the court below.it then addressed the authority presented by west in support of his claim of ineffective assistance.in doing so,the court did cite strickland,but not for the particular part of the opinion that delineates the test for evaluating claims.the court then adopted the state argument,including the state citation to lockhart fretwell,that 
a n analysis focusing solely on mere outcome determination,without attention to whether the result of the proceeding was fundamentally unfair or unreliable,is defective.to set aside a conviction or sentence solely because the outcome would have been different but for counsel error may grant the defendant a windfall to which the law does not entitle him.
west state,wl.lexis,citing lockhart fretwell,d.
after reviewing the arguments of both west and the state,the court held 
we agree with the court assessment that there existed conflicting testimony regarding mitigation evidence that trial counsel failed to present.we also agree with the court that engum testimony reflected that the petitioner evaluation showed no signs of trauma or organic brain damage.we agree with the court that in light of this conflicting evidence,the petitioner did not meet his burden with respect to the allegation of ineffective counsel at the sentencing phase.regarding all of the ancillary and subissues,after a thorough review,we conclude that the petitioner has failed to meet his burden of proof as to these allegations.we agree with the hearing court that the petitioner has failed to show how he was prejudiced by any acts or omissions of counsel.
west state,wl.lexis.
west habeas claims 
west argues that the state courts rejections of his ineffective assistance claim were contrary to and involved an unreasonable application of strickland because the criminal court relied on the wrong standard of proof and because the court of criminal appeals erroneously relied on lockhart.
aedpa and the state court error concerning the burden of proof 
clearly,the criminal court for union county stated the wrong standard for proving prejudice in a claim of ineffective assistance.moreover,the supreme court has used this exact mistake as an example of when a decision would be contrary to strickland 
take,for example,our decision in strickland washington,d.if a state court were to reject a prisoner claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on the grounds that the prisoner had not established by a preponderance of the evidence that the result of his criminal proceeding would have been different,that decision would be diametrically different,opposite in character or nature,and mutually opposed to our clearly established precedent because we held in strickland that the prisoner need only demonstrate a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.at.
williams,at.emphasis added.
while west is correct that his situation satisfies requirements of e,we can not grant habeas unless west is in custody in violation of the constitution or laws or treaties of the united states.a.as justice stevens put it we all agree that judgments must be upheld unless,after the closest examination of the judgment,a federal court is firmly convinced that a federal constitutional right has been violated.williams,at.stevens,concurring.though the state court clearly applied an incorrect standard,it reached the correct outcome.a careful review of the record demonstrates that west counsel was not so ineffective as to constitute a denial of his constitutional rights.for this reason,we must deny west petition for a grant of habeas corpus even though the state court decision was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.
west representation was constitutionally sufficient 
on appeal to this court,west emphasizes the following facts as evidence that his attorneys were ineffective 
defense counsel interviewed only west,his parents and one sister and that they opted not to conduct separate interviews of the other siblings outside of the presence of west parents.
while defense counsel hired bursten to conduct a mental examination of west to determine his competency and any bases for an defense,counsel did not hire a second expert to testify during the mitigation phase.
counsel failed to investigate west employment records or interview west employers.
counsel failed to introduce west school records,though apparently they did subpoena them.west bell,slip op.at.
counsel did not introduce west military records.
defense counsel also failed to subpoena or examine west medical records.
we are not convinced,however,that all of these are actually errors,let alone errors that rise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel.
under strickland,we must give a high level of deference to the defense counsel decisions there is also a presumption that counsel was competent 
judicial scrutiny of counsel performance must be highly deferential.it is all too tempting for a defendant to counsel assistance after conviction or adverse sentence,and it is all too easy for a court,examining counsel defense after it has proved unsuccessful,to conclude that a particular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable.a fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight,to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel challenged conduct,and to evaluate the conduct from counsel perspective at the time.because of the difficulties inherent in making the evaluation,a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance that is,the defendant must overcome the presumption that,under the circumstances,the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.
strickland,at.internal citations omitted.
this high level of deference means that we we address not what is prudent or appropriate,but only what is constitutionally compelled.united states cronic,d emphasis added.in burger kemp,the trial counsel had interviewed all potential witnesses who had been called to his attention,and,on that basis,decided that an explanation of petitioner history would not have minimized the risk of the death penalty,d.the court held that the trial counsel decision not to mount an investigation into petitioner background in search of mitigating circumstances was supported by reasonable professional judgment.id.at.
we came to a similar conclusion in scott mitchell,cir.though we noted that scott attorneys would certainly have been to conduct more research into mitigating factors than they did t he decision of scott attorneys to pursue a strategy in this case was not objectively unreasonable,because it was adequately if not ideally informed and was quite arguably the best course of action available.ibid.
in the case at hand,the most significant alleged failure to adequately investigate west past also the most contested.debbie west claims she informed mcalexander and mcconnell about the abuse,but the attorneys strongly deny that.the two psychologists,engum and bursten,disagree over whether west evaluations contain evidence of abuse and bursten testified that west specifically denied being abused.
as for west other objections,the record demonstrates that west counsel,in fact,did a fair amount of investigation in preparation for the mitigation phase.west defense counsel interviewed west family multiple times.they met individually with west sister,debbie,multiple times.they examined numerous historical records.even if they could not remember doing so which is understandable considering that ten years had elapsed between west criminal trial and the hearing,the record demonstrates that they subpoenaed west school records.west bell,slip op.at.indeed,west testified that he had been on the honor roll and in the beta club.id.at.they also examined west military record but made a decision not to put it into evidence as the record noted that west had a pattern of misconduct,though it did not elaborate on what that misconduct consisted of.id.at.
the attorneys also investigated west mental state.originally,west had been evaluated on motion of the state by a psychologist,ford.not being satisfied with the results,the defense hired bursten to determine competency and sanity.as mentioned above,bursten evaluation was not used for the purpose of mitigation.nevertheless,bursten evaluation did not lead counsel to suspect anything along the lines of the personality disorder diagnosed by engum nine and a half years after west trial and conviction.as mcconnell explained,i had had west examined by a very competent psychiatrist,bursten,who obviously did a thorough history,et cetera,and none of that ever came out.id.at.they also requested from the trial court additional funds to hire a second psychologist in order to pursue a possible duress defense to at least the rape duress is never a defense to murder.the court refused the request on the grounds that west had objected to the trial court sua sponte ordering of a psychological examination to determine competency.id.at.our circuit addressed a similar situation in fautenberry mitchell,cir.there,the defense counsel had hired an expert for the express purpose of conducting a neuropsychological examination,but the defendant refused to be examined.our court held that the counsel inability to discover or establish organic brain damage is directly attributable to the defendant refusal to cooperate,rather than any insufficiency in the investigation.at.we declined to find counsel deficient simply because they did not succeed in discovering the defendant brain damage or pursue unspecified,alternate avenues which may or may not have revealed the brain damage.ibid.in this case,west earlier refusal to submit to examination was the reason the court blocked his request for another examination.like the defendant in fautenberry,west lack of cooperation is part of the reason why his counsel did not discover some potentially mitigating evidence.
finally,we note that even if west could prove that his counsel was ineffective for all of the reasons he cited,he has not shown that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.strickland,at.west trial counsel attempted to appeal to the jury sympathy,decency,and common sense.they attempted to show that west had been a good and decent citizen that he had never before been in trouble with the law,that he was a veteran who served his country,and that he was a loving husband and a father.the jury was not persuaded.we are not convinced that the school,military,and employment records that west now argues should have been submitted would have affected the jury verdict.
as for the evidence of the past abuse,it is possible that had west attorneys discovered it,they might have taken the alternative approach of portraying west as the product of an unstable and abusive home.the jury might have believed that the abuse made west the kind of person who was psychologically unable to confront or disobey strong,threatening people such as martin.the jury might have pitied west and chosen to spare his life.however,the very same evidence may have had the opposite effect on the jury.they might have believed that violence begets violence and that west past abuse made him the kind of person who could have raped and tortured a fifteen girl.they might have despised west and sentenced him to death with greater zeal.
it is not enough for this court to speculate that the jury would have chosen the former path.there must be a reasonable probability that the proceeding would have been different.given the strength of the evidence against west presented at trial and the weakness of the mitigating evidence that west presented during the proceedings,we can not conclude that there was reasonable probability that the jury would have chosen to spare west life.
b.the exclusion of libby woods testimony and the tapes 
the proffered evidence 
west theory of the case was that it was ronnie martin and not west who actually killed wanda romines and her daughter,sheila.in order to demonstrate this,west sought to introduce two pieces of evidence the testimony of libby woods,an acquaintance of both martin and sheila and two taped conversations between martin and his cellmate,steve hunley.
according to west 
woods was prepared to testify that martin said he would kill sheila romines that he was upset with her for embarrassing him on one occasion where sheila actually struck him in front of other students at school that he wanted to date her and he wanted to have sex with her and she resisted his advances and,that martin said that he owed her,and that is why he would kill her.
appellant br.
the two taped jailhouse conversations supposedly demonstrated that martin was the main perpetrator and that west did not take part in the killings.the first conversation proceeded as follows 
hunley hey,ronnie 
martin yeah 
hunley one more time before i go to bed to ease my mind,steve west do that shit 
hunley huh 
hunley thank you.
hunley these guys back here do believe me that you said steve did kill them women.will you tell them you did 
unknown who back there 
hunley all of us.
martin yeah,i did it.
hunley you killed both them women 
martin yeah.
hunley why 
martin i do know.i do want to talk about it.
in the second conversation,martin discussed his plan to falsely take an insanity plea.during the conversation he tacitly agreed that he,and not steve,had killed the romineses.
hunley yea,but you said steve did kill those women,you did.do you think that crazy 
hunley huh 
martin huh 
hunley you told me steve did do that but you did,do you think that crazy 
martin i do think it crazy,no.
west argues that the state court violated his sixth,eighth,and fourteenth amendment rights under chambers mississippi,d,and green georgia,d,by excluding these pieces of evidence.
procedural default 
the state argues that west procedurally defaulted on his claims because he raised them solely as issues of state law before the state courts.we do not agree.while west failed to cite either the united states constitution or federal case law in his argument concerning woods testimony,he did cite federal law in his argument concerning the taped recordings.specifically,he cited the constitution and chambers for the general proposition that,t he right of an accused in a criminal trial is,in essence,the right to fair opportunity to defend against the state accusations.at.furthermore,west concluded the section dealing with both woods testimony and the tapes by arguing that 
west attempted to introduce several pieces of evidence the failure of the trial judge to permit this resulted in a denial of west due process rights as guaranteed by the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution as well as article i,sections,and of the tennessee state constitution.
a litigant wishing to raise a federal issue can easily indicate the federal law basis for his claim in a state court by citing in conjunction with the claim the federal source of law or a case deciding such a claim on federal grounds,or by simply labeling the claim federal.baldwin,at.thus,even though west did not raise a constitutional issue in his main discussion of the exclusion of woods testimony,he did preserve his federal claim in regard to the exclusion of woods testimony by referring to the united states constitution in the summary of his argument.
the fact that the tennessee supreme court analyzed his claim in regards to woods testimony only under state law is irrelevant.a state supreme court failure to analyze a petitioner federal claim,does not deprive this court of jurisdiction.newton million,cir see also smith digmon,d per curiam w hether the exhaustion requirement of b has been satisfied can not turn upon whether a state appellate court chooses to ignore in its opinion a federal constitutional claim squarely raised in petitioner brief in the state court.
in rejecting west claims in regard to woods testimony,the tennessee supreme court reasoned that testimony of libby woods was distinguishable from the excluded evidence at issue in green state,and hensley state,the two state court decisions on which west based his arguments.the state court reasoned that the testimony at issue in west case would be attributed to a so that any such proof would be cumulative where the state concedes the guilt and west defense that his participation was commanded at gun point by martin would not have been corroborated by the excluded evidence.west,at.
the state court also rejected west argument as to exclusion of the tapes.ibid.in chambers,the court reasoned that because the facts of the underlying crime tended to prove that there was only one perpetrator,any confession that implicated another party tended to also exculpate the defendant.in west case,however,the evidence was consistent with there being two perpetrators.thus,any evidence implicating martin did not necessarily exculpate west.
the state court also raised concerns about corroboration and reliability.ibid.the tapes were not recorded by jailhouse personnel.rather they were made by an unknown inmate or inmates,without martin knowledge.west acquired the tapes through ken holt,a private investigator.holt swore in an affidavit that he had acquired the tapes from byron bryan,steve hunley attorney.
the court concluded that the tapes were properly excluded because unlike the defendant in chambers,martin was unavailable to the state or the defendant because he would have invoked the privilege against a statement confirmed by west attorney,who had spoken with martin attorney the record was completely silent as to whether the tape recordings were corroborated and chambers does not require the admission of uncorroborated hearsay statements against penal interest.see west,at.
west habeas claims 
in order for west to succeed on his claim he must demonstrate that the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts d.the relevant federal law was articulated by the supreme court in chambers.
in chambers,the issue was whether the trial court erred in preventing the defendant from introducing three witnesses,each of whom would have testified that another person had confessed to being the actual shooter of the victim.the trial court excluded proffered testimony as inadmissible under mississippi hearsay rule,which totally excluded hearsay statements against penal interest.because the state theory was that there was only a single shooter,the proffered testimony would have directly contradicted the state argument that chambers was that shooter.at.it also would have directly exculpated him by pointing to another suspect as the shooter.in holding that chambers due process rights were violated the court wrote 
few rights are more fundamental than that of an accused to present witnesses in his own defense.in the exercise of this right,the accused,as is required of the state,must comply with established rules of procedure and evidence designed to assure both fairness and reliability in the ascertainment of guilt and innocence.although perhaps no rule of evidence has been more respected or more frequently applied in jury trials than that applicable to the exclusion of hearsay,exceptions tailored to allow the introduction of evidence which in fact is likely to be trustworthy have long existed.the testimony rejected by the trial court here bore persuasive assurances of trustworthiness and thus was well within the basic rationale of the exception for declarations against interest.that testimony also was critical to chambers defense.in these circumstances,where constitutional rights directly affecting the ascertainment of guilt are implicated,the hearsay rule may not be applied mechanistically to defeat the ends of justice.
id.at.internal citations omitted.
libby woods testimony 
as noted above,the state court did not analyze the exclusion of woods testimony under federal law.thus,the state can not defend the decision as a reasonable application of federal law.nevertheless,the decision might still be contrary to federal law if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court confronts facts that are materially indistinguishable from a relevant supreme court precedent and arrives at a result opposite to that of the supreme court.williams.
the state trial court,as with the trial court in chambers,excluded woods testimony as inadmissible hearsay.both parties agreed that the statement was actually hearsay and if it were to come in,it would have to be admitted under one of the hearsay exceptions.the trial judge asked west attorney if he was offering the statement to prove the truth of the matter asserted.west attorney did not address that question,but stated that he would offer those statements against penal interest for the jury deliberations as to whether or not my client is guilty of this particular murder.
the tennessee supreme court,in reviewing the trial court decision to exclude woods testimony,emphasized the cumulative nature of the is,because the state had conceded that martin was also a participant in the murders,woods testimony that martin intended to kill sheila romines did not refute the state theory nor did it exculpate west.furthermore,the testimony shed no light on west theory that he was either under duress or was being dominated and forced by martin to commit the murders.though the state court did not consider chambers,had it done so,there would have been more than adequate ground to distinguish woods testimony from the type of testimony at issue in chambers.thus,the tennessee supreme court decision in regard to woods testimony was not contrary to chambers.
in reviewing the trial court decision to exclude the tapes from the phase of the trial the tennessee supreme court explicitly applied chambers.thus,the question is whether it unreasonably applied chambers or arrived at a conclusion contrary to chambers.
the state court again focused on the fact that the tapes were cumulative evidence and did not exonerate west,who was present,participating,aiding and abetting and his defense that his participation was commanded at gun point by martin would not have been corroborated by the excluded evidence.west,at.the court also noted that in chambers,the declarant,mcdonald,was available for cross examination,whereas the declarant in west case,martin,was unavailable to the state or to west because martin invoked his fifth amendment rights.thus,the tennessee supreme court had adequate grounds to distinguish the tapes from the evidence in chambers.the decision,therefore,was neither contrary to or an unreasonable application of chambers.
prosecutorial misconduct 
west alleged several instances of prosecutorial misconduct grouped into four categories the prosecutor deliberately misinformed the jury that the law was and that choosing or not choosing the death penalty was not their responsibility the prosecutor claimed that defense counsel was attempting to deceive or mislead the jury the prosecutor called west a liar and expressed his personal belief that west was a liar and the prosecutor asserted inflammatory facts not supported by the evidence.we address the first category of alleged misconduct separately,and the last three jointly.
the role of the jury in determining a capital sentence 
a.the alleged misconduct 
west objected to the following statements made by the prosecutor during closing argument 
the decision you are going to be called upon to make obviously is very serious,it is one of the most serious you will ever make.but,on the other hand,if you will listen to what the judge tells you the law is,you will see that it is not necessarily a difficult decision in that sense.in the application of the law.because the law provides certain guidelines,certain perimeters within which you are to consider the verdict,your secondary verdict in this case.
see,the law in tennessee,and the law of the land,in this sense,is,in the sense that the law mandates,requires a death sentence in certain situations,unless it is outweighed by other factors.
the law is clear.your responsibility once again is to weigh proof,to make a finding of fact,apply the applicable law to those facts and the law provides the punishment,not you,not you.you do not set punishment in this case,per se.you make decisions based upon fact and the law,based upon your weighing the facts.
was the mitigating evidence enough to outweigh torture,the depravity,the atrociousness,and all of the other things the state contends it has shown see.you have to weigh them.that is your function.and if the state tips the scales and proves those things to you beyond a reasonable doubt,and what you heard for the defendant today does outweigh this then the penalty is death.that is the law.that is the law.
as the law states,and the judge will tell you this,once the state proves aggravating circumstances,one or more,beyond a reasonable doubt,if they are not outweighed by mitigating circumstances the defendant shows you,the punishment shall be death.that is a matter of law.it is a matter of law.
i am not going to stand here and tell you that that is an easy application of the law,because it is not.it is a difficult application.but,just keep in mind,you do impose the sentence,the law provides the sentence,you are merely finders of fact.
in this case,the state feels like justice in its purest form,once again,would be best served by the administration of the law.
west argues that these comments were constitutionally impermissibly under caldwell mississippi,d.
in caldwell,the supreme court held that it is constitutionally impermissible to rest a death sentence on a determination made by a sentencer who has been led to believe that the responsibility for determining the appropriateness of the defendant death rests elsewhere.id.at.on direct appeal,the tennessee supreme court addressed west claims and agreed that the statements were inappropriate 
we agree that the district attorney statements that the law is,that the law provides the punishment,not you,and the concluding statement that you do impose the sentence,the law provides the sentence,you are merely finders of fact,violate caldwell.such statements minimize the jury role and allows sic them to feel that the responsibility for a death sentence rests elsewhere.
west,at.the court then analyzed whether the violations were harmless,and determined that they were 
we are of the opinion that the three or four brief erroneous characterizations of the jury role in determining the appropriateness of a death sentence were sufficiently corrected by the trial judge and the accurate portions of the district attorney and the defendant arguments stressing the proper responsibility of the jury.these clarifying measures contrast sharply with the situation in caldwell where the trial judge endorsed the prosecutor remarks.thus we find that the errors were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
west habeas claims 
because the tennessee supreme court concluded that the prosecutor statements during closing arguments did violate caldwell,but were nevertheless harmless,the relevant clearly established federal law is both caldwell and the harmless error rule of brecht abrahamson,d.see fry pliler,d wilson mitchell,cir.brecht requires a court to ask whether the error had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict.brecht,at.quoting kotteakos united states.
the comment made by the prosecutor here is distinguishable from the comments at issue in caldwell.in caldwell,the prosecutor told the jury that the responsibility for determining the appropriateness of a death sentence did not rest with them but rather with the appellate court which would later review the case.see at.additionally,the judge also told the jury that its decision would automatically be reviewed by the state supreme court.ibid.by contrast,the prosecutor in this case clearly told the jury that it was the prosecutor duty to prove aggravating factors and the jury duty to weigh the evidence and then decide if there were aggravating factors and if those factors were outweighed by any mitigating circumstances.the judge also instructed the jurors that it was their duty to fix west punishment as either death or life imprisonment and that each one must decide whether any mitigating circumstances were sufficiently substantial to outweigh the aggravating circumstances.
the tenth circuit reviewed a set of comments similar to the ones challenged here in parks brown,cir en banc,rev on other grounds sub nom.saffle parks,d.there,the prosecutor told the jury 
but,you know,as you as jurors,you really,in assessing the death penalty,you not yourself putting robyn parks to death.you just have become a part of the system that says when anyone does this,that he must suffer death.so all you are doing is you just following the law,and what the law says,and on your your verdict comes back in,the law takes over.the law does all of these things,so it not on your conscience.you just part of the system that says that when this type of thing happens,that whoever does such a horrible,atrocious thing must suffer death.
now that man law.but god law is the very same.god law says that the murderer shall suffer death.so do let it bother your conscience,you know.
parks,at.the tenth circuit concluded that caldwell is inapplicable here because none of the prosecutor comments could have had the effect of misleading the jury into thinking that it had a reduced role in the sentencing process.parks,at quoting darden wainwright,d.
the prosecutor comments in parks were more akin to the comments in this case than were the comments at issue in caldwell.in parks,as here,there was no erroneous statement that appellate review relieves the jury of its obligations.indeed,the prosecutor comment in parks that the decision to sentence a man to death is not on your conscience may be more troubling than the prosecutor comments at issue here.furthermore,as both the state court and the district court noted,the trial judge corrected the statements that allegedly minimized the jury role.west,at west,slip op.at.for these reasons we hold that it was not unreasonable,under caldwell and brecht,for the tennessee supreme court to conclude that the prosecutorial error in regard to minimizing the role of the jury did not have a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury imposition of west capital sentence.
the prosecutor claimed that defense counsel was attempting to deceive or mislead the jury called west a liar and made inflammatory remarks not supported by the evidence 
a.the alleged misconduct 
west alleges that during his closing argument,the prosecutor told the jury that the defense counsel was attempting to mislead or confuse the jury on eleven separate occasions.of those eleven instances,ten involved variations of the phrase t hat is an attempt to blow a little smoke in your eyes,or a nother attempt to throw a little sand in your eyes.in the eleventh instance the prosecutor referred to one of defense counsel arguments as an attempt that defense counsel has made in this case,in order to confuse you 
west also objected to statements made during the prosecution closing in which the prosecutor called west a liar.now you are a gifted liar,west.you are not just a liar west also objects to several other statements made during closing arguments 
can you believe that he had the audacity to say that sheila romines consented to have sex with him the most ludicrous,cruel lie that has ever been told in union county history.
i guess the truth is not important,at least to west.
he said that ronnie martin took the knife and killed both women.we know that that is a lie.we know that that is a lie.
finally,west argues that the prosecutor made the following inflammatory comments not supported by the evidence 
i do know whether west or martin,or both,had taken anything other than alcohol.
are we going to turn stephen west loose,let him escape from responsibility for the crimes that he has committed,because he and martin were able to successful dispose of the murder weapons or successfully wash the blood off the murder weapons.
a fter the butchery,west and martin go in and clean themselves up before they leave.
west objects to several comments in which the prosecutor speculated as to martin and west actions during the commission and of the crime,arguing that they were not supported by the record.we do not repeat them all here as they are explored in detail in the district court opinion.west,slip op.at.
procedural default and fair presentment 
the state argues that west procedurally defaulted in challenging the first and third sets of statements by failing to raise them in the state court proceedings as federal constitution violations.appellee br.while it is true that west cited only state law in those arguments,there are other ways in which he could have fairly presented his constitutional claim to the state courts.see baldwin,at.as we stated in mcmeans brigano,cir 
this court has noted four actions a defendant can take which are significant to the determination whether a claim has been fairly presented reliance upon federal cases employing constitutional analysis reliance upon state cases employing federal constitutional analysis phrasing the claim in terms of constitutional law or in terms sufficiently particular to allege a denial of a specific constitutional right or alleging facts well within the mainstream of constitutional law.
west allegations in regard to the first set of statements were sufficiently particular and well within the mainstream of constitutional law.west specifically stated that the prosecutor comments about defense counsel attempting to mislead the jury were highly prejudicial and improper.he used the same phrase in objecting to the prosecutor statements that were allegedly unsupported by the record.though this statement was not close to an invocation of the supreme court standard for judging prosecutorial misconduct,it was evocative of language that we articulated in united states leon,cir.as we stated in leon,we evaluate claims of prosecutorial misconduct using four factors,including whether the remarks tended to mislead the jury or to prejudice the accused.id.at.see united states carroll,cir explaining leon.indeed,in leon,the court found that the remarks at issue were improper and highly prejudicial,leon,at,the very same phrase used by west.as for west arguments about the second set of statements,west quoted from state smith,me,explicitly noting that the state case was citing a federal case,united states gonzalez vargas,cir.west also cited united states bess,cir.we accordingly hold that west fairly presented his federal claims to the state court and that he is not procedurally barred from pursuing those claims here.
the state court analyzed west claim under state law,relying on state buck,and state beasley,which held that a prosecutor argument should be supported by evidence introduced at trial and the reasonable inferences to be drawn from that evidence and that a lawyer personal opinion as to the credibility of a witnesses should not be injected into argument.however,as the state court noted,beasley cited with approval a number of cases in which the courts refused to find misconduct when the prosecutor reference to a lying defendant or defense witnesses was supported by evidence in the record.west,at.
the court ultimately found that some of the prosecutor references had borderline support and could through reasonable inference be drawn from evidence and that some were not based upon evidence or proper inferences therefrom.for example,the comment that he did know whether west or martin,or both,had taken anything other than alcohol,was unsupported.id.at.the state court also acknowledged that,under state law,it was improper for the district attorney to tell the jury that defense counsel was trying to throw sand in the eyes of the jury and blowing smoke in the face of the jury.west,at.the court dismissed the weight of the improper comments,however,holding that viewed in the context in which the improper remarks occurred and in light of the overwhelming evidence of defendant guilt the instances of prosecutorial misconduct were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.ibid.
west habeas claims 
again,the issue is whether the state court decision was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.under the relevant supreme court precedent,prosecutorial misconduct is grounds for reversal if that conduct so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.darden,at.quoting donnelly dechristoforo,d.the appropriate standard for review on a claim of prosecutorial misconduct alleged in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus is the narrow one of due process,and not the broad exercise of supervisory power.donnelly,at.we do not possess supervisory powers over state court trials.byrd collins,cir citing cook bordenkircher,cir,for the proposition that it is the responsibility of the state courts to police their prosecutors we have no such authority.as we explained in byrd 
in making this determination,we must bear in mind that the touchstone of due process analysis is the fairness of the trial,not the culpability of the prosecutor.therefore,even if the prosecutor conduct was undesirable or even universally condemned
