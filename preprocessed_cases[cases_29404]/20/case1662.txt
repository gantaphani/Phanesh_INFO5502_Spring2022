the commonwealth of kentucky,on behalf of the warden,appeals the district court decision to grant a conditional writ of habeas corpus to billy dewayne newton.newton petition alleges that the state trial court failure to instruct the jury on the defense of against multiple aggressors violated his right to due process under the fifth and fourteenth amendments of the united states constitution.for the reasons that follow,we reverse the district court grant of the writ.
background 
the charges against newton arose out of an altercation that took place on november.the following facts were presented in the opinion of the kentucky supreme court 
the victim william hutcherson and newton had their first confrontation early in the afternoon.later that day,in a billiard room parking lot,the victim and newton started fighting after a minor automobile collision involving vehicles of friends.the victim and newton scuffled on the ground,and the victim was stabbed several times in the lower left chest,on the right upper abdomen and the fatal wound was on his upper right thigh,near the groin area.a third person tried unsuccessfully to break up the fight.the leg wound was inches deep and it cut both the femoral artery and the vein,severing them completely.the fatal leg wound was discovered by the ems worker in the ambulance on the way to the hospital.the victim was pronounced dead at newton left the scene but was soon apprehended.newton was arrested and charged with murder,and the knife used to stab the victim was recovered.
newton commonwealth,slip op.at,unpublished.
at trial,newton testified that he believed hutcherson was armed.he also told the jury that jamey woolums did not try to break up the fight but instead joined in hutcherson attack.as a consequence,he began stabbing randomly in the air to protect himself against both men.the trial court instructed the jury on,but did not instruct the jury concerning the defense against multiple aggressors in december,newton was convicted of murder and was sentenced to forty years in prison.
newton appealed to the kentucky supreme court.he claimed that the trial judge was required to instruct the jury that he had a right to defend himself against both hutcherson and woolums since they were multiple aggressors acting in concert.in an unpublished opinion,the supreme court of kentucky affirmed newton conviction and sentence.it noted that woolums kicked newton at least twice during the scuffle,but concluded that the trial court refusal to give a multiple aggressor instruction was not error under the factual circumstances of the case.
later,newton filed a petition for habeas corpus relief,raising four issues,including his claim regarding the multiple aggressor instruction.the magistrate judge recommended that the petition be dismissed for procedural default.the magistrate judge reasoned that newton failed to apprise the state court of the federal constitutional nature of his claim.alternatively,the magistrate judge recommended that the petition be dismissed on grounds that newton failed to establish that the allegedly improper jury instructions resulted in a clear violation of due process.
the district court dismissed three of newton claims with prejudice but determined that his jury instruction claim was not procedurally barred.in ruling on this claim,the district court determined that the kentucky supreme court factual findings were not fairly supported by the record.the district court cited the portion of the kentucky supreme court decision as evidence that it misconstrued woolums behavior as an attempt to break up the fight.because woolums participated in the fight,the district court concluded that the trial court should have provided a multiple aggressor jury instruction and its failure to do so violated newton right to due process.as a consequence,the district court granted the writ.
discussion 
procedural default 
as an initial matter,the commonwealth challenges the district court finding that newton fairly presented his federal claim to the state court.it maintains that newton committed procedural default,arguing that he made only a vague reference to the fifth and fourteenth amendment and failed to cite federal or state cases that employ federal constitutional analysis.the fact that the kentucky supreme court failed to engage in federal constitutional analysis,the commonwealth contends,is further evidence that newton failed to apprise the state court of the nature of his claim.
federal courts do not have jurisdiction to consider a claim in a habeas petition that was not fairly presented to the state courts.a claim may only be considered fairly presented if the petitioner asserted both a factual and legal basis for his claim in state court.mcmeans brigano,cir.although general allegations of the denial of a fair trial or due process have been held insufficient to fairly present federal constitutional claims,id.at,a petitioner need not recite book and verse on the federal constitution.koontz glossa,cir quoting picard connor,d.
a petitioner can take four actions in his brief which are significant to the determination as to whether a claim has been fairly presented reliance upon federal cases employing constitutional analysis reliance upon state cases employing federal constitutional analysis phrasing the claim in terms of constitutional law or in terms sufficiently particular to allege a denial of a specific constitutional right or alleging facts well within the mainstream of constitutional law.mcmeans,at citing franklin rose,cir.
newton brief in the kentucky supreme court provided a detailed recitation of the facts and specifically stated that the trial court refusal to instruct the jury on the issue of against multiple aggressors violated his right to due process of law under the fifth and fourteenth amendments of the united states constitution.this is sufficient to have fairly presented the federal nature of his claim to the state court.there is no requirement that the petitioner cite to cases that employ federal constitutional analysis where he has phrased his claim in terms of a denial of a specific constitutional right.see carter bell,cir holding that the habeas petitioner fairly presented his claim in his state petitions by stating that the statute at issue failed to narrow the class of persons eligible for death penalty in violation of his eighth amendment rights.moreover,the fact that the supreme court of kentucky neglected newton federal claim does not deprive this court of jurisdiction.see koontz,at t he exhaustion requirement can not turn upon whether a state appellate court chooses to ignore in its opinion a federal constitutional claim squarely presented in petitioner brief in state court.citations omitted.
standard of review 
this court applies de novo review to the decision of the district court in a habeas corpus proceeding.maples stegall,cir citing harris stovall,cir.newton filed his federal habeas corpus petition after the enactment of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,codified principally at d.pursuant to this provision,a federal court may grant newton writ of habeas corpus only if the kentucky court judgment 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
by its very language,d is applicable only to habeas claims that were adjudicated on the merits in state court maples,at.in the case sub judice,as the state court did not assess the merits of a claim properly raised in a habeas petition,the deference due under aedpa does not apply.id.at citing williams coyle,cir applying standards to a habeas petition filed pursuant to because no state court reviewed the merits of the claim.accordingly,the aedpa standard is inapplicable,as this court reviews questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact de novo.maples,at citing williams,at.
