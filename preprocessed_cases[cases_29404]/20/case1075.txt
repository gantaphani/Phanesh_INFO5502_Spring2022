petitioner rigoberto avila,avila,convicted of capital murder in texas and sentenced to death,appeals the district court denial of federal habeas relief with respect to his conviction.respondent the district court grant of habeas relief with respect to avila sentence.
avila contends that the state suppressed a pathologist expert opinion in violation of his due process rights.he also contends that his counsel failure to discover the suppressed evidence constituted ineffective assistance in violation of the sixth amendment.finally,avila contends that because the jury was not required to find the mitigation issue at punishment beyond a reasonable doubt,his right to a jury trial was violated.respondent,asserting that the district court erred in holding that the state suppression of evidence during the punishment phase of trial violated avila due process rights.concluding that the state court adjudication of avila claims was not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law and that avila has not made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and deny a certificate of appealability.
background 
an el paso grand jury charged avila with the capital murder of nicholas macias,an individual younger than six years of age.penal code ann.a avila pleaded not guilty and was tried by a jury.at trial,the evidence established that sometime between and,on february,marcelina macias left her home to attend a class,leaving her son,nicholas macias,and his brother,dylan salinas,in avila care.at,avila called and told the operator that the infant boy he was babysitting had stopped breathing.when the paramedics arrived,they administered emergency treatment to the child before transporting him to the hospital.while treating the boy,paramedics found a bruise on nicholas abdomen in the shape of a foot print.when they asked avila about the bruise,he denied any knowledge of the marking.at the hospital,surgical attempts to save nicholas life by repairing the injury to nicholas intestines and other abdominal injuries were unsuccessful,and nicholas died.
an autopsy revealed that major organs in nicholas body had been split in two by considerable trauma consistent with being stomped by an adult.specifically,the medical examiner reported that nicholas died of internal bleeding due to massive abdominal trauma resulting from blunt for ce injury.the surgeon testimony likened nicholas injuries to those caused by such events as exiting an automobile traveling at sixty miles per hour or being dropped twenty feet.
officer jose lopez testified that on february,he was dispatched to the home of a child who had stopped breathing.avila told lopez that he had been watching the television when dylan came into the room and told him that nicholas was not breathing.dylan told avila that he had held nicholas mouth and then nicholas stopped breathing.lopez then allowed avila to drive to the hospital.
detective tony tabullo arrived at the hospital to assess the situation.because avila was the last adult known to be with nicholas,tabullo asked him if he would be willing to discuss the incident with him at the crimes against persons cap offices.avila initially gave a statement in which he denied injuring nicholas.subsequently,tabullo received from other detectives polaroid photographs which appeared to show an footprint on nicholas stomach.tabullo confronted avila with the photographs,after which avila orally admitted to stomping nicholas.tabullo typed the confession,which avila signed.the confession was admitted at trial.during the phase of trial,avila testified that he did not injure nicolas.
the jury found avila guilty of capital murder.after the punishment phase of trial,the jury affirmatively answered the first special issue regarding whether avila would be a continuing threat to society.the jury answered negatively the second special issue regarding whether mitigating circumstances warranted a sentence of life imprisonment.avila appealed,and the texas court of criminal appeals affirmed his conviction and sentence.avila state,wl.july,unpublished.avila filed an application for writ of habeas corpus in texas state court,which was denied by the texas court of criminal appeals.avila then filed a petition for federal habeas corpus in district court.the district court denied his petition as to his conviction,but granted relief as to the punishment phase of trial.avila quarterman,d.avila appeals the denial of habeas relief,and respondent the grant of habeas relief.
ii.standards of review 
avila filed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus after the effective date of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa.the petition,therefore,is subject to aedpa.see lindh murphy,d.pursuant to the federal habeas statute,as amended by aedpa,we defer to a state court adjudication of a petitioner claims on the merits unless the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.a state court decision is deemed contrary to clearly established federal law if it reaches a legal conclusion in direct conflict with a prior decision of the supreme court or if it reaches a different conclusion than the supreme court based on materially indistinguishable facts.williams taylor,d.a state court decision constitutes an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if it is objectively unreasonable.id.at.further,pursuant to section e,state court findings of fact are presumed to be correct,and the petitioner has the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.see valdez cockrell,cir.
additionally,under aedpa,a petitioner must obtain a certificate of appealability coa before he can appeal the district court denial of habeas relief.see c see also cockrell,d u ntil a coa has been issued federal courts of appeals lack jurisdiction to rule on the merits of appeals from habeas petitioners.as the supreme court has explained 
the coa determination under c requires an overview of the claims in the habeas petition and a general assessment of their merits.we look to the district court application of aedpa to petitioner constitutional claims and ask whether that resolution was debatable among jurists of reason.this threshold inquiry does not require full consideration of the factual or legal bases adduced in support of the claims.in fact,the statute forbids it.
a coa will be granted only if the petitioner makes a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.c.a petitioner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that jurists of reason could disagree with the district court resolution of his constitutional claims or that jurists could conclude the issues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further,at.citation omitted.the question is the debatability of the underlying constitutional claim,not the resolution of that debate.id.at.indeed,a claim can be debatable even though every jurist of reason might agree,after the coa has been granted and the case has received full consideration,that petitioner will not prevail.id.at.moreover,b ecause the present case involves the death penalty,any doubts as to whether a coa should issue must be resolved in petitioner favor.hernandez johnson,cir citation omitted.
iii.suppression of evidence 
avila contends that the state failed to disclose certain evidence in violation of his due process rights.the district court granted a coa as to this issue.the state has a duty to disclose evidence favorable to the accused that is material to guilt or punishment.see brady maryland,d.to establish this due process violation,an accused must show that the state withheld evidence,that the evidence was favorable,and that the evidence was material to the defense.little johnson,cir.additionally,the petitioner must show that his belated discovery of the allegedly favorable evidence was not the result of a lack of due diligence.rector johnson,cir 
the supreme court has explained that a new trial is not automatically require d whenever a combing of the prosecutors files after the trial has disclosed evidence possibly useful to the defense but not likely to have changed the verdict.giglio united states,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the standard for determining materiality is a reasonable probability of a different result.kyles whitley,d.in assessing brady materiality,t he question is not whether the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence,but whether in its absence he received a fair trial,understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.id.in other words,a reasonable probability of a different result is accordingly shown when the state evidentiary suppression undermines confidence in the outcome of the trial.id.quoting united states bagley,d.
avila contends that the prosecution team violated his due process rights by failing to disclose the expert opinion of harry wilson,a pathologist.in his capacity as a physician at memorial hospital,wilson prepared a pathology report regarding the victim injuries around the time of the victim death the state designated wilson as an expert witness based on this involvement in the victim medical care.during the investigation of the instant offense,the state contacted wilson and met with him to discuss the case.wilson was present when fausto rodriguez,the defense pathologist,conducted a second autopsy on the victim.
the state did not,however,call wilson to testify at either phase of avila trial.instead,the state called juan contin,the medical examiner in el paso county.contin testified that he performed an autopsy on the victim and that the victim had several bruises,with the largest one on the right side of the abdomen.contin explained that the injury was caused by either a blunt force instrument or object.the shape of the injury was roughly oval and consistent with the shape of a shoe.the blunt force applied to the child abdomen entailed considerable force and compressed his internal organs against the spine,resulting in the organs detachment from the spine.the duodenum and the large bowel were detached,and the pancreas was cut in two.there was a second bruise on the left side of the abdomen that was not very big.the third bruise was in the upper lumbar region in the center of the back contin further testified that the three injuries were likely caused by separate blows.there are no specific techniques to age bruises however,the abdominal bruises were very fresh because you can not survive that injury for long.in contin opinion,the abdominal bruises were inflicted probably within an hour of the victim arriving at the hospital.after sustaining these injuries,a child would not be walking or playing because such injuries would send a child into shock.these types of injuries are usually seen in children who were not buckled during a traffic accident.contin did not think the injuries happened accidentally because they are too big and they are too many.on,contin testified that the victim mother was capable of inflicting the injuries.
the state also called george raschbaum,a board certified pediatric surgeon.on the night of the offense,raschbaum saw nicholas in the emergency room and described him as and having a distended abdomen.showed that there was free air inside the abdomen,and the likelihood of survival was minimal.nonetheless,because the child was only months old,raschbaum performed surgery.the surgery was not an attempt to fix things permanently but fix things so that we could achieve stability if there was any way humanly possible.raschbaum testified with respect to observing the duodenum and pancreas being split into two.raschbaum,like contin,testified that this type of injury is not uncommon in high speed accidents.he had observed almost identical injuries when a person had jumped out of a vehicle going miles an hour.despite resuscitative efforts,the victim expired.in his opinion,a old was not capable of inflicting these injuries in a normal household.he further opined that t he magnitude of impact is so dramatic that i ca imagine that this could be any kind of accident.it would be a strong force,like a stomping force.
the defense called fausto rodriguez,the pathologist who had conducted a second autopsy on the victim.rodriguez testified that he reviewed contin autopsy report,raschbaum surgical report,wilson report,and the microscopic slides from the hospital.rodriguez testified that all the fatal injuries in this case could be explained by a single traumatic event.rodriguez testified that the injuries could have been inflicted by an adult accidentally falling on the child but he could not make such a determination.he further opined that the older bruises on the victim skull were p robably just the daily activities of the child.it was very unlikely that the older bruises were caused by blunt force trauma.on,rodriguez reiterated that the injuries could have been the result of a single blow.
phase of trial 
avila contends that the prosecution suppressed wilson opinion that the fatal injuries were inflicted by one stomp,as opposed to the state contention at trial that the victim was stomped or kicked three times.wilson opinion,avila argues,would have enabled counsel to argue persuasively that his conduct resulted from a sudden loss of control,not a conscious desire to kill.in an affidavit submitted during proceedings,wilson stated that 
the nature of the child injuries,the manner and circumstances under which i understand that they were inflicted,and the reported response of rigoberto avila to those injuries are all consistent with cases in which caretakers of children,under conditions of stress,lose control and act without reflection in a manner which endangers the safety of the infant or child under their care and control.
as set forth above,avila must first show that the state withheld the evidence.the state habeas court made a finding that b efore and during trial,the state was not aware of the opinion now expressed by harry wilson that a single blow caused the fatal injuries sustained by the victim.avila has the burden of rebutting this presumed correct factual finding with clear and convincing evidence.both trial prosecutors submitted affidavits stating that wilson never stated to them or any member of the prosecution team during the trial of the case that a single blow caused all the injuries to nicholas.also,rodriguez,the defense pathologist,submitted an affidavit stating that wilson told me that it was his opinion that the fatal injuries to nicholas could have been caused by a single blow or they could have been caused by multiple blows.further,there is no written documentation of wilson opinion from the time of the trial.
on the other hand,wilson has submitted an affidavit indicating that he communicated his theory to the prosecutors.this affidavit,which was not executed until long after the trial,does not constitute clear and convincing evidence sufficient to rebut the presumption of correctness afforded the state court finding under e.see pippin dretke,cir explaining that a state trial court credibility determination based on conflicting evidence is virtually unreviewable by a federal court 
nonetheless,avila contends that wilson opinion should be imputed to the prosecutors because wilson was part of the prosecution team.it is well settled that if a member of the prosecution team has knowledge of brady material,such knowledge is imputed to the prosecutors.united states antone,cir schneider estelle,cir.in antone,the issue was whether knowledge held by state law enforcement agents could be imputed to the federal prosecutors.at.in that case,fbi agents and florida state law enforcement agents had formed a joint task force to investigate the murder of a former police officer.id.at.the government argued that the knowledge should not be imputed because the two agencies represent entirely separate sovereigns.id.at.this court declined to impose a bright line rule,explaining that such a rule would artificially contort the determination of what is mandated by due process.id.instead,we concluded that the determination should be made on a analysis of the extent of interaction and cooperation between the two governments.id.after recognizing the extensive cooperation between the agencies,we concluded that the state investigators acted as agents of the federal government pursuant to the principles of agency law.id.
thus,in the instant case,we must determine whether wilson was part of the prosecution team,which includes both investigative and prosecutorial personnel.id.at.the question is not whether any expert witness can be treated as an arm of the prosecution,but whether the expert played such a role.united states stewart,d,in hill johnson,this court addressed a claim that an expert witness acted as an arm of the prosecution,cir.during the sentencing phase of hill trial,a psychiatric expert testified for the state with respect to the probability that hill would be a danger to society in the future.id.at.relying on language in estelle smith,d,hill contended that because the psychiatric expert testified for the prosecution that hill would be a future danger,the expert transformed into an agent of the state.hill,at.estelle smith involved a psychiatric exam given without advising the defendant of his rights.at.the psychiatrist subsequently testified with respect to the results of that examination.id.at.this court quickly rejected hill argument,recognizing that the psychiatrist did not examine hill but rather testified in response to hypotheticals with respect to future dangerousness.hill,at.unlike the petitioner in hill,avila is not relying on estelle smith.nonetheless,hill suggests that merely testifying as an expert witness for the state does not necessarily transfer an expert witness into an arm of the state.hill,at.further,deeming every expert witness to be an arm of the state would be inconsistent with our previously cited precedent declining to impose a bright line rule and,instead,directing that a analysis is better suited for determining whether an individual is deemed part of the prosecution team pursuant to the principles of agency law.see antone,at.
similarly,in united states stewart,in the context of a claim,the second circuit rejected a defendant argument that the expert witness knowledge should be imputed to the prosecution,cir.there,the witness was an expert with respect to ink,and the district court had concluded that the expert witness had acted as an ordinary expert witness and not as part of the prosecution team.id.at.the second circuit stated that the district court findings demonstrate that the expert role was limited to matters concerning his area of expertise.id.the expert witness duties included analyzing a document,explaining the forensic ink tests that had been conducted,discussing possible testimony that the defense expert would give,assisting the prosecutors in developing questions with respect to technical aspects of testing,taking part in a mock examination prior to trial,and testifying at trial regarding the tests and his resulting conclusions.id.the second circuit held that none of those duties suggest ed that the expert was in any way involved with the investigation or presentation of the case.id.at.concluding that the witness had acted only in the capacity of an expert witness,and not as a fully functioning member of the prosecution team,the second circuit held that the expert knowledge should not be imputed to the prosecutors.id.at.
here,we are not persuaded that wilson became part of the prosecution team.indeed,wilson own affidavit does not portray his role as anything but a pathologist.because wilson did not become part of the prosecution team,his opinion is not imputed to the state.thus,we hold that the district court erred in finding the state court conclusion was an objectively unreasonable application of clearly established federal constitutional law.avila,d at 
in the alternative,even assuming arguendo that wilson did become part of the prosecution team and thus his opinion would be imputed to the trial prosecutors,we conclude that the state court conclusion that his opinion was not material is not unreasonable.the supreme court has explained that to determine materiality with respect to a brady claim,the reviewing court may consider directly any adverse effect that the prosecutor failure to respond might have had on the preparation or presentation of the defendant case.united states bagley,d.more specifically,this court should assess the possibility that such effect might have occurred in light of the totality of the circumstances and with an awareness of the difficulty of reconstructing in a proceeding the course that the defense and the trial would have taken had the defense been aware of the suppressed evidence.id.
to the extent the undisclosed evidence is cumulative,no brady violation occurs.spence johnson,cir.at trial,the defense called a pathologist,rodriguez,who testified that all the fatal injuries in this case could be explained by a single traumatic event.rodriguez never testified that the injuries were caused by multiple blows.indeed,in his affidavit,even wilson admits that he can not say with certainty that multiple blows did not occur.rodriguez opinion was consistent with wilson opinion and,thus,to some extent cumulative.
avila acknowledges rodriguez opinion but nonetheless contends that rodriguez did not have as much experience or prominence in the field as wilson.avila also points to wilson theory that caregivers of small children sometimes find themselves in stressful situations and act violently but without the intent to kill.thus,he argues that the opinion is material to the guilt phase because it might have persuaded a juror that he was not guilty of capital murder but instead a lesser offense.at trial,however,avila testified before the jury that he did not stomp the baby.wilson theory therefore directly conflicts with the defense at the phase of the trial.avila admits as much but contends that,had his defense attorneys known of wilson theory,they perhaps would have been able to persuade him not to testify avila fails to point to any evidence supporting this speculative contention.avila further contends that,had counsel been aware of wilson opinion,it is likely they would have altered their defensive strategy to focus more on the question of avila mental state than on his conduct.again,avila points to no evidence in support of this contention.further,this contention ignores defense counsel affidavit that was submitted during the proceedings.in his affidavit,avila trial attorney stated that his strategy was not to put on psychological or psychiatric evidence to prevent the state from examining avila.although counsel affidavit did not specifically address wilson opinion,it certainly does not offer support for the contention that counsel,with hindsight,would have changed his strategy to focus on avila psychological or mental state.
finally,we are mindful that wilson opinion regarding the stressed pertains to avila intent or state of mind.wilson expertise is pathology,not psychology or psychiatry.under these circumstances,the state court conclusion that the evidence was not material at the phase of trial is not objectively unreasonable.the district court denial of habeas relief on this claim is affirmed 
punishment phase of trial 
the state the grant of habeas relief based upon the district court ruling that the state suppressed wilson opinion with respect to the punishment phase of trial.as set forth above,we hold that wilson actions were not sufficient for him to be deemed part of the prosecution team.
in the alternative,again assuming arguendo that wilson was part of the prosecution team and thus knowledge of his opinion must be imputed to the prosecutors,we find that it was not material.at the conclusion of the punishment phase of trial,the jurors had to answer two questions do you find from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a probability that the defendant rigoberto avila would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society and do you find from the evidence,taking into consideration all the evidence including the circumstances of the offense,the defendant character and background and the personal moral culpability of the defendant,that there is a sufficient mitigating circumstance or circumstances to warrant that a sentence of life imprisonment rather than a death sentence should be imposed the jury unanimously answered the first special issue regarding whether avila would be a future danger yes.the jury unanimously answered the second special issue regarding whether mitigating circumstances warranted a life sentence no.
although the court below ruled that avila had not shown materiality with respect to the guilt phase of trial,the court ruled that avila successfully demonstrated materiality with respect to the punishment phase of trial.based on this conclusion,the district court conditionally granted habeas relief,ruling that avila was entitled to a new trial on the issue of punishment we conclude that the district court erred in finding unreasonable the state court conclusion that avila had failed to satisfy the materiality prong.as previously discussed,to determine materiality,this court should assess what course the defense would have taken during the punishment phase if wilson opinion and theory had been known.see bagley,at.
the state argues that the district court erred in rewriting the defense trial strategy.we agree.the district court found that wilson experienced professional opinion would have lent support to the theory,and undermined the prosecution theory and that his opinion was relevant to the special issues.avila,d at.in finding that the evidence satisfied the materiality prong,the district court explained as follows 
wilson opinion regarding the potentially unpremeditated nature of petitioner violent actions based on wilson extensive experience with injuries to children resulting from violent,albeit unpremeditated,misconduct by care givers remarkably well with petitioner description of his offense contained in petitioner second written statement to police.in that regard,wilson could have furnished petitioner defense counsel with a rational explanation for petitioner violent conduct which was vastly more beneficial to petitioner efforts to obtain a favorable verdict on the future dangerousness and mitigation special issues than petitioner trial counsel dubious suggestion to the jury that petitioner had murdered nicolas in a jealous rage.
although the district court concludes that wilson opinion would have afforded a better defense strategy at the punishment phase,avila has offered no evidence demonstrating that counsel would have changed strategies.as referenced above,avila defense counsel executed an affidavit during proceedings.in pertinent part,the affidavit provides 
in the investigation of the case,and in preparation for the presentation of mitigating evidence at the punishment phase,i made the strategic decision to not put on any psychiatric or psychological evidence to prevent the state from being able to examine the defendant under soria state,and gain possible damaging evidence.that strategy worked as neither side presented such evidence at trial.
during my of marcelina macias avila girlfriend and mother of the deceased,nicholas macias,i made the strategic decision to bring out the pressure that she had put on avila in her relationship.she knew that he was jealous of her and of her alleged relationships with other men,and i had her admit that she knew he knew about those relationships,she knew he was jealous,and he was a ticking time bomb at the time of the offense.i did this in order to give the jury a motive for the offense,namely,to show that avila was not a killer who committed the offense for no reason.bringing out the pressure he was under in his relationship with marcelina was done in hopes of showing that the alleged offense was,and something that was a total aberration in avila life.this evidence,i hoped,would show a error in judgment with a likelihood that he would not be a danger in the future.in my opinion,if i had not brought that evidence out,the jury would have just thought that avila was a killer who committed the offense with deliberation and would likely be a danger in the future.i believe it was a valid strategical decision at the time that it was made.
avila had the burden of demonstrating how the evidence would have changed the course of the punishment hearing,and defense counsel affidavit does not indicate that he would have changed his strategy at the punishment phase.moreover,as previously noted,wilson expertise is pathology,not psychology or psychiatry.simply put,under these circumstances,our confidence in the verdict is not undermined by the state alleged suppression of a pathologist opinion as to avila intent at the time of the murder.avila has not shown that the state court conclusion was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.we therefore reverse the district court grant of habeas relief with respect to avila brady claim during the punishment phase of trial.
iv.ineffective assistance of counsel 
avila contends that defense counsel failure to discover wilson opinion constituted ineffective assistance of counsel during both phases of the murder trial.to establish ineffective assistance of counsel,avila must show defense counsel performance was deficient and this deficient performance prejudiced the defense.strickland washington,d.we must find that trial counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed by the sixth amendment.id.the supreme court instructs courts to look at the norms of practice as reflected in the american bar association and the like and to consider all the circumstances of a case.id.at.while j udicial scrutiny of counsel performance must be highly deferential,avila can demonstrate deficient performance if he shows that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.id.at.however,t here is a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.united states webster,cir quoting strickland,at.strickland prejudice prong requires a reasonable probability that,but for the deficient performance of his trial counsel,the outcome of his capital murder trial would have been different.strickland,at.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.id.
phase of trial 
avila contends that counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to discover the opinion of wilson during the phase of the trial.the district court denied a coa with respect to this issue.we must therefore determine whether avila has made a substantial showing of the denial of effective assistance during the phase.
performance prong 
avila faults counsel for not discovering wilson opinion that the victim fatal injuries most likely were inflicted by one stomp as opposed to three stomps or kicks.avila contends that wilson theory would have impeached the testimony the state elicited from contin that there were multiple blows.of course,defense counsel was aware of the theory that avila could have inflicted the injuries with only one stomp based on defense expert rodriguez testimony that the victim internal injuries could be explained by one single event of trauma counsel,though undisputably aware that the injuries could have been inflicted with one stomp,never argued that theory to the jury.we now consider whether avila has made a substantial showing that counsel performance was deficient.
trial counsel defense strategy is made clear in his closing argument.during the closing argument at the phase,defense counsel urged the jury to find avila not guilty,which was consistent with avila trial testimony.defense counsel argued that there was no evidence that avila had any motive to kill the old child.counsel spoke of the four character witnesses who testified that avila always treated children well.counsel highlighted avila lack of any felony convictions or crimes involving moral turpitude.counsel reminded the jury that a department of public safety crime
