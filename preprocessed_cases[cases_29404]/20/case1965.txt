eight years after he pleaded guilty to charges of murder and rape,lawrence dalton filed a petition in the circuit court of cook county,illinois.dalton argued that his due process rights were violated because he was unaware of his eligibility for an extended sentence under illinois law when he submitted his plea and thus his plea was not knowing and voluntary.later,dalton also claimed that his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel had been violated when his trial attorney failed to request a competency hearing after he attempted suicide two days before pleading guilty.after the state courts finally rejected his claims,he filed a timely petition for relief under.
it is now years after dalton plea hearing and conviction.undoubtedly in part because of the passage of time,dalton habeas corpus petition comes to this court accompanied by a state court record missing more than it includes.at some point during the state court proceedings,the transcript of dalton plea hearing disappeared.then,in the midst of his appeal from the denial of his petition,the state destroyed the remaining records of his proceedings before the circuit court.the state now asks that we construe the gaps in the record against dalton and deny his request for relief on his due process claim on this basis,notwithstanding his submission of two affidavits stating that he was not made aware of his eligibility for an extended sentence at the time of his plea.in the circumstances of this case,however,such an approach is inappropriate.instead,we remand for an evidentiary hearing on the question whether dalton knew that he was eligible for such a sentence when he pleaded guilty.dalton also asks that we expand his certificate of appealability to include his ineffective assistance of counsel claim,but we conclude that he is not entitled to this additional measure.
on october,dalton was convicted of murder,kidnapping by deceit,and sexual assault in the circuit court of kenosha county,wisconsin,and sentenced to life in prison with eligibility for parole.the state determined that he ha d mental and physical aberrations as to sexual matters and wa s in need of specialized treatment and committed him to central state hospital in wisconsin.while at central state,dalton repeatedly attempted to commit suicide and refused food for extended periods.he often needed to be restrained and forcibly fed.
while still a patient at central state,dalton faced murder and rape charges in the circuit court of cook county,illinois,for an unrelated crime.on august,two days after arriving in illinois,dalton attempted to kill himself and was admitted to cermak hospital.three days later,at the request of dalton counsel,judge thomas maloney ordered a clinical behavioral examination of dalton.on september,a prison health services psychiatrist diagnosed dalton with schizophrenia paranoid type in remission and placed him on navane,an drug.shortly thereafter,gerson kaplan of the psychiatric institute examined dalton.in a september,letter to judge maloney,kaplan deemed dalton mentally fit for trial or so we are letter is also missing.kaplan went on to opine that dalton understood the nature of the charge pending against him,the purpose of the proceedings and was able to cooperate with counsel in his defense.it is not clear from the record whether dalton had a competency hearing,but on october,judge maloney found dalton fit for trial.
on november,dalton again attempted suicide by trying to hang himself.two days later,he pleaded guilty to three counts of murder and one count of rape.dalton counsel did not request,and judge maloney did not order,a competency hearing prior to his plea.judge maloney sentenced dalton to years imprisonment on each of the murder counts an extended sentence under illinois law,as discussed below and years on the rape count,to be served concurrently.dalton never appealed his convictions,but eight years later,on march,he filed a petition for relief in the circuit court of cook county,in which he argued that his illinois convictions had to be vacated because he did not knowingly and voluntarily waive his rights when he pleaded guilty.he explained that he was heavily medicated at the time of his plea and thus was unable to understand the effect of his plea or his sentence.he also argued that he was never informed that he risked an extended term sentence under illinois law.see ilcs authorizing terms of imprisonment in excess of the maximum sentence provided by the statute if the factors in aggravation set forth in paragraph b of section are found to be present.dalton case meandered through the circuit court docket for more than six years,until october,when the court finally rejected his petition.during the intervening period,dalton to obtain a copy of the state court record of his trial.among the documents dalton sought was a copy of the transcript of his plea hearing,but in a letter dated february,the office of the official court reporters of the circuit court of cook county informed him that the state could not locate the transcript.
the state court denied dalton petition because it fail ed to demonstrate a deprivation of a constitutional right.although the court was disturbed that a transcript of petitioner plea was unavailable,it stated that several pleadings within the court file leads this court to believe the petitioner plea was knowingly and intelligently entered.these pleadings included an executed jury waiver,an executed waiver of presentence investigation report,a file stamped letter from the psychiatric institute stating that the petitioner is mentally fit for trial and a certified statement of conviction indicating petitioner was found fit.the court also noted that the state had filed an affidavit from the assistant state attorney present at the plea,which stated that petitioner was advised of his rights and of the applicability of the extended term sentence.at the request of dalton counsel,the court appointed a public defender to represent him on appeal.before the illinois appellate court,the public defender filed a motion for leave to withdraw pursuant to pennsylvania finley,d.the court summarily rejected dalton petition and granted counsel motion,stating we have reviewed the record in the case,defendant lengthy pro se response and the aforesaid brief in compliance with finley,and we find no issues of arguable merit.the illinois supreme court denied dalton leave to appeal on december.
on april,dalton filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus in district court and was appointed counsel.dalton petition argued that the state court violated his due process rights by failing to conduct a competency hearing prior to accepting his guilty plea that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his trial attorney failed to request a competency hearing after the november suicide attempt and prior to the guilty plea and that the state court violated his due process rights when it failed to advise him of the possibility of an extended term sentence,with the consequence that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary.the court rejected all these claims,but it granted dalton a certificate of appealability with respect to the third issue.on appeal,dalton asks that we expand the certificate of appealability to include his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.
dalton argues that his due process rights were violated because his guilty plea in the state court was not knowing and voluntary.this is so,he contends,because he was not aware of the maximum punishment he could receive,specifically the possibility of an extended term sentence under illinois law.our review of dalton petition is governed by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,which permits a federal court to issue a writ of habeas corpus only if the state court reached a decision on the merits of a claim,and that decision was either contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.
in brady united states,d,the supreme court held that a defendant guilty plea not only must be voluntary but must be knowing,intelligent acts done with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences,id.at.the court defined voluntariness as follows a plea of guilty entered by one fully aware of the direct consequences,including the actual value of any commitments made to him by the court,prosecutor,or his own counsel,must stand unless induced by threats or promises to discontinue improper harassment,misrepresentation including unfulfilled or unfulfillable promises,or perhaps by promises that are by their nature improper id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.
although the supreme court has not defined the direct consequences of a guilty plea,it must have intended this term to encompass the maximum sentence for which a defendant is eligible.compare.b h m.rule a.we can imagine no consequence of a defendant guilty plea more direct,immediate,and automatic than the maximum amount of time she may serve as a result of her plea.see warren richland county circuit court,cir.while a defendant need not know all the consequences,such as loss of the right to vote or of the right to own a gun,or the effect on future sentences,he must certainly know the maximum punishment that he faces if he is convicted in the case at hand.trueblood davis,cir citing united states lumpkins,cir.indeed,as a matter of state law which of course is not our concern,illinois requires this for extended term sentences.see ilcs b providing,for purposes of extended term sentences,that i f the conviction was by plea,it shall appear on the record that the plea was entered with the defendant knowledge that a sentence under this section was a possibility and i f it does not so appear on the record,the defendant shall not be subject to such a sentence unless he is first given an opportunity to withdraw his plea without prejudice.we conclude that the potential length of the sentence is one of the direct consequences to which the supreme court referred in brady thus,if dalton was unaware of his eligibility for an extended term sentence when he pleaded guilty,it would be an unreasonable application of brady to find that his plea was knowing and voluntary.
on the record as it stands,unfortunately,there is no way for this court or any other court rationally to determine whether dalton constitutional right to due process was violated in this way.the parties agree that the transcript of dalton plea hearing has disappeared and is not available,leaving no official record of the exchange between dalton,his attorney,and judge maloney when he pleaded guilty.in addition,dalton has submitted documentation showing that all records associated with his case before the circuit court,including his medical and psychiatric records from his time in cook county jail prior to his return to central state,were destroyed by the state of illinois on or about november.the destruction of these records is troubling,as it occurred less than a month after the illinois circuit court denied his petition and six months before the illinois appellate court reviewed his appeal from that denial.
nevertheless,the records are gone,and we must decide whether the district court should have turned to the alternative and tried to reconstruct what was said to dalton through an evidentiary hearing.this depends on whether dalton has demonstrated that such a hearing might be fruitful.right now,the record contains two hints of what might occur at such a hearing.first,the assistant state attorney might possibility suggested by a passing reference in the circuit court order denying dalton petition to an affidavit from the assistant state attorney recall ing that petitioner was advised of his rights and of the applicability of the extended term sentence.that affidavit has apparently also disappeared.second,dalton has submitted two affidavits that contradict the assistant state attorney recollection assuming the accuracy of the state court report of the missing affidavit.
the first affidavit dalton has submitted,dated february,is his own.in it he relates 
i was told at court if i plead guilty i would get forty years for murder,years for rape,so it would total years,but the sentence was to run together,which meant only forty years,and to run together with the wisconsin sentence the judge did not tell me that i was going to get an extended term or even ask me anything,or ask me if i had anything to say.
the second affidavit is from dalton mother,dalia dalton,and states 
i went to the court hearing of n ov,in j udge m ahoney sic courtroom the day my son went to court.s ince i know very little about law i did not understand what was going on in the courtroom.t he only thing i know for sure was no one said anything about a n extended term for my son.
the district court found that dalton could not prevail based on these affidavits,stating that petitioner only evidence consists of his own statements that no one told him about the possibility of an extended sentence.this comment,however,is reminiscent of the old rule that made parties incompetent to serve as witnesses in their own cases.that rule was discarded long ago.instead,a witness potential in testifying about matters for which he or she has direct knowledge goes to the weight and credibility of the testimony,not to its admissibility.we have repeatedly stated that the record may include a affidavit provided that it is based on personal knowledge,as were dalton and his mother affidavits.see payne pauley,cir paters united states,cir.
in a footnote,the district court also dismissed dalton affidavit as having little probative value because it does not explain,for example,whether she was present for petitioner guilty plea,whether she heard what judge maloney said to petitioner,whether she was privy to petitioner conferences with counsel,or whether petitioner simply relayed this claim to her.in fact,dalton affidavit makes clear that she was present in judge maloney courtroom during dalton plea hearing on november,and that she was sure that no one said anything about an extended term for her son.these affidavits therefore provide competent evidence of judge maloney communications with dalton at his plea hearing regarding his eligibility for an extended sentence.assuming generously to the state that it can somehow recreate the substance of the assistant state attorney affidavit in an admissible form,we are faced with a genuine dispute of fact on a critical matter.
the state argues that this indeterminacy automatically means that dalton petition must be rejected,because of the presumption of regularity to which state court proceedings are generally entitled.it relies on parke raley,d,in which the supreme court considered whether habeas corpus relief was available to raley,who was charged with being a persistent felony offender based on two prior burglaries to which he had pleaded guilty,id.at.raley argued in his petition that these prior convictions should have been suppressed under boykin alabama,d,because the records did not contain transcripts of the plea proceedings and hence did not affirmatively show that respondent guilty pleas were knowing and voluntary.id.the kentucky courts relied on the presumption of regularity accorded state convictions in rejecting this claim.the supreme court found no tension between the kentucky scheme and boykin,explaining that t here is no good reason to suspend the presumption of regularity here on collateral review,we think it defies logic to presume from the mere unavailability of a transcript assuming no allegation that the unavailability is due to governmental misconduct that the defendant was not advised of his rights.in this situation,boykin does not prohibit a state court from presuming,at least initially,that a final judgment of conviction offered for purposes of sentence enhancement was validly obtained.id.at.internal citations omitted emphasis added.
raley,however,is concerned with a different problem,namely,a collateral attack on prior convictions that are being used to enhance a current sentence.in that situation,the supreme court has made it clear that such attacks are essentially foreclosed,unless the defendant can show that she
