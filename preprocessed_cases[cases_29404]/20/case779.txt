opinion of the court 
this prolonged parole proceeding had its inception when the pennsylvania board of pardons pardons board recommended to the governor of pennsylvania in that he commute the life sentence of louis thomas.the governor commuted the sentence.thereafter,thomas made several applications for parole,each of which the pennsylvania board of probation and parole board or parole board denied.after exhausting all administrative relief in the state,including appellate court relief,thomas applied to the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania for a writ of habeas corpus.
the court found that the board had violated the ex post facto provision of the federal constitution.vaughn,d.the court granted thomas conditional relief of habeas corpus and remanded his parole application to the board for further hearing under parole laws and guidelines that existed prior to their amendment in and after.the board appealed to this court and we affirmed.vaughn,cir,cert.denied sub.nom.gillis hollawell,d i.
in i,we thoroughly reviewed the board proceedings and issued a mandate instructing the board to rectify its ex post facto violations and give thomas fair consideration under the pennsylvania parole laws and guidelines in existence prior to.relying on the existing record and without conducting any further hearing,the board denied thomas parole application for the fourth time on remand from the district court.thomas again sought relief in the district court,which found continuing violations by the board and noncompliance with our instructions.nonetheless,the district court refrained from granting thomas request for unconditional habeas corpus relief.it summarily concluded that the board had weighed all factors militating for and against parole and that it could not substitute its judgment for that of the board.thomas timely appealed.we vacate and remand to the district court with instructions to direct donald vaughn,superintendent of the pennsylvania state correctional institution at graterford,and the parole board to release thomas on parole.
in an effort to put this opinion in perspective,we review our previous decision in this case.
commutation of thomas life sentence 
thomas,now years old,has been incarcerated for years in a pennsylvania penitentiary for his conviction in of the murder of edith connor he was sentenced to life imprisonment,ineligible for parole under pennsylvania laws.despite his conviction,he has consistently maintained his innocence since his incarceration.in thomas first applied to the pardons board for a commutation of his life sentence.in the pardons board unanimously recommended the commutation to the governor.the pardons board noted thomas attainment of a college degree,his participation in alcoholics anonymous,his participation in therapy,the support of the pennsylvania corrections department,the long length of time served,the numerous recommendations from scholars,religious and community leaders,and his overall maturity and stability.i,at.on january,governor robert casey granted commutation,commuting thomas life sentence to a term of years,months,days to life,making him eligible for release on parole on july.
parole board initial refusal to consider thomas parole application 
the board initially refused to consider thomas parole application filed on july,one day after he became eligible for parole,by relying on a newly enacted statute.stat.ann.a west,which made an applicant in thomas situation ineligible for parole without having served a year in a center.i,at,d at.on november,thomas filed a mandamus action to challenge the board refusal to consider his parole application with the commonwealth court of pennsylvania.commonwealth,board of probation parole.the board conceded in that action that the new statute could not be retroactively applied to thomas application.the state court reversed the board determination of parole ineligibility and ordered the board to accept and consider thomas parole application within days of the court order.the court,however,denied thomas request for an order compelling the board to release him on parole.because every effort by thomas to obtain favorable parole action from the board encountered its utmost resistance,it is reasonable to infer that thomas successful appeal to the commonwealth court incurred the ire of the board.
board first denial of thomas parole application 
pursuant to the commonwealth court order,the board considered thomas parole application on august,but summarily denied it.the board denied the application even though its guidelines recommended his release on parole and all voting department of corrections institutional staff,including the prison counselor and housing officer,recommended his release.i,at.in its decision,the board urged thomas to secure the following before his next scheduled parole application review in investigation of a home plan the availability of treatment participation in a program plan prescribed by department of corrections officials maintenance of a good conduct record a continuing institutional recommendation for parole and an evaluation by mental health professionals experienced with sex offenders.id.the board made these recommendations in spite of thomas apparent compliance with all of the board suggestions prior to the hearing.id.
board second denial of thomas parole application 
before the board considered thomas second parole application in march,he had complied with all of the board suggested requirements stated in its decision.he maintained the positive recommendation of corrections authorities,who once more unanimously recommended his release and noted that he was in compliance with treatment programs.the prison counselor,corrections officer,and psychologist all endorsed his release.he continued to participate in a therapy program along with an alcoholics anonymous program.support networks were in place.once again,the guidelines relied on by the board assigned thomas a score that favored release.i,at.despite his compliance with essentially all of the board conditions,the board again summarily denied parole in march.in this second denial of thomas parole application,the board again advised thomas to seek counseling and treatment,participate in prescribed programming,maintain a clean record,and obtain institutional recommendation for purposes of his next scheduled parole application.unlike the decision,the decision recommended no specific sex offender treatment.moreover,despite the comment that thomas needed counseling and treatment,psychiatric and psychological evaluations did not contraindicate his release.id.at.
board third denial of thomas parole application 
before the board considered his next scheduled parole application,thomas filed the underlying federal habeas action in december.shortly thereafter,the board denied thomas parole application in march for the third time.the board gave as its reason the cryptic statement that it had determined that the mandates to protect the safety of the public and to assist in the fair administration of justice can not be achieved through his release on parole.i,at.the board denied parole once again,even though all voting members of the department of corrections institutional staff,including thomas counselor and work supervisor,unanimously recommended his parole.again,he demonstrated a continued record of good conduct in prison and participation in sex offender therapy and all other programs prescribed by the department of corrections.id.despite all the recommendations and thomas continuous record of good conduct,the board once again advised him to maintain his department of corrections recommendation as a precondition for consideration at the next scheduled parole hearing in.
new to this third denial was the board classification of thomas on the guidelines form as a habitual substance abuser.this increased his risk score by and placed him for the first time in an unfavorable category for release id.at.the board made the classification for the first time based on thomas alcohol abuse prior to his conviction almost years ago.the board assigned this classification although thomas had not abused alcohol throughout his incarceration and had consistently participated in alcoholics anonymous.id.we questioned why,if past alcohol abuse over forty years ago was a relevant factor,it had not been considered on his two prior guidelines evaluations.id.also new to this third denial was the increased risk score of,instead of,for the category of victim injury as a result of a modification of the guidelines.because of these new and modified risk factors,the tally of risk scores for the first time counseled against granting parole despite thomas record of continued good behavior and the unanimous support for his parole from the department of corrections institutional staff,including his counselor and work supervisor.
in our earlier opinion,we affirmed the district court grant of conditional habeas relief upon finding systematic ex post facto violations by the board in applying newly amended pennsylvania parole laws and guidelines to thomas parole applications.we noted that prior to the amendment in,pennsylvania parole statute emphasized the value of parole as a disciplinary and corrective influence and the society interest in rehabilitating inmates.i,at quoting the old parole statute.west.we also noted that after,the emphasis of pennsylvania parole statute had shifted to an overriding consideration of public safety.id.at quoting the amended.west mandating that the parole board shall first and foremost seek to protect the safety of the public.
we further noted that the board guidelines and parole policies had changed correspondingly with the amended parole statute.before,the board internal policies stated that the board must weigh numerous factors balancing the inmate rehabilitation and liberty interest with the interest of public safety.id.at.specifically,we noted that the board manual of operations and procedures recognized that p robation and parole services must consider that offenders can change their behavior patterns when desirous,capable,and given the opportunity,help,dignity,and respect they deserve as human beings.id.emphasis added.we also noted that in the parole decision making guidelines,the board stated that a n eligibility of parole expresses a philosophy of presumed release unless information reviewed demonstrates by its preponderance that the public safety interests of the community outweigh the liberty interests of the inmate.id.emphasis added.
in response to the amended parole statute in,we saw that the board substantially revised its guidelines by emphasizing that the the foremost concern for the board must be the protection of the public.id.at quoting the board fiscal years biennial report.on the basis of undisputed board documentary evidence,we concluded that in the wake of the amendment to the state parole statute,the board had altered the weight it applied to public safety considerations in making parole decisions 
the record is convincing that after,the board applied to the public safety interest far greater weight.the evidence here demonstrates that since,the board has given special weight to the risk to public safety,a prisoner could be denied parole because of public safety concerns only if those concerns together with other relevant factors outweighed,by a preponderance,the liberty interests of the inmate.the policy change placed first and foremost the public safety to the disadvantage of the remaining liberty interest of the prisoner.
we held in our earlier opinion that the board had violated the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws in its treatment of thomas first three parole applications.the board had thrice denied thomas application even though he had unanimous support from the corrections officers,consistently maintained a record of good behavior,participated in sex therapy and alcohol abuse prevention programs,and complied with all of the board requirements.the board had urged thomas to undergo a psychiatric examination when it denied his first application in despite the existence of psychiatric reports supporting thomas parole and the existence of other psychological evaluations in his file that did not contraindicate release i,at.additionally,although a psychological evaluation of thomas showed an antisocial personality and possible sexual preoccupation and psychosexual immaturity,the board was not deeply concerned with that report in its worksheet.id.significantly,the board denial decision,unlike its decision,did not recommend any specific sex offender treatment.none of the existing psychiatric and psychological evaluations,including the evaluation,contraindicated his release.id.a psychological evaluation determined thomas to be an average risk candidate and the department of corrections psychologist noted no psychological contraindications for release in the vote sheet.id.
we observed that following thomas initiation of the underlying federal habeas action in december,the board method of evaluating thomas parole application took a significant change in march.for the first time,the board classified thomas as a habitual substance abuser for his alcohol abuse years ago.id.at.for the first time,the risk score of the category of victim injury was increased from to points.id.
on the basis of the above undisputed evidence,we held in i that the board had committed an ex post facto violation by retroactively applying the amended parole laws and guidelines to thomas applications.we observed that there was significant evidence that the board acted upon policies that were established after his crime and conviction.id.at.although the board was entitled to discretionary judgment in making parole determinations,the exercise of that judgment was circumscribed by constitutionally permissible perimeters.there was no question that thomas was entitled to have the board give genuine consideration and due regard to the factors prescribed by the board policies.id.
we concluded that it became evident that,although the risk of potential danger to the public had always been a factor,it became the controlling feature of the board decision after.id.at.the board defaulted therefore in its duty to consider factors other than the underlying offense and risk to public safety it had failed to address any of the factors favoring release.id.
we described the statistical evidence as staggering,noting that in simultaneous instances of commuted life sentences,thomas was the only one not granted parole within the first two attempts.id.at.it strongly confirm ed the change in policy since.id.at.historically,the gubernatorial grant of commutation of sentence had such significance that the board agreed to parole every commutee on his or her first or second application.id.at.we determined that t he thomas application was distinguished from those cases only by the intervening policy directive of,emphasizing public safety.id.we accordingly affirmed the district court order remanding thomas parole application to the board for review under the parole standards.id.at.
in our remand mandate,we provided the board with guidelines to rectify its constitutional violations.we informed it that 
prior to,the board concern for potential risks to public safety could not be the sole or dominant basis for parole denial under the existing guidelines.considerations of public safety were already incorporated into its guidelines analysis the board had to point to unique factors as a basis for its rejection of the guidelines.moreover,the board had to weigh all factors,militating for and against parole,and make its decision on the totality of the factors pertinent to parole,and give appropriate weight to the interests of the inmate.heavy foot application on one factor could not have been the basis of granting or rejecting parole.
id.at.we advised the board that it could not shield itself from constitutional violations by relying on the discretionary component of its parole review.id.at.we rejected the board reasoning that its determination,founded on newly discovered experience,could,by virtue of the board exalted discretion,forever deny a prisoner preexisting right to parole consideration.id.at.although some discretion might still exist within the parameters,a parole decision that fails to address any of the criteria mandated by board policy,such as institutional recommendations,willingness to undergo counseling and educational achievement,and instead utterly ignores all factors counseling in favor of release,falls outside of the realm of the legitimate exercise of discretion under the policies.id.
in our earlier opinion,we specifically instructed the board to rectify the unconstitutional manner in which it used certain historical factors retroactively to achieve a predetermined result of parole denial.
prior history of alcohol abuse 
we observed that thomas had a record of alcohol abuse,but not drug abuse,prior to his conviction in and that he had consistently attended alcoholics anonymous while in prison.i,at.the board did not assign any risk score for his prior history of alcohol abuse in its and decisions.id.at.for the first time in its decision,the board assigned a risk score of for thomas alcohol abuse almost years ago despite no changes in his situation.id.we questioned why,if past alcohol abuse over forty years ago was a relevant factor,it had not been considered on his two prior guidelines evaluations.id.we decided that the board use of thomas prior history of alcohol abuse was a post hoc rationalization designed to achieve a denial of thomas parole under the new regime of parole laws and guidelines.id.at.there is no evidence that alcohol abuse should,suddenly,as of the report,be given such significance the guidelines recommendation in is not worthy of consideration because it appears to have been deliberately designed to achieve a decision.id.
of guilt and in the admitter part of sex offender therapy program that requires admission of guilt 
although the board was concerned in the past by thomas participation in the deniers group of sex therapy program,the board prior decisions,including the one,made no specific mention of the distinction and the board internal notes regarded thomas consistent denial of guilt in a neutral way.id.at.specifically,we noted that the board internal files accompanying its and decisions merely commented,in a neutral way,that thomas participated only in denier sex therapy and denied guilt for his crime without further comment or discussion of how these factors may have outweighed others favoring release.id.at.significantly,the board in and failed to mention lack of responsibility or any other factor in the section of the guidelines worksheet where specific space was allotted to provide unique reasons for departing from a guidelines recommendation.id.moreover,the recommendation that thomas receive the admitter part of sex offender therapy,which appeared on the report,did not appear on the decision or worksheet.then,inexplicably,the recommendation for sex offender therapy reappeared on thomas report.id.
only when the board was forced to defend thomas charges of constitutional violations in the underlying federal habeas action did it assert,for the first time in its earlier brief to us,that thomas nonadmission of guilt and consequent failure to complete the part of the sex offender therapy program that required admission of guilt counseled against his release.id.we observed that there was no evidence that the board had ever properly communicated to thomas its renewed concern over his participation only in the denier part of sexual offense therapy given that the reasons for denial in the board decision were vague and boilerplate.id.we determined that the board post hoc or retrospective use of the factors of thomas nonadmission of guilt and his nonparticipation in the admitter part of sex offender therapy to justify its parole denial cast still more doubt on the genuineness of the board concern.id.
instant offence and victim injury 
we held that the board committed ex post facto violations by relying on the factors of instant offense,that is,the rape and murder charges of which thomas was convicted,and victim injury to the exclusion of consideration of thomas rehabilitation interest.instead of using the balancing approach required under the regime of parole laws and guidelines,the board had relied primarily on the nature of the original offense in denying thomas applications despite many other significant factors favoring parole.id.at.given its indifference to thomas efforts to improve his parole candidacy,and its repeated reliance on thomas instant offense and his potential for future assaultive behavior,despite the guidelines finding that thomas was not a recidivism risk,the board appeared to rely exclusively on the nature of the underlying offense and the potential danger to the public if thomas were released.id.at.
we found further ex post facto violations in the board application of enhanced risk penalty for the factor of victim injury to thomas applications.the new guidelines,implemented between and,placed more weight on victim injury.id.at the board decision denying thomas parole noted that its action was consistent with the board mandate to protect the public.this language did not appear on earlier board decisions and reflects its new parole policy.emphasis in original.we were convinced that the board new valuation of the category of victim injury,evidenced by the assignment of risk points to thomas application,instead of the point assigned to his first two applications for the same category,further evidence d the advent of new policies and emphasis on public policy on the part of the board.id.at.we decided that t he board had defaulted in its duty to consider factors other than the underlying offense and risk to public safety and had failed to address any of the factors favoring release.id.at.
our mandate to the board to rectify its ex post facto violations could not be clearer in the following paragraphs of our opinion 
the policies place significant weight on factors relating to an inmate potential to adapt to life on the outside,and on the recommendations of the institutional staff.the policies suggest that no single factor should be controlling in a decision to deny parole to an applicant.moreover,the decision making guidelines were given significant,although not dispositive weight.a departure from the guidelines required a recitation of unique factors,outweighing those in the guidelines analysis.the board decisions on each of thomas parole hearings rely heavily on high assaultive behavior potential,which relates primarily to the nature of the original offense,despite many other significant factors favoring parole.
id.at emphasis in original.
we cautioned the board that,on remand,
the board will not be defensive,but instead will fairly consider thomas application in the light of our observations and ex post facto prohibitions.if the guidelines recommend release,the board should fairly consider the weight of this recommendation.a decision contrary to a guidelines recommendation must be buttressed by unique factors which outweigh the guidelines endorsement.moreover,release on parole is a board policy presumption,and parole should be granted unless countervailing negative factors affirmatively outweigh reasons supporting release.
id.at emphasis added.
none of the parties dispute that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over the underlying habeas action under,and a,and that we have appellate jurisdiction under and.however,on this appeal,the board,citing c and coady vaughn,cir,argues that we should dismiss thomas appeal because he has not obtained a certificate of appealability from either the district court or this court the board argument has no merit on the same page of our coady opinion relied on by the board,we construed a timely filed notice of appeal as a request for a certificate of appealability pursuant to c and fed.proc.b coady,at.it is not disputed that thomas filed a timely notice of appeal from the district court latest decision,and we construe his timely filed notice of appeal as a request for a certificate of appealability.of utmost importance,this court has continuing jurisdiction over this appeal to determine whether the board has complied with the district court remand order and our remand mandate.see phifer warden,cir a district court retains jurisdiction to determine whether a party has complied with the terms of a conditional order.
where the district court conducted no evidentiary hearing and made no new findings of fact as to thomas motion to enforce the court previous grant of conditional habeas relief,we review de novo the district court legal conclusion that the board has essentially complied with our mandate to the board to rectify its constitutional violations.see rios wiley,cir in a federal habeas corpus proceeding,the court of appeals exercises plenary review over the district court legal conclusions lambert blackwell,cir barden keohane,cir the court of appeals exercises plenary review over the district court legal conclusions which formed the basis of the court denial of the habeas corpus petition.
following the issuance of our mandate in i,the board did not conduct any hearing or call any witness.it did not consider any unique factors that were not already incorporated in its guidelines.instead of balancing factors favoring parole with unique factors that may weigh against parole,the board considered the same old factors in the same manner found by us to be violative of the ex post facto prohibition in our earlier opinion.
prior history of alcohol abuse 
the board defied our instruction to discontinue its pretextual use of thomas alcohol abuse years ago and once again relied on that factor as a post hoc defense of its unconstitutional method of reviewing thomas parole applications the board ignored our inquiry pertaining to the relevance of this factor.the board failed to consider,as we expressly required it to do,whether thomas should be deemed to have been rehabilitated with his present history of sobriety for years in prison,his consistent participation in alcoholics anonymous,and his compliance with the prison alcohol abuse prevention programs.
the board has in fact foreclosed any possibility of rehabilitation for thomas no matter how successful he has been in not abusing alcohol or how often he has participated in alcohol abuse prevention programs.the following paragraph from the latest board decision is a telling example of its continuing unconstitutional practice 
your peacetime interaction with male prisoners while sober since alcohol is not available in prison is not a reliable predictor of your behavior toward defenseless women and children,your likely victims if you are released and able to consume alcohol.
board decision,iv,at.the board obviously has presumed that having abused alcohol prior to his murder conviction,thomas will always abuse alcohol regardless of his successful participation in the prison alcohol abuse prevention programs.that presumption would preclude any possibility of rehabilitation and doom any prospect of parole.as we noted earlier,the board was required to consider an inmate rehabilitation under the regime of parole laws and guidelines.we mandated that constitutional requirements compelled the board to duly consider factors showing thomas rehabilitation.
as thomas shows on appeal,the board added the category of prior history of substance abuse to its guidelines around to counter illicit drug abuse,rather than alcohol abuse.see board parole decision making guidelines,the prior record of substance abuse history was intended to represent a clear sanction to those who are prone to crime because of either drug dependency or a chosen life of crime as indicated by their habitual behavior emphasis added board special report to pennsylvania house judiciary committee,although convictions for drug law violations were skewed toward the low end of the risk of recidivism classification,illegal drug use is an important underlying determinant in the etiology of crime.emphasis added,substance abuse history was added as a weighted parole consideration factor because of the increasing drug problem.emphasis added.
we believe that the board sudden reliance on thomas alcohol abuse years ago and its equation of substance abuse with alcohol abuse since was designed to negate thomas parole.the board reliance on that factor was not only unjustifiable under the board guidelines and policies,but also unconstitutional because the board retroactively applied a factor that it had suddenly found to be significant based on the amended parole statute and new policies.
the following paragraph from the board latest decision reveals its flagrant disregard of our prior decision and mandate 
note the guidelines mandate that such instances of alcohol abuse be added into the guideline score and do not allow exceptions based on the length of incarceration or upon participation in institutional alcohol abuse programs.evidence in the file clearly demonstrates your history of alcohol abuse and,at your recent interview,you admitted abusing alcohol prior to conviction.the omissions of this fact in any guideline form was therefore erroneous.
board notice at,emphasis added see also board br.at.
the board offers no evidence to support its assertions undisputed evidence shows the opposite.the board plays its card of discretionary power cynically and conveniently to suit different purposes.before,the board represented that it had absolute,unreviewable discretionary power in parole in order to resist federal habeas review.now,it claims that it has no discretion in order to defy our mandate to rectify constitutional violations.if the board had indeed had no discretion,thomas would have been paroled in or since the tally of the scores on the board guidelines forms militated in favor of parole on both occasions the board exercised its discretionary power to deviate from the guidelines and the unanimous recommendation of the corrections staff.the board summarily denied thomas application despite his record of continuous good conduct,compliance with the prison rehabilitation programs,and educational accomplishments during his incarceration.
the board also defies our instruction to discontinue its manipulation of the hitherto insignificant factors of thomas of guilt and his participation only in the denier part of sex offender therapy program.we noted earlier that the board had viewed these factors neutrally,even in the year,and that it asserted those factors as a post hoc defense of its practice for the first time in its previous brief to us.the board now has not only defied our instruction to disregard those factors,it has also gone two steps further in a continued course of constitutional violations.first,to manipulate a result of denial,the board for the first time expressly equates a claim of innocence with remorselessness and refusal to accept responsibility,which the board equates in turn with failure of rehabilitation and likelihood to commit new crimes if paroled.this position is flatly contrary to the board position in the original habeas corpus hearing when its counsel stated that thomas had completed all sexual programs available to him 
second,as asserted by thomas,the board has committed a new and glaring instance of ex post facto violation by applying a newly enacted statute retroactively to thomas the board recent requirement that thomas participate in the admitter part of sex offender therapy program to qualify for parole is in essence a retroactive application of.stat.ann,enacted in december that statute provides that a sexual offender involving a minor shall not be eligible for parole unless the offender has participated in the sex offender therapy program prescribed by the department of corrections.even though the board did not specify the statute in making the above requirement,there is no question that the board new requirement commits another instance of a continuous course of ex post facto violations.
instant offense and victim injury 
the board also defies our instruction not to use the factors of instant offense and victim injury to exclude consideration of factors favoring thomas parole.the board latest decision repeated what we described earlier as its indifference to thomas efforts to improve his parole candidacy by repeatedly relying on those factors.we required the board to balance factors favoring
